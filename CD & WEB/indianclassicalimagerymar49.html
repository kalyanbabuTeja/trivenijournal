style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ONE
of the remarkable facts about the history of knowledge is the enormous amount
of intellectual activity and literary output of ancient India and the
consequent supreme position of world-teacher that India occupied among the
nations of the world. In the Vedas, particularly in the Riks, India possesses
the oldest literature, most considerable in quantity and highly striking in
literary quality, religious fervour and philosophical insight. Ancillary to his
Vedic studies, the venerable Indian intellectual, Rishi, as we call him by the
fact of intuiting things <i>(Rishih-Darsanat), </i>developed every imaginable
science, art, and branch of knowledge, which ramified into the Vedangas, the
Darsanas, and Sastras, the Itihasas and Puranas, the Vidyas and Kalas. With an
extraordinary flair for scholarship, the ancient Indian savants not only gave
lavishly, but took ardently from the student-nations, keeping a live contact
with the intellectual centres of the West like Alexandria, Athens and Rome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the East and the South East, ancient India held all the countries from Japan to
Java in pupillage, gave their peoples religion, moral code, literature and art.
Buddhistic missionaries and Brahman teachers went forth to China, Siam,
Indo-China, Burma, Malaya, Sumatra, Java and Bali; while the former took the
message of the Buddha and the Dharmachakra, the latter took the Vedas and
sacrifices–the <i>Yagna-chakra, </i>Manu, Ramayana and Mahabharata, and arts of
dance, sculpture and temple-building. The Indian colonists of the Far East
quietly settled down there; married locally, founded royal dynasties, and ruled
with the entire cultural set-up of India taken with then and thus raised the
level of the peoples of those countries. Literary and artistic life started in
these countries with the advent of the Indian Pandit who gave them a script and
made them literate. The cultural history of the peoples of the Far East is only
a chapter of the history of India. The symbology and structure of Ankor Thom or
Borobudur, the significance of the Sanskrit inscriptions of Cambodia or the
technique of the Mudras of the Javanese dance-drama or of the Tantric worship
still current in those places,–all these can hardly be understood adequately by
anyone who is not saturated with the knowledge and spirit of Indian Culture and
Sanskrit literature. In fact, Sanskrit literature which is the mother of all
Indian arts holds the key to the understanding of the culture of the whole Far
East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this oriental art and literature which may appear to the uninitiate bizarre and
meaningless is to the knowing mind idealistic and mystic. In it is not to be
found any realism and reproduction of nature but the expression of the
out-of-the way forms bodied forth by a bold imagination stretching out to
comprehend the inner, the inscrutable and the transcendent Truth. Such bold
imagination forged its own symbols and media suggesting the vast divinity.
Suggestion, as Anandavardhana the foremost Indian critic has said, is the soul
of Indian expression, in letters or art. What the thing is in essence cannot be
told in so many words; all the images that we fashion are only suggestive
symbols.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Imagination
which lies at the root of our artistic creation is called Pratibha in Sanskrit,
signifying the fact that in that vivid state of the mind, things strike us and
flash forth. It is a vision that develops as a result of a process of
discipline, Tapas, and makes its possesser a Seer, a Rishi. The eminent
Kashmirian critic of the 10th century, Bhatta Tota, declared that none who was
not a Rishi could be a poet, Kavi; and a much younger critic, Mahima Bhatta of
about the same age and of the same part of the country, to which India owes
some of its outstanding achievements in the literary and cultural fields,
compared this poetic imagination to a “Third Divine Eye.” In the Vedas
themselves the Rishis who gave us the hymns are aptly described as the “Seers
of Hymns”, <i>(Mantra drashtarah), </i>and when we come to the Upanishads we
have the conception of Kavi or the creative artist or poet compared to the
great Creator, God Himself; and Kavi is explained as one who is endowed with a
lofty, wide and far-reaching vision, <i>Kranta-darsi. </i>When in later times, <i>silpa
</i>or arts was developed under the aegis of <i>agamas, </i>spiritual
discipline for the craftsman was emphasised, and the whole range of artistic
activity partook of the nature of a spiritual endeavour. All art now became a
Yoga, all artists, Sadhakas. Rishi, Kavi, or Silpin–all were seers and seekers
of Truth pilgrimaging through the different paths of their individual medium of
expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the basic beliefs found in our works is that God first created the Vedas and
out of them He next created the worlds. This is true in more ways than one;
for, all later unfolding of the Indian mind, in poetry and philosophy, art and
science, has been from out of the Veda. The imagination of the Vedic seers
produced hymns noted not merely for their religious significance, but for their
high poetic quality too, hymns brilliant like the burst of dawn, splashed with
the purple and gold of simile and metaphor. In fact, the poetic imagery of the
Vedas was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>responsible for the personification and
iconography of the Gods. The solar and other phenomena of the skies, the seasons,
months and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>year, all these get in the crucible of the
imagination of the Vedic bard transformed into sacrifices, formulae for worship
and divine myths. What imagery could be more grand and daring than the cosmic
sacrifice of the <i>Purushasukta </i>in which one of the greatest poets of the
Vedic age describes the animate and inanimate Nature and God in terms of a huge
sacrifice? Abel Bergaigne, a distinguished Orientalist, has shown in his
observations on the figures of speech in the Rigveda how rhetoric holds the key
to the meaning of many of the Vedic lines, a truth which centuries ago the
Indian critic Rajasekhara gave expression to in his <i>Kavyamimamsa.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is these Vedic imageries of the Sun, the year and the seasons, dawn, light and
darkness, wind, thunder and rain, it is these that developed later into the
mythologies that fill our major, and minor Puranas. The release of waters from
the clouds became the legened of Indra slaying the demon Vritra. The great
Vedic exegetist Kumarila observes that it is the phenomenon of dawn that has
been picturised into the story of Indra and Ahalya.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similes
became metaphors, and metaphors produced synonyms, and true to the dictum of
the philologist, built up the lexicography. The sky is a ‘sea’ <i>(Samudra), </i>a
‘desert’ <i>(Dhanvan), </i>a ‘huge way’ <i>(Adhvan); </i>the cloud is a ‘stone’
<i>(Upala), </i>a ‘mountam <i>(Adri), </i>‘dragon’ <i>(Ahi). </i>In </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
whole of the Rigveda, the imagery of ‘Cow’, <i>Go, </i>reigns supreme; <i>Gauh </i>meant
to the Vedic poet ever so many things that gave life and sustenance, the bright
rays of the Sun, the heavenly water, and the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Earth, above
all. The Earth as a cow was milched by our ancient king Prithu after whom she
took her name Prithvi; as the <i>Matsya Purana </i>and Kalidasa say, the
bounteous Mother Earth yielded at the grand milking every imaginable resource
of Hers, minerals, herbs, etc., for the good of humanity. The cow, is indeed
the master-motif of Indian civilisation and culture, even as it is the
corner-stone of the economy of this vast rural and agricultural country; we see
it on the seals of MohenjoDado, we adore it as the all-giving mother of plenty,
Kamadhenu. It is at once the symbol of Mother Earth and the bounteous heavens
and the link of law that keeps the two: <i>Dharma.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

the bards who sang the poetic hymns revelled in similes and metaphors and
adored the multifarious deities created by them, the seers that speculated on
the ultimate principle in the philosophical hymns studied the very idea of
similarity and saw the One m the many which led to the philosophy of the
primary basis of everything, the <i>Brahman </i>of
Existence-Bliss-Consciousness <i>(Sat-cid-ananda) </i>underlying all the
bewildereing diversities of name and form, <i>Nama-rupa. </i>Simile, <i>Upama </i>as

analogy, metaphor, likeness </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>between dissimilar things “holds within
itself the very secret of the universe; it awakens something which we must call
spiritual, something at the very root of our being; for as the poet knows, as
does also the seer and the prophet, it is only by means of the hidden analogies
that the greatest truths, otherwise inexpressible, can be given a form or shape
capable of being grasped by the human mind.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

saints and seers delight in similes and parables. To drive the One from which

illustrations: the one fire or air considered different in different places,
the many sparks from the same fire, the one<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

touched by anything that moves in it, the spider which itself throws out and
spins the cobweb, and above all the sea from which all waters go forth and to
which all waters return. The last, especially, is one of the leading similes in
the whole field of Indian literature. Like </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the floods of the
Ganges that finally reach the one sea, says Kalidasa. You are the one goal of
all the diverse paths, even as the sea is of all the waters that flow along
straight, crooked and manifold routes,’ says pushpadanta in a prayer. Thrice
every day our Sandhya is not complete till we recite, “As all waters falling
from above reach finally the ocean, so do the obeisances to all deities reach
the one God.” This one Truth, this unity in diversity, is the central strand of
Indian thought, the tonic, the <i>Adharasruti, </i>of the rich Indian symphony.
This ultimate monism underlying all our manifold, diversified life is also the
great message that our Upanishadic seers of yore hold forth to modern India,
torn by differences of language, dissensions of community and discords of
ideology; in it lies the salvation of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

adoration and love of man. In the epic stage that now follows, the Indian mind
revels in the One Personal God, and in His attractive Personality. He is the
abode of all sublimity, grace and auspiciousness, <i>(Santa, Siva, Sundara), </i>and
man offers up his entire emotional being to Him. Whatever form his feeling may
take, in the image of that feeling, God comes to man; all known images of attachment
familiar to man have made God respond suitably: pupil and teacher, son and
father, son and mother, servant and master, friend and friend, and above all
the beloved and the lover. The last called <i>Madhurabhava </i>or <i>Nayika-nayaka
bhava </i>has given rise not only to many schools of Bhakti, but forms the
basis of much artistic creation in music and dance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Puranas that popularised this Personal God and His periodical manifestations,
expatiated also on the exploits of Devas and Asuras and their periodical conflicts.
As Przyluski has so well explained, the Greater Indian artist handled the
imagery of these conflicts with high philosophical suggestion in the sculptures
of the grand Ankorvat. These Devas and Asuras are the symbols of our good and
bad impulses and their wars are only pictures of our own daily inner struggles
of the pure and impure impulses in us. Innumerable are the legends of such
conflicts, but the most glorious of all is the churning of the ocean. The ocean
is our own deep being; though the initial outcome is poison, patient churning
brings forth the hidden treasures of our heart, the last and greatest of which
is <i>Amrita </i>or immortality. In this is to be found not only the image of
the inner life and evolution of every man, but the image, as Prince Dara
Shikoh, the second pioneer of Hindu-Muslim Unity after Akbar, expressly said in
his treatise on the fundamental unity of Hinduism and Islam, of the emergence
of the most precious gem of communal concord in this country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the same epic age developed also the Itihasa which gave us a race of God-men
who were either descents of God, <i>Avataras </i>or partial manifestations of
divinity. The Rajarshis of the solar and lunar lines who ruled this country,
those high souls, <i>Mahanubhavas, </i>heroic and sublime, <i>Dhirodatta, </i>knights

and dramas, personalities like Rama and Yudhisthira, they became the archetypes
and the standards which man in this country should aspire to reach. The sagas
of Rama the <i>Dharmatman, </i>and <i>Yudhisthira </i>the <i>Dharmaputra, </i>hold
forth before the nation not only the high moral stature of their heroes; they
are the first poems that draw before us portraits of the perfect human form,
with all its anatomical details: <i>Ajanubahu, </i>arms dangling to the knees, <i>Visalavakshas,
</i>broad chest, <i>Vrishaskandha, </i>high hump-shoulders, <i>Visalanetra, </i>eyes
long up to the ear, <i>Prasannamukha, </i>pleasant face, <i>Gaja-Simha-Gati, </i>gait
of an elephant and a lion, and so on. Valmiki’s Rama was the image of the ideal
beauty of man, <i>Smithabhashi, </i>captivating with a smile even men: <i>pumsam
drishti chittapaharinam, </i>the finest of men from whom no man could bear take
away his eyes <i>(No cha saknoti apakrashtum chakshusi va narottamat). </i>Similarly,
in his Sita, Valmiki drew the lines of the perfection of womanly beauty, as
much as of womanly virtue. This first poet, <i>Adikavi, </i>created also the
world of demons with all the minute details of the fantastic anatomy that
characterised the many perversities of these beings. It is these heroes,
heroines and anti-heroes, the gods and demons that we see peopling the painted
and sculptured walls of our caves and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

like Kalidasa and aesthetes like Bharata followed in the Kavya and Natya age,
and they elaborated and perfected the entire field of artistic imagery and
anatomy. Every part of the human form, every grace of the mood and movement had
found its standard of comparison and excellence in flower, bird and animal.
This rich field contains inexhaustible material for the student of art; it has not
been covered fully even by the work of Abanindranath on the subject. Of this
age of classic poetry, the two foremost images are the Moon above, <i>Chandra, </i>shining
brightest in the clear skies and cool nights of a tropical country, and the
Lotus, <i>Padma, </i>down below filling the waters with its bloom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of face, eyes, palms, feet,–nay the best type of woman designated the <i>Padmini.

of our culture, it is the Lotus. It is not insignificant that when the Lotus
decayed in our tanks and roses began to fill our gardens, the peculiar

false, of reality and adulteration, the Swan is verily our saint, the <i>Paramahamsa.

it said that Hamsa is really ‘Aham-Sa,’ ‘So ham-hamsah,’ ‘I am He, He is I’–the

moralists and story-tellers did not lag behind the poets and philosophers.
Trees, birds, and beasts were taken by didactic poets to offer criticism or
praise of the failings or merits of man. From the position of the figure of
speech of restricted scope, <i>Anyokti, Vyajokti, </i>or <i>Anyapadesa </i>developed
into a category of <i>belles lettres, </i>exemplifying the truth that all
messages are delivered by the imaginative only through the service of telling
imagery. More interesting and important than <i>Anyapadesa </i>poetry is the
fables of birds and animals for which India is justly famous. It is from India
that animal fables went all over the world; to India belongs the credit of
having, with its game of chess and story of animals, taught the world how to
spend its leisure hours with pleasure and profit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

halo; in them, he must see the symbol and image of something higher, something
deeper, something which converts his physical activity into a spiritual

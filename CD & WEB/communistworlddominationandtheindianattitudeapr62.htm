since Khruschev’s 20th Congress destalinisation speech, the non-communist
world, in general, considerably changed its attitude towards Russia. This may
not have made them relax their caution. No spectacular demonstrations of faith
in the Soviet Union, like the scrapping of the NATO, have occurred. All the
same, there is a feeling, however small, that a welcome change of heart has
come about in the Kremlin. The comparative humaneness of the regime in dealing
with party renegades and the inimitable protestations for peace of the Soviet
Premier are regarded as pointers to this change. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
protestations have led liberal statesmen to believe that communists have shed
their orthodoxy of world communism and that ‘Socialism in a single country’
will not develop far beyond the stage of ‘Socialism in some countries.’ What
with the delicate balance of terror an Armageddon is now regarded as
unnecessary and impossible. Russian talk of peaceful coexistence is regarded as
sincere, while the periodic predictions of the inevitable success of communism
in taking over the world, albeit peacefully, are explained away as the
ritualistic chantings, on ceremonial occasions of a high priest, who knows that
they mean nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Richard Lowenthal, in his International Commentary entitled ‘the Dangerous
Year,’ in the <i>Encounter </i>(June, 1961), analysing the nature of the
Russian leadership and its ideological foundations, holds that “the ideological
belief in world revolution is not just an edifying forecast of the millennium
which has been inherited from the distant past and to which lip-service is paid
on national holidays–it is an essential part of the legitimation for continuing
the monopoly of the ruling party inside the Soviet Union, and of the cement
which holds it together. ‘He goes on to emphasise the necessity for Russian
leaders to hold the banner of world revolution.’ Soviet society as it exists
today could well discard much of its official ideology and of the traditional
ties binding it to revolutionary movements all over the world. But the ruling
Communist Party cannot do that without renouncing its right to exist, and
Khrushchev cannot do it without losing his title to rule. Only because of this
fact have the Chinese been able to exert pressure on Soviet foreign policy by
raising the ‘ideological’ question of international revolutionary solidarity.
Khrushchev and his colleagues in the Soviet hierarchy have had to respond to
that pressure and to reassert their authority in the world communist movement
by pointing to their increased ability to support revolutionary struggles every
where without open involvement in war–thanks to the edge they now claim to have
in the world balance of power.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
the ‘Guardian’ of London commented editorially upon this article, indicates the
far-reaching implications of this view. The implication that Russian designs of
world conquest are never kept out of sight by its policy-makers and that, if
not by force, even by competitive co-existence, the communists would strive to
make the world safe for communism, is also the view of other publicists. In a
review article appearing in ‘Problems of Communism’, Mr. G. F. Hudson of
Oxford, expressed the same view. The pro-American bias of this publication is
in itself no reason for not taking the views of Mr. Hudson seriously. Surmising
the trend of the books reviewed he says: “What, then, is the meaning of peaceful
co-existence? The consensus of opinion of the books listed, with the exception
of Deutscher’s, is that it is really the cold war under another name. It is
peaceful in so far as it involves on the Soviet side a genuine fear of nuclear
war; the bitter controversy with Mao Tse-Tung–who appears to have clung to
Stalin’s belief in the secondary strategic importance of the nuclear arm–is
evidence of the reality of this fear, and indeed we may give Khrushchev credit
for recognizing the unwisdom of playing with atomic fire. The new co-existence
is praceful also in that the cold war is now more than ever before carried on
with economic weapons; the Soviet Union today can export capital tools and
technical advice on a large scale to underdeveloped countries as instruments of
its political activity. This is certainly peaceful competition, and a case can
be made for regarding it as ultimately beneficial to all concerned, since the
underdeveloped countries stand to gain from the bidding for their favour and
the West is put on its mettle to increase its productivity and improve its
methods of rendering aid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“But
the new emphasis on economic diplomacy does not imply any spirit of
co-operation from the Soviet side; it is economic warfare directed to a
political end which remains fundamentally the same as in the days of the
Comintern or the Cominform. What remains constant is the basic hostility of the
Soviet Union and of all Communist States towards the entire non-communist
world, a hostility due, not to any particular resentments or grievances but, to
the ideology by which alone the rulers of communist countries justify their
right to govern.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

such an approach to Russian policies is correct the policy of the uncommitted
nations may have to be reviewed. What interpretations can we give and what

the above views? It is proposed <o:p></o:p></span></p>

before we proceed, one further point. Even if the conclusions of Mr. Lowenthal
are erroneous, as the ‘Guardian’ argued in its editorial, the following
analysis of our foreign policy–though viewed in the light of Mr. Lowenthal’s
analysis of Russian policy–would nevertheless remain pertinent. The analysis
will show the implications of our stand in the context of communist intentions
of expansion; but it shows something more. The analysis holds good even if we
dismiss the credibility of such intentions. Because, even when we do not take
into serious account the theory of communist domination, surely we have to
estimate for our strong neighbour, China, endangering our security. If we
accept this, then, what implication can we draw from our policy? The analysis
attempted in the following lines answers this question as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Russian
policy, thus, is one of awaiting the opportune moment to help to bring about
the inevitable communisation of the world. Peaceful co-existence is a process
of managing the cold war to the eventual advantage of the Soviet Union. By
definition a hot war is kept out of consideration, at least as long as the
going is good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this conclusion is a correct one, (its tenability can only be discounted at
great risk) what does it imply from the point of view of our uncommitted
policy? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Consequently, Russian policy towards the uncommitted nations, however friendly
and gentle, is a variation on the theme and the theme will have to be struck
later, if not, sooner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is at fundamental variance with the ostensible basis of Indian foreign policy.
We seem to be convinced that the cold war can be ended by growing understanding
of the inevitability of peaceful co-existence. The role of the uncommitted
nations, we imply, is to keep out of the prevailing tension. The more the
participants in this bi-polar struggle, the more is it accelerated; hence the
more the number of uncommitted nations the less the scope for acceleration of the
cold war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is obvious, such thinking is dangerously unwarranted if the, aforesaid view of

examine the possible aims of Russian policy towards us, granting its higher aim

Friendship with newly liberated countries will help Russia discrediting the nations
of the West. The liberated as well as the aspirants for liberation have a chip
on their shoulders and the process of mutual adjustment between ex-colonies and
ex-colonists often results in estrangement. It is at this point that communism
stands forth as the patron saint of the oppressed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Success to the policy of neutrality is the best investment for the Russians. To
make neutrality the rallying point for newcomers is an achievement of the first
magnitude for their policy. Piety and profit are together realised at one
stroke. This is the Russian counterpart of the Western policy of containment.
There is one difference though, as containment, in this case, may only be a
prelude to contain them subsequently within the communist orbit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

benefits that this policy confers are significant. In the first instance there
is the negative benefit of foiling additions to the Western camp. Secondly,

assistance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It may also lull these small powers into a false sense of security, thus
preparing the ground for an Anschllus, either through outside force or through
internal party machinery. Soviet leaders appear to be a bit ambivalent about
the latter prospect. Iraq, to some extent, and Cuba, ideally, serve as
examples, wherein local Communist Parties have gradually assumed control
exploiting the name of leaders like Kassim and Castro. But on the other hand
there is the adroit hand of President Nasser which takes Mr. Khruschev by his
hand and the Egyptian Communist Party by its throat. In India the Communist
Party is extremely embarrassed because of the cordial relations between Nehru
and the Soviet leaders. Thus the policy of ultimate conquest through party
tentacles appears rather uncertain, at least in some cases. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
how about the prospect of an Anschllus? Here it is important to stress upon
another feature of the un-committed nations’ policy. They are passionate in
their concern for economic development. Indeed, the prospect of military
commitments eating away their resources is one of the arguments for their
non-involvement. And this talk of ‘leave us alone to concentrate on economic
development’, assumes a tone of self-righteousness. Defence spending gets, at
best, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a second priority and we pride ourselves all the
more on it, as indicative of our peace loving intentions in contrast to
Pakistan wasting American aid on military equipment. It is this aspect that is
very significant. The point is whether in the context of the alleged
motivations of Soviet policy, this total pre-occupation with internal economic
development at the expense of defence is wise. It may, of course, be retorted
that in any case Indian defence would not be even one-hundredth of a match to
Soviet might in case it were to erupt over India. This, no doubt, is true. But
Soviet might may not erupt itself. It may encourage minor eruptions elsewhere
and even this may not take the form of a total conquest but gradual
encroachment. Are our defences adequate to meet this challenge? Curiously
enough, if that should come, we cannot even ask for help from outside, without
much loss of face, because it has been yet another dictum in uncommitted policies
that ‘local wars must be kept strictly local.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lastly and most probably, the Soviet Union has no definite policy regarding the
uncommitted nations. Even if belief in the ultimate triumph of communism is
fondly held and preparations are being made to help bring about the inevitable
dialectical process, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the Western powers </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

eventually. As to what is to be done with the uncommitted nations, there may
yet be no formulated programme at the Kremlin. After all, these can be sucked
into the communist vortex at any time, when once the policy <i>vis-a-vis </i>the
West goes all right. Probably these small powers could even be allowed to exist
independently, for, their existence is not so much of a challenge to the

we justified in inferring such an absence of policy? The plain fact in
international politics is that statesmen, however gifted, are prone to decide
policy at each and every step rather than resort to what we may term as,
‘time-table diplomacy.’ Even if the overall policy is well set as a goal, as
world domination in the present case, one need not (or should not) infer that
all the aspects of the policy have been worked out once and for all and safely
deposited in foreign office drawers. Dr. A. J. P. Taylor has tried to
demonstrate in his recent work: “Origins of the Second World War” that
“Statesmen are too absorbed by events to follow a preconceived plan. They take
one step and the next follows from it.” Thus, for all we know, the goal of
world communism may itself be just a preconceived plan, not to be taken
seriously, and even when we grant that its execution is a must for communists,
we need not attribute a foolproof, all front plan to the Russians. Indeed their
present policy, <i>vir-a-vis </i>the un-committed nations leaves one surprised
about what the Russians have in view and whether they have anything definite in
view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru’s policy is solely based upon the view that co-existence will eventually
eliminate the cold war, it will be the height of naivety. But in spite of his
moralising, which has in it a streak of naivety we will be doing less than
justice to his historical sense and experience in state affairs if we attribute
to Nehru such a simple-minded conviction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

can we jump to the other extreme and say that he is very well aware of
communist intentions and the tactics that are being adopted and that his policy
is more subtle than their diplomatic strategy? It can be said that the dispute
with China made him see the reality about the spectre of communism. His policy,
it can be argued, is one of making the best use of a situation; making the best
use of Russian pretensions while the going is still good. As for armed defence,
since no amount of defence expenditure will make us good enough to withstand a
communist army, why waste money and spoil the benefits that the ‘lull’ (before
the storm) would bring us. Then how about saving the country from the storm,
that is assumed here as imminent? Here comes the most crucial point. As an
ultimate resort, perhaps, Nehru relies upon Western support to meet communist
aggression. If a communist power were to threaten on a large scale our
security, one can see no other way of protection but the prospect of Western
intervention. This interpretation of our ‘uncommittedness’ may be dismissed as
mischievous. But granting that the communists will attack and that our forces
are too inadequate, what other alternative is there? There is, of course, one
other alternative and that is surrender. Surely, we cannot take this seriously.
Hence we rely on the Western powers. But it must be admitted that it will be
extremely unwise to accept publicly, this “ultima ratio regum” of our policy.
For, it would deny us opportunities that the ‘uncommitted phase’ would bring
with it. Perhaps, it was this sort of interpretation that made Dulles
characterise our neutrality as ‘immoral.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

third interpretation is also possible: Nehru has no definite idea regarding
communist expansion; he neither believes nor disbelieves in the sincerity of
communist professions about the triumph of communism. An eclectic attitude
combining his Gandhian associations, his altruism and ‘soaring idealism’ and
sheer optimism makes him underestimate the roots of the cold war and
overestimate the prospects of co-existence in which neither party will be worse
off for that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

if we hold that Moscow itself has no definite plan <i>vis-a-vis </i>the
uncommitted nations, it is but proper to regard that Delhi has neither <i>vis-a-vis
</i>communist intentions. To apply, once again, Dr. Taylor’s convictions, Nehru
is no exception to the general rule that Statesmen hardly have opportunity to
formulate a long range policy; they go step by step. The situation becomes all
the more indefinite if two statesmen have to formulate their policies depending
upon each other’s intentions. Thus neutralism and co-existence may be
considered the best courses adoptable, given the premise that communism would
not resort to force. But quite occasionally, statesmen will have to change the
premise itself. It can be said that Nehru is not so sure whether the erstwhile
premise still holds water. And suppose it were to be proved that all along his
premise was faulty, has he provided for no safeguard? What ultimate protection
has he in mind? The question is not difficult to answer: the Western powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
passing away of Stalin, the architect of Soviet Russia, is the most outstanding
event of the quarter. He was undoubtedly one of the greatest of men and
exhibited throughout his life unrivalled powers of statesmanship. He was
responsible for the stabilisation of the Communist regime in the country, with
the result that even the worst opponents of Communism are now agreed in
thinking that there is no chance whatever of bringing Soviet Russia into the
fold of Western democracy. As the Secretary of the Communist Party he created a
force of six to eight million men fanatically wedded to Marxism and prepared to
work and even to die for it. There are no signs of rebellion in the country.
People have become adjusted to the totalitarian form of government–an
adjustment which has been easy because of the fact that despotism was the only
form of government which they knew for hundreds of years before the
establishment of Bolshevik rule, and that at no time did they enjoy the
blessings of a free democratic government. When Lenin died in 1924 what
happened was a struggle for power among the prominent leaders of the party. It
was then that Stalin showed his great abilities. He got rid of all his
rivals–including Trotsky–and established himself as the supreme ruler of the
country. He took to systematic purges of the party from time to time and
displayed no scruples whatever in putting an end to the lives of his opponents,
irrespective of their past services to the cause of the October revolution.
This was the first great service he rendered to his country–the stabilisation
of the Communist regime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Stalin
is known as the author of successive five-year plans by which the economy of
the country was revolutionised. Collective farms based on mechanisation became
the rule. Industries of all sorts–heavy as well as light–were introduced. Power
projects were undertaken. Transport was improved. The result was that an
under-developed agricultural country was transformed into a most highly
industrialised one within a short period; and by accomplishing this Stalin
justified to a considerable extent the assumption of dictatorial authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was however the triumphant victory which he won against the hordes of Hitler in
the second World War that brought him immortal fame. This added immensely to
his popularity and brought to him the unlimited confidence of the people in his
leadership. This strengthened his ambition to become the founder of an
extensive Soviet empire. And during the seven years of his life after the war,
he succeeded in establishing Soviet suzerainty over many countries in Eastern
and Central Europe. He helped the Communist party in China in the war which it
waged against Chiang-Kai-Shek and had the satisfaction that the Communist
empire got stretched from Western Germany to the Pacific Ocean. He had thus
under his influence eight hundred millions of people and ruled over an empire
of which his predecessors-the Czars of Russia–only dreamt. Today Soviet Russia
is one of the two great powers that have a real claim to be regarded as world
powers and this was the work of Stalin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not merely as the builder of the internal strength of Soviet Russia and as a
leader responsible for the expansion of the Soviet empire that Stalin left his
impress on the history of his country, but also as one who perfected a new set
of instruments and weapons in carrying on wars of conquest. It has been noticed
by all observers that it was not so much by open aggression and war that Stalin
brought Poland, Czechoslovakia and several other countries under his control.
He accomplished this through encouraging the local Communist parties to rebel
against their governments and seize power by force. It was this method that he
adopted in Korea. The establishment therefore of Communist regimes in
non-Communist countries is to be the outcome of civil war and of internal
crisis. This is the instrument which received perfection at his hands. It is to
this that we have to trace the existence in every country today of a Communist
party looking for guidance and direction to Moscow and being more loyal to
Moscow than to the country of which its members are citizens. Stalin also was
responsible for perfecting the instruments of psychological warfare and warfare
through propaganda. His greatness therefore lies not only in what he achieved
during his lifetime but also in leaving to his successors a number of
instruments effective in enabling them to continue his policies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among the last–though
not the least important–of his achievements is the arrangement which he made
during the last days of his life for peaceful succession to power after his
death. He anticipated that if things were left unsettled there would be the
same struggle for power after his death as there was after the death of Lenin,
and that such a struggle would be far more dangerous in a world in which for
nearly seven years a cold war had been going on between his country and the
United States. So early as October 1952 it was clear that Malenkov would
succeed Stalin as Premier. The result was that when he died, his mantle fell
quite smoothly on Malenkov. It was as normal as Eisenhower succeeding President
Truman and Queen Elizabeth succeeding George VI. The only difference that the
outside world is made to see is that Malenkov is sharing power with a number of
other prominent leaders of the party, and that what may be called a collective
dictatorship of three to five persons has taken the place of a single dictator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everything
goes to show that there is perfect understanding among those who are in
authority in Russia today, that they are working together as a single team, and
that no internal strains or stresses will affect the strength of the new
regime. It is a great tribute to the work of Stalin that he has left behind him
a strong and stable State, completely consolidated, a political party firmly
welded together and prepared to defend the country and the government against
all dangers, and a team of successors who have the confidence that they will
get from their party and the people all the loyalty and support needed to
enable them to work for what they regard as the best interests of their
country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

under-developed countries in the world–especially those which have recently
become free–where people are not familiar with the working of democracy and
where actual power is exercised by a single leader–whatever be the external
features of the constitutional system–have a great lesson to learn from Stalin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policy announced by Eisenhower after he assumed office early this year
indicated that war would become more intensified in Korea and that, with
Formosa as the base, it might be extended into the mainland of China. The
suspension of the Korean truce talks and the impasse on the question of the
prisoners of war even after the Indian proposal was accepted by the General
assembly, made the President feel that it was only through war that Soviet
Russia and Communist China could be brought round to some kind of negotiated
peace. But today the atmosphere is better. There is a feeling that the
international situation has become less tense, that some kind of armistice will
be possible in Korea, and that this might be followed by a conference of all
interested powers for the settlement of all outstanding issues responsible for
the tension in the international sphere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is the new regime in Soviet Russia that has kindled this hope of a peaceful
solution of all outstanding issues. As soon as it came to office it announced
that there were no problems which could not be settled by peaceful negotiation,
that it was quite ready to enter into such a negotiation, and that it only
waited for response from other countries. Along with this it announced a number
of changes in the internal system of government which gave hope that it was
prepared to modify some of the policies which characterised the Stalin regime.
It not only released the doctors who were previously suspected of having been
responsible for the death of one of the prominent leaders of the Communist
party but also punished some of the leading men who were responsible for
creating such a suspicion. Along with this there came some kind of general
amnesty as a result of which several prisoners were released and the sentence
on several others was reduced. Most of these were persons who were accused of
not doing their work in factories or other establishments according to law. The
amnesty did not, it is true, apply to those accused of political crimes and
counter-revolutionary measures. They continued to remain in concentration
camps. But the fact that several thousands of non-political prisoners got
released was taken as an indication that the new regime was prepared to reverse
the policies of Stalin and to adopt milder methods of administration leading to
a relaxation of police methods and to some humanisation of the criminal law.
The inference was drawn from all this that there were some men high up in the
Communist party who were only waiting for Stalin’s death to bring about changes
like these and that they might be quite ready to reverse his foreign policy
also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was followed by two other announcements which had a direct bearing on Korean
negotiations. They were to the effect that some arrangement might be made to
exchange immediately till prisoners of war who were sick and wounded, and that
negotiations might be reopened to consider the repatriation of the other
prisoners of war, more or less on the lines indicated in the Indian resolution
accepted by the General Assembly. These announcements were made from Peking.
They indicated that there was some change of heart among those who were in
authority in China. It was also felt that Mao and Chow-En-Lai were in Moscow
after Stalin’s death, that they had consultations with Malenkov and Molotov,
and that the announcements were the outcome of a change in Soviet policy also.
In addition to this the Soviet Government agreed to enter into talks with
Britain, the United States etc., on the protection to be afforded to allied
aircraft flying near the Iron Curtain and subjected to Soviet shootings on
charges of having illegally crossed into the Soviet area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Negotiations
therefore were resumed on the subject of the prisoners of war. The wounded and
the sick were exchanged without much difficulty, but the question of the
repatriation of the other prisoners of war could not be satisfactorily settled.
The original Chinese proposal was that the prisoners unwilling to be
repatriated were to be kept in the custody of a neutral State till their fate
was finally decided. But debate arose as to who this neutral power should be,
and as to whether the prisoners were to be physically removed from Korea into
the territory of the neutral State or kept in Korea itself under the guard of
the neutral State. In a way Pakistan was agreed to as the neutral State to take
charge of the prisoners and it was also agreed that they need not be removed
from Korea. But before the matter was finally settled fresh proposals have been
made by the Chinese that, instead of a single State, a committee of four States
with another as an Umpire should be set up to take charge of them. This was
more or less on the lines of the Indian resolution of December last. It is
however not known at the time of writing whether the new proposal would be
accepted by the United States, as there are still some controversial points to
be settled. One refers to the final disposal of those not willing to be
repatriated; another to the forces that should be kept by the neutral States
constituting the Committee to keep guard over the prisoners; and a third to the
opportunity to be afforded to the governments of the States to which the
prisoners belong as citizens, to send persons to the prisoners’ camps to
persuade them to get repatriated. Among the neutral States proposed are Poland
and ‘Czechoslovakia. The United States is unwilling to permit Polish and Czech
forces inside Korea to keep guard over prisoners. All these would be matters
for further negotiation. As the Chinese have shown indication of being ready
for some armistice in Korea, it is hoped that an armistice will become an
accomplished fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there is a more important question. An armistice in Korea will be of<i> </i>no
use if it is not followed by negotiation for the settlement of all outstanding
issues in the Far East as well as in Europe. It will be equally useless if the
Communist forces begin fighting in some other part of Asia after stopping the
war in Korea. It has therefore to be recognised that the matter at issue is not
the Korean war, but the cold war between the United States and the U.S.S.R. Are
there any chances of this cold war coming to an end and normal relations
established between the East and the West?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not possible to give an answer to this question. There are so many unknown
factors in the situation that make it impossible to give an answer. For
instance, while the Korean negotiations have been going on, there has also been
a large-scale invasion of Laos–one of the three Associated States of Indo-China
in the French Union–by the Communist Viet-Minh forces of Ho. The inference is
being drawn from this that a Korean armistice may be followed by an
intensification of warfare in Indo-China where the situation, from the point of
view of the French, is highly precarious. If this inference is correct
Eisenhower and his advisers may not be prepared to enter into any armistice in
Korea, unless there is a guarantee that the Communists would cease to bring
pressure on Indo-China, Malaya, Burma, Thailand and other countries of South
Asia which are vulnerable to Communist attack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a matter of fact, in a historic speech which he delivered on April 16, 1953
Eisenhower laid down the preliminary conditions that Soviet Russia and China
should satisfy even before a conference could be convened to settle the terms
of peace between the two blocs. According to him the Soviet fulfillment of
these conditions is the only true test of Soviet sincerity in desiring a
negotiated peace. Not only should Communists cease to give help to the rebels
in Indo-China, Malaya and Burma; they should co-operate in bringing about the
unification of Korea and the establishment of a government based on free
elections. Soviet Russia should also be prepared to give freedom to her
satellites in Europe and promise to create conditions favourable for the
conclusion of a treaty with Austria. Eisenhower also made references to
disarmament and to international control of Atomic weapons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
U.S.S.R. however is not prepared to give any preliminary guarantees before
negotiations are opened. She has also taken objection to laying down any such
conditions, as it is these very conditions that have to be discussed at the
Conference. Moreover she has pointed out that Eisenhower made no reference
whatever in his speech to the representation of China on the U.N.O., to the
handing over of Formosa to the Chinese Government, and to the problem of
Germany. The result is that each party is suspicious of the motives of the
other party in launching what may be called the peace offensive, and, though
both parties are anxious to avoid a global war, this want of mutual trust
stands in the way of a quick settlement of the outstanding issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
opinion is now held however that there will be no war in 1954 as was expected
hitherto. It was on the basis of this expectation that the States of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation undertook their programme of re-armament. It is
now felt that Soviet Russia might not undertake a war in 1954 and the programme
therefore has been modified accordingly. Spending a little less on re-armament
and a little more on the production of the commodities needed to maintain the
normal standards of living of the people, have been agreed to at the last
meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Council.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But there has been no perceptible change in the
over-all policy of either bloc. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is still
faced with the problem of creating an integrated European Army of which the
contribution of Federal Germany would be an integral part. French suspicions of
German revival have not been completely removed and the ratification of the
European Defence Community treaties is being delayed in all the countries of
Western Europe. Russia is proposing the withdrawal of all occupation armies
from Germany and the creation of a United Germany, but the West is not prepared
to pay heed to these proposals unless fair and free elections in East and West
Germany are guaranteed. Meanwhile the United States has agreed to send
increasing supplies to support the French in Indo-China, threatened now by the
Communist invasion of Laos. If Laos falls, the next step will be for a
Communist attack on Thailand and Burma. France is not prepared to co-operate
with the United States in the defence of Western Europe, unless the United
States is prepared to fight for French supremacy in her colonial empire in
North Africa as well as in Indo-China. The result is that, though the United
States speaks the old language of the freedom and self-determination of
colonial peoples, she is not in a position to give effect to her old views in
the face of the new dilemma created by Communist imperialism. The net result is
that American supplies are poured into Indo-China to uphold French supremacy.</p>

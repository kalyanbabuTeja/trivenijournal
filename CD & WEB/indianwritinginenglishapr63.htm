to newspaper reporters in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
some time ago on the problem of literary expression, Prof. <span class=SpellE>Humayun</span>
Kabir made an interesting observation, which should make us think a little on
the subject. He <span class=GramE>said,</span> that a writer’s mother-tongue
was not necessarily the tongue of his mother. It was rather that medium which
he consciously chooses for his self-expression, for intellectual communication,
for putting across his thoughts and feelings, his ideas and emotions, to the
reading public. It often happens, and quite naturally too, that the same
language serves both the purposes and it makes matters comparatively easy for
the writer. But sometimes, it does not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have been well-known instances in which the writer chose for creative
expression a language different from that of his mother-tongue, different from
the medium of communication in everyday life. Many scholars of the past in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> wrote
their great works in <span class=GramE>Sanskrit and Persian, though they did
not speak them at home.</span> In the world outside we have in recent times the
example of Joseph Conrad, who was a Pole by birth, and Vladimir <span
class=SpellE>Nabakov</span> (the author of ‘<span class=SpellE>Lolita</span>’)
a white Russian, and George Mikes, a Hungarian, who are all writers of merit in
English. Arthur <span class=SpellE>Koestler</span> describes himself as a
Hungarian-born, German-speaking, French-loving English writer. Instances of
this kind can easily be multiplied. Nearer home, there is Kaka <span
class=SpellE>Kalelker</span>, a Maharashtrian, who writes in <span
class=SpellE>Gujetati</span>, and a friend of mine (by name <span class=SpellE>Ramesh</span>
<span class=SpellE>Chaudhary</span>), whose mother-tongue is Telugu, but who is
a writer in Hindi and English. There are a few established Tamil writers in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, who speak Telugu
in their homes. <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> P. <span class=SpellE>Lal</span>
(of the Writers’ Workshop, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>)
is a Punjabi, married to a <span class=SpellE>Bengalee</span>, but a poet in
English. Similarly, there are many others in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, whose mother-tongue mayor
may not be English, but who depend on English as their main or even only medium
of intellectual communication. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

English language has been with us, in some form or other, for over a
century-and-a-half. But curiously enough, it was only after the withdrawal of
the British masters from the Indian political scene that a kind of normalcy was
reached in our relations with their culture and literature. (I am not thinking
here of the role of the English language in bringing to us the world classics
on liberty and in preparing the field for the seeds of political consciousness,
as that might be outside the scope of my present subject). I am thinking mainly
of creative writing in English by Indians during the last three to four
decades, and particularly after Freedom. In this context, it seems to me that
once the stigma of political domination was removed and the stain of official
coercion erased, the atmosphere has become more conducive to intellectual
intercourse with <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> and
<st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> and, for that matter, with all other
countries of the world. Now we can keep our window to the West (as well as to
the East) open, without being swept off our feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a fact noted by observers of contemporary trends that there are more
journals, periodicals and newspapers as well as books in English published in
this country now than ever before. It may seem paradoxical, but it is true and
significant that more creative writing and original work in English (notable
for its high standard, as well as sheer volume) is in evidence, from a survey
of published work, in recent years, than in the past, say 40 to 50 years ago.
Writing on the subject in 1949, John <span class=SpellE>Hampson</span>, the
English novelist who was on a visit to <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>,
remarked: “Today we find the stories of English, French and American writers in
the bookshops of <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>, and <st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City>,
and the stories of Indian and Chinese writers for sale on the bookstalls in <st1:City

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State>. This exchange
is a sign of the times, a token of better understanding between the East and
the West, a prophecy of the widest cultural exchanges which will ultimately
take place between the races of the world.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
spite of this encouraging circumstance of a shrunken world, the Indian writer
in English has not ceased to be treated in some quarters, at home and abroad,
as a somewhat strange creature, an odd character, a curious phenomenon to be
looked upon with mild surprise, or amused tolerance; and what he meets with is,
more often than not, tardy patronage, unmixed contempt and even downright
hostility. He is generally damned with faint praise and rewarded with
left-handed compliments. The wonder seems to be not that he writes well or
badly, but that he writes at all (in a language not his own). It is not unlike
the spectacle of a woman preaching (in the eyes of Dr Johnson), a bear dancing,
or a dog walking on its hind legs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Native Image in Adopted Medium </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the writer himself has to overcome many serious handicaps, if he is to be true
to his vocation. In choosing a language, to which he is not born, for his
creative expression, he has to grapple with the two-fold problem of capturing a
vision that is truly his own and, in the process, of subjecting himself to a
discipline of grammar, syntax and idiom (and of <span class=SpellE>metre</span>,
rhyme and rhythm) which are not his own, in his attempt to convey it adequately
to his readers. He stands or fails according to whether he proves himself equal
to the situation or not. The question is not why he functions in English, but
how he presents the Indian image with English clay and tools. Added to this is
the grim prospect of the Indian writer in English (be it of novel, short story
or poetry) being weighed in the balance against his counterparts in the
English-speaking world and found wanting, when judged by such world standards.
A writer in the Indian languages is, in a like situation, compared only with other
writers in his language region and perhaps let off rather leniently in the
test. Even when he appears in translation and is not able to make an impact
worth speaking about, he gets the benefit of doubt, and the blame rests
possibly on the translator. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But with all these handicaps, we may possibly admit
to ourselves in our outspoken and unsentimental moods that English is not now
an entirely alien language to us. As Raja Rao observes in the foreword to his
novel ‘<span class=SpellE>Kanthapura</span>’: “It is the language of our intellectual
make-up–like Sanskrit or Persian was before–but not of our emotional make-up.
We are all instinctively bilingual, many of us writing in our own language and
in English. We cannot write like the English. We should not. We cannot write
only as Indians. We have grown to look at the large world as part of us. Our
method of expression, therefore, has to be a dialect which will some day prove
to be as distinctive and <span class=SpellE>colourful</span> as the Irish or
the American. Time alone will justify it.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>Among the
earliest writers, in recent times, who tried to project an integrated national
picture of India on the world screen, through an English projector, as it were,
was the late <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> K. S. <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani</span>,
an idealist and dreamer (As a writer and man, he was a gem of the purest ray
serene). He did it consciously and deliberately as a mission as well as an art.
The bulk of <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> writing having been done
originally in Bengali, he stands on a different footing, along with <span
class=SpellE>Bankim</span>, <span class=SpellE>Sarat</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Premchand</span>, Bharati, <span class=SpellE>Gurazada</span> and
other giants of Indian literature. Tagore cannot, strictly speaking, be classed
as an Indian writer in English though he has done some original writing in that
language. It is, however, well to remember in this connection that in awarding
the Nobel Prize, the judges had to depend solely on the English version of his
‘Gitanjali’ and had no possible approach to the original which only goes to
prove that the English ‘<span class=SpellE>Gitanjali</span>’ was considered a
work of distinction in its own right, though it might not approach the Bengali
original in its word music or shades of meaning, nuances of expression, or its
suggestive power and wealth of association. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

early thirties under the impact of the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
movement in the struggle for freedom. Some of his works of longer fiction may
have dated now, as they were really in the nature of period pieces. But there
is one little book, which is a neat collection of vignettes of Indian life, of
South Indian life in particular, ‘Paper Boats’, which belongs to a different
category. The fragile fleet he floated more than forty years ago can still be
watched on the uncharted seas from our shores. In the author’s own words, “it
carries in its </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

its sustenance, like a snow-fed river, from the invisible peaks of an

in some respects, to <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani</span>, in his grasp of
the Indian image, is <span class=SpellE>Manjeri</span> S. Isvaran, whose forte
is the short story. With this difference, however, that while <span
class=SpellE>Venkataramani</span> tends to be rather sentimental and romantic
in his outlook and can hardly ever turn his eyes away from the sylvan
background of his wind-swept and water-laved village (of <span class=SpellE>Kaveripoompattinam</span>
in <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> district), Isvaran is an impertinent
realist (a realist with a vengeance, as it were), who can feel at home in the
ample, <span class=SpellE>cosy</span>, spacious atmosphere of a family mansion
in the city of Madras or in a dingy hovel near the market place in a <span
class=SpellE>Malabar</span> village, on the green and shaded highways of <span
class=SpellE>Mylapore</span>, or the narrow, crowded <span class=SpellE>bylanes</span>

Personally, I feel there is something typically Indian in his short stories–in
their ethos as well as their <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span> whether
it be the moving and powerful ‘Immersion’ (a long and elaborately done story,
full of feeling and instinct with a sense of foreboding), or ‘Decision’, both
of which are sketched on a fairly large canvas, or ‘Saturday is Saturday’
(where the theme is fragile, but the <span class=SpellE>flavour</span> is so
homely–that of a newly-wed girl expecting and meeting her young husband, on his
first visit to the father-in-law’s house) and ‘the <span class=SpellE>Lustral</span>
Bath’, where we<i> </i>smile with the author, who seems to peep, with a
mischievous twinkle in his eye, from the keyhole of the door at the amusing
situation in the <span class=SpellE>Puja</span> room of an orthodox Hindu
household. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian village rocked by the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> revolution in
the early thirties. As Dr K. R. Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>
points out in his recent book on Indian writing in English, Raja <span

to adopt in English the idiom, the rhythm, the tone, the total distinctiveness
of vernacular speech (Kannada in this context). A glance at some of the

at any place. He does the difficult trick of achieving a kind of Indian idiom
in English, with its distinct echo of regional speech and reflection of local <span

(Rama, for short) goes up to the Sorbonne for higher studies in the history of
France where he <span class=SpellE>specialises</span> in the <span
class=SpellE>Albigensian</span> heresy (of <span class=SpellE>Cathars</span> in
the south of France). At the age of 21 he marries a French woman by name
Madeleine, a lecturer in history, five years his senior in age. They live
happily together for some years, in the course of which he returns to India
twice–once for the obsequies of his father and a second time for the marriage
of his stepsister. When he rejoins his wife, an ardent adherent to the Indian
way of life<i> </i>herself, he finds her fast losing herself more and more in
the <span class=SpellE>quicksands</span> of Yoga and Buddhist contemplation.
Her asceticism soon reaches the stage of a denial of normal conjugal relations,
when there is no alternative to a separation from each other. While Madeleine
finds it comparatively easy to proceed to a point of no return in reconciling
her native tenets of Roman Catholicism with the new-found principles of
Buddhism, Rama seems, for a time, to hang in the thin air, faced with<i> </i>the
difficulty of finding a personal solution to a spiritual problem. The main thing
to note about him is that he is an Indian, a Hindu, a Brahmin, whether he be in
Bangalore or <span class=SpellE>Benares</span>, the Latin quarter of Paris, or
the villa in the south of France. He notes in his diary, “No, not a God, but a
Guru is what I need. Oh Lord, My Guru, My Lord, I cried in the middle of this
dreadful winter night. The winds of April had arisen, the trees of the
Luxembourg were crying till you could hear them like the triple oceans of the
Goddess at Cape <span class=SpellE>Comorin</span>. ‘Lord, Lord, My Guru, come
to me, tell me, give me thy touch, vouchsafe, I cried, the vision of Truth,
Lord, my Lord.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

doubts and deep longings, its philosophical ideals and spiritual aspirations.

proportion. In her own life she represents a kind of national integration, for
she is a Pole by birth, who had learnt English as a foreign language. She is
married to an Indian and has identified herself with India in more senses than
one. Her outlook on life is, therefore, that of an Indian, looking at other
Indians with sympathy, tolerance and amusement and not that of an outsider looking
down upon or making fun of the people of this country without sympathy or
understanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

officers who join hands like brothers in quelling the riots, the Kashmir
problem and the sense of fraternity between the two officers (who now happened

this rather perfunctory survey, I have touched only one branch of writing and
only a few writers at that, with whom I am familiar. Poetry I did not choose to
discuss, as I am not sure what to make of some of its new experiments. In a
discussion on Indian writing in English one or two points seem to emerge. One
is that Indian writing in English (whether it be good, bad or indifferent) has
come to stay as, for instance, the writing in other Indian languages. The
second is that it has a vital role to play in national integration, as it is
still the only kind of writing which all of us can understand and enjoy in an
equal measure. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Lal</span> says that the Hindi writer
writes for the Hindi readers and the <span class=SpellE>punjabi</span> writer
writes for the Punjabi readers, whereas the English (or Indo-<span
class=SpellE>Anglian</span>) writer writes for the <i>Indian </i>reader,
directly at any rate, as also to the world reader. Perhaps all writers write
for all readers, but there is the process of translation involved in the case
of writers in the regional languages before they could reach the readers in
other regions. The role of the Indian writer in English is, therefore, at least
as great as that of the writer in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil or Telugu or any other
Indian language, for that matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

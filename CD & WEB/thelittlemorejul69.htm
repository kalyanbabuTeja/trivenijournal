I’d love a saint because I was not one. But it was not possible. A saint’s a
saint and wants no love. And love for a saint is <span class=GramE>so</span>
different from love as we think, know or feel it. But I cannot be blamed for
marrying Agnes. She had the body of a woman who was ripe for love and I was
confident she’d give me a fill of love as I wanted it. When she broke into
tantrums that were uncontrollable I began to think I had made a mistake in
marrying her. But that could not be, and one day something told me to tell her
straight what I thought of her, and how cockeyed she was in the thing called
love. She nearly went into a fit.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What did I think she was? <span class=GramE>A loose
woman?</span> Not I, I said. It was not loose of her to behave like a wife. She
was behaving like a wife all right, because she was living with <span
class=GramE>me,</span> She was sleeping with me, and was that not enough? I
began to smile at her <span class=SpellE>naiveness</span>. I was no, child to
take her reasoning seriously and when I saw her leave me with a huff I knew she
was serious all right. I had made up my mind to have it out with her. I had
borne enough from her for over eighteen months. I <span class=GramE>was
certainly not wanting</span> her to call me a hungry animal because I was
nothing of the kind but, normal. “But you’ve had, your sex satisfaction last
month,” she reminded me, and at the same time she was letting me know that as
far as she went, she had nothing of the sort. “It takes two hands to clap,” I
said with a finality she understood. “You’ve got to live with me as a wife or
quit. It’s no use bluffing others or ourselves when it’s not a fact.” “What do
you want from me?” she asked me with an exasperation that tempted me to bring
out my worst. But I concealed this with a <span class=SpellE>humour</span> that
she failed to understand. “My dear girl,” I then said with a beseeching tone,
“I am a normal man and I want the sex in you that will bring me to the point of<i>
</i>love, if you know what I mean.” I had said enough and I was surprised myself
for putting the thing so tersely. But then I had made love my guiding passion
and I knew I had failed with her. She walked out on me. I am glad she took the
initiative because she had tested me to the limit and I might have strangled
her for what I thought was her frigidness, born of puritan living. </p>

felt lonely without her. People who knew<i> </i>me began to ask me where Agnes
was and I began to cook up stories. She had gone to her mother’s, then she had
gone to see an ailing girl-friend and finally she had gone on a holiday! Soon I
<span class=SpellE>realised</span> that people didn’t care a damn whether she
had walked out on me or not. They were far too busy with their own affairs and
they were not being nosey when they asked me about Agnes. It is the most normal
thing to ask a man where his wife is, and no man shudders at the question
unless he has a guilty conscience. I asked myself whether I was the guilty one.
And the answer was a Big No! Was I,<b> </b>I asked myself again, unbalanced
when I asked her to be my wife after I<i> </i>had seen her a couple of times in
church and had ventured in talking to her on her way back home. The answer
again was: that it was the most normal </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thing I had done.

had certainly not made love to her in the sentimental way that our boys do in

her to any park to lie beside her and feel love thrilling down her spine or
mine by a touch here or there. I was, in short, at my best <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>.
But then, may be, I told myself, I had pretended to be a saint like her and
that was what had probably endeared her to me. <span class=GramE>But no.</span>
It could not be that because I can never play at being a saint. I am far from
being one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

be what she was<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>not? She had not wanted
sex. She had thought she had wanted it. And then she knew. She saw the
revolting side of it and was shocked. It was not the grand thing talked about
by the romantics. I was rid of her or rather she was rid of me. We both had
bitter tastes in our mouths. But then it was life or part of life and I was no
eunuch not to want marriage or to seek children through marriage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

second wife Edna was a plump girl. She gave me the impression that she would
give me love from morn to night. That I met her at one of the Indian dances
made me want to be with her. I had fallen for her chic sari and her
prepossessing <span class=SpellE>choli</span> and her pretty dimple. That she
danced divinely made me want to be with her for always and she knew it. When I
asked her to my flat she agreed, and before days flew into weeks or months, we
were engaged. She was all I had wanted in a woman. She had beauty and looks,
and her big almond eyes made me want to see into them every time I met her. I
married her and she knew there was nothing I would not do to see her happy. I
bought her all the things she wanted. I took her to all the places she desired
to see and it seemed that she was the girl for me and I her ideal boy, if you
could call me a boy at thirty-two! But then it all changed for me when I
actually saw her legs for the first time. She was forever covering them and I
let her do that because of modesty. But one day I was not the gentleman she
took me for and I believe I had my own way with her to the extent of ripping
her clothes that covered the legs, for I had wanted to see them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

myself, marrying a woman and not seeing her legs. I’d be laughed to derision!
And then she and I knew what the result of it was. I let her dress and avoided
looking at her lest she read my thoughts anew by way of confirmation. I said
nothing. I was hurt. Why had the woman kept away the secret of the legs from
me. She could have told me about them and let me decide. How could she imagine
a man being such a <span class=SpellE>mut</span> to take her as she was? But
then she had banked on my being an Indian and she an Indian and therefore, legs
apart, all would work out well. But not so in beautiful Britain where the girls
have the finest legs in the world! And I had seen enough of these legs long
before the mini-skirts were the craze! I was certainly not wanting a child with
that pair of legs. No, by Jove! And she would, as she had told me, soon be
expecting a child. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>I thought of
a ruse. I was going to India and would meet her when I returned a month or two
later. But she was not that green. She wanted to come with me as my lawfully-wedded
wife. That I had married her in London under an assumed name made me feel
scared of the consequences. I had two ways out. Either I would have to put an
end to her and be caught in the end or be so mad with her that I’d beat hell
out of her. The latter became a habit which I liked. I was as merciless as I
could. It gave me a pleasure I had not felt before and of which I had only read
in books. I was glad at the end of the month when she said she wanted to see
her relatives. For she had enough of the hiding that she’d remember to the end
of her life. As I had anticipated she failed to come after a week, a month and
then a whole year passed without so much as a letter or a reminder that I had
ever known her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

she’d have been loved. What had she or her parents done to deserve such a
punishment? And what an irony in a woman of such bewitching beauty! But there
it was! No woman was perfect nor any man. And, as someone artistically-minded
said no two sides of the face of a man or woman were ever the same, much as
they looked so! And here was the most beautiful body that man has ever seen

she went out of my sight when her legs haunted me for days and nights
afterwards till I woke up in my sleep and saw them curling round me, strangling
me. How could the legs curl round me if I was not that inclined, but my
imagination made things worse than they were. She had to quit or die
unnaturally at my hands. And she wanted to live. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

respects. But there it was. May be her mother dreamed of an animal and the
dream came true in her legs! There could be so many reasons. But whatever they<span

schoo1 and in the world. Her legs would be her downfall. If only she cut them
off and walked with false ones, or had no legs at all and used the two-wheeled
cycled chair that the legless use and are pitied, helped and loved by turns! I
have not seen her all the five years I was in Britain but may be I’d see her
one day in a psychology magazine as illustration of what the helpless can do to
help themselves rather than their handicaps and make hell for themselves and
others, Or may be she’d marry a blind man who’d feel her face and body and see
them perfect. I wish I were that blind for she could love! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

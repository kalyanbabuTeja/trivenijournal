wave of morning sunshine swayed into the room through the window. Ramaiah was
groaning painfully lying uneasily on the cot. Sitaratham was in a fix. There
was a flutter of uneasiness in her mind. Ramaiah’s body was scorching with
fever. It was absolutely impossible for her to take a day off. Otherwise there
was no worry at all. She took the pulse beat of Ramaiah, who opened his eyes
and looked at her with agony. Sitaratham couldn’t herself. The siren was still
ringing in her ears. She was undecided, mentally unprepared to go but
physically she was moving towards the door. The grey beard of Ramaiah didn’t
attract her attention. She couldn’t bear the books of the cataracted eyes. They
were disturbing her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

guilt. Ramaiah lifted his left hand and took the right wrist to feel the pulse,
rather self-assuringly. Sitaratham felt a pinch in her heart. He is a timid
man, can’t withstand even the slightest discomfiture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sitaratham’s feet physically drew her out. She looked back so often, as though

she realised how late she was. Already, her colleagues were out </span><span

sight. The machine would certainly punch a red mark on her card, for the fourth

thoughts were rolling away as fast as the car tyres. After all it was her fault.
They were justified in doing so. In the past, often, she was late, the red mark
staring into her face. At once Sitaratham was reminded of Ramaiah. She was
anxious about him. Engrossed in her thoughts she ran into a car. Luckily the
driver suddenly applied the brakes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ramaiah was already out of work. He could work no more to earn a livelihood.
Now, she would be soon thrown out of employment. She was afraid of the future,
the future which stared into her<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>face.
How to meet it was her main concern. Machines were working at top speed. She

charms. Ramaiah was attracted by her. He expressed it. She disappointed him and
brushed him away. But, then he did not give up. He was </span><span

and slowly won her over. His beauty and chivalry filled her mind and heart. It
was something unusual. They knew that they were going out of the way. It was
impossible. Ramaiah knew it and Sitaratham too. Still, it happened. The caste,
which stood in their way, couldn’t bar the union of their hearts. They left the
village undetected and came to this far far away city. They were here all these
days. Sitaratham recollected her past. She couldn’t understand how she was so
much courageous then. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

one to the other. She found in him a friend who understood her and was ready to
share her life. All these years, only one discontentment raged in her mind; a
desire to have a child, to share her love and affection. When she mentioned
this to Ramaiah he used to laugh it away saying, “You were born somewhere. Now
you are here, giving yourself to a stranger. Still you don’t think the whole
world is yours. Aren’t you that much large-hearted my dear?” Sitaratham used to
nodd her head blindly, as though she understood him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

you fellow. What the hell are you going to do?” Ramaiah insisted. Buchaiah
looked at Sitaratham from the corners of his eyes and sat down. Buchaiah was
unemployed and so was disliked by one and all in the locality. Sitaratham

amount at that. One of them offered three hundred rupees if she called their

no candidate of her own. Why not make use of this golden chance? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It is the affection that counts; not the money. If you want money, name
Buchaiah as your dependent. I shall give you those two thousand rupees.”

V. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span>, in his essay on ‘Yakshagana’ in <i>Triveni

theatre of India, the contribution of <st1:place w:st="on">South <span
 class=SpellE>Canara</span></st1:place> is the Yakshagana.” He repeats this at
the beginning of the second section of the same essay: “The Yakshagana belongs
to <st1:place w:st="on">South <span class=SpellE>Canara</span></st1:place> in
the Kannada area. <span class=GramE>For it is the Karnataka country that has
named our South Indian music and dance as ‘<span class=SpellE>Karnatic</span>’.</span>
In South <span class=SpellE>Canara</span>, the Yakshagana is one of the two
most wide-spread popular dramatic entertainments...The vernacular name of
Yakshagana is ‘<span class=SpellE>Bayal</span> <span class=SpellE>Attam</span>’
i.e., open-air play, a <span class=GramE>name</span> which corresponds to the
Tamil ‘<span class=SpellE>Terukoothu</span>’ and the Telugu ‘<span
class=SpellE>Veethi</span> <span class=SpellE>Nataka</span>’ both of which mean
‘street-play’.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us see how the Kannada people meet this problem. It is the custom among their
‘Yakshagana-<span class=SpellE>melas</span>’ or acting troupes, specially in
South <span class=SpellE>Canara</span>, to give the first performance on can b
the ‘<span class=SpellE>Dipavali</span>’ day in the temple to which they are
attached. Sri <span class=SpellE>Muliya</span> <span class=SpellE>Thimmappaya</span>
in his ‘<span class=SpellE>Parthi</span> <span class=SpellE>Subha</span>’,
states that ‘<span class=SpellE>Dipavali</span>’ was called ‘<span
class=SpellE>Yaksha-ratri</span>’, and that <span class=SpellE>Kubera</span>,
the King of the <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span>, got back all his wealth from
Bali on <span class=SpellE>the’Dipavali</span>’ day. Hence the <span
class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> sing and dance in joy expressing their pleasure. In
token of this, it is said that the Kannada Yakshagana troupes give their first
performance on the <span class=SpellE>Dipavali</span> day in their own temple.
As such this drama is called ‘Yakshagana Ata.’ The day previous to ‘<span
class=SpellE>Dipavali</span>’ day is called ‘<span class=SpellE>Naraka</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chaturdasi</span>,’ because the demon <span class=SpellE>Naraka</span>
was killed on that day by Sri Krishna and <span class=SpellE>Satyabhama</span>
for his atrocities. To celebrate this incident, it is said that ‘<span
class=SpellE>Dipavali</span>’ was performed the next day. This is mentioned in
Bhagavata and Vishnu <span class=SpellE>Purana</span>. That <st1:place w:st="on">Bali</st1:place>
returned the wealth of <span class=SpellE>Kubera</span> on the same day is not
mentioned in the </span><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
For argument’s sake let us take this for granted. Let us examine when the
Yakshagana troupes began to give these performances. Sri M. <span class=SpellE>Govinda</span>
Rao, in his article on ‘Karnataka Yakshagana’, states that he could not find
any Kannada Yakshagana earlier than the end of the 17th century A. D., while E.
P. Rice in his ‘History of <span class=SpellE>Kanarese</span> Literature’
writes that this new literary form ‘Yakshagana’ sprang up in the 18th century.
The word <span class=GramE>‘Yakshagana’,</span> does not appear in Kannada
literature earlier than the 17th century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a second view, which is also traditional. In the court of Indra, the <span
class=SpellE>Gandharvas</span> used to sing and <span class=GramE>dance,</span>
and the <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> had to serve them as menials. Being
tired of this, the <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> went to Sukracharya, the <i>guru
</i>of the demons, and learnt this kind of music and drama, and hence came the
name Yakshagana. This view, like the previous one, is not supported by
reference to any text in any epic. Further, Sukracharya was never noted for his
talents in music and drama as <span class=SpellE>Bharatha</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Narada</span> or <span class=SpellE>Nandikeswara</span>. Next, how
could the <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> go to the <i>guru </i>of their
enemies, and how could he oblige his opponents? Further, the literary form
would have been called ‘<span class=SpellE>Sukragana</span>,’ like ‘<span
class=SpellE>Sukraniti</span>’, after <span class=SpellE>Sukra</span>, but not
‘Yakshagana.’ It is clear that these stories were invented subsequently to
support an ancient and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dr. V. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span>, in his
article mentioned above, admits that “The Tamil <span class=SpellE>Natya</span>
literature, having numberless odd names, does not mention the word Yakshagana.”
He also says in the same article: “In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
and <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> Manuscript Libraries, there are many
Tamil and Telugu <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>, though none of them can
be dated beyond the 18th century.” From these statements, it can be safely
admitted that there were no <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> in Tamil
before the 18th century. But his statement about Telugu is not correct, as ‘<span
class=SpellE>Sugriva</span> <span class=SpellE>Vijaya</span>’ of <span
class=SpellE>Rudrakavi</span> belongs to 1550 A. D., and there are several <span
class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> subsequently. So there is no use of relying on
Tamil for the origin and derivation of Yakshagana. I think the <span
class=SpellE>Kuravanjis</span> in Tamil may be more in number and earlier than
their <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> by two centuries i.e., 16th century
A.D., though they too are not earlier than the Telugu <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>
of the 14th century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
let us also see whether the Malayalam language will throw any light on the
subject. Dr. V. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span> writes in the very beginning
of his article: “To the vast indigenous theatre of India, the contribution of <st1:place
w:st="on">South <span class=SpellE>Kanara</span></st1:place> is the
‘Yakshagana,” the Kannada cognate of the ‘<span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span>’
of <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span>, the ‘Yakshagana,’ </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
street-play, and the ‘<span class=SpellE>Bhagavataemelanatakas</span>’ of <span
class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span> and Andhra.” And he begins the next <span
class=SpellE>para</span>: “The Yakshagana can be taken to be the common name of
an old type of traditional, popular vernacular drama of South India, a name
common to the three linguistic areas of Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, and absent
only in Malayalam.” Are not these two statements, “Yakshagana, the Kannada
cognate of <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span>” and “the Yakshagana absent only
in Malayalam” inconsistent with each other? The actors in Yakshagana both sing
and dance, while the actors in <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> never move
their lips, as Dr. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span> himself admits in <span
class=SpellE>para</span> 9 of his article. <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span>,
as the <span class=SpellE>Malayalees</span> say, is the worship of Mother Kali,
and it came into existence only in the latter part of the 17th century A. D.
and was never heard of before. He continues: “In subsequent times the
Yakshagana gave place to the two names ‘<span class=SpellE>Nataka</span>’ and ‘<span
class=SpellE>Vilasa</span>’ in <span class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span> and Andhra,
but it continued in <st1:place w:st="on">South <span class=SpellE>Canara</span></st1:place>.”
As far as Andhra is concerned, it was subsequently never called ‘<span
class=SpellE>Vilasa</span>’ either as a cognate or a substitute. The word ‘<span
class=SpellE>Vilasa</span>’ might have been added to the titles of the works,
when the characteristics fitted, whether it was Yakshagana or otherwise. The
name ‘<span class=SpellE>Nataka</span>’ as I already mentioned above, was added
to Yakshagana as Yakshagana-<span class=SpellE>nataka</span>; but was never
used simply as a cognate or substitute, <span class=GramE>since,</span>
perhaps, it was restricted to stage drama.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
let us turn to Andhra, and see whether it can throw any fresh light on the
subject. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span> writes in the same article,
that he was informed by the late Sri V. <span class=SpellE>Prabhakara</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> that Yakshagana was called after the name of a
community in the <span class=SpellE>Guntur</span> District by name <span
class=SpellE>Zakkulu</span>–the derivative form of <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span>–talented
in music and dance. He also learnt from the same scholar that Yakshagana might
have developed from folk-songs like ‘<span class=SpellE>Ela</span>,’ ‘<span
class=SpellE>Jhola</span>’ etc., which might have been <span class=SpellE>utilised</span>
for the Yakshagana. At this stage Dr. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span> takes
a wrong step and feels these ‘<span class=SpellE>Ela</span>,’ ‘<span
class=SpellE>Jhola</span>’ songs of <span class=SpellE><i>Ragada</i></span><i> </i><span
class=SpellE>metre</span>, to be similar to the songs mentioned in some
Sanskrit treatises on music, like the <span class=SpellE>Sangita</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ratnakara</span> of <span class=SpellE>Sarangadeva</span> of A. D.
1210–1247, and concludes that these <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> came
to birth under the influence of Sanskrit and <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span>
plays. He supports his view with a reference to the fourth act of <span
class=SpellE>Vikramorvaseeyam</span> of Kalidasa and some <span class=SpellE><i>uparupakas</i></span><i>,
</i>and some other <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span> plays in <span
class=SpellE>Mithila</span> as <span class=SpellE><i>Parijatapaharana</i></span><i>
</i>of <span class=SpellE>Umapati</span> (1304–’24). Taking this as an
authority Dr. N. <span class=SpellE>Venkataramanayya</span>, in his article on
Yakshagana in Te1ugu <i>Bharati, </i>states that Yakshagana was the outcome of
Sanskrit and <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span> dramas in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place>. He argues that the <span class=SpellE>Dvipada</span> <span
class=SpellE>metre</span>, which was profusely used in the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Telugu
Yakshagana was derived from the Sanskrit or <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span> <span
class=SpellE>metre</span>, called <span class=SpellE>Dwipadika</span> mentioned
in <span class=SpellE><i>Vikramorvaseeyam</i></span><i>. </i>His second
argument is that the music and dance used in Yakshagana, are none else than
those mentioned by <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span> in his <span class=SpellE>Natyasastra</span>.
Finally he argues that, as <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> were among the ‘<span
class=SpellE>devatas</span>’ or gods, who dance and sing in heaven and their
King was <span class=SpellE>Kubera</span>, there must be some relation between
them and the Yakshagana. As <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> are mentioned in
Buddhist literature, he continues to argue, they cannot be considered as pure
myths, and their music must be the original source of the Yakshagana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is true that it gives scope for probability about the relationship between the <span
class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> and the Yakshagana. But nobody is able to explain
satisfactorily what bearing the celestial <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> had
on Yakshagana, a literary and musical composition in the Dravidian languages
since 700 years. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Venkataramanayya’s</span> arguments are
in no way better than the conventional and legendary stories of our Kannada
friends, which I discussed above. Simply because some parts of names appear to
be similar, one need not identify them both, without knowing the
characteristics of the music and the dances of the celestial beings in heaven
and those of the earthly beings. Every nation in the world has its own
folk-songs, music and dances in its own language, independent of the classical
arts and languages. They are called <span class=SpellE><i>desi</i></span><i> </i>music
and <span class=SpellE><i>desi</i></span><i> </i>dance, whereas the classical
arts and languages are called Margi. Hence we cannot ignore this element, and
attribute every thing to Margi or classical. It has to be admitted that the
music and dance contained in the Yakshagana are of the <span class=SpellE>Desi</span>
nature and not of <span class=SpellE>Bharata’s</span> <span class=SpellE>Natya-Sastra</span>.
That is why the terms of songs as <span class=SpellE>Daruvu</span> etc. and <span
class=SpellE>metres</span> as ‘<span class=SpellE>Ela</span>,’ ‘<span
class=SpellE>Jhola</span>’ etc. are not traceable in <span class=SpellE>Bharata’s</span>
<span class=SpellE>Natyasastra</span>, or in any Sanskrit work on music, dance
or drama as stated previously. Though the words <span class=SpellE>Yaksha</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Gana</span> are Sanskrit words familiar to Sanskrit
literature and language, the compound word Yakshagana, is not found in Sanskrit
language, for it was not any ‘older type of music’ as Dr. <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span>
was informed. If it had been any older type of music, it would have been
certainly recorded in books on music or dance. Unless the origin of Yakshagana
is understood properly, the term ‘Yakshagana’ cannot be appreciated. We already
noticed that the term Yakshagana was not heard of in Sanskrit, Kannada,
Malayalam, and Tamil literatures, and in works on drama, music or dance before
the 17th century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the modern condition of performing a Yakshagana either in music or dance, we
cannot justify and infer its initial </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>position and nature.
It underwent several changes both in writing and acting, since the time of its
origin, Nowadays, in Telugu, the term ‘Yakshagana’ is used for the script or
the writing aspect of the work, but not applied to its performance as used in
Kannada as ‘Yakshagana Ata’, The correct word that it used for the performance
in Telugu in modern times is ‘<span class=SpellE>Veethi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bhagavatam</span>’ or ‘<span class=SpellE>Veethi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Natakam</span>’ as more loosely used. Even these two are used in
slightly different senses. The <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> were
performed by two kinds of people, one the Brahmins and the other, the <span
class=SpellE>Yanadis</span>, <span class=SpellE>Gollas</span> (cowherds) etc.
The performance of the Brahmins is called ‘<span class=SpellE>Veethi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bhagavatam</span>’ and that of the <span class=SpellE>Yanadis</span>
etc., is called ‘<span class=SpellE>Veethi</span> <span class=SpellE>Natakam</span>.’
As a matter of fact, the non-Brahmin <span class=SpellE>Yanadis</span> were
said to be the pioneers in the field. The Brahmins entered the field only
later. In the performances of the Brahmins alone, the <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span>
<span class=SpellE>Natya</span> has been introduced. In the performances of the
non-Brahmin <span class=SpellE>Yanadis</span> <span class=SpellE><i>desi</i></span><i>
</i><span class=SpellE>natya</span> is performed but not regular <span
class=SpellE>Bharata</span> <span class=SpellE>Natya</span>. These people never
use ‘<span class=SpellE>hastas</span>’ and’ <span class=SpellE>mudras</span>’
as embodied in the <span class=SpellE>Natya</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastra</span>.
Similarly there is difference in the music and songs of the two. It is due to
this <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span> <span class=SpellE>Natya</span> or dance
that the performance takes longer time, the whole night, from 10 P. M. to 5 or 6
A. M. But for this, it would not have taken such a long time, as the script is
a short one fit for about two to three hours. The introduction of <span
class=SpellE>Bharata</span> <span class=SpellE>natya</span> into Yakshagana is
a later improvement. Hence it can be inferred that dance or <span class=SpellE>Nritya</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Abhinaya</span>, was not so prominent previously; but <span
class=SpellE>Gana</span> or music was more pre-dominant in it. That was why
people having talent in music only were selected for this purpose. Naturally,
women are gifted with this talent. Specially, women of <span class=SpellE>Zakkula</span>
caste among the Telugus, have got this natural gift to the highest degree. They
were always selected for the purpose of singing the story, It was rather <span
class=SpellE>monopolised</span> by this community at the beginning. Hence the
performance was called after the community, ‘<span class=SpellE>Zakkula</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pata</span>’, which was <span class=SpellE>sanskritised</span> as
‘Yakshagana’. But it was never a <i>kind of music. </i>The music adopted in it
is <span class=SpellE><i>desi</i></span><i> </i><span class=SpellE>Gana</span>.
This <span class=SpellE>Zakkula</span> caste is no other than <span
class=SpellE>Devadasis</span> or dancing girls, among the non-Brahmins. Singing
and dancing were reserved to them as a profession and they were asked to give
performances in public on festival days. Such is the history of the term
‘Yakshagana’. As stated previously, Yakshagana at this stage was sung by only
one woman of musical talent from the beginning to the end, to the accompaniment
of some musical instrument. Later on more people used to take part, to play the
role of different characters. In early <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>
while the songs consisting of ‘<span class=SpellE>Ela</span>’, ‘<span
class=SpellE>Jhola</span>’ etc., were being sung by the woman, the short prose
passages of connecting links that were introduced Subsequently into it were
uttered by the <span class=SpellE>Sutradhara</span> who assisted her. She
danced a little, keeping time to the song with her anklet-bells.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Yakshagana is called in Tamil as ‘<span
class=SpellE>Issakki</span> <span class=SpellE>Kuttu</span>’, a simple
derivative of the Sanskrit Word. But the term has no significance or history as
in Telugu. Now it is clear that Yakshagana had <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt'>its place much earlier in Telugu than in Tamil or Kannada, even by the
13th century, with a special significance. It started with </span>the Telugus
with more of musical songs and less of dance, and it was named after the <span
class=SpellE>Zakkula</span> caste among the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span>.
It continued to grow with uncultured non-Brahmins for some time, till the
Kuchipudi artists improved it by introducing <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span> <span
class=SpellE>Natya</span> into it. ‘<span class=SpellE>Daruvu</span>’ or ‘<span
class=SpellE>Daru</span>’ mentioned in Yakshagana is nothing but songs sung in
accordance to drumming. ‘<span class=SpellE>Daru</span>’ or ‘<span
class=SpellE>Daruvu</span>’ <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>originally
meant in Telugu, drumming. Gradually the word has come to mean the song sung in
accordance to drumming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
the question arises as to how the Yakshagana could prevail in the Tamil and
Kannada areas. In the reign of Sri <span class=SpellE>Krishnadeva</span> <span
class=SpellE>Raya</span> of <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span> during the
beginning of the 16th century A. D., the Tamils and the <span class=SpellE>Kannadigas</span>
came together </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with the Telugus under the patronage of the
King. Further <span class=SpellE>Krishnadeva</span> <span class=SpellE>Raya</span>
conquered <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> and <span class=SpellE>Madura</span>
and appointed Telugu <span class=SpellE>Nayaks</span> as rulers there. They <span
class=SpellE>patronised</span> the fine arts and encouraged Telugu poets,
musicians, and dancers who went to <span class=SpellE>Madura</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> from the Telugu country. At that time the Telugu
people took their <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> and performed them
there. The <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> kings encouraged the Yakshagana to
such an extent that the rulers also took part in it personally. Hence it
because so popular that Telugu <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> were being
performed in the Temples of <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> by Bhagavata-<span
class=SpellE>melas</span> since the 16th and 17th centuries. <span
class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Nayaka</span> and his son <span
class=SpellE>Vijayaraghava</span> <span class=SpellE>Nayaka</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> during the 17th century wrote several <span
class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> in Telugu. The <span class=SpellE>Maharatta</span>
rulers of <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span>, who succeeded the Telugu <span
class=SpellE>Nayaks</span>, also learnt Telugu and wrote <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>
in Telugu. This clearly shows how popular Telugu Yakshagana was in <span
class=SpellE>Tanjore</span> since the 16th century. The Tamil people of the
place could not keep quiet and imitated the Telugus in writing the <span
class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> in Tamil. It attracted the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span>
Kannada people also who had already come in contact with the <span
class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span> Empire. They too began to write <span
class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> from 17th </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>century. In the Telugu
Yakshagana of <span class=SpellE>Mannarudasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Vilasa</span>
written by the poetess <span class=SpellE>Rangajamma</span> in the court of <span
class=SpellE>Vijayaraghava</span> </span><span class=SpellE><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,
different characters speaking Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam were introduced.
These incidents prove that other South Indian languages imitated the Telugu
Yakshagana. Hence they have <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> only from the
17th century and not earlier than that. <span class=SpellE>Govinda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dikshita</span> of <span class=SpellE>Tanjore</span>, a court
Pandit of <span class=SpellE>Vijayaraghava</span> <span class=SpellE>Nayak</span>,
mentioned this Yakshagana in his Sanskrit work on music ‘<span class=SpellE>Sangita</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sudha</span>’. Before this, it is not found in Sanskrit
literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the 15th century non-Brahmin women were giving the Yakshagana performances as
stated in the Telugu ‘<span class=SpellE>Kridabhiramam</span>.’ From the
beginning of the 16th century Kuchipudi Brahmins took up the profession in
troupes and toured all over South India giving the Yakshagana performances. In
these troupes men took up the roles of women and acted the drama. In the hands
of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

It is these people that introduced <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span> <span
class=SpellE>Natya</span> into the Yakshagana performances. There is recorded
evidence to show that Kuchipudi <span class=SpellE>Bhagavatars</span> or actors
visited all parts of South India and received <span class=SpellE>honours</span>
for their performance during the 16th and 17th centuries. At <span

<span class=SpellE>Nayak</span> and <span class=SpellE>Vijayaraghava</span> <span

is also good proof to show that the Kuchipudi troupes went to <span

of the charmers there. All these go to prove that the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span>
were the pioneers in the field of Yakshagana and with their influence only,
Yakshagana developed in Tamil and Kannada areas. The Telugu Yakshagana might be
responsible to some extent for the development of <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span>
in <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span>. Learning the art of Yakshagana
performance, different peoples might have developed it making slight
deviations. <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> might have been one such. They
might have felt it difficult and inconvenient on the part of the actors both to
sing and dance at the same time and hence reserved simple acting to the actors
and supplemented singing by accompanists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Kannadigas</span> might not have liked this mute dances <span
class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> of <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span>, and
followed with appreciation the Telugu Yakshagana by both singing and dancing
simultaneously. As the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> and the <span
class=SpellE>Malayalees</span> are on the borders of the <span class=SpellE>Kannadigas</span>,
they could not but have their influence on them. While they preferred the
singing and dancing of the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> in their <span
class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span> the <span class=SpellE>Kannadigas</span>
adopted the cast, make-up and musical instruments of the <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span>
of <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span>. Their themes also are much nearer to <span
class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> than to the Andhra Yakshagana. <span
class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> and the Kannada Yakshagana make use of ‘<span
class=SpellE>Chendai</span>,’ the drum, but the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span>
never use it. They both have wild fight-dances whereas the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span>
do not have them. The <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> adopted sword-play
instead. In the matter of singing and dancing in the <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Kannadigas</span>
vary at some places. In the <span class=SpellE>Kanaada</span> Yakshagana
performances “When the actors stop the speech, the musical theme is sung.” It
has also been noticed that the substance of the speeches is already sung in a
succinct manner in the song by the musician, and that the actors then deliver
the speeches. This custom does not prevail in the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>.
Both singing and dancing are done at the same time, and the substance of the
song is never repeated in prose speeches. The Kannada people might have adopted
their system from the <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span>. So we find in
Kannada Yakshagana some aspects similar to the Andhra Yakshagana and the <span
class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> of <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the composition of the Telugu <span class=SpellE>Yakshaganas</span>, it
started by the 13th century as mentioned previously. They were the early forms
of the Yakshagana. The later and developed forms are seen from the beginning of

<span class=SpellE>Chitrakavi</span> <span class=SpellE>Peddana</span> by 1550
in his ‘<span class=SpellE>Sarva</span> <span class=SpellE>Lakshana</span> <span

conclude: Yakshagana in its early stages was only a song as denoted by the
term, without any prominence to dance. It does not mean that it is a <i>certain
kind of music </i>or song. It was called after the caste of the people who sung
in the beginning in the <span class=SpellE>Andhradesa</span>. It is purely a <span
class=SpellE><i>desi</i></span> art without the influence of <span
class=SpellE>Bharatanatya</span> <span class=SpellE>sastra</span>. Kuchipudi
actors developed it into a drama and introduced <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span>
<span class=SpellE>Natya</span> into it. They made it popular in South India,
by touring over all the parts of <span class=SpellE>Deccan</span> even by the
16th century. The Tamils and the <span class=SpellE>Kannadigas</span> followed
them and the people of <span class=SpellE>Malabar</span> adapted it to suit
their convenience in their <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> and developed
it. It is not good logic to argue that Yakshagana started in Kannada on the
ground that South Indian music and dance were called after Karnataka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
recent decision of the Congress Parliamentary Board permitting legislators of
other democratic parties to enroll themselves on an individual basis, as
associate members of the Congress Legislature Parties at the Centre and in the
States, is a welcome step towards the reintegration of the groups which broke
away from the parent organisation on the eve of the last General Elections. A
beginning was made in this direction when the Andhra members of the Krishikar
Lok Party agreed to co-operate with their fellow Andhra Congress legislators as
associates. While all parties will continue to function as distinct bodies
outside the legislatures, their members will deem themselves members of the
Congress Legislature Party and be bound by its discipline for purposes of
debate and voting. The Parliamentary Board lays it down as a pre-requisite that
a three-fourths majority of the Congress Legislature Party, local or central,
should agree to the enrolment of such associate members. This is meant to be a
safeguard against indiscriminate extension of membership and the possible
swamping of the congress Legislature Party by legislators other groups, who
might seek eventually to dominate the party and divert its energies to their
own ends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
merger of the Socialist and Praja parties, and later, the negotiations between
Pandit Nehru and Sri J. P. Narain for closer co-operation, indicate that there
is a widespread desire to draw together the scattered democratic forces in the
country and weld them into a powerful organisation. It is true the
Praja-Socialists have for the moment chosen to keep aloof and not to enter into
a coalition<i> </i>with the Congress, except in Andhra. But the points of view
of the two great leaders are not so irreconcilable. Doctrines and creeds,
ideals and dreams, are necessarily divergent even where there is fundamental
agreement on the methods to be adopted by a constitutional Parliamentary
democracy. The Socialist leaders recognise that there is much in common between
themselves and the leaders of the Congress, while there is a corresponding
cleavage between either of them and parties like the Jan Sangh and the
Communists. Sri J. P. Narain’s close association with a movement like the <i>Bhoodan
</i>is a pointer in this direction. His refusal to support the Jammu agitation
is another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was evident at the time of the General Elections that the average voter was
bewildered by the multiplicity of parties between whom the divergences were not
very marked. Especially in the South, candidates belonging to the Congress,
Socialist, K. M. P. and K. L. P. organisations went about the country asking
for support, but failing to convince the electors about the superior validity
of their respective programmes. As a result, the voter very often cast his vote
not for a party but for a person, and when he preferred a Communist it was
because the rest had all been Congressmen till recently and it was difficult to
choose between the many groups. The Communists, at any rate, had a distinct
outlook and programme, and, performance apart, their promises of a new heaven
made a great appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After<i>
</i>the experience of the post-election period, there must be a re-alignment of
parties. Even if there are no further mergers or coalitions, it ought to be
possible for parties and groups with previous Congress affiliations and sharing
a common faith in parliamentary methods, to come closer. Thus will our infant
democracy function with greater success, and protect itself against the
reactionary or revolutionary forces threatening it. In this context, the
decision of the Congress to admit associate members is fraught with
far-reaching consequences. The Congress, under Nehru’s leadership, has made up
its mind to invite Co-operation on an agreed programme. There is bound to be a
wide response from all those who owe allegiance to the Constitution and are
anxious to build on that foundation the edifice of a progressive and prosperous
Republic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Prime Minister’s statement in Parliament on the 25th of March, steps are
being taken for the formation of an Andhra State by the 1st of October. The
Andhra members of the Madras Legislature are due to meet on the 1st of June, to
select a place within the territory of the new State for the location of<i> </i>the
temporary Capital. Despite Justice<i> </i>Wanchoo’s recommendation, the Tamil
leaders refused to accommodate the Andhra Capital, even temporarily, in Madras,
and the Government of India endorsed that refusal. The Andhras are obliged to
confront a difficult situation. No single town in Andhra is qualified to be the
Capital, as Justice<i> </i>Wanchoo recognised after an arduous personal survey.
All that the Andhra legislators can do to meet their immediate needs is to name
some town–Visakhapatnam or Vijayawada–as a token Capital, accommodating the
Secretariat and the Legislature, and then distribute the various departments at
different centres.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hyderabad as the permanent Capital of a future Visala Andhra are not very
bright. A new city has got to be built on the banks of the Krishna with funds
provided by the Centre. The plans and estimates must be prepared almost
immediately and the construction commenced early next year. The lure of
Hyderabad cannot be allowed to delay the construction of a proper Capital. If,
at some time in the future, Hyderabad becomes available, there will be two
great cities of the first rank in Andhra, like Lucknow and Allahabad in Uttar
Pradesh, or Bombay and Poona in Western India. The new State starts with some
disadvantages; the worst of them is the uncertainty about a Central
Headquarters. The terms ‘temporary’ and ‘permanent’ are elusive and likely to
mislead men’s minds. If the Andhra legislators can decide upon the construction
of a city on the banks of the Krishna as suggested above, the new State can
settle down in a few years, and devote attention to the many and urgent
problems of reconstruction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a bitter controversy has raged over the future of the town and taluk of
Bellary. Justice Misra conducted a detailed enquiry and submitted his report to
the Government of India, whose final award will be given in a week’s time. Each
side is so convinced about the justness of its own point of view that any
decision must cause disappointment to one of them. Throughout the chequered
history of South India, a spirit of friendliness has subsisted between the

years ago, the demand for it Province of Karnataka followed close upon that of
Andhra. The final emergence of a Samyukta Karnataka including Mysore and the
Kannada areas of Hyderabad, and a Visala Andhra including the city of Hyderabad
and the Telangana districts of the State, will be welcomed with equal
satisfaction by both the peoples. With this background and this hope for the
future, Bellary was a comparatively minor issue which could have been settled
by the leaders sitting round a table. But what are called the ‘popular
elements’ got out of hand. It was with difficulty that they were controlled
during the few days when Justice Misra’s enquiry was proceeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

every inch of territory is to be similarly fought for, wherever opposing claims
are urged by sister States of the Indian Union–Bengal and Bihar, Andhra and
Orissa, Mahabharata and Gujarat–the task of restoring harmony will be arduous.
Therefore, sooner or later, a boundary commission or commissions will have to
conduct an impartial survey on an all-India basis and determine the boundaries
of the States. The way to meet the demand for linguistic States is not to
ignore or oppose it, but to satisfy it in a spirit of sympathy and
understanding. Once the problem is solved–and the disintegration of Hyderabad
is necessary for such a solution–it will be enough to provide adequate safeguards
for the cultural rights of linguistic minorities in accordance with the Indian
Constitution. A policy of drift will only exacerbate existing differences and
impede the growth of Indian unity. Regional patriotism is a valuable asset,
and, if properly directed, it will contribute in a great measure to the
ultimate progress of the nation. To characterise it as ‘primitive’ or ‘tribal’
is to invite trouble and deepen discontent. Statesmanship consists in facing
realities. Let us not forget that the demand is not for independent sovereign
States, but for a re-distribution of administrative units on a reasonable
basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

itself into our first Parliament. He was not<i> </i>in agreement with the

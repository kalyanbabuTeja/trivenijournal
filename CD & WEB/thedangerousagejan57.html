style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was really the hospitality of the Dutts that started the trouble for the Sens.
Judge Dutt was recently transferred to Banaras, and his wife Nandita had thrown
a house-warming party. As Charulata, Professor Sen’s wife, was her old friend,
a special invitation was sent for both. Being confined to personal friends it
proved to be a delightful function.. Prof. Sen enjoyed it thoroughly and was
all admiration for Mrs. Dutt’s charm and taste, her liveliness and efficiency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the same time, the seed of a vague discontent took root in his heart since that
day. He was not envious by nature, and did not grudge Judge Dutt his official
prestige or his financial superiority. But since meeting Mrs. Dutt he couldn’t
help wishing that his own wife were less dowdy and their house better kept.
From the very next day he started grumbling of things he scarcely noticed
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

kept?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day it would be the haphazard display of photographs on the wall. ‘Why can’t we
consign this illustrated family history to the privacy of an album?’ he would
ask. ‘That would leave the wall free for a picture or two by Haldar or Ukil, as
in Mrs. Dutt’s drawing-room.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he would turn to the mantel-piece. ‘Look, Charu, is this a dispensary or a
drawing-room? Let’s sweep these bottles and jars away, and make room for a bust
of Rabindranath and a Chinese vase. How attractive Mrs. Dutt makes her home!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has no children needing first-aid every quarter of an hour,’ Charu would answer
with a smile. He would curse their furniture and remind her of the smart sofa
set and leather chairs and decorative table-lamps at Mrs. Dutt’s. ‘Let’s get
rid of this rickety junk and buy something decent,’ he would declare. ‘How
tastefully she arranges her drawing-room!’ he would sigh </span><span

where have I the peace for all this elegance?’ Charu would argue. ‘Let her
raise a family and run the house with two servants, and then I’ll listen to her
praise.’ There was always an implied disparagement of his wife whenever he paid
a tribute to Mrs. Dutt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so it would go on every day. The burden of his song would be the same: Mrs.
Dutt’s taste, her accomplishments, her popularity. As dissatisfaction with home
seemed to swell and a new peevishness crept into his intercourse. Mrs. Sen
might be placid and easy-going, but she was lacking neither in sensitiveness
nor intelligence. Her wifely pride began to get the better of her good-natured
tolerance and her resentment grew at her husband’s open admiration for another
woman. In this frame of mind it was easy for her to ‘detect’ in him the
beginnings of ‘male infidelity’. She remembered that the more sophisticated of
the ladies’ journals she read had often warned wives against their husbands’
succumbing to what they called ‘the dangerous age.’ She recalled that one of
the remedies usually recommended was a temporary separation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she was still searching for a pretext for what the all-knowing journals called
‘a conjugal holiday’, her elder brother, a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>flourishing lawyer at
Patna, came to her rescue. He reminded her of her promised visit, and wrote
that their mother had not been keeping too well, and that it was time his
new-born son had his auntie’s blessings in person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When,
seizing this chance, Charulata broached the topic to her husband, his immediate
reaction was vexation. ‘What about the children?’ he exclaimed. ‘They can’t
miss their school.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of course not’, she agreed. ‘I was not proposing anything of the kind. <i>You </i>will
be here. You have often said that looking after them was nothing to make such a
fuss about. I’m sure you can manage it easily. And while I’m away you could
also get the drawing-room done up as you want it, and make a few<i> </i>other
alterations to brighten the place.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hidden challenge nearly touched off his resentment at first, but it quickly
yielded place to a subconscious lure of freedom in the offing. He fell into the
trap. ‘But you mustn’t stay longer than a month”, he said more for good form

hope it won’t be necessary’, she replied casually, though secretly jubilant

Prof. Sen taught Philosophy, he was not quite the apocryphal philosopher. He
did not thrust his hat in the letter-box and clap the envelope on his head; nor
did he place his umbrella on the chair and stand himself in the corner. But he
was a good imitation of that type. He was mildly absent-minded, practically
mirthless, and hopelessly clumsy with his fingers. This array of handicaps put
him beyond the pale as children’s play-mate. But that was the one role he had
set his heart upon as a reply to his wife’s subtle challenge What little
success he came to achieve in this field now was due more to the children’s
patience than to any adaptability he had acquired. There was one stratagem,
however, which worked beyond his expectation, and that was his gift of <i>rasagulla.
</i>It proved such a hit that he made it a daily ritual; and the children would
run to the garden gate and escort him and the jar of sweets in a dancing
procession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

even tenor of his lot for years had kept Prof. Sen under a delusion. The poor
man never realised that his life was being run for him by his capable wife; and
that if it had the steady flow of a stream, downhill, the momentum was hers.
Now that it was withdrawn, the stream became a trickle, the sport of every
contour, the victim of every wind, devoid of initiative, lacking in decision.
Blissfully ignorant of this, whatever he undertook on his own now proved beyond
his competence. He began renovating the hall, but the workmen walked out one
day, leaving a mess. He bought paintings and bric-a-bracs without any plan and
had to dump them somewhere, heightening the present chaos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He chafed that things were going all wrong and his
annoyance grew at finding no scapegoat. His grouses passed over Chandi like
water on a duck’s back. There was tension in the air and even the children
began to keep out of his way. He wrote to his wife once or twice, hinting at
her duty to home, but could not bring himself to send a frank s.o.s.</p>

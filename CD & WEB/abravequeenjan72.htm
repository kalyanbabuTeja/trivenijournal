The anxiety of the <span class=SpellE>Hada</span> <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>
knew no limits as he sent messenger after messenger to the inner courts. The
frown between his heavy brows deepened as the last messenger sent by him came
back with a message from the chief midwife saying that the <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>
would have to wait for a few more hours. He grunted, and kept walking to and

from the ceiling, and several gold-framed pictures of the past <span

glory of the past. A smile touched his lips as he caught sight of a maid
walking fast through the long sunlit <span class=GramE>courtyard, that</span>
separated his own apartments from the inner courts. He waited. She entered the
room, her hands folded, looking down. He looked at her as his throat contracted

took up the opportunity. She smiled broadly. “Anna-Data will kindly pay us a
visit. The little one has come exactly on my lord,” </span><span

saffron cloth, was brought to the window. The <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>
stared, fascinated. The infant gave a yell, but stopped short as it caught <span

him–forcing him to recognize her existence. His brows went up slowly; this was
unusual. He extended his hands for the child, but the maid backed away–no, not

<span class=SpellE>Sardar</span> sounded hurt. “I don’t doubt my Lord’s wisdom.

thinking him too old for his young daughter, when a message sent in a
round-about way by the Princess herself, made him decide in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>

handsome, brave captain of the <span class=SpellE>Rana</span> of <span

back from a prolonged struggle. <span class=SpellE>Bundi</span> should...” The

He looked at the old man. “The <span class=SpellE>Mahamantri</span> has become
too prudent with age; he is forgetting his <span class=SpellE>Rajput</span>

out his sword, holding it naked, up in the air. “My sword is thirsty for the

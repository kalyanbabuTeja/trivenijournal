style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
of the average readers of Rabindranath Tagore’s poetry may be hardly aware that
the character of childhood occupies quite an eminent place in the whole range
of Tagore literature. It is a great pity that many of his exquisite lyrics and
songs on childhood have not so far been translated, and it is a still greater
pity that those which have come out through the garb of English and other languages
have undergone so much transformation that much, nay most, of the beauty and
grace of the original is lost. This however is a limitation with all
translations. But to return to our point. Tagore’s treatment of childhood is, I
repeat, quite unique. It is remarkable that unlike in many poets who have sung
of childhood, the beauty and sweetness of these poems is never lost in the
wilderness of philosophy. They are true poetry–poetry <i>par excellence. </i>The
magic touch of Tagore’s poetry converts us all into children, so much so that
we seem to live and move, not in the world of cares and worries, but in a new
world of never-fading sunshine, of ineffable beauty and mystery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Poet Rabindranath wrote these poems on childhood his heart was heavy with bereavement,
his mind was overcast with the darkening shadow of gloom. In such a state of
mind the Poet found solace and relief in the company of children. As he was
able to enter into the joy and laughter of the child-mind, his own care-worn
mind found the sap of its sustenance and retained its freshness. Such is the
magic charm of the society of children that even the grim master Death has to
relax his rigour before them. Thus has Tagore’s Muse sung forth the sentiment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tagore the child dwells in a land of perennial sunshine where there is one
long-continued holiday. That sunshine, that holiday spirit, breaks through
every step, every movement of his, and he scatters that spirit around him and
infects everybody nearby. So long as he is awake and playing, his world too is
busy and awake; the moment he falls asleep his world is silent and quiet; not
only that, with him sleeping, there is a dead and uneasy silence in the whole
house–the world of his elders; and again, as he wakes up, the world around him
is stirred into a new life. As the poet sings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there is up with him a world of delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who indeed can be the most intimate companion and the willing partaker of all
the Mysteries of the child’s world? It is the <i>Mother, </i>and no one else.
This the Poet illustrates through a variety of portraits. To all his secrets of
the inner world the child finds Mother to be the only trusted confidante, the
sharer of his joys, the sympathiser of his sorrows. His mind forms the
delightful picture of a Fairy Land and loves now and then to dwell in it in
imagination. That <i>Land </i>is the child’s own, none is allowed entry
there,–only Mother has free access. Do you know the secret of it? You
men–grown-up men–are all too sceptical. You dismiss all his fond stories and
his glorious pictures of the Fairy Land with a wise frown and turn them down as
‘silly’. Hence you have no admittance into that enchanted land. The Mother’s
heart pulsates in sympathy with the child’s, and she alone can enter into the
true spirit that pervades that land of charm, which no geographer has charted,
no explorer has found. The child therefore whispers all his secrets and reveals
all the mysteries of that land to his Mother’s ears. But do not imagine, O you
sceptics, that this land lies far away beyond hills and dales, across the ocean
waves, or in the region of the rainbow in the sky! Tagore’s child imagines the
Fairy Land to be no further away than by the side of the Tulasi plant on the
terrace! That very ordinary place–but not easily accessible to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
child physically–is, to the child’s imagination, filled with all the
enchantment of his Dreamland! It is there that the Fairy </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Princess
sleeps, immersed in the enchanted slumber of an unknown spell! Her palace?–Oh,
it has silver walls and a golden roof! But what happens within those walls and
under that golden roof, only Mother should know; she is the only trustworthy
confidante–no sceptic must hear of its secrets! Says Baby to his Mother:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

people come to know where my King’s palace is, it would vanish into the air.
Its walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold. The Queen lives in
a palace with seven court-yards and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth
of seven kingdoms. But let me tell you, Mother, in a whisper, where my King’s
palace is. It is in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the Tulasi plant
stands.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is one other person that can also be admitted into these mysteries. She is
‘Pussy’, though you sceptics will call her but ‘the Cat’. She is the unfailing
companion at all his plays and pranks. To debar her from the delights of this
Dreamland?–O, it would be sheer ingratitude. Moreover, she will not raise any
doubt, nor ask any inconvenient questions about the wonderland! So it is quite
safe to admit her there, and to her the child communicates a whole world of
details which ever gleam through his imagination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Poet again takes us into another and a most important function that the Mother
must perform for her child. Baby listens with keen interest to the fairy tales,
reclining on his mother’s </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

adventure, of heroic exploits, whose hero is some Fairy Prince or some gigantic
perso</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

embers of heroism in our Infant Hero! He wants to emulate the Hero of the fairy
tale and perform deeds of bravery like him. But to whom except the mother can
the child confide this secret desire of his? So the Poet brings her as the
obliging, nodding witness to all his feats of adventure. Our little Hero asks
his mother to imagine that she is going in a palanquin on a journey to a
distant village. And who is to be her guardian and escort for the journey? It
is none other than the little Hero himself. You are not to suppose that he is
within the palanquin listening to lullabies on the mother’s lap. Why should he?
Is he not a Man? –a brave Man? So he has taken upon his broad shoulders the
burden of escorting Mother. She is safe within the palanquin when Baby himself
is on horseback, riding abreast of Mother’s palanquin. But so far it is a tame
affair, after all! There is no adventure as yet! What is the good of becoming
Mother’s escort and caretaker if there is no opportunity of displaying his
daring and courage? So the Mother must imagine that the palanquin is attacked
by highway robbers. A gang of tall, dark, terrific, turbaned fellows are they,
carrying dangerous weapons. Surely palanquin-bearers are not bold men like our
Hero; they leave their charge and take to their heels. The infant Caesar is
thus left alone to fight the robbers! He takes up the noble duty with a word of
consolation to the Mother, and with determination in his heart. This is how the
Poet presents the picture in the ‘Crescent Moon’:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wants all the days of the week to be Sundays, and to be a scholar is never his
ambition. He does not mind being a dunce, if only he can have a holiday every
day of the week, and if, of course, Mother keeps him company always. Says the

is yet another side of the child’s mind interlinked with his dislike for studies;
it is his dread of one person who is his mortal enemy – the schoolmaster! The
child’s constant care is how to get rid of this very unamiable person. He runs
at times to his mother with woeful tales of rough chastisement at the hands of
his schoolmaster. For such things Mother is his only solace, his unfailing
sympathiser. How often do we fail to understand that a harsh word or
thoughtlessly cruel treatment cuts the child to the quick and tells upon his
entire mind and outlook! How incalculable is the harm done to the future
development of the budding little personality! This the Poet has depicted with
delicate sympathy in a small poem. Here he draws our attention to the scolding
that the child has received from his master for failure to memorise the multiplication
table. “What is the product of 8 into 7?” –he is asked; “it is 27”, the boy
replies! O what a reprimand the boy gets for this! Not only the reprimand; a
tiny, coloured earthen doll which Mother had bought for him at the car-festival
for the price of one anna and a quarter, and which the boy had carefully hidden
among his books, is forcibly snatched away from him and the master throws it
away as part of the penance for not knowing the product of 8 into 7! The doll
breaks into pieces, the boy sees the tragedy in silence; he sheds not a tear,
makes no protest–but as he returns home he straightaway tells the mother the
full details of the tragedy, and he asks Mother:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

child is ever eager to bring all the choicest </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>gifts of the
earth to his mother’s hands. If love is defined as thy desire to sacrifice, to
give without the hope of return, this vere sentiment we notice in the child’s
attachment to his mother. All his gifts and presents he wants to shower on his
mother’s lap only to satisfy his overflowing love for his mother, but not with
the hope of getting any return from the mother. The mother on her part is not
unaware of how splendid a blessing the child is to her. This mutual love
between the mother and child the Poet has, with rare insight, depicted in some
poems. The traditional and commonly understood relationship between mother and
child is that the child owes a deep debt to his mother for all that he is and
become. Time after time, poet after poet has sung the glory of the mother who
devotes all her care and concern to the child, and sacrifices her life and all
for the upbringing of the child. But few indeed have realised the debt which
the mother owes to the child for her own fulfillment, for the satisfaction of
her soul. Poet Tagore is perhaps the very first who discovered the important
part that the child plays in bringing the mother’s love and affection to a
natural fulfillment. True it is that when the child “cometh from afar”, it
comes empty-handed. But the smile, the joy, the beaming, radiant face, the
restless spirit manifesting itself through every odd movement, the lisping
attempts at speech,–all these form a wonderful world of delight, a very
paradise around himself, which to the mother is more precious than all the
riches of the earth. The subtle beauty and mystery of this world of delight
only the mother can realise, and none else. But the insight arid sympathetic understanding
of Poet Tagore have delved into these deeper mysteries and given us a taste of
their delight. He has pointed out that whatever the child receives from the
mother, he receives not as a beggar, but he repays all a hundredfold. What a
helpless creature he is when he is first received into the mother’s bosom! For
every movement and for every effort the must depend on the mother. But yet, for
the Mother, he constitutes a whole world of treasure, a heaven of delight.
Without him Mother is no Mother, with him Mother is everything. She fulfils
herself through the child. He comes to the mother “trailing clouds of glory”, a
gift of God, and should she not be hungering to give to her child all that she
can, her entire life and soul? Thus sings the Poet:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tagore’s treatment of childhood there are so many aspects, such a wealth of
variety, that it is not possible in a brief survey like this to do justice to
them all. There is however only one more point which I should like to touch
upon. The most pathetic of all the poems in this series is the one which deals
with the child languishing through long sickness, and yet consoling his mother
when she is overcast with the gloomy foreboding of the child’s approaching
death. Baby does not fail to realise his own critical condition. He perceives
the care and caution reflected in every eye in the house,–the gentle footstep,
the silent whisper, the anxious inquiry, the woe-begone looks of the mother,
her red, swollen eyes heavy with tears,–all these tell their own tale. From these
the child has felt within himself the call of the deep, the beckoning of the
Great Unknown. But he has no particular fear of death; death is, as it were,
rushing into his favourite Mother Nature’s lap, and perhaps not much different
from jumping to his own mother’s bosom. He is not therefore anxious for
himself, but his concern is for Mother. Her own grief, her sense of desolation
at his separation, is the sore point with him. So he consoles her, saying that
he will not be away from her in death! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there is such a play of colours on clouds and water, and why flowers are

the water breaking out into laughter. A little poem incorporates this deep and
sublime truth about the subtle inter-connection between the mother’s joy and
the joy in nature, yet the poem does not sacrifice the interest of poetry to
philospohy. It must be borne in mind here that Tagore has woven a lovely web of

this lyric conveys the sublime truth that God fulfils Himself through man,
through His creation, so in the other poem in the <i>Crescent Moon </i>we find
a parallel idea that mother fulfils herself through her child. As Mother gives
colourful toys to her child and delights herself by delighting the child, so
God gives us delight through the sights and sounds of nature, through the
colour of the rainbow and the smile of the flowers, and at the same time enjoys
his own delight through our delight; the artist delights in his own work of
art, his creation is his own fulfillment; and God the artist fulfils himself
through man, his handiwork; and Mother fulfils herself through her child. The
same sentiment is reflected in yet another lyric of the <i>Gitanjali </i>where
God is represented as a Poet who revels in the joy of his creation: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the sublimity of the Poet’s genius, such the depth of his poetic vision,
such the sympatlhy of his mind, that he has read these deep mysteries in the
love between the mother and the child. Abstruse philosophical truths which
evade the meditation and baffle the understanding of seers and sages, can be
readily perceived by the mother in fondling and caressing the child. In this
respect the child is verily the angel of God. He brings to us the Message of
the far-off yet intimate world which is our Home. He is, as Poet Wordsworth too
has said, the “mighty prophet, seer blest”, who maintains an unforgettable link
between us and our Maker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

send word to Siddhanti garu that I solicit his presence here once,” ordered
Rani Chandramadevi. It was surprising for her entire private retinue in the
harem to see their mistress absent-minded and with a grief-stricken face, right
from the morning. To the intimate personal attendants of the Rani, who had on
the previous night seen the Maharajah emerge from the bed-chamber with eyes red
with rage, the words “My Lord! I am blameless. I may be pardoned”, uttered by
Chandramadevi appeared to come out of a dream. It was true that they, standing
there transfixed, were shaken on seeing the face of the Maharajah. There had
been never an occasion or necessity for them to encounter the Maharajah in
anger. It was beyond their imagination to know what had happened. To question
the Rani about it was impossible. So all of them had been silently immersed in
their respective duties since the morning. But the Yuvarajahs who had come to
take the blessings of their parents early in the morning had to satisfy
themselves with those of their mother alone. Rani Chandramadevi was more deeply
depressed on hearing that the Maharajah refused audienee to his Sons. She did
not know what to do. She could not recollect any dereliction in her attending
on the Maharajah the previous night. It was not as if the Maharani did not
exactly know what engendered such unprecedented indignation in the Maharajah
who was a fine sport, learned in all the arts and a pastmaster in erotics. The
Rani could never for a moment imagine that the Maharajah would manifest such
anger on his discomfiture in Cupid’s battle as he <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>would<i> </i>o</span>n his defeat in the war field. It was an indelible
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>blemish<i> </i></span>to the chivalry
of the Maharajah. Whatever it be, the result had been disastrous. The situation
having worsened, was unbearable. The Rani was frightened even to imagine how long
this unhappy situation would continue. She therefore sent for the court astrologer.

profound scholar in astronomy and astrology, the heritage handed down from
generation to generation in his family, and a distinguished descendant in the
line of sage Vasishta, Sri Pidaparthi Sitarama Sastri garu entered the harem as
if he were the science of Astrology in motion, and seated himself on an
appropriate seat. The members of his family had been court astrologers for two
or three generations and have been enjoying hereditarily the Agraharam granted
by the Maharajah. Their daily duty was to give counsel to the Maharajah,
according to astrological science, on all matters consulted. Having known the
arrival of Sri Sastri garu through her attendants, Rani Chandramadevi entered
the room in which he was seated. Standing behind a blue curtain and surrounded
by her attendants, Chandramadevi folded her hands in salutation, saying “My
namaskarams to Sastri garu.” Sri Sastri said: “May you have a long and blissful
married life! May your family prosper as long as the sun, moon and the stars
exist! My lady, it appears you have sent for me on some urgent business. May I
know what it is?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sastry keenly cogitated for a while. He grasped the configuration of the
planets at that moment. It did not take much time for him to know what her
question was. He also could foresee all the possible future repercussions and
effects issuing therefrom. “Madam! I see you are now the target of our Lord’s
anger. This is a very calamitous period. I very much regret to say that circumstances
would not turn favourable for sometime to come. But there is no doubt that in
the end happiness alone would ensue. In my opinion this separation is only
temporary. Don’t you grieve; none of us can escape from the distress ordained
on us by Fate. You must develop fortitude. Forbear for some time, keeping in
mind the episode of Sakuntala” said Sri Sastri in a deep resonant tone, and
taking leave of the Maharani, made his exit. The Rani’s mind was agitated. But,
as Sri Sastri forecast that the future was hopeful she took courage and retired
into her private chamber. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

time passed on like that. There did not seem any end for this separation from
the Maharajah. The Yuvarajahs also were helpless, being kept out of the grace
of the Maharajah. This was a more tragic situation. The Dewan could not divine
the cause of all this misfortune. He was much perplexed at the indifference
shown by the Maharajah towards the Rani and the Yuvarajahs. The other courtiers
also felt very disturbed in their minds, not knowing what it was all about. To
Sitarama Sastri garu alone was known the root cause of this mishap. But, as it
was an extremely personal affair it was not possible for Sri Sastri to divulge
it. He was suffering a lot within himself. He was also anxiously looking
forward to the day when the circumstances would be set right. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

come to know that Ramachandra Sastriji who was the court astrologer of the
Mysore Maharajah, with very mighty powers of divination and who had plumbed the
depths of the science of Astrology, was arriving to have an interview with the
Maharajah, Sri Sitarama Sastri felt immensely glad. He expectantly hoped to
know of the finale of the conspiring, complicated circumstances prevailing in
the harem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

long last the day had arrived. The Mysore Siddhanti, having been duly honoured
in the Durbar, pleased the Maharajah and the courtiers with the show of his
scholarship. When the conference was about to close, Sitarama Sastri garu stood
up, saluted him and humbly submitted, “Sastriji! I have a question to ask. I
pray you to give me the answer.” The Maharajah was amazed. He wondered what his
court astrologer, who had seen the extreme frontiers of astrological knowledge,
had to know from another astrologer. It was beyond his imagination. The
astrologer from Mysore intensely pondered. He carefully considered in his mind
the configuration of the planets. Turning to Sastri garu and looking at him
thoughtfully he said, “Sastri garu, I have grasped the particular point you
have been anxious to know from me. I have also realised what dire and
distressing circumstances impel you to put such a question. The future is very
hopeful. The situation will become favourable ere long. And, the Maharajah is
deeply learned in all the Sastras. This situation which has stained the
escutcheon of his chivalry and good sportsmanship is only temporary.” So
saying, he turned to the Maharajah and smiled. Sitarama Sastri garu felt glad. “Are
not the blessings of Pandits, with purity of speech, flawless and prophetic? So
there is a great possibility for circumstances turning favourable.” So
thinking, Sri Sastri satisfied himself. The Maharajah could not understand
that. But, as it was no opportune moment to know further, he kept silent. The
Durbar came to a close. The Mysore astrologer went to his apartment. The
Maharajah, the Dewan, and Sri Sastri were going into the harem. Thinking that
it was the appropriate time to know further about what had happened in the
Durbar, the Maharajah queried Sri Sastri: “Sastri garu, I fail to understand
why the Mysore astrologer looked at me and smiled while answering your
question. Moreover, what was the reason for his commenting on my chivalry?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sri Sastri was in an expansive mood and as he believed that the news that these
distressing circumstances would come to an end soon would gladden the
Maharajah, he replied thus: “My Lord! The question I put relates to your
Lordship’s personal affair. Your Lordship has heard the answer given by him in
regard to the tragic situation in the harem.” The Maharajah stood there for
some time, motionless. The Dewan and Sri Sastri also stood still. The Maharajah’s
face reddened with rage. Suddenly drawing his sword from its sheath he
attempted to pounce on Sri Sastri. Sastri garu trembled like a leaf in
whirlwind. The Dewan at once caught hold of the Maharajah’s hand and dissuaded
him in his attempt, saying: “My lord! The sin of killing a Brahmana...Your
Lordship must forbear and be merciful.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

! Sri Sastri has exposed to the public a strictly confidential affair of the
harem. What insult it is to me! I now know the meaning of the words uttered,
and the significance of the smile exhibited by the Mysore Astrologer when he
came to grasp this matter. A matter that ought not to have crossed the threshold
of the harem has gone far and wide, beyond the borders of this country. How
insulting it would be to me if the Maharajah of Mysore were to know of this!
This is a matter in respect of which one should feel as if beheaded. The source
of all this is Sastriji. He cannot be excused. From today onwards may he and
all his descendants be banished from our court!.....They cannot enter the
Durbar. Resume their Agraharam and annex it to our estate. There can be no
occasion for him to show his face to us....”, So saying he flurried away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sastri was aghast. He realised that this disastrous happening was due to the
innocence and straightforwardness naturally inherent in members of a Srotriya
family. Now the inner significance of his act became apparent to Sri Sastri.
But it was too late. It was he that committed the mistake and therefore he had
to undergo punishment, bowing down to the force of circumstances. But, as he
was born in a reputed family which never bowed down before anybody, Sri Sastri.
did not supplicate for the mercy of the Maharajah or crave for the indulgence

the situation of Sri Sastri remained the same. Nobody could dare broach this
topic before the Maharajah. Some years rolled on in this way. The Maharajah had
passed away. His eldest son was installed in his place. He was ruling the
country as its Maharajah. Sri Sitarama Sastri had grown old, and being in
troubles contracted many debts for his living and was thrown into abject misery
in his last days. Sri Sastri by himself did not go and beg for an interview
with the Maharajah; nor did he seek the favour of the Dewan. Therefore, there
was no opportunity for the Maharajah to consider Sri Sastri’s affair; nor was
the Dewan interested to apprise the Maharajah of the same. One evening the
Maharajah and the Dewan went for a stroll into the city, on horseback. While
passing through the royal thoroughfare, the Maharajah saw before him Sri
Sitarama Sastri, weak and wrinkled in body but with an aura of effulgence about
him. Seeing the Maharajah, Sri Sastri blessed him with raised hands and sidled
himself away. The Maharajah having proceeded a few steps said: “Dewanji! He
is...” “Yes, my lord, he is Pidaparthi Sitarama Sastri garu. He was in your
father’s court. On a particular occasion...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
late the Indian films have been accused of having failed to depict the Indian
society. And yet many of these-films, with typically <st1:place w:st="on">Hollywood</st1:place>
situations and pin-up girls, have succeeded at the box-office and have been
applauded by a large section of our audience including the students, both men
and women. At this, while the public men complain that the films are <span
class=GramE>degenerating</span> the morals of the youth who conveniently forget
their own cultural tradition, the film-makers strongly maintain that the
country gets the films it deserves and if ‘better’ films were made they </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would
not succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
issues involved in the above dispute are of such fundamental importance that a <span
class=GramE>probe</span> into the nature of the films that have been made in
this country would reveal interesting facts. It is undoubtedly an accepted fact
that, in spite of its being an art, the main and the more direct purpose of the
film is to entertain: at least that is what the common film-<span class=SpellE>goer</span>
takes it to be. To talk of entertainment means to accept the idea of escape,
escape for the common man from a world that is not quite so pleasant, at least
during the period of a visit to the cinema. The relationship of the film
produced in a country to its social order, even if negative is therefore close;
and this social order again is the outcome of several forces. Of these in
modern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>–and
I want to confine myself to the period of the talkies–education is certainly as
important a fact as our culture and inheritance. And it also remains another
established fact that the education that was given to the Indians yesterday and
that is being given even now has been subjected to attack on all fronts, taking
away from the average man a good deal of the self-confidence that he should
have in himself along with his culture and environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Along
with this there had always been certain problems peculiar to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>: the
problem of the caste system, of political dependence, of economic subjugation,
and of a lot of other ideas that had been on the whole cramping. To this was
added the depression of the thirties, followed by the recklessness of the
forties, and now reacting in the shape of the disillusionment of the fifties.
In the pre-war depression the people were unemployed, their purchasing power
was low, and their visits to<i> </i>the cinemas comparatively few and far
between. In the years of war there was a sudden increase in our activities,
with a temporary rise in our purchasing power accompanied by considerable
reckless spending that also meant very frequent visits to the <span
class=GramE>cinemas.</span> The war years in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> had been the years of boom in
the film trade. Subsequent to it, in the post-war years, the purchasing power
of the Indians shrank; there was an all round disappointment, and <span
class=GramE>a corresponding</span> ebb in the production of films in this
country. There was a sharp fall in film attendance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
these are only bare statements on the Indian social condition, for a proper
understanding of which one has to go </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>deeper. With the
cinemas even now confined to the town </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dwellers, it was but
natural that the films should increasingly seek to meet their expectations, and
it is a known fact that most of those who live in the cities live a dumb and
dreary life. The alternative means of their entertainment are few and expensive
and therefore beyond the reach of the common man, who works in conditions that
are not cheerful and lives in surroundings that are not very bright either. The
values that govern the life of the common man are not those born of a proper
social <span class=SpellE>realisation</span>, ever vacillating between the
false glamour of the screen and the crude reality of the daily life. The
average urban <span class=SpellE>cinegoer</span> has therefore no time to think
before he goes to a cinema or after he returns from it. He wants relaxation
from the drudgery of his daily life on the one hand, and, on the other, he
unconsciously seeks some norms for his daily conduct. The conflict between the
two attitudes is the conflict between the society as it is for them and the
society as they would like it to be. And, of course, in this search for the new
society ‘the gay life’ shown in the films, with their magnificent buildings and
plentiful attire, has its legitimate share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
meanwhile the common folk had already been shaken from their faith in the
accepted order of society, and, if the freedom movement had made them conscious
of anything, that was the awareness of the rights of the individual. And the
first </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>manifestation of this right may be witnessed in
the now-growing <span class=SpellE>realisation</span> that the long accepted
order of society is grossly inadequate. There was a corresponding apprehension
in the mind of the average man about his cherished beliefs and ideals, and the
new gospel of Socialism that swept the country led him to a more critical view
of the rich and the well-to-do. The earlier change-over from scarcity to
plenty, and then the somersault from plenty to scarcity had taken within their
sweep a large multitude of people while the monetary catastrophe had more or
less overtaken all classes of society except the very rich.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Faced
with such unsettled conditions of social life, the individual finds himself
crushed at one extreme, and highly critical and almost vindictive at the other,
<span class=GramE>The</span> ordinary man overcome by shortages, strikes,
disasters and every form of economic collapse, is demanding to know his
position <span class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span> society. He is demanding to know
if he cannot get more wages and more bread, and along with it of course cheap
entertainment. The issues immediately gather momentum and take the form of
various conflicts, the most spectacular of which is perhaps either the open
rebellion against society or the capitalist-<span class=SpellE>labour</span>
conflict. The accent on the frustrated individual in quest of a mooring is
great, and the contemporary social life becomes one of extreme complexity that
is not easy either to explain or to resolve. The prevalent mood is therefore
one of uncertainty, of <span class=SpellE>disbalance</span>, of the failure to
appreciate which ideal is to be preferred to which other. It is, generally speaking,
not the value of definiteness which governs Indian life but one of vacillation
and uncertainty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
films of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
therefore <span class=SpellE>centred</span> round either the escapist themes or
the wayward, reckless and fickle-minded hero or heroine, only to reflect the
mentality of the country in a more direct way than any other artistic medium.
The first reason, as said <span class=SpellE>Kracauer</span> with regard to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, is
“that the films are never the product of the individual, and the team itself
consists of varying interests, represented at the two ends by the
capitalist-producer and the proletariat, under-fed extra”. The second reason,
again according to <span class=SpellE>Kracauer</span>, is that “films address
themselves and appeal to the anonymous multitude. Popular films, or to be more
precise, popular screen motives can therefore be supposed to satisfy existing
man’s desires”, which in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are more or less uncertain desires <span class=SpellE>characterised</span> by
their almost ambiguous nature. But the uncertainty takes a more positive shape
when the ideas are <span class=SpellE>concretised</span> before them on the
screen through visual images and aural sounds, and the psychological
inhibitions or dispositions that lay deep within the subconscious suddenly seek
dimensions that were perhaps originally not known to the persons themselves.
The inner tendencies are now transformed into dominant attitudes and the “inner
life manifests itself in various elements and conglomerations of external life,
especially in those almost imperceptible surface data which form an essential
part of screen treatment. In recording the visible world, whether current
reality or an imaginary universe, films therefore provide clues to hidden
mental processes”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
the ‘clues’ in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
might sometimes be completely upsetting is apparent from the fact that nobody
can exactly foretell which type of film would be a box-office hit. There is a
wide divergence between <span class=SpellE><i>Kismat</i></span><i> </i>and <i>Dr.
<span class=SpellE>Kotnis</span>, </i>or <span class=SpellE><i>Devadas</i></span><i>
</i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Barsaat</i></span><i>, </i>or <span class=SpellE><i>Anarkali</i></span><i>
</i>and <i>Do <span class=SpellE>Bigha</span> <span class=SpellE>Zamin</span>, </i>all
produced within the last twenty years; and yet at different periods of time
these were tremendous box-office successes. Almost at the same time <span
class=SpellE><i>Manzil</i></span><i> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Adhikar</i></span><i>,
<span class=SpellE>Ameree</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Dharti-ki-lal</i></span><i>
</i>or even <span class=SpellE>Minoo</span> <span class=SpellE>Masani’s</span> <i>Our
India </i>failed at the counter, though in many ways they echoed the problems
of the common man more directly and with greater energy. The vagaries of the
public taste have been very uncertain, so far as really good films were
concerned, I mean good technically, though a certain type of romantic or sexy
films almost uniformly succeeded. Miss <span class=SpellE>Panna</span> Shah has
shown that 46.1% of our films had love themes and a perusal of the list of
box-office films would yield the most unexpected conclusions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
has induced some of our <span class=SpellE>publicmen</span> and educationists
to believe that the Indian cinema is creating, in the minds of the adolescent
and the young, certain desires and passions which the cinema alone can satisfy.
But this seems to be a hasty and, perhaps, unwarranted conclusion and one might
almost retort, in the words of J.A. Wilson that “the cinema, in many ways the
dominant art of our time, has become–because of its nature–a mirror of the
community in which it is produced.” The films that we see in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> have a
vital relation to the society from which they spring, and a close scrutiny of
their themes and problems would surely be revelatory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before I proceed to relate our films to our society, it is necessary to draw
attention to the nature of the film art and its commercial development. What
Paul <span class=SpellE>Rotha</span> wrote of the film trade in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> holds so true of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> that I
cannot resist the temptation of quoting him <i>in <span class=SpellE><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It
is a matter of common observation that the cinema has been developed as an
industry on lines similar to those obtaining in any other branch of modern
manufacture. That is to say its guiding factor has been production for private
profit...The fact that it supplies entertainment on a wide basis, coupled with
its mechanical ability for repeated performances at little extra cost beyond
the original outlay on production, has naturally meant that all the
paraphernalia of mass production...has been introduced in an attempt to make
the cinema today conform with other large-scale manufacturing
processes...Because it offers the opportunity for making profit on a big scale,
film production proceeds on an economic policy of quick receipts in a short
period of time...Such methods...have inevitably led to inflated wages, often
far in excess<i> </i>of the exchange value of the actual work performed, and to
the fabric of ballyhoo maintained to keep the public ‘film conscious’. As a
cultural result, film stars have become the mythology of the twentieth century;
film factories the modern <st1:place w:st="on">Parnassus</st1:place>.” (Paul <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
impact of this attitude on the movie-makers as well as the movie-goers of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has been <span
class=GramE>specially</span> great. While the stars, taking advantage of their
rather easy popularity, go on increasing their remuneration, the film trade
continues to appeal in an ever increasing degree to the minimum intellectual
value that coincides with the common factor of public thought. The trade has so
accurately measured the public taste “that even stories in turn have been
reduced to a limited set, each with its appeal formula <span class=SpellE>analysed</span>
and tabulated”. To what extent certain types of stories and themes are being
constantly exploited would be apparent from Miss <span class=SpellE>Panna</span>
Shah’s excellent analysis. On an examination of 603 Indian films exhibited in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> from 1935 to 1946,
she found that love stories constituted the bulk of the total films, varying
from the lowest figure of 36.8% in 1938 to 54.5 in 1943 and 57.4% in 1941.
Histories and biographies and comedies come next with 8.4% and 8.1%
respectively. Mythological stories only form 7.8% of the total output. Of the
278 love stories parental love was the theme only of thirteen films.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

“In the Indian films 60% of the heroines were between the ages of 15 and 20,
35% were between 21 and 30, and 5% between 31 and 40. Of the heroes 95% were
between 20 and 30, and 5% between 31 and 40. Not a single hero or heroine was
above the age of 40.” “Of the Indian heroes and heroines 20% and 70%
respectively had no occupation, 35% heroes and 25% heroines were in some
profession and 5% heroines were on the stage. The occupation of the remaining
45% heroes in the order of importance was either criminal, agricultural,
business, student, personal service, military or government service. As regards
their economic status, 62% heroes and 38.1% heroines were wealthy, 23.8% heroes
and 33.3% heroines were moderately well off, 9.5% heroes and 33.3% heroines
were poor while 4.8 heroes and 9.5 % heroines were ultra-wealthy”. “Of
the...Indian films 95% of the locales were entirely in India and only 5% showed
any foreign country. Of the settings 40% were entirely urban, 35% rural and 25%
partly urban. About 20.6% of the residences shown were houses, while only 5.9%
were huts; 53.3% of the residences belonged to the well-to-do classes, 26.6% to
the poor and 20% to the middle classes.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Shah has not told us what percentage of stories in films have no locale, with
just a certain type of external and internal shots creating the background. In
many a film one can find the same lake, the same garden, the same tree trunk
and even the same shivering moon. In a similar manner it will be worthwhile
knowing how many <span class=SpellE><i>chota</i></span>-versions of <span
class=SpellE><i>Kismat</i></span><i> </i>or <span class=SpellE><i>Khazanchi</i></span><i>

</i>have been made more or less <span class=SpellE>modelled</span> on the same
story, the same incidents, even the same tunes used for the songs. On an
examination of about 100 films made during the last two years I find that about
53.7% repeat themes and episodes used earlier, while about 49.4% use themes and
episodes from foreign films without the necessary acknowledgement. The modern <span
class=SpellE><i>Aurat</i></span><i> </i>is only a blazing instance. The
boy-meets-girl story, the
rich-man’s-son-falling-in-love-with-a-not-so-rich-man’s-daughter-who-has-no-mother-alive
theme, they-lived-happily-thereafter formula: all these have been exploited
almost to the point of exhaustion. An analysis of some of the dramatic devices
used in Indian films will be yet more startling. Miss Shah writes: “Forty per
cent of the heroes and heroines were previously acquainted, engaged or married,
while 60% were not<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

who were not previously acquainted 83.3% had an accidental or unusual meeting
without a formal introduction, while 16.6% had an ordinary or usual meeting
with a formal introduction.” “It was found that while 50% showed either love at
first sight or love after a few meetings, about 25%…showed love as a slow
growth. Ten per cent of the leading characters were either in love or engaged
before the picture opened, 15% were stories of married life. 70% of the
characters were married only once while 25% were married more than once.”</span><span

array of figures that have been quoted above do surely make a despairing
situation to a casual critic. But once attention is paid to the exact nature of<i>
</i>the world we are living in India and to the fact that foreign films yet
continue to be our ideals to copy, the statistics will be self-explanatory. The
real enquiry must therefore lie elsewhere, in finding out to what extent the
modern adolescent and the modern youth look up to the life in the movies as the
‘ideal’ life. Herbert <span class=SpellE>Blumer</span> in his <i>Movies and
Conduct </i>has written: “From such pictures they are likely to derive the
ideas of freedom of<i> </i>relation to parents, and of conduct towards one’s
associates. In this way motion pictures give <i>sanction</i> to codes of
conduct and serve as an instrument for introducing the individual into a new
kind and art of life.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
measure the nature and extent of<i> </i>this influence it is therefore
necessary that we now consider the Indian films according to their themes. The
first full length Indian film was a mythological <span class=SpellE><i>Harischandra</i></span><i>
</i>(1913) in which no attempt was made to reinterpret the legend in terms of
modern thought. But the first talkie <span class=SpellE><i>Alamara</i></span><i>
</i>(1931) and the subsequent <span class=SpellE><i>Shirin</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Ferhaud</span>, The King of <span class=SpellE>Ayodhya</span>,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Jalti</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nihan</span> </i>and others verged on<i> </i>socio-romantic themes
even if they did not discuss a social problem seriously. <span class=SpellE><i>Bharat-ki-beti</i></span><i>
</i>(1935) placed the accent on<i> </i>national feelings interwoven in a
society dominated by a foreign power: <span class=SpellE><i>Puran</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Bhakt</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Chandidas</i></span><i>
</i>were highly imaginative in their treatment of<i> </i>religious themes, with
a clear emphasis on<i> </i>secular ideas. <span class=SpellE>Barua’s</span>
epoch-making <span class=SpellE><i>Devadas</i></span><i> </i>was a film version
of<i> </i><span class=SpellE>Saratchandra’s</span> novel of<i> </i>the same
name and had as its motif the degenerating morals of<i> </i>the <span
class=SpellE>zamindar</span>; the once famous <span class=SpellE><i>Dhupchaon</i></span><i>
</i>wove a highly romantic gossamer against <span class=SpellE>modernised</span>
society. Subsequently getting the clue from some of<i> </i>these some mediocre
directors tried to extend the range of<i> </i>their choice by dealing with
various kinds of<i> </i>subjects. A few<i> </i>films were frankly propagandist
while the majority of<i> </i>the others were almost directly romantic, thriving
on ridiculously amorous episodes. But in all cases the various phases of<i> </i>Indian
society came in as the background, and these aspects could in most cases be
clearly distinguished from the main motifs. One can find for<i> </i>instance
the acute social problem of<i> </i>dowry and caste system, of social boycott,
and of the <span class=SpellE>westernised</span> girl, reflected in the various
films that were made in the late thirties or the early forties. The caste
system with its attendant evils had been the main, issue considered in films
like <span class=SpellE>Prabhat’s</span> <span class=SpellE><i>Dharmatma</i></span><i>,

in 1935 also gave a reinterpretation to the crusade against untouchability that
Mahatma <span class=SpellE>Eknath</span> led four hundred years ago. An equally
large variety of films were evoked by the dowry system, showing its impact on
the girl-wife, on her parents, and on society as a whole. The most artistically
successful film dealing with this theme was <span class=SpellE><i>Dahez</i></span><i>

effect of unequal mating caused by marriage between parties that never knew
each other, often pointing to the physical and economic consequences of early
marriage. But the treatment was ‘<span class=SpellE>romanticised</span>’ by
depicting the horrible state of child widows who either ‘fell’ or went into the
clutches of evil persons or became just emotional non-entities. A few of the
more successful films like New Theatres’ <span class=SpellE><i>Barididi</i></span><i>

impact of Western ideas and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>manners on Indian life. In fact the
nature of this impact has been considerably determined by the Hollywood films,
many of whose episodes and incidents developed in lavish sets and gorgeous
displays are reproduced in out films almost wholesale, unmindful of the fact
that their social conventions are different from ours. The appearance of the <span
class=SpellE>westernised</span> hero, attired in the western style and smoking
incessantly, has become a common feature of many Indian films. It also remains
a curious fact, to adapt the words of Lynton Hudson, “that the term
‘sex-appeal’ one of the many vulgar neologisms of Hollywood creation, has come
into universal currency and been adopted….into almost every tongue, at the
moment when Woman and her guide and mentor Fashion had for the first time in
(Indian) history discarded the principal element that had served her most
faithfully throughout the centuries: Mystery.” The fanciful costuming of some
of the modern Indian films, coupled with the greater exposure of the feminine
body and the now strong demand for a kiss being shown on the Indian screen, are
all manifestations of Hollywood culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it was not easy to pass the <span class=SpellE>Anglicised</span> Indian in
Indian society, as we know from the many films which had shown how the
conservative Indian society refused to accept such men into their fold. All the
same the story of a father sacrificing his all for an I.C.S. son-in-law, the
use of drinking and ballroom dancing in Indian homes, the dialogues replete
with English words and phrases, the new ideas relating to free love and
companionate marriage, the educated girl’s search for complete freedom, the
decreasing emphasis on marriage as a sacrament, the popularity of courtship or
prenuptial acquaintance, the young man’s desire for an ultra-modern wife who is
not expected to pay any attention to household work, the frequent escapades and
parties and dinners in the western style, and the dash and speed with which
Indian heroines leave their guardians and go through all kinds of
adventures–all these are so commonplace in Indian films that I need not cite
examples to illustrate them. A close perusal of the file of the <i>Times of
India </i>or the <i>Screen </i>or the <span class=SpellE><i>Filmfare</i></span><i>
</i>would be convincing enough. The indirect effect of this approach is evident
in those films where a rich man’s son falls in love with another man’s
daughter, who can easily go out with the hero in a manner not customary in
India. In fact one would always find that the girl either should have no mother
or she should walk at it and get away at the right moment. Even a street girl
may be lifted by a hero and reformed into a society lady <i>a la </i>(Shavian) <i>Pygmalion.
</i>The stress on the liberty of the modern educated girl who goes in search of
various jobs under the most <span class=SpellE>unfavourable</span> situations

forgot to lend artistic treatment to the theme and ended with melodramatic sob

born of rational bankruptcy caused by an over- emphasis on certain destructive
values. While providing entertainment they propagated an easy-going life summed
up in the two phrases ‘Live, Love and Laugh’ and ‘Wine, Woman and Song’. The
gaiety was driven to the point of neurasthenia as wine and prostitution came to

fact that most of the themes of the films mentioned above were lost in the too
romantic depiction of the heroes or the heroines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“In
the Indian films “, wrote Miss <span class=SpellE>Panna</span> Shah “72 per
cent of the leading character; were guided by individual motives, 16.3 per cent
by personal and 11.6per cent by social aims. Of the individual goals 38.7 per
cent characters were concerned with winning someone’s love, 29 per cent with
marriage for love, 19.4 per cent with personal happiness and security while the
rest were concerned with such aims as professional success, obtaining money to
lead a gay life, desire for an heir or search for an ideal character. More
heroines than heroes sought for personal goals...” Not only this; the leading
character is often restless and breaks away from the social conventions to
grasp life as he imagines it, but the conventions prove so strong that the
erstwhile rebel is ultimately forced either into submission or to suicide. It
is during this period of revolt that he launches on some of the most
extravagant plans including those that tend to crime. This gives considerable
opportunities to the capitalist producer who can work them up efficiently, and
the total effect of the film remains that of the culture of the ego on a scale
that does not agree with the new demand on society. The jumbled up inner vision
is given an extension not known to the average Indian and the dilemma which the
hero faces is more personal than social. It is true that once a while society
creeps into the play, but nevertheless the tragedy of the Indian film hero is the
tragedy of the street made glamorous by the costly star-system as is evident
from the number of films which refer to the figurative ‘travel’ or ‘<span
class=SpellE>traveller</span>’ going away ‘<span class=SpellE>remote..very</span>
far remote’ perhaps from reality. And during this ‘travel’ it is of course
necessary that the hero should go against authoritarian discipline, either by
refusing to accept the positive values of life or by a failure to form new
ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
this, of course, as J. A. Wilson wrote in <i>The Cinema,’ 52</i>, the
capitalist-producer is partly responsible. “Capitalism, someone has said, does
not challenge art in principle–it merely treats it with ignorance, indifference
and unconscious cruelty. The supremacy of the destructive over the
constructive, the failure to make peace exciting, a prurient curiosity about
the details of violence, a denial of tragedy: these are a few symptoms of
capitalist patronage as evinced in the cinema.” This is remarkably true of
India, as our films predominate with stories of the more <span class=SpellE>favoured</span>
social groups and <span class=SpellE>emphasise</span> the problem of the single
and the young, the anti-social and the dreamy. In fact the revolt of the
individual referred to earlier is of a dreamy nature, born out of a desire to
escape from the grave dissatisfaction with the present day society and seeking
relief in what is called pictorial wish- fulfillment. The new realism that has
appeared in the Indian film, even if it is partially the outcome of foreign
influence, is but a hopeful emergence from a state of emotional chaos caused by
the willingness to work for an ideal more substantial than mere lovemaking. The
sense of honesty and responsibility that the out-witted peasant displays in <i>Do
<span class=SpellE>Bigha</span> <span class=SpellE>Zamin</span> </i>is
indicative of the new urge, though that itself remains to be fulfilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was but natural therefore that the Film Enquiry Committee laid so much stress
on the “important cultural and social significance and, as such, a very
formative role” of the film in India. The Indian film of tomorrow should not
only provide us with a knowledge of the world in which we live but should also
create the values by which we live; its sociological content and artistic
excellence should be worthy of the cultural tradition </span><span

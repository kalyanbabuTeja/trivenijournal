style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
purposeful man always draws attention. Sometimes he even draws more attention
to himself than to his purpose. A literary man who represents a social or
political cause serves that cause more ably the more able he is as a man of
letters. The Telugu language has had its small share of purposeful literary
writing. There has been no more purposeful and no more able literary writing in
Andhra, representing social causes, than the work of Veeresalingam. The New Age
in Telugu Literature almost began with him. He was a man of heroic dimensions,
with an intense belief in the causes he championed, whether within the narrow
limits of his municipal borough or in the wider arena of social discontent. And
it, strikes me that, if he could not have fought his causes with literary
weapons, he would still have fought them–with other weapons! If, in fact, he
did not fight with other weapons! For it is on record that he had a select band
of followers who were not exactly liveried men of literature, who achieved for
him in the battlefields of social emancipation what meek men of the Muses could
never have achieved. If Veeresalingam was a man of the Muses, he certainly was
not meek. He awes us even now by the magnitude of his social courage. The
Spirit of Time spoke <span class=GramE>bravely</span> through him. On certain
planes he moved men in Andhra to think and act as it was given to no man before
him or after: not even to Gandhiji. As a man of purpose his achievements were
immense and varied. But, here comes the difference, as a man of letters his
achievements were not nearly as great.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is just as well to admit this fact. There was <span class=SpellE>Gurazada</span>
<span class=SpellE>Apparao</span>. There was <span class=SpellE>Gidugu</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ramamurty</span>. There was even <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarthi</span>
<span class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> <span class=SpellE>Narasimham</span>. These
three men, each in his different way, represented the literary cause more
completely and more distinctly than <span class=GramE>Veeresalingam,</span>
though all the other three must have shared largely the latter’s social beliefs
and disbeliefs. But, judged as literary men, their stature is greater. The
literary output of <span class=SpellE>Gurazada</span> <span class=SpellE>Apparao</span>,
including the play, <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>, </i>is
perhaps not a twentieth part in bulk of the literary output of Veeresalingam.
But the mellifluous and new-patterned verses of <span class=SpellE>Apparao</span>,
his simple and elegant prose, and the characters of Gireesam and <span
class=SpellE>Madhuravani</span> in <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>
</i>are the more authentic beginnings of the modern age in Telugu Literature,
compared to which the fables, the essays, the stories, the novels, the dramas,
and even the <span class=SpellE><i>Prahasanas</i></span><i> </i>of
Veeresalingam seem as classic and cold and distant in time as ancient Rome. <span
class=SpellE>Gidugu</span> <span class=SpellE>Ramamurty</span>, it might seem
to the indifferent, is of greater significance to the Telugu language than to
Telugu literature, but of him it can be said more truly than of any other
literary man in Andhra of the past sixty years and more that, without him and
his work as a linguist, there could have been nothing like a renaissance in
Telugu literature. Language is not just the garb but is the soul of literature.
<span class=SpellE>Gidugu</span> <span class=SpellE>Ramamurty</span>, by
espousing the cause of <span class=SpellE><i>Vyavaharika</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Bhasha</span>, </i>the spoken tongue, saved the Telugu language
for the Telugu people. <span class=SpellE>Chilakamathi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> <span class=SpellE>Narasimham</span> wrote more
original dramas and more original novels than Veeresalingam. <span
class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> <span class=SpellE>Narasimham</span> lacked <span
class=SpellE>Veeresalingam’s</span> incisive <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>,
and he also lacked what one might venture to call <span class=SpellE>Veeresalingam’s</span>
malice against evil. But <span class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> <span class=SpellE>Narasimham’s</span>
playful good <span class=SpellE>humour</span> was all his own, and his sense of
<span class=SpellE>humour</span> was perhaps as useful a social instrument as <span
class=SpellE>Veeresalingam’s</span> seeming vindictiveness. The real literary
difference, however, between the two writers is best expressed by saying that
in <span class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> <span class=SpellE>Narasimham’s</span>
novel, <span class=SpellE><i>Ramachandra</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Vijayam</span>,
</i>the classic <span class=SpellE><i>Prabandha</i></span><i> </i>age is
half-melted to the modern age, whereas in <span class=SpellE>Veeresalingam’s</span>
<span class=SpellE><i>Rajasekhara</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Charitram</span>
</i>the <span class=SpellE><i>Prabandha</i></span><i> </i>age is still hard and
unyielding. <span class=SpellE><i>Rajasekhara</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Charitram</span>
</i>takes us back and across to Goldsmith’s <i>Vicar of Wakefield </i>on which
the novel is <span class=SpellE>modelled</span>, whereas <span class=SpellE><i>Ramachandra</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Vijayam</span> </i>is the beginning of the quest of the
modern Telugu story-writer seeking life here and today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Judged
as literature with a defined social purpose, <span class=SpellE>Gurazada</span>
<span class=SpellE>Apparao’s</span> play, <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>,
</i>calls for comment. I am not ashamed to confess that I am one of those
lovers of the characters of Gireesam and <span class=SpellE>Madhuravani</span>,
who regret that these sterling literary creations, and particularly Gireesam,
should have been sacrificed by the author to a social cause, and, in the
process, translated out of shape. This the author did to suit a drama to which
the social theme and the social purpose became more important than the
spontaneity of art that first created these characters. Gireesam, who in the
beginning bids fair to rank with the world’s best humorous creations for the
Telugus, dwindles into a mighty little man of virtue as the play progresses.
And to readers and audiences, the play <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>
</i>in truth dwindles as Gireesam dwindles. Shakespeare dealt more kindly with <span
class=SpellE>Falstaff</span> when he closed the theme with <span class=SpellE>Falstaff</span>
babbling of green fields after Prince Hal’s repudiation of the old man. To
some, however, like my able and gifted friend, <span class=SpellE>Abburi</span>
Ramakrishna Rao, who more than once produced <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>
</i>more<i> </i>than slightly edited, the play really begins where Gireesam
ends. For, my friend discovered the truth that, to the real drama of <span
class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>, </i>with all its intricate
machinations and confusions and, be it said, its defined social themes of
bride-purchase, widow-remarriage and reclamation of prostitutes, Gireesam, the
nearest approach we have in Telugu literature to <span class=SpellE>Falstaff</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Pickwick</span>, was but an obstacle on the producer’s
stage, viciously drawing attention to himself and to his wit when the producer
was anxious to draw his audience to the theme of<i> </i>the play and to the
other (to him) really important characters. And so my friend <span
class=SpellE>Abburi</span> Ramakrishna <span class=GramE>Rao,</span> eliminated
Gireesam as far as he possibly could in the production of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
play. In this elimination of Gireesam, Ramakrishna Rao did nothing more than
complete that unfortunate process to which the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>playwright
himself got committed in his parallel enthusiasm for the social cause: the
process of sacrificing his great creature to his little theme. And audiences
who love the play as it begins, only because of Gireesam and <span
class=SpellE>Madhuravani</span> whom they meet in the first scenes, get
impatient, in spite of my friend <span class=SpellE>Abburi</span> Ramakrishna
Rao, when the early <span class=SpellE>humour</span> subsides to give place to
a very complex and very second-rate drama, in which all the fun around <span
class=SpellE>Ramappa</span> <span class=SpellE>Pantulu</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Lubdhavadhanulu</span> does not really vary the monotony: except
for a straggling short while in the scene in which <span class=SpellE>Madhuravani</span>
laughs long and pitilessly (as only <span class=SpellE>Sthanam</span> Narasimha
Rao, acting as <span class=SpellE>Madhuravani</span>, can laugh) while <span
class=SpellE>Ramappa</span> <span class=SpellE>Pantulu</span> reads out <span
class=SpellE>Gireesam’s</span> famous letter to <span class=SpellE>Lubdhavadhanulu</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Coming
to a later stage in Telugu literature, skipping the phase in which <span
class=SpellE>Unnava</span> <span class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> Narayana gave us
the first powerful Telugu novel, <span class=SpellE><i>Malapalli</i></span><i>,
</i>and <span class=SpellE>Rayaprolu</span> <span class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rao
gave us melodious songs of peace and patriotism (and no more), and <span
class=SpellE>Nanduri</span> <span class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rao gave us his
immortal songs, <span class=SpellE><i>Yenki</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Patalu</span>,
</i>and <span class=SpellE>Adivi</span> <span class=SpellE>Bapiraju</span>
created his fine fantasies in song and prose: the most dominant figure,
perhaps, as a writer, and, if not the most dominant, certainly the most
representative, was the poet Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span>. Some
would probably like to say that the story-teller <span class=SpellE>Gudipati</span>
<span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span> was the most dominant writer of that
period. Some others would probably like to reserve that <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
to the poet Viswanatha <span class=SpellE>Satyanarayana</span>. ‘There is no
denying, however, that Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> was the
forerunner of a literary cult, whereas the other two achieved their stature in
isolation. Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> produced very few verses
and songs, but in the <span class=SpellE>geneology</span> of letters, which
takes in contemporary writers, he had a plentiful progeny which held the
parental example in veneration. <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Satyanarayana</span> were comparatively childless in letters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
these three, <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span> was as great a fighter of
social battles as Veeresalingam was before him, but the former fought for ideas
that would have shocked the latter. The ideas were invariably very modern, and
sometimes also very absurd. <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span> wanted ‘<span
class=GramE>progress’</span> only in the sense that in an intensely personal
way he was all discontent for whatever was. It was his major failing that he
could not see the direction of progress. And being as impulsive as he was
‘progressive’, and as impatient as he was impractical, he ended up as a social
anarchist. His powerful writing, which lacks only in analysis and perspective,
destroyed not merely what ought to be destroyed, but more often what ought not
to be destroyed, and always threw confusion round what never ought to be
confused. A generation hence, when the evil of his influence on the socially
immature might come to be of less </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>moment, or almost
forgotten, he might rank among Telugu writers with Veeresalingam, and be
remembered for the <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> with which </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
fought for the right of women to their own emotional life, and it cannot be
gainsaid that when he fought for it he fought in the direction of ‘progress’.
But <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span> cannot relish being classed with
Veeresalingam. And, what is more important, Veeresalingam had not in him that
great craftsmanship and art of modern writing of which <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span>
is an acknowledged master, he being our best and biggest writer of the century
in Telugu prose up to now. <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span>, however, is
not representative. He is just unique.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so unique, perhaps, but still just as unrepresentative, is Viswanatha <span

place, and his novels are an unorthodox concoction mixed of poetry and
philosophy, nearly eschewing <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span> and
theme, and this is true in a lesser measure of <span class=SpellE>Bapiraju</span>,
but it is as a poet that Viswanatha <span class=SpellE>Satyanarayana</span> has
a lasting niche in Telugu literature, and even his worst critics do not deny
him this recognition. For the sheer force and Vedic finish of his vocabulary
and phrasing, he is a poet. There is a fine fury in his words, though readers
like me, unfamiliar with the fountain source of Sanskrit, might sometimes cry
out with Desdemona:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

some would say he was, he certainly is not its protagonist, and he has nothing
valuable to contribute to modern ‘progressive’ thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> as a poet. But Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span>
in his later years decided to be more than a poet; or, which is the same, less
of a poet; or, to be perfectly candid, no poet at all: and Krishna <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> when he is not a poet happens to be a very
‘progressive’ thinker. Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> might very well
quote his contemporary, <span class=SpellE>Harindranath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chattopadhyaya</span>, and tell us that he has “ceased to be the
poet” and “learnt to be the song.” But, if that be so, we have luckily little
to do with the song that is his later life. Concerning ourselves only with the
magnificent verses that he wrote–“alas, too few”–it must be said that the music
and the magic of them are hard to beat in any literature. And the way he
lingers over sounds and words and phrases, caressing them like a lover, shows
him as being not just a poet, but one of the makers of modern Telugu, steeped
in all the finest traditions of the language: barring, perhaps, the manly and
the heroic, which he may be said to have left to Viswanatha <span class=SpellE>Satyanarayana</span>
to cultivate. Saying all this is not, however, saying that Krishna <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> is a progressive writer, in the sense that the
writer’s thought as seen in his literary work is socially or politically
progressive. More than a decade ago, when I had the doubtful privilege of having
to preside over proceedings in Madras that initiate what probably still lingers
as the Andhra Branch of the Progressive Writers’ Association, I was both amused
and pained to hear one of the more ‘progressive’ speakers claim that Krishna <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> was a ‘progressive’ poet merely because, as a poet,
he discarded the <span class=SpellE><i>Prabandha</i></span><i> </i>habit of
describing woman in the nude. The speaker was obviously referring to the fact
that Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> started the tradition of
describing woman as a formless fancy of the poet’s brain. That Krishna <span
class=SpellE>Sastry’s</span> one fundamental failing as a poet, his lack of
robustness, should have been the target for praise was a sad commentary on the
commentator. Forgetting woman in the nude is not necessarily a sign of
progress. D. H. Lawrence did not forget woman in the nude, and he was not
calling back the Dark Ages. <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover </i>may be nudity with a
purpose, in a sense in which the descriptions of nudity in <i>Manu <span
class=SpellE>Charitra</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Vasu</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Charitra</span> </i>are not. But the formless fancies of Krishna <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> are themselves socially purposeless, and
purposelessness should be reckoned a literary sin (by those who reckon sins!)
whether in the description of woman as nude or in the description of woman as
formless. In fact, there could be no more purposeless writing, from the social
viewpoint, than the songs and verses of Krishna <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span>.
He is as purposeless as Veeresalingam was purposeful. There is no social
content in his literary work, no awareness of a social order or disorder. If
any single literary man in Andhra could be charged with the offence of having
led literature away from corporate life, away from social reality, away from
every healthy contact with live fellow human beings, that writer is Krishna <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span>!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

himself Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span>. Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span> is
a modern. He is the sport of all the winds that blow. Deep as his roots are in
the great literature that belongs to him and to which he belongs, he is not
really fond of the roots. He is even suspicious of them. He would rather that
Telugu literature was not a tree with root and branch, but a mansion with many
rooms that could be lifted and placed in the heart of any modern city of
Europe, America or Asia, without changing scene or changing habit. When I
contemplate his latter-day trends, I think of him as of a mighty tree trying to
twist itself away from its roots in order to feed on air. Sri <span
class=SpellE>Sri</span>, the author of stirring threnodies like <span

a valiant youth, on the verge of manhood, eagerly in search of the meaning of
life as a poet. Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span>, the so-called surrealist, is
that manhood attained, without the poet’s <span class=SpellE>realisation</span>
of the meaning of life, and he almost ashamed of the eagerness and the <span

is the curse of our times that the world is changing too fast to preserve the
realities of mental growth by the certainties of gradualness. There is growth
but no gradualness in Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span>. A growth that is not
gradual is generally a <span class=SpellE>tumour</span>. It is outside the
anatomy of life. Sri Sri’s Dadaist and Freudian extravaganzas are tumors on his
literary being. Surrealism, the world over, has been a protest in all arts, and
mostly in sculpture, painting and literature, against the hideousness of
realism, or against the horror of its inevitability even when it is not
hideous. But surrealists were realists first, or should have been. In sculpture
and painting, at any rate, the adventures in surrealism were attempted by
artists who were already masters of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>realistic art. To a great extent this is true even of the surrealist of
literature. T. S. Eliot’s strength was that, at the least in the maintenance of
the outer fashions and forms of literature, he could have been a Browning or a
Tennyson if he wanted, but did not want to be. Surrealism has, no doubt, <span
class=SpellE>travelled</span> far from Picasso and Epstein and Ezra Pound and
T. S. Eliot, but the farther it travels from realism the more it loses its
truest significance, namely, its emphasis through discontent on the limitations
of realism in art. Taking the example of English literature, surrealist
tortuousness and Freudian incoherencies might well follow in the wake of
Victorian realism and Victorian volubility as a sheer reaction against the
surfeit of realistic art. Distortion and incoherency, unprovoked and
deliberate, are unforgivable in all serious art. There is every difference in
the world between, on the one hand, a disciplined patient before a
psychiatrist, purposefully expressing, or being made to express, his immediate
inmost thought, albeit incoherently, in an attempt to regain the equilibrium of
life, and, on the other hand, an utterly mad man, loitering outside the pale of
reasoning humanity, who has no battle in him to go back to poise, and who
mutters because he must, and not because he intends to help either himself or
others. Freud was a scientist: nay, more than a scientist, the creator of a
science. Surrealists who pretend to be Freudian insult Freud and his science.
Such aberrations of surrealism in art might have crept in as literary <i>ennui </i>into
the mature world of English or French literature, which, while abounding in
realistic forms, touches an exhaustion as a very phase of its fullness. It is a

and repulsive realism, preceded for a half-century this surrealist <i>ennui? </i>None
whatever of abiding worth. Or, at any rate, very little. Quality, as the
answer, fails. But, worse than quality, quantity fails too. For, Telugu literature
has yet to manifest itself to some purpose in the most elementary forms of
realistic art before it can boast of being tired of tears and laughter, or seek
to imitate the great literatures of Europe in their vexed repose. Surrealism is
largely a natural if undesirable phenomenon in the literatures of the West.
Surrealism in languages like Telugu is an utterly unnatural imitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In dealing with Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span>
there is one other point that requires to be emphasized. Surrealism, by its
very character, cannot be progressive. Progress belongs to the realm of
realities. It is a measure of social growth, the growth of a social order from
stature to stature. It is matter for statistical or qualitative <span
class=SpellE>apprisement</span>. It is real. Surrealism is unreal. It is a
device of distortion in the realm of art. It does not seek either to contribute
to the growth of social order or to influence it. Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span>,
the latter-day surrealist, cannot, therefore, claim, or be claimed, to belong
to a class of ‘ progressive’ writers in Andhra, if any such exists.</p>

with <span class=SpellE>Narla</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Narla’s</span>

of his delightfully <span class=SpellE>humourous</span> plays, achieved an
abandon and a spontaneity of wit that recall the Restoration Drama in English
literature. But in <span class=SpellE>Narla</span>, again, like in <span
class=SpellE>Galsworthy</span>, there is no abandon at all, and no wit that
scintillates on the mere surface of life. In his <span class=SpellE>chiselled</span>
little plays, men and women move on the stage, dignified in joy and in sorrow,
in peace and in conflict, in greatness and even in meanness, with a restraint
almost unbelievable in art, undistorted by <span class=SpellE>Dickensian</span>
exuberance or <span class=SpellE>Dostoievskian</span> gloom. <span
class=SpellE>Narla’s</span> achievements are those of an artistic mind
completely disciplined. He appears dull only to those who have not studied the
great value of restraint in art. <span class=SpellE>Narla</span> is modern,
unquestionably so. But is <span class=SpellE>Narla</span> ‘progressive’? <span
class=SpellE>Narla</span> was progressive in the Telugu literature of the
nineteen forties because <span class=SpellE>Narla</span> brought to Telugu
writing qualities it sadly lacked during the <span class=SpellE><i>Sahithi</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Samithi</span> </i>decades: dignity, balance, and an
author’s consistency. But <span class=SpellE>Narla</span> is not ‘progressive’
in the sense of interpreting Marx through literature, or of <span class=SpellE>analysing</span>
the social order or of <span class=SpellE>theorising</span> it by means of the
drama, or of illustrating the politics of the hour in the propaganda of the
hour. To him literature is life, not politics or the science of politics,
though, without flinching in social perspective, he shows us the world of
today, born out of the world of yesterday,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>and growing into the world of tomorrow. <span class=SpellE>Unnava</span>
<span class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayana’s</span> novel, <span
class=SpellE><i>Malapalli</i></span><i>, </i>was a stirring record of
contemporary life. <span class=SpellE>Narla’s</span> plays are a correct record
of present-day situations. Live men and women, dealing on their own with plain
personal problems, are his theme. But they sprawl out of their problems into
the total vastness that is life. His men and their problems are not fixed with
a date or filled with a creed. We get to know them in the same attitude of
reality and <span class=SpellE>unsurprise</span> with which we meet the
certainties of every day. If this is being ‘progressive’, he is undoubtedly
‘progressive.’ But that is all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

truth has been that <span class=SpellE>Kutumbarao</span>, quite like <span
class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span>, cares very much for himself, and very little
for the writer’s throne. His own personal mental processes always meant more to
him than his refined and acknowledged creative art, which is of a very high
order. In his earlier work as a writer of stories, he had always a very peculiar
approach as his technique. His earlier stories did not grow out of his men and
women, but his men and women grew into his earlier stories. His later stories
reveal a brilliant sense of <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span>, and his
art today is almost perfect in that department. But in the beginning he always
had an object; usually a very valid object, almost invariably a very pleasing
object, artistically speaking, in writing a story which had to conclude in a
particular way, on a particular intellectual or emotional note: and his
characters incessantly obliged him! Literature to him in those days, and it is
sometimes so even now, nearly always illustrated a point view of the author or
paved the way to a conclusion already reached by the author. As rarely as
Shelley’s Spirit of Delight came, in those days, from this most gifted and most
persistent of the story-writers in Andhra today, a magnificent creation or two
like <span class=SpellE><i>Neekemi</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Kavaali</span>?
</i>in which the characters mattered more than the theme, and the theme more
than the conclusion. It was, however, an exception, not the rule. When,
therefore, more than a decade ago, the Progressive Writers’ Movement swept
across Andhra <span class=SpellE>Desa</span>, ably guided by another friend of
mine who was then a Communist political worker with an intense belief in
purposeful literature, <span class=SpellE>Kutumbarao</span>, I guess, must have
felt at last that he had found his soul in art, for he meant now to seek a
political and economic creed to work his characters into. The result, or at
least the immediate result, was <span class=SpellE><i>Arunodayam</i></span><i> </i>which
is the most distressingly immature work up to date of <span class=SpellE>Kutumbarao</span>.
He wrote excellent stories before. He wrote even more excellent stories
there-after. In between came this half-hearted, unsuccessful politico- literary
experiment which ended in a mess because film-producer <span class=SpellE>Nagaiah’s</span>
romantic twaddle, <span class=SpellE><i>Swargaseema</i></span><i>, </i>the film
story of which was the basis of <span class=SpellE><i>Arunodayam</i></span><i>,
</i>did not mix with unromantic twaddle about black-marketing and all that. <span

other writers who force their way to one’s mind, and who deserve very

intellectual school of Andhra writers, are <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span>,
who is Sri Sri’s nephew, <span class=SpellE>Palagummi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span> and <span class=SpellE>Somanchi</span> <span

class=SpellE>Migilethi</span> </i>is a great new effort in the realm of the
Telugu Novel of which any writer can be proud. But he and others like him, with
many merits of their own, do not slip into a school of writing. There is ‘<span
class=SpellE>Atreya</span>’, the very clever dramatist, who stands best in his
knowledge of stage-craft, and who has written several successful plays in prose
dealing with modern problems. But his cleverness does not quite touch the
intellectual level of the three whom I named. Of the three, <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span>
is a man of genius, and <span class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Yegganna</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> are men of
extraordinary talent. All the three have quick minds which react sensitively to
modern conditions and modern trends of life, though each reacts in a different
way. <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span> reacts as one of God’s own poets.
Compared to his uncle, Sri Sri, he concerns himself far more with the poet’s
regiment of thought than with the words and the music that march with the
thought. Word and sound are mere word and sound to him, and have no essential
significance by themselves. His only object is to project an idea. And the
words and their music care just the means to project the idea. Mostly his words
and their music are in sheer accord with his idea. But he himself does not seem
to bother. Word, sound and sense must mix to perfection for him just by
accident. He uses uncommon or grotesque words, picking them from any language
or dialect, in what seems almost an indecent hurry to proceed to write, but
never really is he uncommon or grotesque in thought or expression for the mere
fun of being so, without having as his ultimate purpose the victorious putting
across of a valid idea. In this he differs very much indeed from his otherwise
far more gifted uncle. For Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span>, when he is not
chaotic, is almost childishly simple. Sri Sri’s normal poems and songs are by
no means a canvas on which sheer intellect paints an elaborate motif. His
themes are usually emotional, and sometimes very elementarily so. His <span
class=SpellE><i>Maro</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Prapancham</span> </i>is
so elementary in its emotion, and so unguided by intellect, that in the end, if
one goes to the root of the song, one feels cheated, realising how much feeling
Sri <span class=SpellE>Sri</span> has exploited by sheer emotional and artistic
devices without so much as suggesting the object by which the feeling is to
sustain itself. <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span> strays into Telugu literature
as John <span class=SpellE>Donne</span> strayed into a world of sickly <span
class=SpellE>sonneteering</span>, and he stands out as the first real creative
protest of the artistic intellect against inartistic emotion in Telugu poetry.
Sad to say, the protest is only lodged, not quite pursued. One wishes he had
written more in his intellectual strain. The pity with him is that as a
creative artist he is not clear, consistent or complete. Possibly, there can be
no completeness of art when the artist is ruled largely by the intellect only.
Such an artist, half turned critic, usually stands outside life. He tends to
become impersonal, and after a time denies himself the benefit of
introspection. Introspection is seeking your own roots, and therefore, every
one else’s and all nature’s. The roots are emotion, not intellect.
Introspection implies one’s yielding to one’s emotional life, and one’s
exploring it unashamed and unafraid. When Shakespeare described, in seeming <span
class=SpellE>regretfulnees</span>, how he “gored his own thought” and “made
cheap what was most dear” to him, he meant that he was unashamed and unafraid
of his emotional life, or of the contribution made by his emotional life to his
life as an artist. The superior detachment of the intellectual artist is
sometimes no more than the shame and fear to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>yield to, and to
explore, his and everyone else’s emotions. The creative artist who is
disinclined to explore his emotional life is like a Christopher Columbus who
sails the seven seas but hates to set foot<i> </i>on unknown land. When a
creative artist is also a poet, and not a mere writer of prose, this inhibition
is almost disastrous to his art. <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span>, the poet,
wields an intellectual-artistic medium which can take in controversial social
and political thought and yet remain literature, but he has not so far made a
consistent attempt or such literature. Therein he has so far failed both the
cause of literature and the cause of progressive writing. He is, perhaps, the
one modern Telugu writer who need not have failed in the difficult region of

class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span> is essentially a writer of prose and a writer of
Stories. Barring <span class=SpellE>Yegganna</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span>,
he is the most cultured and the most balanced of the writers of his generation.
He has learning and perspective. His life as an artist is not just a matter of
individual idiosyncrasy. It is permeated by a sense of dignity and high
seriousness. The dignity is not the aloofness of a moral prude, and the<i> </i>seriousness
is not the sheer absence of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span>, like <span class=SpellE>Gurazada</span> <span
class=SpellE>Apparao</span>, whom he resembles in his efforts to raise the tone
of Telugu literature, tried to be many things, at his own level of achievement:
poet, dramatist and writer of stories. But it is as a writer of stories that he
has the superior claim to be noticed. His poems, which are hopelessly few,
share the intellectual quality of the poetry of <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span>,
but they lack the spontaneity of <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span>, and present
instead the <span class=SpellE>stanardized</span> impress of a factory. Of his
work as a dramatist, excluding his radio plays which are always pleasant and
nothing else besides, I am familiar with only one piece of his which
caricatured certain mediocrities of my home town and delighted certain other
mediocrities of my home town. To me that play of his illustrates his
deficiencies not only as a dramatist but even as a writer of stories: chiefly
an emotional incapacity to put himself in the place of another person. <span
class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span> is guided largely by his intellect alone, and he
is too severely himself to be another person even as an artist. To a very large
extent this defect proclaims itself in his stories. They are mostly told from
the outside, and by an outsider. The story-teller must always be hovering
about, and the characters do not speak. This is the reason why there is
generally a great deal of description and comment, and far too little dialogue,
in his stories. This is also the reason why his stories appeal only to the
extent to which they are a perfect intellectual appreciation of a situation,
and afford almost invariably no emotional satisfaction or emotional relief. His
all-world prize-story, <span class=SpellE><i>Gaalivaana</i></span><i>, </i>which
I, as one of the preliminary judges in Andhra <span class=SpellE>Desa</span>,
put first, is a perfect example of his fine qualities as a story-teller and of
his exact limitations. It was perhaps a seeking of the opposite quality of
emotion which drove him to translate into the Telugu language the heart-throbs
of <span class=SpellE>Turgenev</span>, which are like glittering crystals, when
he translated <i>Fathers and Sons, </i>and the primitive impulses of D. H.
Lawrence, which are like rugged rocks, when he translated <i>The Man Who Died.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
barring the capacity to depict emotion and all that the lack of that capacity
entails, there is hardly any other writer of stories today in the Telugu
language who can compete with <span class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span> in variety of
matter or versatility of manner. In him, besides, appears almost for the first
time in Telugu story-writing a truthful and sympathetic observation of village
life, albeit more or less from the angle of vision of the Brahmin community to
which he belongs. Very able and facile writers, like my talented friend, <span
class=SpellE>Gopichand</span>, who belong to the agricultural community and who
observe village life more comprehensively and more from its core, have written
extremely pleasing stories, with a comfortably firm local background, about
village life. Perhaps, to be able to give perfectly true and complete versions
of village life it is not enough even to belong to the agricultural community.
The disinherited, like the landless <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span> and the
landless laborers, among the other communities must have more to tell than the
well-born and the well-bred even among the agriculturist classes. No village
society is all of a piece. Its component elements cannot be truly integrated in
art except with the aid of the imagination. Belonging to the most important
element, the agriculturist land-owning class, is some advantage to the artist,
but it is not all. It does not help the understanding of all the sectors of
village life, apart or as a whole. Cutting across occupational divisions and
economic classes are divisions of caste and sub-caste; and the castes and the
sub-castes are so many that the fact of belonging to any one of them, when you
have no imagination, is just as unimportant or just as little helpful as the
fact of belonging to any other of them. The <span class=SpellE>Kamma</span>,
the Reddy and the <span class=SpellE>Kapu</span> of the village are nearly just
as familiar as the Brahmin of the village, and nearly just as unfamiliar too,
with the intricate details of the domestic life or the economic life of farm-<span
class=SpellE>labourers</span>, fisher-folk and small artisans of the village.
Telugu literature suffered till very recently by being completely isolated from
the life of the community in the villages where yet the bulk of Indian humanity
lives, not so much by the fact that Telugu literature was dominated by educated
Brahmins as by the fact that the Brahmins who so dominated it were the type who
migrated to the town and no longer belonged to the country-side. So understood,
this is a defect from which all the great literatures of the world suffer, and
the defect is more glaring in the history of all the <span class=SpellE>industrialised</span>
countries of the world where urban life attracts the intellectuals, and the
rural folk are comparatively less literate. <span class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span>,
possibly by the happy accident of his upbringing, and possibly too by his own
deliberate choice of matter and manner, is a bridge between the town and the
village in Telugu literature. There he holds an asset which some of the best
writers of the world lack. However, he lacks the fullness of literary life, as
much as <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span> lacks it. He is young, and his gifts
are rich and varied, and to these age may still add the art of picturing
emotions. One has a right to expect a good deal more from him than that he
should remain a prize-boy–standing at the edge of the table, waiting on the
Chairman of the evening. But even if he reaches the heights he is meant for, he
cannot be a writer with a social or political purpose. He is too intellectual
and too individualistic for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

many well known plays from other languages. His adaptation Bernard Shaw’s <i>Man
and Superman </i>as <span class=SpellE><i>Viswam</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Pelli</span> </i>appears to me to be the best of his efforts.
Indeed, no play of any modern author in the Telugu language, whether an
original work of art or a translation or an adaptation, comes near it in merit.
His adaptation of the third </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

more effective in adaptation than in original writing. His original work is
invariably of a lesser standard of excellence. He has correct stage technique,
and a fine sense of piquant situation. His dialogue is sparkling. He is at his
happiest and best in the vein of playful criticism of the follies of his
countrymen, particularly the Andhras. No one knows their failings more
accurately than he. And no one depicts them better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
his work, so far, as a dramatist reveals serious limitations in his art. He has
justified himself only in respect of simple comic themes, but he has not to
this day attempted serious emotional drama. Even his comic themes tend to mere
caricature. Comedy, as the English Stage understood it through the centuries,
and even Shaw did not really fall short of this understanding, has a core of
serious emotion which the Comic Muse exalts even while flood-lighting it with <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>. The Restoration Comedy tried a little to step
aside, but did not quite over-step the mark. Therein lies the difference
between caricature and comedy. Caricature is Comedy without a sense of
direction. Meredith tells us that true Comedy sees the defects in the object of
one’s love without loving the object any the less. The core of adoration may
not be denied. That is the secret of <i>As You Like It. </i>Rosalind’s heart
and Rosalind’s wit never part company. It is perhaps not fair to <span
class=SpellE>Yegganna</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> or to the Telugu
Drama to throw them against the entire background of the English Theatre in
assessing <span class=SpellE>Yegganna</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastry’s</span>
undoubted success on the undeveloped Andhra Stage. But standards of universal
dramatic art cannot be lowered to suit a people who are yet to mark progress.
The cause of the development of the Andhra Stage is dear to <span class=SpellE>Yegganna</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sastry</span>, as it is to so many others. That development
requires that present Andhra audiences should not be pleaded as an excuse for
the deliberate creation and production of fifth-rare drama. The audiences of
today are not to be taken as the ever-lasting primal intelligence to be played
to. Audiences are both as we deserve them and as we make them. Shaw somewhere addresses
them as “Ye, compulsorily educated ones! By and large, there is more in them
than we deem to be there. In any event, they have to be educated, if slowly,
out of all their errors of approach. This is the first duty of good writing and
good acting in our country today. <span class=SpellE>Yegganna</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> is one of the most impressive craftsmen on the
Andhra Stage. He has intellectual gifts of the very highest order. He must help
to bring the modern Telugu Drama into being. The false phases have yet to end.

he in most ways, did their best to usher in the era of the modern drama on the
Andhra Stage. The former was an artist of the very highest <span class=SpellE>calibre</span>.
Early applause did not spoil him. It spurred him to greater achievement. Cheap
applause arrested the growth of <span class=SpellE>Sthanam</span> Narasimha
Rao. In his man’s portrayal of women he belonged to a dead age. He tried to
walk into </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the living age–disguised as woman. It was
impossible for his audiences, and, worse, for him, to forget his disguise. His
art suffered because he had preliminarily to put on the role of a woman, and
only thereafter to put on the role of a woman in a particular dramatic
situation. The first part belongs to the region of mimicry: the second part
alone to the region of art. He had, and has, rare gifts for the second region
of true drama. But his audiences were content with his preliminary disguise.
They were thrilled at the mere thought of a man imitating a woman so well. They
wanted no more from him. As time passed he yielded to the easy, premature
applauses of his audiences, and he ceased to grow as a real actor. He became
the stereo-typed <span class=SpellE><i>Chintamani</i></span><i> </i>or <span
class=SpellE><i>Chitrangi</i></span><i> </i>or <span class=SpellE><i>Deradevi</i></span><i>,
</i>the elementary female of sorts<i>, </i>who lacks nuances of character or
theme and looks the same in any drama. It was, and has been, the misfortune of
the Andhra Stage that the art of these two great actors could not be fed by
worthy modern plays written by able modern writers, and that these actors
should have been thrown back to mythology or the Middle Ages, or to an
occasional second-rate old-world play like <span class=SpellE><i>Roshanara</i></span><i>

consciousness. He is not one of those who go on writing one-act plays,
extolling that medium merely because they are incapable of writing decent

and some inner fury must decide that he moves hereafter into the true drama of
emotion and social conflict. He is as finely equipped for the drama of social
controversy as <span class=SpellE>Arudra</span> is for the poetry of social
controversy. But neither can sacrifice art to propaganda. And neither has in
earnest attempted literature with a purpose. The intellectual in them is too

conclusion, I desire to state as my considered opinion that the process of literary
creation, which, in the ultimate analysis, is unconscious, abhors social or
political purpose which is deliberate. In this, literary creation is not
different from life. The Life Principle works its own way. It does not wait
upon us. It produces a Buddha, a Jesus, a Shakespeare, or a Gandhi, sometimes.
At other times it produces–just our sons and daughters. The Indian
mother-in-law and the Soviet politician may fancy products of a particular
kind. It may seem nice to the former that the daughter-in-law should produce,
for instance, a grand-son instead of a grand-daughter. And it may seem </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nice
to the latter that the Russian literary men should make song and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>novel
of a Five Year Plan instead of writing about Anna <span class=SpellE>Karenina</span>.
In the thirties of this century, I distinctly recollect, the great Stalin </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>actually
wanted poets and novelists to make the production of steel in Soviet Russia
their theme. There is something to be said for literary worship at new altars.
But it must be an altar, not a drainage scheme. True, the altar need not always
be “the sounding cataract” of England’s Lake District. Cascades of water
rushing down the latest artificial dam may be the new “music of humanity.” But
before it seeks to trespass into literature it must “haunt” a true poet “like a
passion,” not bind a false one like a building contract. Likewise, unless a
purpose or a theme becomes part of a writer’s integrated self, woven into the
very texture of his dreams, and it is not every purpose or every theme that can
so aspire, it cannot make literature. It remains mere pamphleteering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

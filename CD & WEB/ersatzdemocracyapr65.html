the Congress Government declares, every now and again, that Socialistic
Democracy is to be the model for the future Indian society, it is taken for
granted that the existing democracy which prevails in the U.S.A., U.K., France
and other western democratic countries is the ideal pattern on which it is to
be built up. In these western countries the evolution of democracy has been
gradually taking place during the last few centuries. But in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> the
question is quite different. Here the existing non-<span class=SpellE>egalarian</span>
Hindu society is to be completely <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> up and
western democracy is to be transplanted in its place. In these circumstances,
it is necessary to have a rational analysis of this new transplant for its real
democratic contents before adopting it for the Indian social construction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

definition of democracy as “Government by the people, for the people, with the

of Independence, and the French Revolution, its basic principles are (1) All
men are<b> </b>equal; (2) <span class=GramE>Sovereignty of the people; (3) <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Liberty</st1:City></st1:place>; (4) Equality; (5)

illuminating. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ALL
MEN ARE EQUAL: “That all men are <span class=GramE>equal,</span> is a
preposition to which at ordinary times, no sane human being has ever given his
assent” says <span class=SpellE>Aldous</span> Huxley in his essay on the Idea
of Equality. Bryce is in agreement with him and writes in his book. <i>Modern
Democracies, </i>“Natural inequality has been and must continue to be one of
the most patent and effective factors in human society.” Western democrats
cannot prove how great men like Einstein, President Kennedy, <span
class=SpellE>Pandit</span> Nehru and Queen Elisabeth are equal to each other
and how all these can be equated with any Tom, Dick and Mary on the street. Yet
this is a dogma in which every democrat has a blind faith which he cannot
rationally substantiate. In order to get over this difficulty, it is argued
that no doubt men are unequal, but democracy provides all of them equal
opportunity in the competition for their individual social uplift. But this is
injustice and hypocrisy, pure and simple, because opportunity can never be
equal for unequal persons. <span class=GramE>In<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>boxing</span> and wrestling, unequal persons are divided into different
categories according to their weights before they are allowed to contest with
each other. In billiards, <span class=GramE>an</span> handicap is imposed on
talented persons. Unless this is done, the declaration of equal opportunity for
<span class=GramE>all,</span> is a downright fraud on the people. Western
democracy, therefore, completely fails on the basic criterion that “All men are
equal.” In every society all human beings are not equal. And therefore, equal
opportunity for all does not operate in any of the present democracies of the
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SOVEREIGNTY OF THE
PEOPLE: “The sovereignty of the people is the basis and the watchword of
democracy. It is a faith and a dogma to which in our times, every frame of <span
class=SpellE>goverment</span> has to conform and by the conformity to which
every institution is tested….<span class=SpellE><i>Vox</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Populi</span> <span class=SpellE>Vox</span> Dei…</i>The divine
right of the king has become the overriding majesty of the people” says Bryce
in his book on Modern Democracies. This shows that sovereignty of the people is
considered in its collective aspect only. All adult people of the nation are
regarded to be sovereign in the political sense. By universal franchise, this
sovereignty of the people is exercised and transferred by means of votes to the
elected representatives. The elected representatives then form an assembly and
they in turn hand over their sovereign power to a small body of persons who
govern the whole nation in the name of the people with the consent of the
members of the assembly. During the term of office of three or four years of
this elected assembly the general population is completely enslaved and is at
the mercy of the governing body. According to <span class=SpellE>Pitirim</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sorokhin</span>, “a citizen declared free and sovereign in
democracies, in fact, plays in politics, the role of a zero rather than that of
a sovereign. He does not have any influence on the election of men who rule in
his name and with his authority.” This clearly indicates that an individual in
a democratic form of government loses his sovereignty completely during the
tenure of the elected assembly. The only difference between monarchy and
democracy is that in the former type of government, persons were never allowed
to enjoy the sovereignty of the people, while in the democratic form they
exercise their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sovereign power for one minute, every three or
four years, the time necessary for putting the vote in the ballot box.
Moreover, this sovereignty is in the political aspect only. In the civil,
economic, social, religious, and other aspects, the sovereignty of the people
is conspicuous by its absence. Can this, by any stretch of imagination, be ever
called sovereignty of the people? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there, is another very debatable side to this question of sovereignty of the
people. Can a person possibly surrender his sovereignty to a representative if
he himself does not wield sovereign authority? How can he give up a thing which
he himself does not possess and which exists in his imagination only? Legal
transfer of ownership can be <span class=GramE>effected</span> only by the
owner of a thing. And can a government which comes into existence on this
impossible corollary contain the smallest iota of sovereignty? If individual
sovereignty is absent, collective sovereignty has only an imaginary existence.
The so-called modern democratic government is, therefore, nothing but a
disguised bureaucracy. To call it a democratic government is not only hypocrisy
but a downright fraud on the ignorant population. Western democracy has not the
remotest right to call itself a democracy unless it makes provision for making
every adult individual of the realm a sovereign person and this seems to be an
impossible achievement for it at present. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

conception of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Liberty</st1:place></st1:City>
has varied from time to time. Before the Second World War, four kinds of
liberty were recognized–civil, political, religious and individual. But “the
idea of liberty is now so restricted that it contains only two distinct
ingredients–freedom to satisfy elementary and common human desires like the
desire for food, and freedom, to take significant decisions, and that welfare
cannot be discussed outside the content of liberty, or liberty outside the
content of welfare, or either without reference to the particular circumstances
of the people and communities under discussion.” Capitalistic democracies take
great pride in the observance of the principle of liberty. But its emptiness is
quite obvious as even in advanced countries like the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the Negroes had recently to
fight for it. </p>

“Men are born and continue to be equal in respect of their rights.” The
Declaration of Rights of the National Assembly of France begins with this
sentence. The doctrine of equality is, therefore, the very basis of western
democracy. Yet in the observance of this fundamental principle again it has
been a complete failure. Bryce distinguishes five different kinds of
Equality–civil, political, social, natural and economic. All these types of
equality except the civil and <span class=GramE>political,</span> are on paper
only and exist in imagination. After the Second World War, equality has now
come to mean only equality in the distribution of the necessities of life.
Lately in the Welfare State, a sort of equality is brought about by giving
every member of the society, irrespective of his income, freedom from want,
disease, squalor and idleness. But these are the tenets of a Welfare State and
not of democracy and this Welfare Equality can be brought about even in a <st1:place

Englishman has an apt proverb with which most of us of the older generation are
familiar–“You cannot eat your cake, and have it.” Common sense tells us the
same thing; you cannot do two contradictory things at the same time; you cannot
walk to the north and the south at the same time. And yet in our daily </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>life,
most of us are irrational enough to want to do this very thing; eat our cake
and have it; want two contradictory things at the same time. Else how to
explain the applause with which </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri Kamaraj’s latest
slogan has been received by a good many public men, including Rajaji, and the
conversations that are going on between the Congo and the others to implement
it. So far as Rajaji is concerned, 13 years ago he discovered that the
“Democracy” which the Congress was practising was only a facade; the actuality
was its opposite “Statism”; and as a consequence he organised the Swatantra
Party, which he has been telling us all these years is the only genuine
“democratic” party. Does his joining Sri Kamaraj mean that he has won him
(Kamaraj) over to his views? But there is no public declaration of this, in
which case, if Rajaji hopes to convert Kamaraj to his views after the overthrow
of the Congi, is it not a mere gamble; much like his gamble in backing the
D.M.K. Party in Madras 30 years ago at the last general election? The D.M.K.
has carried on all the policies of the Congress government which it replaced -
including rationing and, Urban Land Tax, which it had opposed. To put an
unrepentant Kamaraj in place of Mrs. Gandhi is to replace tweedledom by
tweedledee, both are “Statists”; only a year ago Kamaraj and the Congo were
thick as thieves with the Congi and Mrs. Gandhi. Merely because for their own
personal reasons the Congo and the Congi have fallen out, how can the public be
asked to assume, as Rajaji is asking them to believe, that the Congo have
become anti “statists”? And till they do so, how can they be called “democrats”
and till that is done how can he support the Congo as against the Congi to save
“Democracy”? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
assumption therefore that “Democracy” can be saved by supporting the Congo
against the Congi is not valid; both are “Statists” and “Statism” is the
opposite of Democracy, as Rajaji has been telling us for the last so many
years, and to destroy which he started the Swatantra Party. Then take the next
assumption, that to “save Democracy, is to save India”; is that not equally
false? India is on the brink of collapse in every walk of life; we all know
that to our cost. But what has brought about this collapse but “Democracy”, to
which Rajaji was a party till 1957, and to which Kamaraj was a party till 1969;
till the Bangalore split. We gave ourselves a Republican Constitution in 1950.
We chose the best men we had in our public life to man our Parliaments, the
instruments of our new “Democracy”. We gave adult franchise to every man and
woman, the accepted crest of “Democracy” then and now. We put at our head as
Prime Minister, perhaps the finest man we had in our midst, and for 16 years
till his death he ruled without any demur; and after him both Lal Bahadur and
Mrs. Gandhi were put in their gadii by the Congress Party Organisation. All
this, what was it but “Democracy”? Rajaji’s rejoinder that all this was
“Statism”, does not meet the point, for even “Statism” was brought about by
“Democratic” means. All the miseries that have been heaped upon our people
during the last 20 years of Independence have been heaped on them by
“Democratic” means, for “Democratic” purposes; e. g., Controls, Licences,
Permits, Armies of Ministers, confiscatory taxation for the socialist pattern
of society, etc. India has been brought to the brink of ruin by our “Democracy”
of the last 20 years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hence
the battle cry of Sri Kamaraj, is it not contradictory? If “Democracy” of the
last 20 years has brought us to the brink of ruin, should not the crusade
slogan be “Save Democracy or Save India”? You cannot have both: you cannot eat
the cake and have it. Is that not the reality of things? Of course, it hurts
our pride as a people to confess that we have made a mess of the “Democratic
Club” of England and the U. S. A. of which we had formed a branch here; much as
it hurts our pride that we are not yet members of the Atom Bomb Club of the
European Countries and China. And further a huge vested interest of colossal
dimensions has been built round this “Democracy”; of the politicians and the
industrialists and merchants on the one hand to fleece the exchequer and the
consumer, and of the good-for-nothing-rowdies at every level or the social
scale at the other end, who have been holding the general public to ransom for
their own selfish ends. If the Prime Minister can “grab “ the Banks under the
name of “nationalisation,” why cannot the rowdies “grab” your “land” under some
other equally high-sounding name of Maoism; and tomorrow grab your house, and
car, and radio and all else under guise of social justice? All this is
“Democracy”–a College Principal is murdered by a student; managements are
gheraoed and every dog can bite because we are having a full-fledged
“democracy”. And hence except the few good men who want to be left alone,
everyone is for “Democracy” in spite of the havoc it has created during the
last 20 years. There are none so blind as do not want to see; “Democracy” has
ruined India; and yet even people like Rajaji dare not face the fact. A
drunkard knows the cause of his ills; and yet he is a slave to it. In the old
days religion was the opiate of the masses; today it is “Democracy” which is
our opiate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hence
the choice today before the good men of India is not “Democracy and India”, but
“Democracy or India”. Our pride and our vested interests do not permit us to
see the choice clearly; these are two vital reasons for the blind spot of our
public men. But perhaps the most important reason for the blind spot is, if not
“Democracy”, what else? Our public men have made a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mess
of things; perhaps Democracy is not in our blood as the Englishman warned us;
or perhaps we lack the infrastructure of “Democracy”, courageous people like
the Pathans and the Swiss. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But what is the alternative? Surely we
cannot ask the Englishman </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to rescue us again from our new masters as
he rescued us from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>our old masters 200 years ago; and even
if we were childish enough to do so, the poor Englishman is in no mood or
position to rush back to us. When the Romans left Britain 1500 years ago the
poor Britons sent them entreaties to come back and rescue them from their new
terror, the Angles and the Saxon hordes; but history had moved on. And surely
we cannot call back our old princes–the Nizams and the rest. That would be like
a man eating his own vomit. So what is the alternative? A military dictator is
no good as Pakistan has shown; and that is the weakness of both General
Cariappa and Kumaramangalam’s views. For a short time a military dictator may
be helpful, in setting right the mess that a “Democracy” creates, as Bernard
Shaw wrote; and the Greeks and the Romans often resorted to this device to get
them out of their “Democratic” difficulties. But what about a long term
solution? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
the first and last requisite to grasp this long term solution is a change in
our attitude to the whole problem of “Democracy”; to recognise that
fundamentally in life there is no such thing as “Democracy”. Life is all
“Aristocracy” based on merit, and “ Democracy” is vital to life in every form
to the extent that “Democracy” helps the evolution of “aristocracy”. A garden
does not consist in its millions of weeds; it is made up of the few flowers.
And yet but for the weeds there would be no flowers; out of the “Democracy”
(equality) of weeds has emerged the aristocracy of flowers. Millions and
millions of men and women have been born and died on this earth of ours; all good
“democracts”; all equal. But only a few of them are remembered–the aristocrats,
the sages, seers, teachers, poets, philosophers, artists, the Christs, Buddhas,
Tagores, Gandhis. It is these aristocrats that have enriched life;
distinguished the life of man from that of the animal. But there would have
been no “aristocrats”, but for the millions of “Democrats”. And so politics
being fundamentally the science of good government, in the evolution of this
good government, “Democracy” is an essential ingredient; no more. Life is the
aristocracy of merit; inbreeding, dilutes merit, which explains the
degeneration of kings and courtiers; and it is the merit of “Democracy” that it
opens up the largest area for the rise of merit; it is the greatest check
against the dangers of inbreeding. The career open to talent; it was this that
made Napoleon the master of Europe, until he confined this career to his own
narrow circle of France, and brought about his own ruin. In other words
“Democracy is only a means; not an end; once we recognise this fact, it is easy
to set up an alternative form of government, to our present “Democracy” based
on its merit in the service of the people, and not a mere high-sounding figure
of speech, as hitherto. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Does
it all sound blasphemy? Look at the U.S.S.R. and the tremendous progress it had
made during the last 53 years. Was it due to its “Democracy”, or to a small
body of “aristocrats” who grasped power from the feeble hands of the Tsar, and
have held it in their hands ever since by every means, honest or dishonest.
Modern Russia, modern China, both are the products of the leadership of an
Aristocracy, who pave risen to the top through merit. But already both are
beginning to degenerate because the career open to merit is confined to a narrow
circle; all opposition must be crushed. India has been brought to the brink of
ruin because from the very beginning, in the Constitution itself, merit was
given a second place; backwardness was given the first. Those who sow the wind
reap the whirlwind; today we are reaping the whirlwind of our perverted
“Democracy”. And the only way to save the country is to discard our fictitious
“Democracy” of backwardness and replace it with the real “Democracy” of merit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

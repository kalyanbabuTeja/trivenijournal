is unfortunate that education at every level has become the guinea pig of
experimentation. It is the plaything of politicians narrow-minded chauvinists.
Patriotism is the last refuge of every illiterate or ill-educated reformer. The
love of ones country is measured by the abuse of a particular language which is

British Professors of Education formulate the basic theory of curriculum change
and renewal. We should take care to see that the light that guides us<i> </i>is
not an <i>ignis fatuus. </i>Kenneth Charlton, for instance, points out that
educational theory at the day is moving towards synthesis which may modify our
theory of knowledge which in turn may modify our curriculum and curriculum
theory (p. 76). It is the influence of the psychology of child development,
states Taylor, that makes the concept of readiness in the language of teachers
(p. 80). Frank Musgrove<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>writes the work
of evaluating curricula from the point of view of social objectives has
scarcely begun (p. 109). Paul Hirst suggests that it is quite impossible to
learn facts, to know them as facts without acquiring the basic concepts and the
criteria for truth involved (p. 45). Prof. Kerr informs us that the really
important questions in curriculum discussion are not syllabuses and methods of
teaching but objectives. The curriculum is a tetrahedron with a component at
each vertex–curriculum objectives, knowledge, learning experiences and
curriculum evaluation. Further, how are we to resolve the dichotomy between
theory and practice, between teacher-training and the actual job of teaching
children? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have referred to a pentagon of views to give the reader an idea of the riches
of the book. Any one interested in educational theory should make this book
ones friend and philosopher. History and philosophy, Psychology and Sociology
throw light on the strategy of curriculum planning though it is dangerous to
rely on the findings of individual disciplines. It is said that Aristotle puts
the right questions whether he gives the right answers or not. <i>Changing the
Curriculum </i>makes change or reform in education more rational and less
erratic. A sentence of Coleridge, says Virginia Woolf, explodes in the mind.
This book merits similar praise; it explodes in the mind. It is the road to the
Xanadu of the complex process of curriculum change. The book does not need a
reviewer’s puffery. It shows the many gaps in our thinking about education. It
eliminates the idea that education is education as pudding is pudding and the
best thing is to swallow it. It induces the play of criticism in this field
which, according to Arnold, should precede any creative effort. The book
supplies a set of constructs. Reform can be rationally designed and consciously
willed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the pride of South India that it has had in the past a great line of saints
and devotees of the Lord, who by their sheer strength of faith and
God-experience, were able to pour out in strains of Tamil song the glory of the
Almighty. If the devotees of Vishnu were called Aalwaars, the dedicated souls
of Siva were named as Naayanaars. If the outpourings of the Vaishnava singers
were termed Divya Prabandams, those of the Saivites went by the name of
Devaarams. Almost as contemporaries were these living in the land and one can
only wonder at the purity and plenty of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the middle of the twelfth century after Chirst, during the reign of Anapaaya
(Kulottunga II) Chola, a God-intoxicated person, called Sekkizhar, strove to
narrate the eventful lives of the Naayanaars in verses, which correspond in
form to the Devaarams themselves. In seventy cantos he collected in his own
words, the lives of the famous saints who with unswerving zeal and steadfastness,
fulfilled themselves with God’s grace in order to sing His praises without any
interruption. The result was a <i>magnum opus </i>of nearly 4,286 stanzas of
unalloyed dedication of the spirit to the knower of human destiny. Periya
Puraanam was the title under which this book of hagiology got released to the
world and has proved a standing source of influence to the religion of the
followers of Siva. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The most famous of the Naayanaars like Appar,
Sambandar and Sundarar who have been responsible for the major contents of the
book of Devaarams were the heroes of legends which when read, can make the
least religious among us, stirred to our depths. Miracles and wonder-works have
given life to these episodes that are recited with fervour and piety still in
every temple of accredited antiquity in South India. An attempt to make these
ancient soul- stirring stories available to readers of other languages is a
laudable one, and everyone will feel indebted to Yogi Suddhananda Bharati for
his English version of the contents of the Peria Puraanam. He has not exactly
translated the Tamil verses of Sekkizhar’s book, but has in a summary manner
given in English the matter contained in them. Apart from his English narration
of the lives of the Naayanaars, he has in his short introduction dwelt upon the
characteristics of the Saiva saints and has drawn their comparisons with some
of the western saints of the middle ages in their earnestness for a dedicated
life of devotion. </p>

late, there has been a spate of books which are the outcome of various American

other book, as is already suggested, serves as a striking contrast to the
preceding one. The writers discussed here–all modern novelists and most of them
of well-established reputations–are Thomas Wolfe, Edith Wharton, Sinclair
Lewis, Nathaniel West, Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway.
The essays are in the form of critical introductions by university professors
and critics in America. The papers compiled here were published originally as
separate pamphlets by Minnesota University on American writers. All the essays
present refreshingly the viewpoints of these novelists in the context of the
developing American culture. The analysis of individual novels, though quite
often not detailed, are sufficient to be striking and to suggest the novelty of
vision that each writer works out. The bibliographies appended towards the end
of the book seem to have been assiduously prepared and are so carefully
selective as to prove useful guides to the exploring students. Apart from the
index given at the end, the editor has added an introduction also wherein he
explicates his own views about the craft of fiction and the world-view which
inheres each work of fiction. The so-called modernity may lie </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>only
in the ‘technique’ or the ‘Point-of-view’ which may prove only a superficial
veneer, for ‘the great novelists have always known how to <i>tell</i> a story.’
Eliot’s concept of modernity comes easy in such contexts and the editor has not
failed to relate it convincingly to his readers <i>vis-a-vis </i>the art of
fiction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

its subtitle (“a philosophical essay on modern poetry”) indicates, the book is
a study of the relation between poetry and truth against the backdrop of <i>modern</i>
poetic theory and achievement. The present study is remarkable more for the
author’s dissatisfaction and disagreement with certain positions of the modern
poets and literary theorists than for any uncritical endorsement, as is the
habit some critics and writers, of all that is modern. The author’s quarrel
with modern poetic theory and practice is essentially directed against what he
singles out as its two major aberrations: abstractionism or an excessive
preoccupation with words at the Cost of meaning, an “overwhelming consciousness
of evil,” a phrase Lionel Trilling used sometime ago to characterise the bulk
of modern literature. Ayyub is cautious enough to qualify his indictment with
the remark that not all modern literature is abstract or charged with an over-whelming
consciousness of evil but “much is and a great deal more shows one or both
these trends.” He singles out Baudelaire, Valery and Mallarme as the major
exponents of these aberrations and feels an uncritical acceptance of their
leadership by the early poets produced results not altogether happy. The
exceptions, he notes, are: Hopkins and Frost, Yeats and Tagore, in their last
phase, Eliot of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Four Quartets</i> and
Rilke of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Duine Elegies</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With a sense of relevance that goes
with a perceptive critical awareness, Ayyub does well to concentrate in the
first chapter on the major tenets of modern literary theory–of Valery in
particular whose theory is contrasted with that of the Indian aesthetician
Kuntaka. Kuntaka’s definition of poetry, Ayyub points out, as “the togetherness
of the mutually challenging excellences of word and meaning” comes very close
to Paul Valery’s idea of a tension between sound and sense in poetry. The
comparison serves mostly to clarify Valery’s concept of words and the ‘poetic
state’. Ayyub goes on to point out how the attempts to make poetry ‘pure’ art,
either by making in approximate to the condition of music or the state of
painting–the pet analogies of the late nineteenth century French poets–have
only resulted in structures of words emptied of meaning. An upshot of all this
has been an abstract poetry which Ayyub defines as “a structure of words which
gives us the experience of being looked <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>at<i>
</i></span>instead of being looked <i>through.” </i>(p. 17). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ayyub’s case against some aspects of
modern literature comes out forcefully in his repudiation of the very
philosophical premises of the school of the absurd: “...the doctrinaires of the
absurd are professed atheists yet naively expect like good Christians to see
the hand of God of love and mercy in everything. It is right to look for a
moral order in a God-governed universe; and it is proper to be prepared for a
lot of evil where physical and biological laws prevail. It is absurd to deny
God and yet expect to see the world run according to a divine plan.” (p. 156) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In short, the study may be regarded
as a timely and serious protest against so much that is negative in modern
literature. Neither ‘pure’ poetry, nor the inverted-romanticism of the
Baudelairian kind nor even the campaigning against ‘a phantom ruler of the
universe’ (as in the school of the absurd) can make, Ayyub feels, literary
experience meaningful or healthful, unless it is animated by a sense of values.
How much of a “metaphysical black-out” there has been on the modern literary
horizon can only be realised in a comparison with the great tragedies of
Shakespeare in which “the negation of values is never total.” Ayyub’s warning
is not without some point: “if we do not see through the metaphysical black-out
indulged in by many modern writers, then moral blackout cannot be far behind.
But untruth itself is a disvalue, not only a metaphysical but also and even
more a literary disvalue...” The discourse concludes with a plea for avoiding ‘aesthetic
falsity’ and for a normalisation of the old relation between poetry and truth–the
sort of relation in which a sense of the terribleness of truth is not unmixed
with bliss, as in the poetry of Rike or Yeats. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the Simhachalam range of hills and the middle portion of the ancient State

Cholas, the northern Gangas, Matsyas of Oddadi, Silavamsa kings of Nandapara,
Chalukyas of Elamanchi, Surabhis of Jantarunadu, Pallavas of Viruktam, Koppula
chiefs, Suryavamsi Gajapathis of Orissa (major powers), and other miscellaneous
royal and made-up royal dynasties, who all vied with one another for political suzereinty
over the strategic region. But they were one and all exemplarily loyal to the
mighty Varaha-Narasimha, the presiding deity of the temple, and did their
utmost not only to renovate but also endow the temple abundantly with maanyams
for the various Bhoga-services to be rendered to the Lord every day and on
special festivals. Even the Muslim Nawabs of Bengal and Oudh were faithful to
this Hindu God and did their best </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Bhanudeva I, and Narasimha II (1187-1221 A. D.) the temple was extended and
rebuilt into the great artistic heritage that it now is. This is borne out by

is the final goal attained by the yogin in this path? Kaundinya says that those
who are liberated by the Sankhya-Yoga process, attain <i>Kaivalya </i>but lose
knowledge of what is self and what is other than self. But the <i>Paasupata </i>yogin
who has thus reached Rudra possesses knowledge, that is, omniscience and being
careful, comes to the end of sorrows through the grace of the Lord (V. 40).
This being with Rudra is his liberation and hence he is no longer dependent on
anybody and he can arrest any future aggression of evil. He shares the supreme
power of God except that of creation and he becomes completely free from all
sorrows of three types. In this stage the Yuktasadhaka should mutter ­Brahman.
Even in this highest stage he may experience some disturbance but God is the Lord
of all knowledge, the Lord of all </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>beings and the Lord of
even Brahman and the Sadhaka would pray to God Siva for His grace and Siva
would always be with Him. This is the final stage of beatitude when the yogin
will be permanent, free from all sorrows and will relish the eternal
association with Siva. (P. 28) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

place when it snows heavily. They rest in a hotel on their way home, and the
snow reminds Mrs. Gabriel Gretta of her boy friend Michael Furey who used to
wait for her in thick snow and eventually died at the tender age of 17. The
reminiscence oppresses her so much that she fails to respond to her husband’s
amorous approaches. Though at first he resents the intrusion of the dead boy’s
thought, he gradually begins to appreciate the situation and is moved by her
sheer childlike innocence. He too ruminates over the “hosts of the dead.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as a discipline cannot be underestimated its usefulness to the modern reader
would seem to lie in its study as aesthetics. Among the hundreds of writers on
poetics only a few have shown themselves to have been cognisant of aesthetic
problems as such. The rest stuck to its grammaticological basis and its accent
of Rhetorics. Kuntaka, Ruyyaka, Abhinavagupta, Anandavardhana, Rajasekhara and
Jagannatha <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>certainly brought an
aesthetic approach to bear on their observations and discussions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the great writers on Sanskrit poetics. A polemical writer with a highly
dialectic approach his work <i>Rasagangaadhara </i>is important for having made
quite a few points which are aesthetically relevant. It defines poetic charm as
the poetic imagination with reference to the of poetic production. Defining a <i>Kaavya
</i>in terms of the word propounding a delectable sense it correlates the idea
of <i>camatkaara </i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with <i>vaicitrya
</i></span>or <i>vicchitti </i>of the <i>aalamkaarika </i>school thus
completing the description of Viswanatha. Rejecting Viswanatha’s definition of <i

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
distinguishes a literary work of art from music and dance by not accepting <i>asvaada
udbodhakatva </i>and <i>rasa udbodhakatva </i>as bases of its definition. Its
clear perception of the manifestation of self-cognition and <i>rasa </i>as the
two distinct but simultaneous facets of aesthetic experience is in itself very
significant. While Abhinavagupta described aesthetic experience as <i>veeta vighna
prateeti </i>through <i>caarvana, Rasagangaadhara </i>elucidates it as <i>bhagnaavaranaa
cit</i>. Shedding tears in an aesthetic experience is explained as due to the
nature of the experience of particular pleasure and not due to pain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</i>into Telugu with a copious original commentary by name ‘Sarvani’ comes from
the seasoned hand of Sri Vedala Thiruvengalacharya whose <i>magnum opus Andhra
Dhvanyaaloka </i>and other works are familiar to the Telugu <i>literateurs. </i>Sri
Acharya’s work is important in two ways. It seeks to correct certain postulates
and ideas found in the commentary of Nagesa Bhatta as also some points made by Gangadhara
Sastry and Madhuranatha Sastry. Secondly it is no easy task to make the
dialectic of the argument in the text clear to the modern reader. The author has
succeeded in making the import of the textual argument as lucid as possible.
One will find a lot of useful material very valuable to the advanced student.
In refuting Nagesa Bhatta and others to establish the intention of Jagannatha,
Sri Acharya’s conduct of the argument is very scintillating no doubt but one
would think <i>suaviter </i>would have sufficied where caustic or sircastic
remarks are made. However, there are two points on which Nagesa Bhatta has come
under fire from the author. Nagesa’s attempt to justify the <i>Sabdaarthanishtata
</i>of <i>Kaavya </i>and his hypothetical observation that it might be possible
to supply a distinguishing quality (<i>vailakshanya</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>)<i> </i>to aesthetic relish<i> </i>(<i>asvaada</i></span>). A modern
aesthetic contemplator would perhaps argue the points in favour of Nagesa on the
following lines: A literary work of art as an aesthetic object implies poetic
diction for emotive purposes. And poetic diction, in the main, has to be <i>Sabdaanuroopa
artha </i>and <i>arthaanuroopa sabda </i>whose existence has been implicitly
agreed to by <i>aalamkaarikaas. </i>Such word and sense as also the expressed
part (the grammaticological meaning of the poem) and the unexpressed part (such
as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rasa</i> and <i>dhvani</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>)<i> </i></span>act and interact as mutual
complementaries. Since they are not mutually exclusive to the contemplator they
constitute an integral whole. It is in this context that Jagannatha’s <i>eko
nadaaviti vyavahaara </i>seems to go off the mark. Secondly since a literary
work of art uses conventional language as its medium its verifiable truth or
falsehood, sincerity or insincerity continues to influence the affect and <i>saahitya
laabha </i>of the contemplator so long as his <i>antahkarana vrittis </i>are
functioning in the process. This lends a distinguishing quality to <i>asvaada </i>at
least to a major part of it. Or else it would become difficult to account for
individual preferences as between Manu and Vasu charitrams where one will find
all other aesthetic criteria common </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

has attempted to show how the poets of Andhra from Nannaya to Viswanatha have

backdrop to the human drama depicted by poets. During the heydays of the
romantic period in Andhra, poets tried to look at Nature from a subjective
point of view deviating from the beaten track of convention. The author has not
only catalogued the descriptions but also added his own comments upon the
impact of the seasons on the sensitive minds of the poets whose vision can
perceive “a world in a grain of sand and Heaven in a wild flower.” While he has
taken care to refer to the works of minor poets, it is a pity that no mention
has been made of the works of Kavikondala Venkatarao and Jashuva who stand pre-eminent
among our Nature-poets. In their inspired work we find much refreshing originality

be the Father of the Modern Telugu Literature. He wrote the play “to advance
the cause of social reform and to combat at a popular prejudice that Telugu
language was unsuited to the stage.” It is the first work in the spoken dialect
and has proved to be a great success. Though the drama deals mainly with evils
(like acceptance of bride’s money, child marriage, widow re-marriage, abolition
of prostitution as a social institution) that existed in the contemporary
Indian society in the last century, the manner in which the problems were tackled,
the characters that were moulded out of the dramatic material, their dialogues
and the resultant emotions are of an everlasting appeal. No less a critic than
Dr. C. R. Reddy said that “<i>Kanyaasulkam </i>remains a masterpiece in the

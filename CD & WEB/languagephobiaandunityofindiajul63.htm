 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>What sort of danger linguistic
problems hold to the unity of? It is abundantly clear that by the unity of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> one means, not so much a sense of
emotional integration about which one hears so much, as the political
integrity, i.e., wholeness of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a nation. In other words, one thinks of the possibility of an area or a
State with a separate language working up an agitation for secession from the
nation that is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in order to form a separate nation that would gain recognition by international
bodies like the United Nations. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>It is well known that before the
completion of the process of independence and the integration of the States,
this was indeed a very dubious and complicated issue. Apart from the general
problem posed by the 560 and odd former princely States, there were the special
problems created often by the statesmen in charge there, by the demand that the
States be recognized as distinct nations. It is <span class=GramE>strange<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to</span> recall that even the old <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Travancore</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> was one of these, apart from the two other
classical examples of <st1:State w:st="on">Jammu and Kashmir</st1:State> and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>. However, it
may safely be said now, as a result of monumental statesmanship, all these
dangers are well behind us now, except for the loss of portions of <st1:State
w:st="on">Jammu and Kashmir</st1:State> first to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
and now to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a result of very special factors. Although from one State one hears
occasional reports of a demand for secession, there is reason to believe that
this is a result of no more than political slogans and that, in practice, in
any case, there would be very stern counter measures taken by the <span
class=SpellE>Centre</span> and indeed by the country as a whole to prevent any
such political slogans from developing into any active attempts to separate
from the rest of India. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far as the north of the country is concerned not only are there linguistic
States but also in several States, superficially at least, only one language is
the official language. These States are U. P. Bihar, M. P. and <span
class=SpellE>Rajasthan</span> making up a total population of 175 millions. He
would be a bold man who ‘would argue <i>per contra </i>that these 175 million
people have learnt to live in amity with a full sense of emotional integration,
merely because the official language of the States concerned is Hindi. Indeed
some of the most virulent political struggles for leadership have been staged
in these very States, and although at one time there was a proposal, based on a
great deal of common sense argumentation, that the State of U. P. be split up
into two with consequential peripheral rearrangements, one of the most
important politicians of the country is reported to have declared that the
partition of the U. P. could only take place over his dead body. This clearly
proves that the real culprit in the lack of this unity is not the linguistic
States but something else, and unless this ‘something else’ is carefully traced
out and diagnosed, there is an imminent danger of a false prognosis and a great
deal of ineffective and possibly mischievous action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Language is essentially a
vehicle for cultural patterns and for inter-communication in regard to current
affairs. Since, with the advent of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>,
and the conferment of adult franchise as a <span class=SpellE>concommitant</span>
of the western parliamentary form of democracy, it is very essential that the
link between the voters and their representatives, in the legislatures and in
the governments at various levels, should have the closest possible intimacy,

fact that the literacy percentage in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is now round about 30 and
that the truly literate percentage of the population would be hardly half of
this, even linguistic sentiments would dimensionally be so small as to be
easily outweighed in the balance by more natural aggregations of interests,
such as regional, political, religious or economic. In other words, linguistic
problems largely exist in the minds of only the more sophisticated section of
the community and these have been using language as a peg on which to hang
other ulterior motives. I do not believe that the man in the street or the
peasant thinks of language with any kind of sentiment. All he is concerned with
is that he should not be inconvenienced in the conduct of his day-to-day
affairs, and even in this he is prepared to be surprisingly </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
view therefore is that the perils of <span class=SpellE>linguism</span> are
artificial of a creation of a very small sophisticated minority and that it is
almost the red herring trailed across the path by interested groups which have
other aims and objects, more material than linguistic sentiment, in view. Of
all the so-called dangerous issues, at present the subject of <span
class=SpellE>pejoration</span> in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <span class=SpellE>linguism</span>
is the most innocuous, for it means the desire to separate in arrangements
which would make for the maximum understanding and the readiest communication
in regard to everyday affairs. To cite one example applicable to the
sophisticated minority, the current controversy over Hindi is to my mind really
a struggle for a somewhat unrestricted market for publications. If Hindi were
to be more prevalent than is warranted by, say, merely its being an official
language or as a <i>lingua franca, </i>obviously the reading public and of
publications in Hindi would be increasingly large at the expense of the reading
public in the other languages which might be destined to be neglected from a
base commercial motive. In other words, if an option were to lie before an
author capable of expressing himself in, shall I say, Gujarati and Hindi, it
might very well be that he would prefer to write in Hindi because of the far
wider reading public that he might have and therefore of the larger rewards
that he might reap. It is here that a great deal of restraint is called for.
Every language has a genius of its own and mirrors patterns of culture which do
not conflict with but are complementary to the sister patterns of culture
prevalent in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It is therefore in the best interests of the country that all these vehicles of
human transaction and communication should be given their maximum possible
encouragement so that they might together contribute to the strength of the
unity in diversity that is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
remedy for such false self-appraisals–whether of language or of national or
communal character–is to mix freely and with-out inhibitions with <span
class=GramE>others,</span> and this implies means of communication in the shape
of a common language. In other words, the more we acquire facility in another
language than our own the wider is our horizon and the more the basis of a
wider understanding. The academic bodies like the <span class=SpellE>Sahitya</span>
<span class=SpellE>Akademi</span> and the National Book Trust are making
systematic efforts to make the speakers of one language familiar with the
cultures and ideas mirrored in the other languages of India mentioned in the
Constitution, by the necessarily limited and unsatisfactory method of
translation, and their efforts will bear fruit only if the study of languages
becomes more systematic and purposeful in the school, the university and <span
class=SpellE>citizenhood</span> (among citizens). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as Lancelot <span class=SpellE>Hogben</span> has claimed and tried to prove in his
famous book ‘The Loom of Languages’, scarcely can anyone have any rational
basis for the belief that he or she is congenitally incapable of becoming a
linguist. If a language phobia exists, it must be a by-product of formal
education or other agencies of social environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

true this is of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
with its post-Independence language phobias, which are the result of neglect of
teaching languages to pupils no less than of the slogans of politicians or of
vested interests! And yet how easy and how rewarding is the study of languages,
especially in India, where they belong to two main language families, provided
the aim is not perfect mastery but the more modest one of acquiring a small
workmanlike vocabulary and getting a grasp of essential grammatical
peculiarities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the private citizens’ efforts have to be reinforced by the purposeful efforts
of the State. It is here that I see the greatest ambivalence of the Indian
scene, a profession of deep concern the language and culture of minorities and
a practice of direct but more often indirect, i.e., through official (<span
class=SpellE>myrmidous</span>) denial of opportunities, of suppression and of
compulsive use of the majority languages. It is principally this situation that
has even created the antithesis of linguistic problems and national unity. Its
remedy can only be in the rooting out of such fissiparous politics and vested
interests by every citizen who has a concern not only for national unity but
also for progress towards an international society in which <st1:country-region

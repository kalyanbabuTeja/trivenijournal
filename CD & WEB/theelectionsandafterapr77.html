Indian and foreign observers have expressed the view–and rightly also–that the
elections to Lok Sabha held in March last brought about a peaceful revolution
in the country. We have to understand clearly in what this revolution
consisted. It does not consist in a mere change in the party in power and
office. The Congress which has been continuously in power at the Centre
suffered a crushing defeat and for the first time in the thirty years history
of free India a non-Congress Government–that of the Janata Party–under the
leadership of Morarji Desai has assumed power. There is nothing revolutionary
about this. It is what is normally expected of elections in a democracy. The
fact that though six elections were held from 1952, it was only in 1977 that
such a change was brought about does not also constitute a revolution. Even in
mature democracies like those of Britain and the United States, we find the
same party being returned to office continuously from one election to another
for long periods of time. We may also note that the Congress spell was broken
even in our country when after the elections of 1967 the Congress held office
for sometime as a minority party depending upon the D. M. K. and the C. P. I., for
continuing in office, and when in eight States Congress lost its majority, and
non-Congress governments were formed. Thus a mere change in party in office
does not constitute a revolution. No one referred to the changes between 1967
and 1972 as revolutionary in character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Consequently
when we look at the elections of 1977, and refer to them as revolutionary in
their outcome, it should be for some other specific reason. The modern era in
the history of the world is spoken of by historians as an era of revolutions.
These revolutions have been of two kinds. In one category we have revolutions
for achieving freedom from foreign rule. The first of such revolutions was the
War of American Independence in which the people of the thirteen British
Colonies, in what subsequently became the United States, fought to get rid of
British rule and achieve freedom. They set an example to other colonial
dependencies, and territories subject to other kinds of alien rule–to the
people of Central and South America, to Balkan people’s subject to the Sultan
of Turkey, to the people of Italy, and above all to the peoples of Asia and
Africa subject to Western imperialism. We ourselves followed that example and
carried on a struggle from 1920 to 1945 under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi
and finally achieved freedom in 1947. By so doing we ourselves became the inspirers
of similar revolutions in other parts of Asia and in Africa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
second category of revolutions consists of those whose purpose was to put an
end to despotism and establish a democratic system of government. The first
among them was the French Revolution of 1789 which in the name of Fundamental
Human Rights and of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity overthrew the monarchical
regime and established a democratic government in its place. The revolution
which led to the overthrow of the czar’s despotic rule in Russia in 1917
belongs to this category, though it was not followed by the setting up of a
democratic system as term is ordinarily understood. A common feature of these
revolutions is the overthrow of despotism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
elections of 1977 resulted in a revolution which falls into the second
category. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
our country became free in 1947 our Founding Fathers set up a democratic system
of government through the Constitution framed with great deliberation by
eminent jurists. Along with the democratic system they also set up a Federal
Type of Government. Both democracy and federalism stand for governments with limited
authority. Constitutional government does not merely mean a government which is
based on a written constitution. Even autocratic governments have a
constitution. It is only when a constitution provides for limitations on the
authority of government that it is entitled to be called a constitutional government.
Our Constitution is of this character. Besides providing for a democratic
system, based on adult suffrage, free and fair elections once in five years and
other features which are usually associated with democracy, it has created governments
with limited authority both at the centre and in the states. It<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>does this by maintaining a balance
between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. Each serves as a sort
of check on the others and prevents any one institution from exercising unlimited
authority. Judicial review of the laws enacted by the Central and State legislatures
and of any orders that might be issued by the Central and<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'> </b>State Governments is an integral part of the system of limited
government enshrined in our Constitution. Besides this, citizens have been
guaranteed a number of fundamental rights–rights to freedom of speech, to
freedom of association, of holding public meetings, freedom to move from place
to place, freedom of person, equality before law, etc. Any limitations placed on
these rights by legislatures or executives are subject to judicial review.
Federalism which leaves to States a field of autonomy freed from the Centre is
also another characteristic of limited government. No government whether at the
Centre or in the States is permitted to do anything in excess of the limits
imposed on them by the federal system. Balance between the three institutions
of government, judicial review, fundamental rights of citizens and federalism
should be regarded as the basic features of our Constitution. They all have one
common objective–the exercise of only limited authority by governments and the
prevention of any kind of despotism coming into existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Something
contrary to all this began to happen from 1971 onwards; and this reached its
climax in the Emergency declared in June 1975. The steps taken during the 19
months of Emergency to make fundamental changes in the Constitution substituted
personal dictatorship for democracy and limited government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
happened from 1971 onwards was the gradual concentration of all political
authority in the person holding the office of Prime Minister. It has been the
convention for the Prime Minister to consult the Cabinet before arriving at
governmental decisions. But this convention disappeared gradually. The Prime
Minister arrived at decisions and only announced them formally at the meetings
of the Cabinet. There arose in due course a coterie of an inner circle of
advisers chosen by the Prime Minister outside the Cabinet and her decisions came
to be based and not on their advice and on that of the Cabinet. They owed no
responsibilities to Parliament like the Cabinet. This is the first step in the
establishment of an authoritarian system. It is now known that even the declaration
of Emergency in June, 1975, was her own decision taken on the advice of the
coterie and not after consultation with the cabinet. So great was her personal
ascendancy that no Cabinet Minister had the courage to<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>question her authority. As a result of the elections to State
Assemblies in 1972 all State Governments, with the exception of two or three,
came under the control of the Congress. But the State Congress parties lost all
autonomy. The same was the case with the Congress party as a whole. The
President of the Congress was her nominee as also the members of the Working
Committee. Inner democracy within the Congress disappeared. The Chief Ministers
of States were all nominated by her in all the States where the Congress had a
majority. They held office at her pleasure. Bahuguna who was sent by her to
become the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh told the public recently the way in
which she made him Chief Minister and later removed him from office. Under
these circumstances state autonomy guaranteed by the federal nature of the
Constitution ceased to have any meaning. The elected Provincial Congress
Committees ceased to exist and their place was taken by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ad Hoc </i>Committees nominated by the Congress President at her
behest. Later the principle of the equality of all citizens in the eye of law
was abandoned and the electoral law was so changed as to place beyond the
jurisdiction of judiciary the question of the validity of election to
Parliament of any person who, after election, might happen to hold the office
of Prime Minister. There was thus one electoral law for the ordinary citizen
and another for the Prime Minister. It is a matter of common knowledge that it
was the judgment of the Allahabad High Court declaring invalid the election of
Srimati Indira Gandhi to Parliament from the Rai Bareily Constituency in Uttar
Pradesh that provoked her to place this electoral law on the statute book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
was immediately followed by the declaration of Emergency to prevent internal
threat to peace and order. What happened to the 19 months of Emergency was far
worse than what happened in the worst days of British Rule. Nearly one-and-half
lakhs of people were thrown into prison without any charges being framed against
them and without any formal trial. Among them were universally respected
leaders like Jayaprakash Narayan, Morarji Desai, Vajpayee, Asoka Metha and
several others. Not only members of the Opposition parties but also of the
Congress itself who were suspected of being disloyal to the Prime Minister–members
of A. I. C. C., and P. C. C.–met the same fate. Complete censorship was
exercised over the Press. All freedoms were taken away. Several organizations
were banned–some political and some religious and cultural. It is an elementary
principle of democracy that the mere fact that a general election voted a
particular party to power does not give it the arbitrary authority to use the
power in any way it likes. Public opinion has to assert itself to prevent the
arbitrary exercise of authority. But in the name of Emergency all scope and
opportunities for the expression of public opinion were closed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Emergency was used to place the Maintenance of Internal Safety Act (MISA) on
the statute book. It has no parallel in the history of legislation in
Post-Independence India. We have to go to the days of British rule to find a
parallel to it. It was similar to the Defence of India Act passed during the
two World Wars and to Rowlatt Act against which Mahatma Gandhi organised an
All-India Satyagraha in 1919. It was worse than these two Acts in many ways. It
was directed not only against smugglers, and black-marketeers but against even
honest citizens whose loyalty to the Government was suspected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Above
all, the Emergency was used to enact the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution
which gave to Parliament the Sovereign right to change the Constitution in any
way and to any extent it liked, to change its basic features and deprive the
courts of questioning the validity of such amendments. Other restrictions were
placed on the judiciary. The exercise of arbitrary power by the executive–the
Prime Minister, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto </i>executive–was
given constitutional validity. So also were the restrictions on Fundamental
Rights and the Right to Freedom of Association. It provided for constitutional
dictatorship–as if any dictatorship can be constitutional in the real sense of
the term “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Constitution</i>” as referred
to above. Our political system ceased to be democratic and unlimited authority
of the Prime Minister took the place of Government with limited authority. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a clear abuse of the Article in the Constitution which empowers the
President to declare an Emergency. The purpose for which it has to be used is a
limited purpose–to restore order when it is disrupted and when ordinary law
cannot deal with it. But Emergency has been used by the Congress Government to
change the basic structure of the Constitution and to set up a permanent
political system dictatorial in character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are some who defend Emergency on the ground that it has restored discipline,
put an end to student unrest, to labour strikes and lock-outs, and to give
effect to the Prime Minister’s Twenty-point Programme and to her son’s
Five-point Programme. But these defenders forget that it was the weakness on
the part of police authorities and disregard for the rule of law among persons in
authority–elected as well as non-elected–that were responsible for the state of
indiscipline in the pre-Emergency days. The police were denied the legitimate
authority due to them as a result of undue interference by ministers in office.
No declaration of Emergency was needed to restore discipline or to enforce the
Twenty-point or the Five-point Programme. All this could have been done under
the ordinary law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sorts of excesses were committed by the authorities in the name of Emergency.
Compulsory sterilisation which most attracted public attention was only one of
them. The tortures to which persons taken into custody were put to formed another
category of excesses. Compulsory retirement of officials without framing any
charges against them was another kind of excess. Examples of this character can
be multiplied. All these are the characteristics of dictatorial rule, and the
country became subject to such a rule during the Emergency. The Constitution
was so changed that dictatorial rule could be continued even after Emergency
was lifted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

brought about a revolution. This is the real significance of the elections. India
was acclaimed till few years ago as the largest democracy in the world. By what
happened in consequence of the nineteen months of Emergency, it became the
largest dictatorship in the world. The election reestablished the claim of
India to be regarded as the largest democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

members of the Opposition party to broadcast on A.I.R. show how much the new
Government values the principles of democracy–personal liberty and freedom of
expression–not only in theory but also in practice. But democracy in which we
have all along understood it cannot be fully restored unless the 42nd Amendment
to the Constitution is repealed. Can the Janata Government do this? It may get
with some difficulty the support of a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha as
several other parties have expressed their willingness to co-operate with it,
but it does not command a majority of this kind in the Rajya Sabha. And unless
there is a change in the composition of the State Assemblies which are now
dominated by the Congress party, it may not be able to set the support of half

to undo the undemocratic character arising out of its 42nd Amendment at a time

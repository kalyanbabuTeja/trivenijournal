has <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
foreign policy been <span class=GramE>so</span> full of interest as during the
end of the year 1954. Any reference to the subject during these seven years at
once brought to the fore the names of the four great Powers,–the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the U. S. S. R. And of these the first three, generally in agreement with
one another, have been equally in disagreement with the fourth. Then again, of
the three, the first two, though in essence and in conclusions agreeing
together, have arrived at their conclusions by traversing different routes and
pursuing different planes of thought. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> has been like a younger
brother to the two, except lately on the question of the Geneva Conference, and
that for a passing time. All these years, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> had been marking time,
watching and observing <span class=GramE>until,</span> finally, she took
courage in both hands, and embraced its opportunity on the Korean problem which
earned former an equal place with the first four, so making four into five. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> has now become an important consultant of
position and authority even as between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
and by entering into discussions at critical times, acted as a <i>pasang </i>in
the diplomatic scales, balancing the two sides just by her timely thought,
suggestion or even solution. That was how the Prime Minister of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> has had to visit <st1:City w:st="on">Colombo</st1:City>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Burma</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region></st1:place>, and bring together the
important Asian countries and ensure for them a voice in the counsels of peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prime Minister declared in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>
on the New Year’s Day that “the New Year held out better chances of peace than
before, despite the complexities of the problems confronting the world today.”
This was the observation he thought fit to make soon after his return from
Indonesia, after attending the preparatory conference of the Colombo Powers to
pave the ground for the Afro-Asian Conference. He added, “There is an increased
realisation of what I call an almost impossibility of having major wars now,
because of the terrible consequences.” The world situation, following two world
wars and rumours of a third of the series, is like the digging of a well deeper
and deeper when a stage will come when the circular margins of earth, in spite
of the conical inclination given, threaten to fall on the workers below; the
diggers may come upon a rocky bottom which baffles the strokes of our crowbars
and pick-axes and spades. Deeper down you can certainly go, provided the
protection is by means of planks vertically fixed and held in position by side
pegs of iron driven into the earth horizontally at different levels. These pegs
must be represented by understandings between nations on ‘peaceful
co-existence’. You may go ever so deep but protect the marginal earth from
getting loose and falling upon the diggers. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> may go ever so deep into her
own communistic philosophy, but let her not meddle with the texture of politics
of her neighbours. That is the only protection to the peace of the world. If
the twenty- two Asian and African Powers consolidate their own internal
structure and let mutual friendliness ripen into genuine friendship, and if
thereafter <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region>
join them, there can be no power on earth that can disturb the world’s peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be broadly known that this peace, seeming and superficial in the past two
years, was perilously near a break, “during the critical period in December
1950 and January 1951 of defeat in Korea, when Mr. Attlee flew to Washington to
confer with President Truman, and when the French were suffering defeat in
Indo-China and Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Anthony Eden flew to Washington to
confer with President Eisenhower. On each occasion distinguished members of the
United States Government and of the American Armed Forces publicly demanded a more
aggressive American policy in the Far East and publicly advocated the extension
of the fighting by sea-blockade and bombing from the air”.<sup>1</sup> If the
Korean war remained localised, the credit must be, as indeed it was, passed on
to the Prime Minister of India, who boldly faced the situation and warned
America, for the second time, against proceeding further in Korea. It was bad
enough that they had not heeded his well-timed warning, when they re-crossed
the 38th parallel, that they should not <span class=GramE>proceed</span> further,
a warning for disregarding which the Americans found themselves in a kind of
Trisanku Swarga. Fortunately the Korean <span class=GramE>war</span> became
circumscribed and the truce in Indo-China became an accomplished fact. The
hasty statements of American officials and even Ministers are, it is stated, to
be regarded only as their individual opinions, which neither bind nor even
voice forth the views of the President, unlike the utterances of British
Ministers and officials who always echo the voice of Her Majesty’s Government.
Fortunately we are saved from the calamity of a third world war, and few of us
knew how near we were to it. Having averted that great calamity, the world is
hard put to it to discover or to devise measures by which the peace that has
been saved may become a permanent feature of the world’s affairs. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is being planned and wrought–in the umbras and penumbras </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
world politics–by an Asian statesman and seer, not by mobilising a third bloc
by any means, as people glibly put it sometimes, but by holding together
nations who might involuntarily and inevitably be drawn into the coils and
toils of global intrigues. The Colombo Powers had met at the instance of the
Prime Minister of India and almost taken the wind out of the sails of the
Geneva Conference, by confirming the five principles that had been earlier
agreed upon between the Chinese Prime Minister and himself. The same Colombo
Powers who have met in order to concert measures for convening the Afro-Asian
Conference, are apt to strike America as political parvenus that are suddenly
emerging from their long established and long deserved obscurity into political
fame; and when they ripen into a two-continent organisation planning measures
to eliminate war altogether, they are apt to be regarded as officious and
meddlesome. There is a section of American opinion which is apt to be
favourably inclined towards extreme views leading up to “so much support for
extensive military action in the <st1:place w:st="on">Far East</st1:place> that

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
may wonder why this should be so, but we shall not when we remember that,
“America, a modem industrialised nation, was most sympathetic and helpful
towards China, an ancient, undeveloped country, from the time of the Boxer
rebellion to the rise of the Communists in China, by building hospitals,
schools and Universities and manning them with hundreds of devoted American men
and women.”<sup>3</sup> If after all this service, the Chinese Communists
treated the Americans who had been for half a century their best friends, as
their worst enemies, and killed many American troops in Korea to boot, is it
any wonder that the Americans should be angry” and “feel that these evil men
should not go unpunished. This is the passion which gives support to violent
action in the Fast East”<sup>4</sup> <span class=GramE>It</span> may be true
that, Americans are by temperament men of action. It may be that, “Time for
them is an enemy to be overcome, not, as we British tend to think, as ally to
work with”.<sup> 5</sup> Yet the Americans, it is said, are not likely to be
misled by temperament into action, unless the Chinese embark on reckless
action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not therefore likely that the new Afro-Asian Concert will have irresistible
forces to combat. The American, despite his antipathy to the Chinese Communist
regime, works in the long run to increase the prospects of peace. Sir Oliver
Franks in his third Reith Lecture says: “The Americans believe this object is
furthered if lines<i> </i>are drawn, and it is made clear to friend and foe
alike that aggression across these lines will be resisted, if necessary, by
war. <span class=GramE>That, I take it, is the significance of the Atlantic
Pact.</span> A line has been publicly drawn from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Norway</st1:country-region>
to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Pacific Pacts with <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>,
the <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">New
 Zealand</st1:country-region>, draw a line between the Islands of the Pacific
and the mainland of <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>. The <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
supported the South-East Asia Treaty of Collective Defence as a first step of
the same sort.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
thus the Americans and the British have been ardently trying to evolve
agreement out of differences of political trends and temperament, while they
are now at one and now at variance but, in differing, are friendly, even as
they, in friendliness, have points of disagreement, a new factor and force has
come into the field which has been these seven years waiting and watching,
observing and studying until, at last, it gave a peremptory suggestion on the
question of Korea and made the Powers in embarrassment seek India’s advice,
intervention and initiation. But <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is not a single nation. She
has at first become the mouth-piece of four other sister nations, and has found
nearly twenty other countries willing to follow her lead in Asia and the
African Continent, ready to share all woes and struggles with her. A new cell
is thus forming itself, with <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
as the primordial nucleus, which presents every prospect of playing a vital
part in shaping the foreign politics of <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

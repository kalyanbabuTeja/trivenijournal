style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
emergence of India as an Independent Republic marks the close of an era of
dependence and subjection and the beginning of an epoch of freedom and
democracy. For the first time, in the annals of our country, a democratic
Constitution is being drafted on the Indian soil by the representatives of the
Indian people. The new Constitution is not only for the people, but also of the
people and by the people. On the 9th of December, 1946, a never-to-be-forgotten
day in our history, the Constituent Assembly had its opening session and took
“the first of the last steps to freedom”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
new Constitution, which is still on the anvil, is democratic in its structure
and outlook. What then is the general structure of our new body-politic? It is
necessary to note that the Government of India Act, 1935, is taken as the basis
by the fathers of our Constitution. So the main principles of the Act of 1935
form the foundation on which the new constitutional edifice is built. There is
nothing derogatory in this, for there are certain principles in the Act of
1935, which are eminently suited to India. The most noteworthy feature of the
new Constitution is that it favours a federal type of Government. A federal
system is purely an internal constitutional arrangement and is compatible with
Autocracy or Democracy or Communism. But it has been an established principle
in Political Science that federalism is best suited to a country having
centripetal and centrifugal forces. Even after the separation of Burma and
Pakistan, and even after the transfer of populations which is being conducted
amid scenes too horrible even to imagine, there will still be divergent and
conflicting interests and minorities to be safeguarded in India. For such a
country the federal form of Government is considered to be the best type, for
we can have unity without a deadening uniformity, and free association without
suppression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the essential requirements of a federal Government is division of
Governmental powers. The sphere of the Central Government and that of the
Provinces is determined in the Constitution itself. One of the methods which
this is done is by drawing three lists of subjects,–one list containing the
powers of the Central Government, another the powers of the Provinces, and a
third known as the ‘concurrent list’ consisting of subjects in respect of which
both the Central and Provincial Governments can legislate. Whenever a conflict
arises over a subject in the ‘concurrent list’ between the Union Government and
the Provincial Government, the view of the former prevails. In whatever way the
lists may be drawn up, and whatever the amount of care taken in the framing of
the Constitution, it is impossible to exhaust all the conceivable subjects. So
there will always be the residual powers. As it was the intention of the
Congress to have a strong Centre, it wanted to vest the residual powers with
the Central Government, while the Muslim League, jealous of provincial rights,
wanted to give them to the Provinces. These differences among the Indian
representatives at the Second Round Table Conference were, as usual, exploited
by the British, and, according to the Act of 1935, residual powers were vested
in the Governor-General. The white man shouldered the burden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
now the Congress ideal is achieved by the creation of a strong Centre.
According to the new Constitution, the residual powers will be given to the
Union Government. In addition, it will exercise varied administrative and
financial powers. It is also given the power to create new units or to alter their
boundaries. But, in so altering the provincial boundaries, the Central
Government must consult the legislature of the Province concerned. Moreover,
the Federal Government may entrust the work to administration of Federal
subjects to Provincial officers, and it will also have the right to give the
necessary directions to a Provincial Government for the proper enforcement of
its rules. Above all, in allocating the financial resources, the Central
Government is very much strengthened, for all the lucrative sources of revenue
are given to it. In this matter, the Canadian and Australian example has been
followed: there, the Royal Commission appointed by the Constituent Assembly
recommended that taxing power should reside in the Dominion and that national adjustment
grants should be made to the different Provinces. The strengthening of the
Centre is, of course, in accordance with sound political principles After all,
the party can enjoy freedom only if the whole is strong. That is why, in every
country decentralization is accompanied by integration of authority. Even in a
Federation like the U.S.A., the units, which were once jealous of their power,
are now willing to strengthen the Centre. Thus the establishment of a strong
Centre is justified by current political thought and the practice in Modern
Democracies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
monarchy and party-dictatorship have been the usual forms Government in
autocratic States, Parliamentary and non-Parliamentary Governments are in
consonance with a Democratic State. A noteworthy democratic feature in the new
Constitution is that a Parliamentary Government is given to India. It has been
the view of some in our country that a stable Executive is better than the
Parliamentary Executive for a politically backward country like India. In a
system of Parliamentary Executive, the parties inside and outside the
legislature may make capital out of popular ignorance and lethargy and subvert
the Executive. So much so, the Executive may become the slave of the
legislature. This cannot be better illustrated than by referring to the ugly
happenings which led to the fall of Mr. Prakasam’s Ministry in our own
Province. But if the people remain politically dull and lethargic, Democratic
Government of any type–Parliamentary or non-Parliamentary–is bound to be a
failure. So, why should we throw into the dustbin of history a type of
Government with which we have been familiar? Ever since 1921 there has been a
gradual development of Parliamentary institutions and responsible Government in
our country. We have been habituated to it. Moreover, it has been a grand
success in Great Britain and the Dominions. The Fourth French Republic has
again adopted it. No wonder that a Parliamentary Executive, having such a
brilliant record, is considered to be the best for our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
several respects the new Constitution is out and out a democratic one. The
Indian National Congress, which functioned as the voice of India, has been a
champion of Democracy and an enemy of Fascism and Imperialism. It always stood
for the right of self-determination, adult suffix age and other democratic
rights. It needs little illustration to point out that Mahatma Gandhi, the
architect of Modern India, and Pandit Nehru, India’s man of destiny, are ardent
democrats and sworn enemies of Fascism. As early as March 1936, when the
so-called Western Democracies admired Mussolini, Pandit Nehru, then he visited
Italy, refused a <i>pressing </i>invitation from Mussolini to see him. Again in
1938, he declined an invitation of the Nazi Government to visit Germany, but
instead he visited Czechoslovakia. Thus Pandit Nehru definitely proved himself
to be a foe of Fascism even when it was in its heyday of power. This champion
of Democracy and peoples’ rights moved the eloquent and high-spirited’
resolution in the Constituent Assembly declaring India a Sovereign Republic.
Though some members of the Constituent Assembly considered the resolution as
hasty, in view of the States having a monarchical Government, Nehru’s
resolution was carried. Thus, according to the new Constitution, India is
declared a Republic <i>i.e., </i>a State having a Government of the people and
by the people. Will it conflict in any way with her status as a Dominion? This
may cause some headache to constitutional experts. But one does not cut his head
to cure his headache, Rather, he should find a way out. In this connection, it
is instructive to note the words of the late Prof. A. B. Keith who said: “If no
place can be found in a British Commonwealth for Republics, then the enduring
character of the Commonwealth may well be doubted.” Due to change of
circumstances, a change may also come in the conception of their Commonwealth,
so that Republics may find a place in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most remarkable phenomenon in the history of democracy in the past century has
been the steady evolution of the suffrage from a narrow and unequal system to
one which is now virtually universal and equal. In all Modern Democracies the
long movement for universal suffrage has today triumphed. The Indian National
Congress, which always fought for democratic rights, has been a staunch
supporter of adult suffrage, and as early as 1928 the Nehru Committee adopted
it. It was suggested to the Simon Commission which, however, ruled it out as
impracticable. The result was that, according to the Act of 1935, only 14 per
cent of the total population of what was British India have the right of
franchise. Thus the so-called popular legislatures are representative, not of
all people but only of a few. But the fathers of our Constitution have taken a
long step towards the establishment of democratic freedom by the introduction
of adult suffrage. All people not less than 21 years will have the right of
franchise. Thus, as India emerges as a full-fledged Democracy, adult suffrage
is introduced in all direct elections. Political liberty and political equality
are at last conceded to the people of our country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
equally important democratic feature in the new Constitution is the abolition
of the fateful communal electorates and the formation of joint electorates.
Ever since 1909, the Muslims have had the right to elect the representatives
exclusively by the members of their own community. This right was extended to
the Sikhs in 1919, and when the British Government in 1932 tried to extend to
the ‘scheduled castes’, Gandhiji came to the rescue of the Hindus by deciding
to ‘fast unto death’. It needs little argument to point out the defects in the
system of communal electorates, for it is palpably reactionary and
undemocratic. It is reactionary, for the members chosen on a communal basis
will always think in terms of their communities but not of the nation. It has
been the greatest impediment in the way of healthy political development of the
nation and its progress towards responsible Government. As the authors of the
Montage Chelmsford-Chelmsford Rep remarked: “The history of self- Government
among the nations who developed it and spread it through the world, is
decisively against the admission by the State of any divided allegiance,
against the State’s arranging its members in any way which encourages them to
think of themselves primarily as citizens of any smaller unit than itself.” In
fact, the development of the fateful idea of Pakistan and its fruition today
have been the direct results of separate electorates. The system of separate
electorates is as undemocratic as it is unprogressive. Under it, the Choice of
the voter is restricted and narrowed to his own community: he will not have the
liberty to choose the person he likes best. According to the new Constitution,
true to the principles of Democracy, members for the federal as well as
provincial legislatures will be elected from joint electorates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
democratic Constitution has become synonymous with a written and a rigid
Constitution, for the fundamental principles which govern the State cannot be
left to the hazards of a chance majority in the legislature. So, since the 18th
century, written constitutions have become popular and today almost all
countries have written constitutions. Countries having an unwritten
Constitution, like Great Britain, possess written elements. A democratic
Constitution is made not only written, but also rigid to avoid the unlimited
authority of Parliament. The Constitution of the Indian Republic is a written
and a rigid Constitution. A separate procedure, different from that followed in
passing statute law, must be followed to bring about an amendment to the
Constitution. An amendment to the Constitution may be suggested by either House
of the Federal Legislature. It must be passed in both the Houses by two-thirds
of the members present. Then it must be ratified by half the Provinces.
Finally, it must receive the assent of the Rashtrapati or President. From this
procedure, which has to be adopted in passing a constituent law, one can see
that our Constitution is not made as rigid as the American Constitution. The
procedure for amendment is made reasonably accessible, without being too easy
of access. But, after all, to quote the oft-repeated words of Prof. Lowell, the
distinction between rigid and flexible constitutions is one of degree rather
than of kind, and the necessary changes can be brought about by various other
means. Our new-born Constitution, like other rigid constitutions in the world,
must keep pace with the times by the growth of customs, conventions and
judicial interpretations. A Constitution drafted today will not be suited for
all time. “For the real Constitution in any country is like the photograph of
an individual: no matter how good a likeness it may be today, it will not be a
good likeness ten years or even five years later. The general features of the
individual, as of a Government, may remain unaltered, but the picture is no
longer true to life.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Constitution of Independent India, like any other democratic Constitution, will
be a charter of the people’s freedom. Ever since the Declaration of Rights in
the American Constitution, it has become common to incorporate them in the
constitutions of different countries. The Fundamental Rights incorporated in
our Constitution, which establish equality between all, irrespective of
religion, race, caste or sex, are enforceable by law. In this respect, they are
based on the Irish model and differ from those in the Constitution of the U. S.
S. R. The Indian polity is based on the twin principles of liberty and
equality, the watchwords of Democracy. The individual is made the end, and the
social and political regulations a means. The decision of the Constitution
makers regarding the legal abolition of untouchability “will rank with much
historic events as the rise of Buddhism or the protest of Luther.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the scheme of Fundamental Rights is not without its limitations. Some rights
such as the right to work, or the right to public assistance in case of
unemployment, old age, sickness etc., are not cognizable by any court. One is
led to think that the grave economic inequalities in out side the country may
continue in future, and as Pandit Nehru himself remarked, (in commenting on the
Declaration of the Rights of Man drafted by a Committee of eminent British
political thinkers with H. G. Wells as Chairman: <i>The Hindu</i>, April 15,
1946), “any Declaration of the Rights of Man will be ineffective under
capitalism and imperialism.” The withholding of economic liberty from the
people makes the Constitution a bourgeoisie Constitution. But it must be noted
that, though the above-mentioned rights are not cognizable by any court, it
will be the endeavour of the Government to implement them in practice. The
makers of the Constitution made an omission in not enumerating the Fundamental
Duties of Man. The incorporation of Fundamental Duties along with the
Fundamental Right of Man, as is done in the Constitution of the U. S. S. R.
will have great significance, for it would mean that there can be no rights in
the absent of functions. He who discharges his duties only can enjoy rights. As
Gandhiji remarked: “I suggest the right way. Begin with a charter of Duties of
Man, and I promise that the Rights will follow as spring follows winter.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
India is at last being given a democratic Constitution. But freedom is not a
thing which can be deposited in a written Constitution or in any Declaration of
Rights. The people must have the alertness and vision to protect their rights
and liberties, for “where there is no vision the people perish”. A parchment
roll in which the rights of the people may be enumerated can never be a
guarantee of their freedom. If the people remain lethargic and ignorant, even
within the framework of the Constitution, dictatorship may arise. Did not
Mussolini and Hitler become dictators by constitutional means? The success of
the Indian Democracy depends on the political sagacity and democratic
tendencies of the people. The structure is erected by architects of consummate
skill and fidelity. It future depends upon the new social and economic order
that has to emerge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a particular language. The French, Italian, German, etc., are nations named
after a language. One would have thought that language is a primary determining
factor of nationhood. That there are other <span class=SpellE>nationhoods</span>,
like the Russian or the Indian, which are <span class=GramE>multilingual</span>
does not detract from the primary role of language in determining nationhood.

fundamental difference between a language and a branch of knowledge like, say
mathematics, or a machine like, say the motor car, is that the criterion of
truth in a science, and of efficiency in a machine, are extra-national. A
particular mathematical theory is not regarded as correct because it is current
in a particular nation. Mathematics may have originated in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But the validity of the
mathematical ideas of a <span class=SpellE>Ramanujum</span> or an Einstein is
not judged by finding out how far they conform to the Indian or the Greek
practice. The car may have been invented in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> but the efficiency of a car
is not judged by considering how far it is a faithful copy of the American
model. The standards of correctness or chastity of a language, on the other
hand, are judged by conformity to the current and accepted practice in a
particular nation. A particular pronunciation of English is correct because
that is the current pronunciation in the south of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. A particular idiom is chaste
English because it is current in particular circles in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. A
language thus by its very nature is national. English is what the Englishman
speaks. What others speak is only English in as much as it conforms to it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have begun to say that by English they do not mean the ‘English’ English. There
can be such a language as Indian English as there is American English.
Americans do not very much care whether their pronunciation and idiom conform
to what is accepted at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>.

is overlooked. The majority of Americans have descended from the Englishmen who
migrated to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Americans have not acquired the English language by laborious and formal
instruction at school. Their language, therefore, is not likely to deviate from

unintelligible to those who know only ‘English’ English. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

on the other hand, have acquired the use of the English language on pain of
starvation. English, so far, has not succeeded in displacing Indian languages
excepting where the British Government displaced them at the point of the
bayonet. The process of acquiring English, for an Indian, is very prolonged,
involving whole-time learning for about 10 to 15 years, constantly keeping the
English norm in view. If the English norm is no longer there, the type of
English that will develop in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may be something like the Pidgin English of the Africans which cannot be
understood by those who know only English (and those who know Pidgin English
only, cannot understand English). For all we know, if the English norm is not
kept in view, Indian English may become indistinguishable from <i>Roman
Hindustani. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again
the whole argument for English is based on the fact that it is the language of
a large number of English and American people who have produced a very rich
literature on all subjects. Anyone else who wants to take advantage of the wide
intelligibility of English in England and America, and the vast literature
produced by these nations, must always try to conform to the English that is
accepted as English by them. Any other English will be English only in name. It
follows, therefore, that English, for the Indian, will for ever remain a
foreign language. It cannot be appropriated to ourselves by just<i> </i>calling
it our own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this connection, the English enthusiasts should remember the message which the
poet <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> sent to Indo-English writers. When <span
class=SpellE>Yeats</span> was asked whether he had any message for Indo-English
writers, <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> is reported to have said “Yes, I have.
Don’t write in English.” In spite of the fact that most of our educational
resources in the last 150 years have been concentrated on acquiring the use of
English, we have not produced a single writer whose writing can be said to be a
part of English literature. Tagore was avowedly a Bengali author translated
into English. Authors like Dr. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span> are read
in the West not for </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

surroundings as an English child, will be as efficient in English as the
English child. (Even about such cases, Psychologists like lung, with their
theory of the racial unconscious, will maintain that an Indian child will not
be able to get rid of its Indian linguistic ancestry even if he is removed to <st1:country-region

What is true, therefore, of a solitary child, cannot be true of a nation. A
vast body of Indian teachers will have to do the teaching of English with their
Indian pronunciation and Indian idioms, constantly on guard lest their English
may degenerate into Roman Hindustani, by keeping the <span class=GramE>standard</span>
English authors and standard BBC accent in view. We can thus never be creative

Rao observes that our language policy should be based on present
communicational needs. I would agree with this statement if the word ‘present’
is dropped from it. The present communicational needs in India have been
artificially brought about by a military conquest. If our country had been
conquered by the Chinese or the Japanese, Chinese or the Japanese would have today
occupied the same place as English is occupying. Since we <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>are now free to choose our own language, the
fact that we were conquered by the English should no longer weigh in choosing a
Union-language. In fact a self-respecting nation would regard that as a reason
for not having English. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>What then are
the communicational needs of the Indians? Most Indian languages are highly
developed instruments of expression with thousands of years of literary history
behind them. It is only deplorable ignorance of our own languages, and fashions
of thought perpetuated by our subjugation, that have given rise to the widely
held view that the Indian languages are inferior to English. No Indian would
need English for communication if the Government does not make it obligatory
that English must be used. Most Indians can satisfy all their communicational
needs by learning their mother-tongue. A few who will serve the Union
Government will need to know the language of the Union Government, which
according to the Constitution is Hindi. Since Hindi is the mother-tongue of
over 10 <span class=SpellE>crores</span> of Indians, it follows that those who
are included in these over 10 <span class=SpellE>crores</span> will not need to
learn any language other than their mother-tongue even if they serve the Union
Government. Who then needs English in India? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>The answer is
that only those who have received education <span class=SpellE>upto</span> M.
A., and want to pursue the subject of their special study throughout life, need
to know English. But here also the claims of English are not exclusive. The
claims of French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish cannot be ignored. It is
very often laid by the English enthusiasts that these other languages are not
as rich as English in scientific literature. But this does not mean that we can
afford to ignore these languages. English may have 100 technical papers for
every 70 in German but the 100 English papers are no substitute for the German
ones. For every hundred knowing graduates, we must therefore produce at least
70 German knowing ones. It follows, therefore, that even as a foreign language,
English cannot have any monopoly in the Indian system of education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ignored the question of the level of ability in a foreign language that is
needed by us. Even the life-long research workers need to know English only for
comprehension purposes. They need not be able to express themselves in English.
A comprehension level of ability in a language can be attained much more easily
than the expression level of ability. It is quite sufficient to start the study
of English or some other European language at the University level. Six years’
study <span class=SpellE>upto</span> the M.A. standard by highly intelligent
people, for whom alone University education should be reserved, should be
sufficient for the attainment of a comprehension level of ability in European
languages. I would recommend, therefore, that the incubus of English should be
removed altogether from our schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fallen a prey to the missionary myth that India has thousands of languages. He
has also referred to the languages spoken by one person. In that sense, India
does not have thousands but 400 million languages. The linguistic distribution
of present day India can be adequately covered by about 10 languages. Even
these 10 languages are so similar to each other that if English had not
interfered in the last 150 years most Indians would have been able to follow
each other in their own languages. A Maharashtrian does not take much time to
follow <span class=SpellE>Gujerati</span> or Punjabi, even with the present
hindrance of English, if he stays for a few weeks in <span class=SpellE>Gujerati</span>
or Punjabi areas. If the hindrance of English were not there, migrants to other
provinces would have tried more sincerely to understand the inhabitants of
their new province in their own language. This is hardly a matter of weeks. The
so-called linguistic heterogeneity of India is a myth created by the votaries
of English. Just as the British rule prevented the integration of the Indian
nation, the English language has prevented the integration of the Indian
languages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

English into Hindi. Here he is on the weakest ground in his argumentation.
Comparing the cost of producing the required literature in Indian languages
with the cost of teaching English to every school-going child, is like
comparing the cost of setting up a car industry in India with the cost of
importing cars for all time to come or the cost of building a road with the
cost of every <span class=SpellE>traveller</span> making his own road. If we
are turning out 2 million English knowing students, the cost involved is at
least 20 million man-years, on the assumption that about 10 years whole time
study is needed for acquiring the use of English. Again this cost in man-years
is perpetual and ever-increasing. In 20 million man-years the entire literature
of English can be translated several times over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this connection, it should be noted that the Hindi that should become the Union
language will be different from the Hindi that is the mother-tongue of a
particular province. The all-India Hindi will have the inflections of <span

a predominantly Sanskrit vocabulary. Since Sanskrit vocabulary is common to all
the Indian languages, including Tamil, and the inflections of <span

fairly common throughout India, the apprehension that people coming from a
particular province will have an undue advantage in handling such a language is
largely imaginary. After about a couple of decades, it is quite certain that
the South Indians will be able to influence the development of Hindi itself
according to their own genius. Indians can never hope to influence the growth
of the English language according to their own genius. That this will not be
the case with Hindi is evident from the fact that many pioneers of Hindi
literature came from the non-Hindi speaking sections. South Indians form more
than one-third of the population of India and it is inconceivable that if they
take to Hindi, Hindi will dominate them. It is more rational to expect that <i>they

“reciprocity in disability.” It is strange to hear that knowledge is a
disability. I do not myself know any South Indian language but many south
Indian languages must be having literatures almost as rich as that of Marathi
or Bengali and purely from the educational point of view the knowledge of the
life and literature of the South Indians will be a valuable achievement. Besides,
if our educational system produces people who are intimately conversant with

million people with a long, and on the whole proud, history will not take time
to become rich in all types of literature and spread at least throughout Asia.
Even now with great political disadvantages, Hindi has spread to Ceylon, Burma
and South East Asia. If we adopt the right policy it can soon become a major
language of Asia. Our prestige will rise higher if our language becomes a major
language in the world. This will promote Hindi studies throughout the world,

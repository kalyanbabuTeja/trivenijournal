style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
‘Gitanjali’ envisages a merging, by mystical elevation, of the human in the
Divine, the impermanent in the Permanent. It gathered supreme importance, both
in the public mind and the Poet’s immortality, to the neglect, comparatively,
of his other works and their range. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the latter are Tagore’s exquisite love-lyrics, which are only referred to, by
authors, in passing. Much of poetry expresses the passion of love in a kind of
ecstatic outburst. The poet, in the capacity of a lover, sings the feelings of
his heart in a burning poem. He tells the beloved of hill distress in her
absence, his consuming desire to always have her in his sight, his fear and
trepidation at her silence, his soul’s threnody at being rejected or crossed.
But the poems of Tagore are a class by themselves. They may not be startlingly
new in the Indian tradition, but, in the West, save for a hint in Thomas Hardy,
there is no tradition of writing poems in his style, whose characteristic beauty–a
beauty which finds greater definition and dignity in his mystical verse–is,
what may be called, the capture of a moment or a phase of emotion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
guileless youth may fall a prey to Cupid’s dart when still a boy of fourteen or
even younger, and try to soar to Parnassus for help. The early poems of Byron,
some of Shelley’s juvenile scribblings, are a couple of instances in point.
They are romantic ravings of transparent sincerity, heightened by the blind
sexual effervescence of adolescence, and cramped in the trappings of an
ununderstood idealism. But with age, in fact with every minute, the emotion
change, having gained by experience and introspection what can be within the
space of that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, at a later date, the person begins to discover how differently the text of
love then reads. That, perhaps, is one of the reasons for a prevalent idea that
a person falls in love but once in his life, his other <i>affaires d’amore </i>being
considered purely on th6 basis of sex. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tagore’s
love poetry not only brings out this difference in the growth of feelings with
remarkable insight and subtlety, but also captures the fleeting moments of the
passion as it expresses itself in a certain state of mind with a multitude of
associations. For love is a state of maximum expansion of the ego. In that
state of intoxication familiarly called love, the entire atmosphere becomes
instinct with life and meaning. The lover (man or woman) projects his or her
heightened consciousness on all things animate and inanimate. The stars, the
sky, its colour and clouds, the trees, the birds, the flower and fruit, the
winds and weathers, all suddenly acquire a meaning. The stars are either cruel
in their Courses or benevolent and worthy of trust; the sky changes its colours
either with cold, indifferent beauty or with consoling regard; the birds are
calling forlornly to their mates or are merrily wafting from branch to branch,
at peace with the rest of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The poems in the ‘Gardener’, as the author himself
tells us in the Preface, are of ‘love and life’ and written much earlier than
the ‘Gitanjali’. As an illustration of the point stated above regarding the
changes in love at different times ‘we may compare the poem’ (25) “Come to us,
youth, tell us truly why there is madness in your eyes”, with “We are to play
the game of death tonight, my bride and I” (‘Gardener’ 82). In the first the
youth ends the poem by replying, “my feet are languid with the burden of my
heart.” The entire poem suggests the indolent and the idealist languor of all
love at an early age. The youth has a great and enjoyable burden in his heart,
and that is <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the second poem, the lover speaks of his bride and himself realising love in
the terrors of a storm. “The night is black, the clouds in the sky are
capricious, and the waves are roaring at sea.” Her hair is flying in the wind,
her veil is fluttering, her garland rustles over her breast.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
poems Nos. 7 and 56 (‘Gardener’) show two very different phases of love which
Tagore tries to express. In the first it is all a mere adolescent love at first
sight. “But the young Prince did<i> </i>pass by our door and I flung the jewel
from my breast before his path.” From her window the girl sees the Prince pass
and flings both her necklace and the jewel from her breast (i.e. her heart)
before him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the second, love is an old acquaintance with strange vagaries in his behaviour.
He comes like a harsh light, drags the trembling heart into the open, tears all
reserve and modesty to shreds and then abandons the once beloved, leaving
greater darkness and sorrow behind. The woman who had been working with others
has fallen a victim to his ruse. She responds and perhaps enjoys. And then, “I
hoped my love would be saved from the shivering shame of the shelterless, but
you turn your face away.” Here are lines spoken not by a chit of a girl, whose
heart is borne away by the splendour of a Prince, but spoken by a woman, who
has known all the pleasures of womanhood and love in their maturity. And
suddenly he has turned away his face. In the closing lines, how clearly and
with what unbearable poignance–poignance intensified by the resigned and
hopeless spirit in which they are spoken–all this and much more are brought
out:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Yes,
your path lies open before you, but you have cut off return, and left me
stripped naked before the world with its lidless eyes staring night and day.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
in the ‘Gardener’ and the ‘Lover’s Gift’ (the latter is unfortunately not
translated by the author himself) several poems can be found which bear out the
idea given above. However, there are a greater number of matured poems and
comparatively fewer of the adolescent, perhaps because, at the time of
translation, Tagore preferred the reality of the former to the nebulous beauty
of the latter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not a mere poetic expression of the feelings of a particular person. It may
be that the poem brings out the characteristic shyness of a maiden, who knows
she is within her lover’s sight. But then, there are shades and shades of
shyness. In poem No 8 of the ‘Gardener’ when she is seated by<i> </i>her
window, the young traveller comes to her ‘in the rosy mist of<i> </i>the
morning’ and asks her, with an eager cry, “Where is she?” The answer is known
to her but–<o:p></o:p></span></p>

delightfully absurd that her name should not be revealed to Him, “for he only
comes and goes away!” But it is only in such meaningless little absurdities
that Tagore manages to capture the fleeting moments of betrayal of a woman’s
heart, by herself. In the above quoted poems, the woman betrays her secret by
her shyness, in various phases of its expression. The shyness in the glance
between two sisters and their meaningful smile, because somebody stands behind
the trees whenever they go to fetch water, is incomparably different from the
shyness which successfully stifles the rebellious words just behind her lips,
“She is I, young traveller, she is I!” And without the entire context in which
the idea is expressed, the feeling would lack completion and the subtle
differentiating shade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

poet intends to convey the sudden emotion as it sprang in him. The words
employed are exquisite and expressive. The emotion is healthy and animal,
awakened to life by the touch of the end of her skirt. As a painter, with a few
strokes of his brush, brings his figures into bold relief, the poet, by a few
unforgettable metaphors, prepares the reader for a complete and sympathetic
appreciation of the pathetically stormy feeling of the last line, “It fell upon
my heart like the sigh of her body and whisper of her heart”. (Incidentally,
the sound of this line is marred by the too close repetition of the heart’).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

various reasons women, all the world over, have been subject to social slavery.
They have not been given a chance to express their personalities with freedom.
Though conditions in the West have changed greatly, in India women are still in
a position of social subordination. In fact the ideal of wifehood in India is the
adoration of her husband us a god. Similar conditions have prevailed till very
recently in China. Free talk, hearty joking and loud laughter by women, even in
their homes, are still a matter for grave concern. Whatever the desires that
may burn within a woman’s heart, she ought, if she would be considered moral
and modest, to refrain from expressing them. So, half the world has spoken, the
other has yet to speak, and naturally woman has been made a mystery. “Who
knows,” the protagonists of this social injustice and cruelty wonder, “what
unknown and unknowable wells of love and hatred bubble within a woman…..” and
so on <i>ad nauseam, </i>as if, given a fair chance, she could not be as
inhumanly human as man generally is! Mankind put her on a pedestal, adored her
for a goddess and neatly muzzled her mouth. It is extremely absorbing to
analyse why this has been and how it has evolved, but this is not the place for
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this background Tagore attempts to explore ‘mysterious woman’, and makes her
express her innermost thoughts. There is no such practice in poetical
literature of any respectable proportion. Man has always spoken of himself, his
love, his ardour, his achievements and what not. Here and there we find a stray
poetess or woman-painter, trying her best, in the ridiculous guise of
conventional forms, to express herself vaguely and with restraint. The poems
spoken by women in India are largely of a religious character. The only notable
exception is found among those whom we complacently allude to as the tribal
peoples: the Ghonds, the Pardhis etc. Their poems, both by men and women, are
extremely free expression and direct in thought. Tagore also has tried to make
woman articulate and has achieved astonishing success. He<b> </b>almost gets
beneath their skin. Their coyness, their vague fear of love, their utter and
perilous abandonment in moments of passion, their confusion at the glance of
their lover, their predilection for flattery, their betrayal through care to
conceal, are all brought out with remarkable insight and delicacy, with an eye
to womanly restraint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somewhere,
in one of his prose writings, Tagore himself deplores paucity of such poems.
Though, in his translated works, the proportion of such poems is very small in
comparison with others, yet it sets a tradition worth emulation, both in method
and character. It must be remembered that it is a particularly difficult type
for men poets to attempt. Lyric poetry being the communication of very intimate
and personal experience, objectivity is difficult to attain. A love lyric is
therefore bound to be ecstatic and subjective, endeavouring to communicate a
certain phase or mood of our emotion or mind toward love. It is for this very
good reason that lyrics are mostly written in the first person. Although, all
the poet does, in writing love lyrics spoken by women, is to express his own
feelings as if they belonged to the ‘fair sex’, or to express in a particular
state of mind what ideas or emotions he presumes are theirs, yet such an
attempt demands objectivity enough to consistently use the woman’s code and
symbolism and to maintain certain fundamental differences between man and
woman. And the poems of Tagore are worked out even in this respect to a nicety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

such subtlety characterises almost all the poems of Tagore, whether of love or

greater intensity in the subsequent stanzas. His poems move in a crescendo, the

there. Perhaps it is an urge for a climax or the modern trend to bring all
things to a crashing finish for effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I do not intend to deal here with the outlook of Tagore on, or his attitude to,
love; yet in connexion with his love poems. I might risk a few remarks on the
idealist disappointment in some of them. The experiences of the body are
shorter if tangibly more in tense, while those of the mind or heart are more
enduring, and perhaps because the mind is a more specialised form of matter than
the body, its experiences are on a more specialised if not higher plane. It may
be that the passion of love has its origin entirely in the appetites of the
body and is a subtler and more restrained form of their expression, but it is
also an attitude of the mind developed through ages under the pressure of
certain socio-sexual inhibitions functioning for the solidarity of society,
which inculcates the idea of the sanctity of monogamy, to finally assume the
dignity of a hunger for in intellectual companionship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attitude of the mind is foredoomed to disappointment, for the limitations of a
personality are precise, permitting of negligible elasticity, but the illusions
of the mind are illimitable. It is not so much familiarity that breeds contempt
as the inflexibility of our pre-conceived notions. The pious virgin may turn
over a shameless and incorrigible voluptuary, and the implacable misogenist the
ideal husband. But all these risks are a part of the perilously delightful game
of love and marriage, and only the brave deserve the fair. The disappointment
of Tagore which is not very unique (it is in fact a fairly common experience
among poets), is the failure of a union in love above mere mating: a kind of
spiritual oneness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that his Indian friends tell him, these lyrics, “are in the original...full of
subtlety of rhythm, of untranslatable delicacies of colour, of metrical
invention...” But we might be grateful that Tagore translated his poems at all.
The translation itself is so well done, in fidelity to the spirit of their
original, that Yeats did not scruple to include in his compilation of an Oxford
Anthology of Modern English Verse, a couple of poems from Tagore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is, on the whole, superfluous to praise Tagore.
He is securely ensconced in the Pantheon of the world’s immortal poets. But his
immortality has been severely one-sided. One reason for this is that Tagore’s
religious and mystical poems borrow the symbolism of the lover and the beloved.
It is usually contended that it is bound to be so, because human expression,
which is conditioned and limited to the five senses, is insufficient for the
communication of experiences beyond mind and matter. It is not without reason
therefore that there are critics who claim a mystical character and import for
the otherwise popularly downright epicurean ‘Rubbaiyat’ of Khayam. Although Tag<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>ore is clear as to the nature of his beloved
or lover, and the very first lines are enough to differentiate a poem of
mystical ecstasy from one of mundane human love, yet there is at times not a
little cause for confusion. For instance, the poem referred to earlier, which
speaks of the young Prince and the maid who threw the jewel from her breast
before his path, lends itself perfectly to mystical construction. Again,
critics of varied skill and insight have tried to assess the philosophical
content and contribution of Tagore’s poems and have invariably laid so much
stress upon his greatness as a mystical poet, that in the common mind he has
come to be associated with message, vision, intuition and other not very easily
comprehensible ideas. His other writings also bear the stamp of his genius. If
they do not convey </span>messages and sing to you of those moments of
communion with an eternal and immanent spirit manifesting itself in every item
of creation, to the eye that has the power to see and the mind that has the
breadth to conceive, they still are close to the heart, for they speak of the
commoner experiences, the joys and sorrows, the laughter and tears, which are
the lot of every man.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is true that these poems do not have that which
so pleases the distracted minds of the old and broken, and also there is not in
them the mellow richness which comes with age. These early poems are full of
the faults, if one would care to see, of the unreasonable dementia of the
youthful mind. In his exuberance of heart, the poet crowds his early poems with
deoorations in simile and metaphor, and colour and language, not common to
ordinary man. There is talk of princes and pearls, chariots and horses foaming
at the mouth: bodices of the colour of the peacock’s throat and mantles green
as young grass, kingdoms and queens, drunken bees and dew-drops on lotus
leaves, moonlit nights and jasmine wreaths, that thrill to the heart like
praise in a riot of extravagance. What among these can match the simplicity and
sparseness of the poems of his ‘Gitanjali’? In the latter, the fever is gone,
the flesh is as good as dead, and only the spirit or mind in an ecstasy soars
and sings. And yet, to those of the common run of humanity, the poems of love
and life touch a more sympathetic chord, for they (poems) do not speak of the
realm of experiences the spirit, but they bring back to the mind the more
commonly shared joys and the more widely known disappointments and sorrows of
men. The ordinary men, uninitiated in the mysteries of spirit, is naturally
impatient of mysticism, as so much high-brow pedantry Poetry, which is not
taken to very kindly by most men because it is not straightforward and
downright prose, becomes anathema when all it conveys is beyond normal
experience. It beats men’s understanding, and beaten men have no praise for
their opponents, though they may be awed into respecting.</p>

music, for then is touched within them a kindred chord. I am one with the
general opinion regarding the greatness of the religious poems of Tagore, and

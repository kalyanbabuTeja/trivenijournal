sanction such a radical social change? A Christian may approve of a prophet
like Vinobaji, who only kindles the fires of charity. But will<i> </i>he
endorse Professor Mohonalobis’ socialistic pattern of society? The answer
cannot be given in<i> </i>a word. One must go back to Christ and is<i> </i>teaching
and, to some extent, to the history of the Christian Church, to find an answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
careful reading of the Gospels would show that Christ<i> </i>never came to
preach an economic revolution. He was not a socialist agitator in any sense. He
and his followers were not proletarians. He came to preach a spiritual
redemption: “Repent, for the kingdom of God is<i> </i>at hand.” It is Luke
(from whom Christian Socialists get all their favourite texts) who gives us a
different impression of Christ in this matter. Luke, as we know, was a
physician, and in the course of his practice, we may gather, he saw much of the
disinherited classes, for whom he developed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a sympathy. And
Christ’s ‘gospel to the poor’, being in line with his own sympathies, naturally
excited him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
point of fact, however, Christ was not even true to his </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>prophetic
character in this respect. Amos, for instance, would, denounce the rich for
“grinding the faces of the poor’– (what a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>master-piece of
expression, by the way), and even one of Jesus’ own followers, James, would
indulge in a piece of soap-box oratory: “Go to now, ye rich men, howl and weep
for Your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted and your
garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them
shall be a witness against you.” But there is nothing of the kind in the
gospels. Mary would sing, even before Christ’s birth: ‘He filleth the hungry
with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away,’ but Christ would not
adopt it. I am inclined to think that in this matter, not only Luke and Mary,
but also a historian like H. G. Wells, seem to have been carried away by their
enthusiasm. H. G. Wells writes ‘His (Christ’s) teaching condemned all the
gradations of the economic system, all private wealth. Is it any wonder that
all who were rich and prosperous felt a horror of strange things, a swimming of
their head at his teaching?’ I think it needs to be considerably qualified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
far as one could see, Christ himself never made the rich as a class feel like
that. It was the Pharisees, the religious </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>leaders, who were like
a bad smell to him, not the rich. He accepted invitations to dinner from the
rich. He invited himself to the house of Zacheus, the chief of the Publicans, a
well-to-do man. Among his followers were many women, one of whom, as Luke takes
care to point out, was Joanna the wife or Herod’s steward, one who had to do
with the palace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
teaching on riches too was not an affront to the rich. ‘Thou <i>fool</i> not
thou <i>thief’</i> (the Marxian word), is what he says to the man who would
build bigger barns to store up his goods. He was only pointing out the
materialist’s flimsy foundations. His ‘Go, sell all that thou hast and give to
the poor and, come, take up the cross,’ we may fairly assume, was prescribed
for a particular case (found to be unpalatable medicine, alas)–an invitation to
one individual to give up his gold that he may have a treasure of stars, to
find his chiefest good in an uneconomic but profitable exchange.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was one of his followers, not Christ, who called money ‘filthy lucre’. His
disciples were to live by alms, and at the same time, paradoxically, they could
carry a bag with money in it. Money was safe in the hands of people who were
ready to throw away their very lives. The fact that the man who carried the
bag, Judas, was a failure did not make money essentially bad. The sin of Judas
was not so much that he betrayed the Son of man (and that, meanly, with a kiss)
nor his love of money as that he estimated the eternal in terms of thirty
pieces of silver. Calvary, apart from the redemptive purpose of God for the
world, was the result of a complete collapse of values on man’s side. But as
against Judas’s failure, Christ found his breath taken away by the beauty of a
poor widow woman casting two mites–all her living–into the temple treasury. For
the money-changers in the temple, he had only a whip; for this woman, the most
un-qualified praise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
he disapproved of riches, in particular circumstances, and the <i>love of </i>money
(or covetousness) in all circumstances, it was only to warn people against the
dangers inherent in them. The love of money was the root of all evil, and
riches were a snare, because, inevitably they multiplied one’s wants (top-hats,
among them). And multiplicity of wants condemned one to peripheral living. It
was the worst enemy of that simplicity of life, that centering down, which he
so much prized and so clearly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

birds and the flowers, he said, had very few wants and they were happy, not
only happy but creative, Give a bird a nest and a worm and it will sing at
heaven’s gate. And all that a lily needs is a little patch of sunshine and
soil, and it will purple the green hill-side. Song and beauty may be
unmarketable, but they have the stamp of the divine. It was such ‘immaterial’
things that Christ commended to one’s consideration, not merely to one’s interest.
<i>‘Consider...</i>the<i> </i>lilies,’ <i>‘Consider </i>the birds’. There was <i>saving
</i>(not damnable) iteration in his ‘consider’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

went further and told men that while enjoying the present good (mark the little
life-affirming detail in the Gospel, his not denying himself a pillow white
asleep on a fishing-boat in Galilee), they should at the same time live by a
diviner law–take no thought for the morrow, seek first the kingdom of God, take
up the Cross. This was no rose-water gospel then. If anything, it confronted ordinary
men and women with perilous possibilities. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

God for the individual. The trouble with society is that it has allowed the
de-personalising process to go too far. Dean Matthews once complained that
during the war he was just a number, for purposes of rationing. The man who
told an acquaintance of his, “I nearly met your brother,”–and, when asked what
he meant by <i>nearly, </i>replied: “Is not your brother constable No. 110?
Well, I met No. 111,” puts the problem in a humorous light. And the woman who
named her children one by one: ‘Well, there is Meena, and Seeni, and Kittu….”

analysis, it is found to contain three very striking features. There was a <i>dispossession,

of taxation or other such means, being entirely voluntary. There was <i>distribution
</i>(one of the key-words of Socialism), but it was not a vague diffusion of
benevolence, but according as every man had need, according to the measure and
degree of each man’s need. And most important of all, there was a <i>dynamic, </i>something

arresting. In his Roman letter, written to a heterogenous group of Christians,
he speaks of all classes and races of people. He calls some of them his
‘kinsmen.’ He exhorts them to ‘greet one another with a holy kiss.’ In his
letter to the Christians at Corinth, he speaks of the fellowship meal among the
Christians on the Lord’s day. And in more than one place in his writings, he
speaks of his collecting money for the ‘poor saints in Jerusalem’ during a time
of severe famine. It was recognised on every hand that something very beautiful
was going on, and some people even remarked: ‘Behold, how these Christians love

this society did not last very long. It broke up, for several reasons. There
was no means of replenishing the common stock. The prices of the things that
were sold and laid at the Apostles’ feet could not be expected to last for
ever. There was failure at a quite ordinary level too: ‘The Greeks complained
that their widows were neglected at the daily ministrations,’ i. e. the common
meal. The Apostles tried to set it right by appointing (what we would now call)
a seven-man committee, but without much success, although the members of the
committee were ‘all filled with the holy spirit.’ There was failure at a deeper
level also. Ananias and Saphira sold their possessions and kept back part of
their money. Idealism is a fire that transforms those who give themselves to
it, but consumes the triflers, the compromisers who would not put all their

is exactly what happened to Ananias and Saphira, and two such flies were enough
to spoil the whole ointment. At the deepest level too there was failure. From
St. Paul’s strictures, we gather that the rich greased and slopped themselves at
the fellowship meal on the Lord’s day (to which each one brought his own food)
while the poor often returned home hungry. Remember, it was after this meal
(which was meant to be shared) that the most solemn rite of the Church, the
sacrament of the Lord’s passion and death, was celebrated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

time, they passed into the Christian Church which gradually grew up everywhere
with the Apostles’ missionary journeys and preaching. But an institutional
Church, however good it may be, cannot be expected to retain the revolutionary
character of the first Christian society. As time passed, the Church more and
more withdrew into itself, becoming a sort of nursery for its own faith and piety,

secondary matters. Aquinas the Aristotelean was busy speculating, among other
things, as to how many archangels could be accommodated without discomfort on a
pin-head. Augustine, another great mind of the Church, was absorbed in tracking
sin through all its metaphysical mazes, and in the excitement of this
theological game seemed to have been indifferent to even ordinary hygiene,
judging from his advice to the nuns of a certain convent not to bathe too often
but once a month. Luther had a luxurious religious pastime, namely, giving
battle to the Pope. A thunderbolt of a man, he could have shaken society to the

of these men, it may be further noted, had any very valuable social concept,

favourite City of God in conflict with society, and between them there was no
possibility of accommodation. Aquinas distinguished between the law of God and
the law of Nature. ‘Human laws,’ he taught, ‘are the application of the law of
Nature to particular circumstances. Utility has modified the law of Nature and
this utility or expediency has introduced the principle of private ownership.’
The true Aristotelean that he was, he would even quote the master: ‘Legislation
against private property may have a specious appearance of benevolence.’
Luther’s views were not any different. ‘Political and economic ordinances are
divine, because God himself ordained them,’ he taught. No Socialism, it will be
obvious, can come from such conservatism. Calvin, Luther’s successor, was only
a little less orthodox. He accepted the capitalism as it existed in his day,

much the love of money, position or comforts on the part of the clergy and the

like elections, and, in particular, in that backwash of democracy, the
committee system, which has given us, in place of the ‘committed men’ of the
first Christian society, the committee men, a new biological species. The
failure of the Church has been the failure of Archdeacon Brandon in Hugh
Walpole’s fine novel, <i>The Cathedral, </i>who would dominate even trivial
decisions in committees. It may be said, in terms of today, that the worst

this is not the whole of Church history, only a partial glimpse of it from a
particular angle. For, many times in its history, idealism <i>has </i>triumphed.
The Franciscan movement was one such triumph. St. Francis was no ascetic,
though he was found to wear a hair-shirt. Nor was he a pietist; he did not
believe in any solitary religion. On the other hand, as G. K. Chesterton puts
it beautifully, ‘he was the fire that ran along the roads of Italy, at which
men, more material, could light both torches and tapers.’ We are once again in
a beautiful world as in the days of the Apostles. Brother Juniper, one of
Francis’ disciples, would run after the thief who had stolen his cloak and beg
him to take away the hood also. In one place, we are told, the whole population
of a town, men, women and children, turned out, leaving their wealth and work
and homes, exactly as they stood, and begged to be taken into the army of God
on the spot. ‘There is in it,’ to quote Chesterton again, ‘something of the
gentle mockery of the very idea of possessions; something of a humourous sense
of bewildering the worldly.’ But it is also obvious that there was in it only a
mood for Socialism, not the mind–not the practical application of the mind to
organising the enthusiasm. In fact, Francis and his followers were indifferent
alike to private ownership and social ownership. And no Socialism of any kind
was possible on such terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

churchman of our own day, who speaks of ‘the betrayal of Christ by the
churches.’ It is true that at about the same time as Middleton Murry spoke of
the betrayal, another churchman, one of the greatest of our day, William
Temple, wrote his <i>Christianity and a social order, </i>but it has taken
centuries to bring again to the foreground what has so much receded to the
background of Christian thought and practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

revival was due in part to the revolt against social conditions, under Rousseau
in the 18th century, and the height that theoretical Socialism reached at the
end of that century, and, in a greater measure, to the profound secularising of
the gospel that took place at the beginning of the 19th century when the idea
of a secularised kingdom of God took a strong hold of religious minds. That was
the time when the Christian Social Union came into existence in England, and
soon after Morris and Ruskin in England and Tolstoi in Russia were relighting,
in their different ways, the fires of Christian Socialism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then, Christian social teaching has become part of modern liberalism. As
Bertrand Russell, who cannot be accused of any Christian bias, puts it ‘In a
new form, the ideal of Christ has passed into modern liberalism and remains the
inspiration of much that is hopeful in our world.’ Bernard Shaw goes further:
‘We find that all our practical conclusions in politics and economics are
virtually those of Jesus,’ which means, in other words, that Christian teaching
is not opposed to our most sanguine schemes of social advancement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

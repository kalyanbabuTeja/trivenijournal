in other ancient countries the Vedic people in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
recognised the law as something objective. The Gods are the administrators and
not the makers of law. In this article, late Dr. Kunhan Raja discusses the
source of law which derives its authority from its reality as an objective
factor in the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
earliest system of civil law obtaining among men is accepted as the tablets of
Hammurabi, the Assyrian king of the third millennium B. C. He did not create a
system of law for the people. He codified the system of law that had been
current in the country prior to him. The <st1:place w:st="on">Mesopotamia</st1:place>
region had been occupied by the Sumerians and no nation is known prior to them
in that region. They had their own system of civil law and this system was
adopted by their successors in the region, the Elamites. The Elamites were
replaced by the Assyrians and it was the Assyrian king, Hammurabi, who codified
them, and that tablet is now available recording the system of law promulgated
by that king. A portion in the middle has been damaged through the ravages of
time. But the major part remains in tact. The law relates to money matters in
the main. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
assyrian tablets make it clear that the law came from the Sun God. It was Ahura
Mazda, the Great God of Zoroaster, that gave the revelation to the teacher. In
the Exodus, Moses gave the teaching to the people, after he received it from
God, and also the command to spread the teaching among men. Later we have the
Roman Law, i.e., the twelve tablets and the Code of Justician. Everywhere there
is God as the giver of the law. Until recent times, practically every
philosopher in the west introduced God as the source of the law. In the New
Testament, there is the description of the teaching of the law given to Jesus
by God, in all the Gospels. Thus Christian Law is the Law of God. In Quoran
also we have the system of law taught to the Prophet by God. Practically, in
the western region in which modern civilization has its origin and development,
what is<i> </i>called law is a gift </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to humanity by God,
through a messenger. The king promulgated law as the representatives of God on
the earth, which claim was supported by the priests. Thus, law is the will of
God, and then it became the will of the king. Later when the rule of the king
was replaced by democracy, it became the will of the people expressed through
the majority. I am not taking note of the development of law in the other
ancient countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we note that God has no place </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in the origination of law. In the Rigveda
we have two terms prominently noticed. One is <i>Rita </i>and the other is <i>Vrata.
Rita </i>is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the cosmic law and Vrata is the ordinances of
the gods for the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>preservation of this cosmic law. This cosmic law
is an eternal factor in the universe and is not created by anyone, not even by
God. There is no creation of the world and there is no origination of the law.
The world was ever and is and will continue forever. This is the Indian view.
As a consequence, the law was always there, is there and will endure forever.
This is what is called the <i>Sanatana Dharma </i>or the eternal law. In the
Veda, we </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>have another term, <i>Dharma, </i>which is not
very prominent in the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>texts. But that means the same thing as
the <i>Rita. </i>There is no place where there is a reference to the law of
God. The gods were born into this law <i>Ritajata, </i>they knew the law <i>Ritagna
</i>and they preserved this law <i>Ritapa. </i>There are various other words
also which mean more or less the same thing, like <i>Ritavridh </i>(developer
of the law), and <i>Ritayu </i>(one devoted to law). But there is not even the
faintest hint that the law <i>Rita </i>came from a source. It was always there.
The gods are not spoken of as the source of law.</span><span style='font-size:

we come to the term <i>Vrata, </i>the ordinance, <i>Vrata, </i>is referred to
the gods. There is the term <i>Dhrita Vrata </i>(one who holds the law). He has
assumed that role, of one who is to administer the law. There is frequent
mention of the <i>Vrata </i>of this god, like <i>Varuna </i>and <i>Savita. </i>Any
violation of such a <i>Vrata </i>is sin and man suffers for such deviations
from the path of the <i>Vrata </i>of the gods. This only shows that the gods

the will of God. It may also be stated here that in the early Vedic literature,
there is no place given </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

as the maker of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

‘One God’, as the Supreme. The world is real; the law in the world is also an
objective reality like the world in which that law functions. Man is supreme in
the world, with no God to interfere with his freedom of action. There is no
contract between men and God, by exchanging their obedience for His Grace. The
gods, many in number, are the administrators of the objective, real law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is called the Veda, the presentation of the powers of nature, is eternal and is
not the creation of any individual; it is <i>Apaurusheya </i>(impersonal). God
never issued a commandment that “This is the law”. Gods guided men in this life
according to the law. If a man has to surrender himself to another, even if
that another is the Great God, there is no real freedom for him. It is only
when man has only to follow the law of the world and not the law arising out of
the will of another, that man can be accepted as truly free. There are the <i>Rishis
</i>who have been able to command a vision of the Veda. They never received any
gift from a God; they saw the Veda on account of their own inner illumination.
Gods were only the functionaries in the affairs of the world. They </span><span

governed the world and men in the world. Men governed </span><span

according to the objective, real law of the world and in this government, gods
were also given a part. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>Buddhistic Interpretation </h1>

never said that he was the maker of the law; he </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>did not even
claim to be the first knower of the law or as the first to promulgate the true
law among humanity. He speaks of the <i>Sanatana Dharma </i>(the eternal law)
and he also speaks about the previous Buddhas, those who had the illumination.
We do not find the Vedic religion current among the people at a later stage, in
its purity. As time changed, beliefs also changed and there was a compromise.
We do not know the original teachings of Buddha. Many doctrines known as
Buddhistic, are later additions. As Dr. Radhakrishnan says “In the <i>Questions
of Milinda, </i>we seem to get a more negative interpretation of the Buddhist
Teaching.” This may be true of the philosophy of Buddhism. Such changes have
come over even in the region of religion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a section in the Buddhistic scripture by name <i>Dharma Chakra Pravartana
Sutra. </i>This refers to the “First turning of the Wheel of the Law” by
Buddha. Gradually Buddha became the first teacher. According to the
twenty-ninth Gatha of the <i>Avesta, </i>Zoroaster was commissioned by the
Great God, Ahura Mazda, to spread the law of God among humanity. The law was
there and it was when the law was being trampled down by evil forces, that
Zoroaster was given this commission. But somehow or other every such teacher
became, in course of time, the first and the last messenger of God with a
message to humanity. The same thing happened to Buddha also. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Man
cannot know correctly. Man cannot live a life of virtue. Man cannot be happy in
this world. To know is to err, to do is to sin, and to experience is to suffer.
Such became the doctrine current among the people. The only individual who
cannot err is Buddha. Buddha is the only authority for law. Man knows correctly
only when he knows the teachings of Buddha. Man can be happy and free from sin
only by obeying the teachings of Buddha. The world does not exist as a reality
and the world is only an illusory transformation <i>Vivarta </i>of a void <i>Shunya.

such doctrines are the very opposite of the doctrine found in the Vedas. The
new doctrines could not remain aloof from the life of the people and the
beliefs of the people following the path of the Vedas also began to change.
Instead of Buddha the Vedas became the words and the teachings of God. God
became the source for the law. Even some sort of creation of the world crept
into the regions of the beliefs of the people who followed the Vedic paths. The
Veda became the sole authority for <i>Dharma. </i>The words of those who know the
truth (the <i>Aptas) </i>and their conduct too became the source for the
knowledge of <i>Dharma. </i>The consequence was that there is a portion of the
infinite Veda that is not recorded in the text of the Veda, called <i>Nashta </i>(lost)
Veda. The words of those who know the truth had such Vedic texts as the basis.
Their conduct also became authority became they could have lived only within
the Vedic injunctions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
double basis for the knowledge of the truth, the Vedas and those who know the
truth, is accepted in the <i>Sankhya, </i>in which there is no God. In the
Yoga, God is the teacher of Veda. This is accepted in the <i>Nyaya </i>also. In
the <i>Vedanta, </i>the Veda is eternal and God is the original teacher. The
words and the conduct of those who know the truth are accepted as authority in
all the systems of thought, every individual is a potential omniscient being.
Thus, the equality of man and man, the supremacy of man, the self-sufficiency
of man–these features are common to all the systems of thought that come within
the Vedic currents. These points are the exact opposites of what had been
developed in the Buddhistic thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that law and with the freedom to act according to that law. There is no power
above with a sanction to punish those who disobey this law, and there is no
such power to reward those who remain within the law. Man can do what he likes
and he suffers for his mistakes or he enjoys the fruits of his good actions.
The law derives its authority from its reality as an objective factor in the
world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

basic assumption is that man is by nature good and that a man will do the right
thing, following the law, if he knows the law. Ignorance of the law is at the root
of all sins and of all sufferings in man. Man is not a sinner; man is an
ignorant being. It is the duty of the wise man to teach the ignorant man. It is
for this reason that the study of the Vedas, which deal with <i>Dharma </i>or
Law became an obligatory part of the study of every student. It is not enough
if he is told at every step what the law is. One must know what the law is and
then act according to the law. It is only in such a case that one is recognised
to have followed the law in his life. That is why the knowledge of law should

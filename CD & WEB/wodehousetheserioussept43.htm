mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Three years ago, in June 1940, a bald-headed
Englishman of middle height and middle age was spending his holiday in his
private villa in Northern France along with his North American wife. By an
irresistible irony of fate, this man, who, in novel after novel and short story
after short story, extricated the hero from a series of tight corners, found
himself in a tighter corner than any in which he had previously placed any of
his characters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Germans took this Mr. Wodehouse prisoner at the
time of their advance on Le Toquet. Mrs. Wodehouse escaped arrest by virtue
(yes, it was still a virtue) of her American nationality. The humour-king was
reported to have told his wife that he hoped to be able to produce a serious-
novel this time in prison. We then chuckled at the statement because we were
reminded of a similar situation in which another distinguished humorist was
involved. That was Stephen Leacock, who, as Professor of Political Economy in the
McGill University, had to deliver University extension lectures. He rose to
address a Texas audience: “Ladies and Gentlemen,” he began. There was continued
and prolonged laughter–laughter, in anticipation of jokes. Trying to make his
position clear, Mr. Leacock announced, “I am serious, gentlemen.” What he said
later was drowned amidst the loud guffaws of the audience, who hailed it as the
most inimitable of his jokes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Some people say that the very thought of Wodehouse
writing a serious novel conjures up a vision before the mind’s eye which
provokes laughter of the type which Milton described as “holding both his
sides.” (Readers of the March number of <i>Triveni </i>know better than that,
for they have seen that all the great Russian Gloom Masters were humorists of
the highest order). True, the reputation of the author is against his
undertaking such a venture. In fact, P.G.’s project has been described as very
good material for the cutest publicity stunt ever planned, in total disregard
of the note of sincerity which runs through his words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To say that whether Wodehouse was serious when he
was telling his wife that he wanted to write a serious novel or no can be seen
only when actually read the novel is to try to be too clever: that is, to show
a tendency of predicting nothing which is not already known to anyone who has
given a moment’s thought to such things. The title itself, which has been
variously trumpeted as <i>Money for Jam </i>and <i>Money in the Bank</i>,
encourages us to think that it is a humorous affair: but you may say that it
might be due to the fact that we associate Wodehouse with wit. <i>Money for Jam</i>,
for all we know, may be a masterpiece on Economics. If it had been written by
someone else, we could easily have mistaken it for an economic treatise on the
barter system: but with Wodehouse, no. For he has written at least three other
books, all brimming with hunour, bearing similar titles–<i>Uneasy Money</i>, <i>Big
Money</i>, and <i>Money for Nothing</i>, not to mention innumerable short
stories like <i>Pots of Money</i>. A review of <i>Money for Nothing </i>published
in a Scottish journal contained an unconscious joke (undiscovered so far), for
the <i>Scotsman </i>said there that Mr. Wodehouse was a public benefactor. It
sounds as though the proverbial Scot’s love of money has asserted itself and
found expression in that sentence, much against his will: but what the brainy
Scot had in mind was not the love of filthy lucre but the greater happiness of
millions all over the world to which public benefactor Wodehouse was
contributing on an unprecedented scale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>There is yet another side to the personality of the
humorist. He is capable of serious novels just as Bernard Shaw is capable of
serious plays. Those who have heard and remembered P. G’s criticism of the
conversation about the all-absorbing topic of the weather will not, in this
life-time, enquire about the conditions of the atmosphere, even if all the
elemental evidence went to show that the heavens were presently coming down
crashing upon us. He says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

late August sun, had been growing warmer and warmer, until now, at three
o’clock in the afternoon, its inhabitants had divided themselves sort of
natural cleavages into two main bodies–the one crawling about and asking those
they met if this was hot enough for them, the other maintaining that what they
minded was not so much the heat as the humidity.<sup>1</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The creator of the impeccable Jeeves is one of the
most thought provoking critics of to-day. Most people miss the criticism, for
he is, like Chaucer, a perennial fountain of good humour; and his satire on
manners, customs and institutions of modern society is even more subtle than
Geoffrey’s. Almost every other time we gently smile or laugh aloud, while we
read him, there is criticism of a serious tenor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Wodehousian satire resembles in some respects
Tolstoyan satire. Probably, P. G. himself is conscious of this: for he makes
one of his characters pick Tolstoy and himself as unique in the firmament of
authors. They simply make a remark or two at the most, in the manner of a good
cartoonist making his strokes; and everything that is in their minds becomes
perfectly clear without the necessity for elaborate, grammatically phrased
paragraphs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

criticism of cricket, until with one stroke, it is revealed to us that Mr.
Crocker is a super-fan of baseball–a game in no way superior to cricket,
though, it must be said to its credit, that something or other always seems to
happen at baseball. In his shortest novel, <i>Doctor Sally</i>, we find that
during the ‘consultation’, the world-famous nerve-specialist, Sir Hugo Drake,
takes a few tips on holding the golf-club from Dr. (Miss.) Sally, and does
nothing else. Can a greater admonition of the sporto-maniac possibly exist?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Wodehouse was interned in what was once a German
Mental Hospital in Northern Silesia, and he could not possibly bring out a
serious novel from behind the prison-bars; for at a place where eleven hundred
internees were huddled up, consisting of lorry-drivers, coalmen, sea-men
Cambridge graduates, any man with an eye for the ludicrous would find cartloads
of material for amusement. And Wodehouses would convert this raw-produce into
finished works of humour without fantasy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As President of the Library of the internment camp,
consisting of one more volume than the ominous thirteen, all written by
himself, Mr. Wodehouse had a moral obligation to his fellows, and he knew it.
He had to be constantly replenishing the library with volumes which they would
read. As he said, “You can imagine how flattering it is having fourteen men in
one room reading your books at the same time.” And if he then wrote a serious
book, we could imagine how flattering it would have been to have not one man reading
that book at any time. At best it might have been a sight of just one man out
of one thousand and one hundred and one sulking away his time over it. A fact,
which we hasten to admit, the mirth-maker himself had recognised. For if his
first book ever written in the padded cell of an asylum were a serious affair,
he would have probably driven at least half his fellow-internees mad, thus
necessitating the re-conversion of the camp into a mental hospital. If
Wodehouse was not serious enough, he would have written his serious book
without caring for the consequences. He evidently does not agree with those who
think that insane people are laughing matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

died three years back, has classified books into favourites for different
occasions. Utopian novels when you suffer from cold, Edgar Wallace for fever,
Dickens and Gogol for chronic illness, and in the hour of death someone after
whom he had not made many enquiries but certainly not Destojevsky.<sup>2</sup>
Inside prisons and during convalescence, Wodehouse is the favourite, though
Capek misses him. P. G. heroically faces in <i>Louder and Funnier </i>the fact
that he is quite a favourite with dog-stealers. Up in the Upper Silesian
prison, the honour-king was probably playing the role of the single outstanding
figure, the youthful hypnotic Napoleon whose will was law, supplying them with
stories, and being supplied with material for more according to the best
traditions of the German barter system; though, if journalist Knickerbocker is
to be believed, it is doubtful whether jam could be bought by barter, or if it
could be got for love or money either. <i>Money for Jam </i>and <i>Jam for
Money </i>are both slogans which can be, and often are, repeated mentally in
countries where both jam and money are scarce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

barbed-wiring of the mental asylum. He probably did not know that he would be
huddled up with eleven hundred others, that he would be President of the
Library there, and that he would be so popular as all that. Just as he did not
know he would fall into German hands, you would say. At this rate, what he did
not know about the war situation before the tall of France would fill a whole
library.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>After a year in the Silesian Camp, Wodehouse began
to broadcast a weekly talk over the German Radio. There were questions about it
in the House of Commons. Anthony Eden made a statement. <i>Tit-Bits </i>published
a scurrilous attack on the humorist, saying that he never cared for his
friends, that he was a miser, that he never bought a new hat, and so on.
All-India Radio refrained from broadcasting talks on P. G. W. College
professors (without listening, of course, to his talks), tried to draw a parallel
between P. G. Wodehouse and Ezra Pound (who broadcasts from the Rome Radio). I
myself held that as an admirer of Napoleon, he had something in common with
Hitler, and also was probably an admirer of Hitler the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

earlier efforts over the Berlin Radio. He was not much of a broadcaster, for he
hadn’t the voice of a Roosevelt. He said he was being treated well in Germany
(they would, when it was a writer of international reputation), that he was
growing fatter and fatter every day at such a rapid rate that he was afraid his
wife would not be able to recognize him when the war was over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

broadcasts created quite a flutter. The talks of Wodehouse, the Philosopher,
came to be looked upon as something awfully serious. It is as it should be, for

the art of the second best?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to write a novel. <i>Money in the Bank </i>may not be it; but, if it is not, he
would serious novel afterwards. For all we know he has written it already. Has
he not written a really serious short story in the collection entitled, <i>The

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>HAR PRASAD SHARMA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Master
<span class=SpellE>Sukhdev</span> who was very much interested in philosophy
asked a question:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=GramE>“Which of the historical places of India you liked most?”</span> Miss
<span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span> made <span class=GramE>herself</span>
comfortable on the sofa and said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I
liked <span class=SpellE>Taj</span> <span class=SpellE>Mahal</span> most, which
is one of the wonders of the world?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Master
<span class=SpellE>Sukhdev</span> nodded his head in assent and exclaimed: “That
is right, that is right. That is the finest specimen of art in India. That is
almost the unanimous opinion of all foreigners. Who can deny this fact?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
suddenly, Miss <span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span> interrupted him to express
her own opinion about the philosophy of beauty. She said: “What you say is
right but what <span class=GramE>is beauty</span> and how can a thing of beauty
become imperishable and immortal? These are the questions which always arise in
my mind. Many scholars, thinkers, philosophers, poets and writers have
expressed their ideas about beauty. <span class=SpellE>Romain</span> Rolland
has expressed the view: ‘Beauty resides in the eyes of the beholder. If we
think over this matter a bit carefully, we shall arrive at the conclusion that
only that object is beautiful on seeing which we are bewitched and if anything
does not appeal to us in spite of the fact that it is a fine piece of art we
shall not find any trace of beauty in it.’ Bacon says: ‘The best part of an
object of beauty is that which cannot be expressed through any work of art.’<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>It means that beauty cannot be expressed
perfectly in any way. Ruskin has his own ideas about beauty. He says: ‘Bear in
mind that some of the most beautiful things of the world are useless, for
example, the peacock and flower’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“But
when I think of the philosophy of <span class=SpellE>Ninon</span> who says that
what is attractive and beautiful is not always excellent but what is excellent
is always beautiful, I think myself as to what is excellent which is always
beautifu1. What strikes us with wonder is not beautiful, because according to
an Italian proverb, the effect of wonder does not last more than three days.
Therefore, Friedrich Schiller has said in very clear words that art is
extremely difficult but its charm is perishable. Hence how can an object whose
charm is lost soon be called beautiful and what is the value of an object
which, according to Schiller, is perishable?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Miss
<span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span> cast a questioning look at all, smiled and
asked the above question. And then without a pause she began to answer the
question herself thus: To understand this thing clearly, take a simple example.
To a visitor or to any person who sees the <span class=SpellE>Taj</span> for
the first time, it will look extremely beautiful. The <span class=SpellE>Taj</span>
will look less beautiful when seen for the second time and much less beautiful
when seen for the third time and, before <span class=GramE>long,</span> it will
lose all its charm and attraction. How can then the <span class=SpellE>Taj</span>
be called beautiful, which looked attractive at first sight but lost all its
attraction when seen again and again? It is a mere illusion. An object which we
call beautiful today, we do not care to cast even a look at it after sometime.
Then how can it be called beautiful? Now let us see what is really beautiful?
It is the Supreme Being who is really beautiful because the more we long for
seeing Him, the more we are attracted towards Him. The intensity of this
longing never lessens. That is why great seers, sages and saints who are madly
in love with God renounce all worldly things – their houses, near and dear ones
– and thus snapping all worldly ties, retreat to the solitary caves, attracted
by the beauty of Supreme Lord. They are always meditating upon God and their
eyes are always fixed upon Him; their mind is not diverted from Him even for a
moment. They are always absorbed in thinking of the Supreme Being till their
own being is merged in Him. That was why the <span class=SpellE>Gopis</span>
were so much attracted by the beauty of Lord Krishna that they always circled
around Him, madly. Compared to Lord Krishna’s beauty, nothing in the world
looked beautiful to them. That is why Schiller said that it is no use loving
work of art which is perishable. If it is perishable, the question of its being
eternally beautiful does not arise at all. Lord Krishna has said this thing in
very clear terms:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Therefore, the whole world is a
manifestation of His form. Hence, when everything which looks beautiful in the
world derives its beauty from the Supreme Being, is it not, then, the Supreme
Being who is most beautiful or is it something else?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On
hearing this, the whole room resounded with the cheers of those who were
present there. They looked at one another, nodding their heads in assent. They
were astonished with the intelligence of Miss <span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span>
and began to shower praises upon her. In the light of the sermon of the Gita,
Miss <span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span> had separated the grain of the reality
from the chaff of illusion and doubt and placed it before them all. They began
to look upon Miss <span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span> as a great philosopher.
Then suddenly, a young writer named Ram <span class=SpellE>Swarup</span> raised
another question. <span class=SpellE>Aplogetic­ally</span>, he said to Miss <span
class=SpellE>Schemidt</span>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“What
is your philosophy of life? What is the object of human life? Some people say
that life is meant for action, while others say that it is a hopeless burden.
Will you please throw some light upon it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On
hearing this question, Miss <span class=SpellE>Schemidt</span> became a bit
serious. She thought over the matter a bit deeply and then said: “It is not
easy to understand the mystery of life. Learned men have looked at life from
different angles. Some of them have regarded it as a means to attain salvation;
others have said that life is meant for making oneself merry; while still
others have described it as a mere bubble of water. Stephen <span class=SpellE>Zewig</span>
has said that one who devotes all his energies to benefiting the coming <span
class=GramE>generations</span> leads a really good life. Goethe’s philosophy is
that a useless life is no better than death. Another thinker has said about
life that he wants to live in this world only once and therefore, he wants to
do, once for all, all the good that he can do to his friends, because he would
not like to be born in this world again. <span class=SpellE>Hillard’s</span>
opinion about life is that life is another name for action that one does not
act only exists but does not live. But most of the people in the world live
like what H. G. Wells has said: “Our life is just like the spark produced by
the friction of two pieces of dry wood. It flashes for a moment and is then
extinguished. We do not know where it comes from and where it goes.” Even then,
this life has not been created in vain, though we may not understand what it is?
Take an <span class=GramE>example,</span> We go out for a walk in a jungle.
There we see lofty mountains and say that God has in vain created these uneven
mountains which are very high here and very low there. Descending from the
mountains, we see forests spreading far and wide and the earth lying unevenly.
Then we start thinking whether all these extensive forests have been created in
vain and whether the uneven earth is meant for lying idle. Again we find that
at places, the flat earth is extending to a great distance, while at other places
there <span class=GramE>lies</span> the vast expanse of the ocean which has no
bounds. Then we ask: what is the use of all these extensive lands and vast
seas? But our condi­tion is just like that of an ant which crawls along our
breast, tries to rise towards our neck, considering it to be a vertical rock,
climbs upon it. Then it descends a little towards the chin and finds a pit
there; then, it climbs on to the lips and, taking it for a cavern, it goes back
to the nose, but taking the nostrils for a grotto, it gets frightened and runs
away from there, and consi­dering the cheeks to be hillocks, it starts
ascending towards them, but as soon as it approaches the eyes, it stops and
taking them for lakes of water, it flees from there also. Then it goes towards
the eye-lashes and taking them for small forests, it climbs upon the forehead
and, considering it to be a flat tract of land, it starts running upon it, but
as soon as it approaches the hair, it finds that a dreadful jungle of hair is
spreading, all around and it runs away from there lest it should be entangled
in it. Thus, our eyes, mouth, nose, cheeks and hair have perfect significance
but the ant does not realize it and roams about here and there. Similarly, life
is not without purpose but if, like an ant, we are not able to understand its
significance and if we grope in the darkness here and there, whose fault is it?
What is the fault of God in it?”</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Nityam
kuru karma tvam,” is the gospel of work which constitutes the kernel of the
Gita teaching. “Do thou thy allotted work,” is an imperative which knows no
compromise. Arjuna’s lost nerve is sought to be restored by an appeal to his
sense of duty, Svadharma. The Lord enunciates His famous theory of work without
concern for the results, the spirit in which all work should be performed and
not shunned. In that famous 47th verse in Chapter II, He lays down: “To action
alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of
action be thy motive; neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction.”
This is the refrain of the Song Celestial. The Lord is never tired of repeating
that moral action is action from which the idea of its fruits is ruled out,
before as well as during the act. Attachment to the fruits of one’s actions is
not conducive to the achievement of equanimity, balance of mind or Samatva,
without which the very backbone of moral action would be broken. Where Samatva
is absent, quarter is given to self-interest, and where that is allowed to have
a sway over the mind it may well blind one to what is right. “And even when we
succeed in choosing the right deed, undue eagerness to secure its fruits may
induce us to swerve from the path of rectitude.” An eloquent description of
this Samatva we have in the words of Hamlet when he speaks of Horatio as:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Nityam
kuru karma tvam”–Do thou thy duty, and that oblivious of the consequences. What
noble precepts! And what challenging relevancy have they for us in this
critical juncture of our country’s life? Work, more work, and yet more work
might as well be inscribed alongside ‘Satyameva Jayate’ on the national emblem.
Work imbued with the Gita spirit, work regarded not </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as
God’s curse, but as that having divine sanction behind it. “There is not for
Me, O Partha, any work in the three worlds which has to be done nor anything to
be obtained which has not been obtained; yet I am engaged in work.” That should
serve as an antidote for what is derisively, and no doubt somewhat truly,
described as oriental inertia. If you do not want to put the country’s clock
back, you shall do your allotted work; you shall not grouse and whine; you
shall not pursue petty and selfish ends that conflict with the commonweal. You
shall not, for instance, seek promotion by inaction masquerading as action; or
by action of the back-door variety which gains despicable currency in a
degenerate society. ‘Copy-book maxims indeed’, cries the cynic, who might turn
round and ask: Are conditions congenial to the discharging of one’s duty
regardless of consequences? Under conditions where “preferment goes by letter
and affection,” where many a conscientious worker wakes up in the morning only
to find some unworthy toady jumping over him to positions of eminence not
commensurate with his calibre, is it not too much to ask of the former to keep
on doing his duty automaton-like? If that be the sad tale of the conscientious
individual’s endeavour with reference to his allotted work, how much sadder and
more chilling would be the task of the social uplifter whose mission is
‘lokasamgraha’? Activist morality nerved by a crusading spirit must needs have
a faith, faith grounded in reason, if it should get a move on in the right
direction, if it should not falter and flinch in the holy task set before
itself. Does the Gita supply the right ballast of the right brand to keep the
average man and the crusader at once strenuous and serene in the pursuit or
their ideals?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

question needs a little elucidation. Considering the general apathy to duty,
duty for duty’s sake, rigorous as it is, sounds too academic and grandiose to
merit general adherence. What guarantee is there, one may well ask, that the
dutiful man’s honest endeavours are not doomed to frustration in times when
expediency, ‘prudential algebra’, line of least resistance, are proved to pay
richer and quicker dividends in the day-to-day struggle? And on a grander
scale, how does a social reformer’s manly effort in the service of humanity
fare in the long run? You need only open your eyes and look around to be struck
by the number and enormity of social evils that plague our society today. The
widening gap between the rich and the poor, tyranny of rank and office,
corruption of different shades and kinds, practical denial (</span><span

endless examples of social inequities and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>heartless abuses stare
you in the face. Short of supine acquiescence in them, every man who has a
sense of duty and social sympathies must feel that the evils constantly
challenge him to take up the ‘flaming sword’ and fight them. But what are his
chances against what may well be super-human odds? To what extent can the

though they are a minority and not to go with the throng, what is necessary is,
not merely the belief in the foolishness of the fools, but a faith, a reasoned
faith in the rightness of the right, in its cosmic significance. A deeper
analysis is therefore necessary to discover if there is anything in the nature
of reality to assure him regarding the attainableness of his ideals. May it not
be just a wild-goose chase, a juvenile reaching out to an ever-receding rainbow
on an ever-receding horizon?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we proceed to answer that question we should ask ourselves the justification
for such a question. The question ‘what chances’ implies the forbidden question
‘what results’, and is that not ruled out by the Gitaic injunction that
detachment from all concern about the fruits of action is a condition of
ideally good conduct? A question which has no moral justification has no truly
rational answer. But a proper assessment of the consequences does have a place
in moral action. It is morally self-evident that where there is a conflict
between responding to the call of duty and following the line of least
resistance, it can never be right to weigh the consequences of the alternatives
so that a choice might be made between them. The imperiousness of duty does not
brook sordid calculations. The path of duty is the only path, and therefore in
deciding <i>whether </i>to do the right, consideration of consequences ought
not to enter one’s deliberations. But in the very different question of <i>what
</i>in particular it is right to do, such a calculation is not only desirable,
but necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

atra mohitab’, –what is doable (right action), and what is not-doable (wrong
action) is a question which puzzles even sages. Life is so complex and human
intelligence so limited, that it is not always given to man, not even to the
morally sincere and earnest man, to know for sure what the specific path of
duty is under a given set of circumstances. What at a given time and place is
the right way to behave is sometimes a genuine, though pardonable, perplexity.
All the same he is so earnest about his ideals that there is no wavering in his
resolve to do only the right. It is precisely because he is earnest that it is

but </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

the good. An action can never, it is true, be right simply <i>because </i>it is
useful. But at the same time no action can be right unless it is ethically
useful–unless it promises to be more serviceable than any alternative way of
acting to the ends which we have learned to count morally precious.” And it is
here that a due consideration of consequences has a relevancy, for without such
a consideration we might be expending our moral and spiritual resources on ends
of dubious value. Which of course is not morally right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

insight rather than scientific understanding is the faculty that affords to man
his most penetrating glimpse into the nature of the real. Cosmic history begins
to surrender its secret, its inner meaning, when, in the course of time, it
evolves the human moral consciousness The revelation is made more to moral
reason than to scientific understanding. It would therefore be instructive to

things fill the mind,” says Kant, “with ever new and increasing admiration and
awe, the greater and the more steadily we reflect on them: The starry heavens
above and the moral law within.” The moral law within is an inner urge of
tremendous force, a sense of obligation which expresses itself in a categorical
imperative–<i>Thou shalt. </i>Thou shalt do thy duty whatever be thine
particular likes and dislikes. The question of one’s not being able to do one’s
duty does not arise, as Kant says in a thrilling aphorism, “The <i>ought </i>implies
the <i>can.” </i>While the law of prudence is hypothetical–if you want
pleasure, do this–moral reason commands categorically: Thou shalt do thy duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

illuminating element of our common human experience. It is astonishing. For how
can a short-sighted, impulse-ridden creature of a day like man have knowledge
of, or even be able to imagine an eternal, universal and absolute obligation?
It is self-certifying. For when conscience is really awake, it speaks with a
majestic authority, before which all doubt shrivels up, and we <i>know </i>that
we are in the presence of an absolute right and good. And this astonishing, but
self-certifying categorical imperative is metaphysically illuminating. For by
that augustness of majesty which is too self-evident for honest doubt, duty
betrays the transcendent nature of its sources.”<sup>1</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

has the authority of an imperative, an authority that does not condescend to
convince you by ratiocination. It is Kant’s conviction that duty must be rooted
in reality to have about it such an imperious ring. If it were not a matter of
cosmic significance but only a matter of man’s not always impeccable notions of
right and wrong, Duty should not have that air of augustness it has. If
anything, duty expresses the immanent purpose of the real. Moreover duty would
not be duty, would not speak with that august grandeur, “if it were not so
grounded in the real as to carry the sure promise of victory.” “In its very
accent of authority the insight of moral reason can detect the tone of
promise.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this it follows that the moral activist is bound to succeed in attaining his
goal so long as he remains convinced of the real, intrinsic goodness of that
goal. What enables us to affirm this is the faith, the reasoned faith that what
is truly right and good must have the whole universe on its side, for is not
the real rational, orderly and coherent? Moreover we can go a step, further and
assert that the more certain he is of the true goodness of what he strives for,
the more certain he is entitled to feel that on the side of the accomplishment
of his ideal there are ranged the deepest forces of the universe. Those who
sacrifice their all for duty are conscious that “in being loyal to what is
highest in themselves, they are being loyal also to what is deepest in the
eternal nature of the real.” And so they wage their battle for the good in the

the critic may turn round and ask: “Your anxiety for an assurance as to the
outcome of your moral endeavour sounds like bargaining. Are you not cutting the
moral ground from under your feet?” Kant is anxious that it should not be
understood that duty could not be done where such a guarantee were not
forthcoming. While our first and foremost business as autonomous, but not
heteronomous individuals is to do our duty, a salutary fillip is given to the
doing of it, if it were possible to have faith that our moral purposes were
capable of fulfillment, as the universe is not alien to human ideals. It does
not at all mean that we are not going to do our duty unless we get a guarantee
of an eventual consummation. We are not to make bargains in obeying the moral
law. We are to give, asking for nothing in return. “For, if ye love them which
love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same?” And so,
such disinterested action implies necessarily trust and faith in the
consequences of our actions. “The faith is the outcome of the action, not its
determining ground; but it is not an accidental outcome. The action implies the
faith.”<sup> 2</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
illustration should make this point clearer. When we are acting morally we are
not acting in a vacuum or in isolation. Moral acting is action along with, and
having respect to, other people. Each one of us acts as a member of what Kant
calls a ‘Kingdom of Ends’. Since moral action is action along with other
people, the latter have something to contribute to it. Hence the realisation of
what we aim at is, normally, not entirely in our power. We do our part in a
co-operative enterprise, trusting that others will do theirs. Let us take a
simple duty as truth-speaking or keeping of a promise. When you do this it is
implied that others should speak the truth and be honest, for, if you knew for
certain that no one else could do the same, the situation would be impossible.
But that does not mean that you refused to speak the truth or keep a promise,
unless you got a guarantee that everyone else would do the same. That would be
a clear violation </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the moral law. We are to do our part trusting
that others will do the same. This implies that we must, for right action, have
faith in something that is not within our power, and yet that we must not
demand that that faith should take the form of certain knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tall claim is made that on the side of the victory of the good there are ranged
the deepest forces of the universe. As a possible inference from this claim is
that an unqualified assurance is given that victory is certain, are we not
thereby robbing the moral adventure of its thrill of venturesomeness? Firstly
it should be borne in mind that an element of contingency characterises the
temporal process, and the course of history is never rigidly predetermined. It
is this that makes the struggle for worthy causes a real battle, the course of
which depends as much on the warrior’s own mettle and faith as on the
worthiness of his causes. Secondly when it is said that in genuine moral
endeavour Reality itself is our ally, and on the side of the victory of the
good there are ranged the deepest forces of the universe, it does not for once
mean that the cosmic forces have such safeguards as to exclude the occurrence
of the evil and the wicked. What is meant is that Reality is so fundamentally
good that “there cannot possibly enter the temporal and contingent process any
evil which is not capable of being converted into the purchase price of some
surpassing good.” The evil and the wicked are not invincible; they only
constitute a challenge which can be faced and dealt with successfully and
transmuted into a compensating good. This significant point can best be illustrated
by an incident which is narrated in the Gospel of St. John. In the course of
their wanderings Jesus and his band of disciples encountered a congenitally
blind man. So shocking a spectacle as that set the disciples digging for its
possible causes, while Jesus with his characteristic insight and forthrightness
sought for an adequate divine purpose. The phenomenon was meant to be a
challenge to the afflicted as well as to his fellowmen. The purpose of the
Heavenly Father in so creating this man was nothing but to challenge him and us
“to win from that evil some good which was worth such a cost, and which could
be had in no other way.” And that is what is meant by saying that Reality at
the core is so good that any evil that way enter into it can be transmuted into
some surpassing good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

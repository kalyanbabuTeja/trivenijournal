it painful or pleasurable, the life of a traveller is wonderful. The
experiences that are gained by travelling are numerous and unforgettable. I
shall now relate in a short span my most cherished memory of a place in the
Himalayas. Very few people, if not none, wrote anything about this remote,
sequestered valley. Nobody ventures there crossing the path which is hard to
traverse and extremely difficult of going. The tourists go as far as Kedar and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Badrinarayan. Gangotri, Jamunotri and Gomukhi
are visited only by a few people. These are the pilgrimages where only the
sadhus, the sanyasins and other pilgrims go on foot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Curious
and eager as I was to see the source of Bhagirathy–that is the Ganges–I arrived
in Gomukhi. At long last I can see before me the mound-like cave out of which
Ganges is pouring herself out. I dipped myself in the holy water. However, upon
closer observation little later it dawned on my guide and me that this could
not be the origin of the Ganges since the river is very broad here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“There”,
he said, “do you see the snow-covered fields gradually rising up to join the
snowy mountain? Atop that mountain’s the real source of the Ganges. No human
being can ascend up there, for those places are owned by gods. It goes the
round that you’ve to cross that region before you can enter heaven. There’s a
place in that region, they say, where there’s always a hailstorm and all sorts
of perilous obstacles. No human being can go there, but if fortune favours and
one can ultimately reach there, then one comes back a god.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
and then I waived the desire of going up there and returning all transformed
into a god. But as the confounded Providence would have it, all my plans went
amiss in that heavenly place. Standing for a long time near the cave of ice I
got excited. I was mad with excitement, a madness that even imperils one’s
life. My guide contacted my over-enthusiasm and he was inclined to accompany
me, but my heart would not like to share the glory with him. Alone I set out
with the assurance that he will be waiting for me for three days. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cave, as I said, is like a mound and clothed with ice. The right side is steep
and plane, and the left side is full of ice-covered rocks that admit foot
support. To view the land and see if the source of the Ganges could be spotted,
I climbed along the left side. At one point I heard a murmur. I traced the
sound and saw through the cracks of ice in one place the flow of the Ganges. In
the hope of finding real Gomukhi I picked my way along the purling stream. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Time
passed. I have climbed more than two miles of this up slope. I am now panting
for breath. I cannot walk any more. Despondency is taking hold of me. There is
no trace of the source. I am dying with thirst, and breathing is painful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had to return after all. Thinking that I am returning by the same way as I
came, I quickened my steps. I am glad to find com that I can now walk easily.
Coming to the vast snowy region I hoped to find that cave again beyond it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

after a while it struck me: the snowy tract that I had crossed was not this
vast, and soon it will be evening. There is no time to pause and think. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sun is hidden behind a misty screen of light and shade. Having been seeing the
icy whiteness all around throughout the day, my eyes are heavy and paining.
With great anxiety I halted for an all round view of the region to see which
way to proceed. I have, obviously, lost my sense of direction in this pathless,
uneven and snowy tract. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

downward slope is enjoyable, and I would pray to God that there be no upward
slope after this. It is not yet dark; in the light that is still there long way
off in front is visible. Far away, down below, there seems to be a vast plane
abounding in lush green plants and trees. Such enchanting scenery I did not
come across before. Seeing–through the greenery of the valley–a tall temple and
houses of various colours, I imagine that there is a big town there. I also
think we will go there. This slope, which appears nothing less than a mountain
in its height and vastness, encircling and thus protecting the big town from
all outside influences, is a unique work of Nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

though we had flown down the scree, when we barely reached its foot, I could
see not far away a stream, quite broad. On this side of it there is not a blade
of grass, but the other side is full of trees and plants amidst which I can see
a long white line on the ground; I deem it is a road. Six persons are standing
on the bank. They are hailing my saviour with their right hands up, though we
are still a bit far. When we were closer they turn by turn embraced him. I
wonder if they have noticed me, for nobody talked to me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in form, waist high, able to hold about ten persons, such is the boat left on
the river’s border. Holding my hand my friend went in it first. On a soft and
thick cushion he sat down and motioned me to sit down also. Then one of those
six men got in. He stood at the rim of the boat holding a long stick which he
pressed against the bank and thus the boat got started. First it moved slowly
then it started flying like an arrow towards the other shore. It did not tilt a
bit on any side. When the marvellous craft touched land I saw two men standing
who were dressed just like my new acquaintance. Alighting from the boat he
first greeted the men in the strange language. They in turn greeted and
embraced him. Then signalling me to follow he started walking with them. There
was no talking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

on a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lotus </span>leaf are three
pieces of flat bread, and other foods. Taking me straight to the seat, she
lifted off my cap and the turban, opened the cumbersome overcoat and went to
hang them all on the wall. Returning she relieved me of the rest of the upper
garments. She also opened my boots and socks, and left them in a corner, and
then she put around me a thin sheet of white cloth. I was dumbfounded; so could

am awakened in this heavenly kingdom by the sweet notes of a bird. I got up
from the bed feeling strong and happy. Following the same path by which I came
here yesterday, I went to the river bank. There is not much light yet. The
trees that are about me are very tall and, mainly, of two varieties, pine and
eucalyptus. Far away I can see hazily two men bathing. I too entered the water.
It is ice-cold, bluish and transparent like crystal, and sweet of taste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the bath I returned to that verandah sauntering through the beautiful gardens.
The bed is not there now, in its place is a wooden seat. Instead of sitting
there I went and stood in front of the room in which I took my meal yesterday. I
am wondering if I should get in. The room is lighted by the Sun. I can see
before me inside the room a long dais upon which many eye-catching articles are
neatly arranged. Two of them are specially attracting me, a conch-shell and a
metallic box with a conic lid. I have never seen such a conch before; it is two
feet long, and thin and pointed towards the mouth. On it there are five pearls.
Its colour is bright minimum and its mouth is mounted with gold. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

below the dais is a long bench set against the wall and covered with a
decorated leather piece. On it there are a few utensils of gold. The things
inside the room are as though pulling me. Suddenly my eyes caught sight of my
divine host and that lady. Laughing they came and stood flanking me, and
clasping my hands they spoke to me in their charming language of which I
understood one word clearly, “mitra,” or friend. As though they said: dear
friend, why are you standing outside? Come inside. They took me in. We went and
stood before the dais. The man spoke something to the lady who left us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I see my host, my divine guide, quite different. He is not wearing the turban.
His dark hair is flowing down the shoulders. Three gold necklaces, with a
locket at the bottom of each, are hanging over the chest. On each of the upper
hands there is a gold band studded with gems, and below it is a square amulet.
Around the wrists too there are two gold bands. On his wide chest there is a
broad leather fillet–wrought with golden figures rolling down from the left
shoulder and attached to the cummerbund. As for garment he has <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>only </span>a thick red <span

round the waist and reaching till the knees. His feet are bare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the lady, her thick black hair is braided and the plaits, decorated with
flowers, are hanging down the shoulders. Her gold ear-drops have bright blue
gems at their centres. Between the eyes, on the forehead, shines a tiny Moon.
She is wearing eight invaluable necklaces. The golden fibres, dropping down
from the hem of her bright blue skirt, scintillate as she moves. The gold
strings of small bells worn around the ankles adorn her bare feet. No use
attempting to describe her divine beauty. She is glorious even as a goddess. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

admiring the quaint articles on the dais I saw on a blue saucer those egg-like
things which my host had dug out yesterday from the ice heaps. I thought
nothing of picking up one and asking him in Hindi, “What is this?” He smiled a <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>little, </span>and what he said in his own
tongue comes down to this: You take it, please do not keep it back on the
plate. Then with the help of gestures he explained to me that if even a minute
portion of that substance is taken with milk then there would be an increase of
“ojas,” life force, and the body would not decay. Eating this, man can live a
hundred years without the cares of age. Its name is “tushar gothol.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

enquired, “Do you take it everyday?” Without a word he lifted the lid off a
golden bowl. Within it I saw a white powder and a tiny spoon of gold. He picked
up one spoonful of that substance and lifting my chin dropped it inside my
mouth. Just then my hostess came in with milk in a silver bowl. I drank it and
found in it the smell of saffron. Its wonderful taste led me to think that I
drank ambrosia. Almost immediately I felt strength and force surging up in me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the walls of the room there are different kinds of shields, coats of mail,
helmets, scimitar, etc., and hundreds of ornaments. My host while showing me
all these, called someone in a deep voice. Immediately in entered none other
than my charming hostess, with a radiant countenance. Then he held my hands in
a way of bidding goodbye and said something in the sweet language that
resembles our Sanskrit. I deem he is going out on work and this lady should be
looking after me. When he left the room we too came out in the verandah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

walked down to that portal and struck the path that leads to the temple. This

taller, and crowned with seven gold jars and on top of the other. From the
highest jar, which is the smallest, is protruding a trident. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are spacious caves very high and amply illumined. They are used, most of them;
as store rooms, and some as kitchens in one of which I see about ten herculean
cooks busy with their work. The smell of a strange blend of aromatic articles
like incense sticks, sandal-wood and saffron has created a joyful atmosphere.
It took us about one-and-a-half hours to see the place. Never have I seen a
temple with such great extensions. Now we climbed up the steps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

light. The light is not coming in from outside through any hole since there is
none. There must be something inside by which the interior is wonderfully
lighted. Six steps lead to the square altar before me. Upon the altar, right at
the centre, is a small splendid throne made entirely of gold and decked with
jewels, and over it there <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is<i> </i></span>an

saw on the throne a square base of which each side is a foot long. It is
covered with a lustrous yellow cloth. In its centre I see something magnificent,
exquisite. It is so dazzling that at first I could not make out anything of it.
When I was myself again I discovered a pure diamond statue of Lord Buddha in
meditation no larger than the thumb. Behind it is a tree made entirely of
emeralds. The hall is illumined by their effulgence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

she said, in substance, is this: No one knows how old the emerald tree is, but
this is certain that it is not man-made. It was found exactly as you see it inside
a mine in the Himalayas. It was for some time with the king of Ratal. The
grandfather of Vajra Sena defeated him in a battle and with other jewels he
brought along this. Fortune favours him who possesses this priceless object.
Thanks to it he conquered this kingdom of Corode or of the Gandharvas–to which
you have come, and established this temple. And centring this temple he
extended the area of his capital on all sides. Then he declared that
thenceforward his kingdom will be called ‘The Emerald Kingdom’. Later someone
brought that statue of diamond from Tibet which the then prince of the
Gandharvas, Kanaka Vajra, accepted in return of two thousand horses and a lot
of gold. Kanaka had left it in the treasury along with other jewels. But when
the royal priest, Balakashyapa, saw it he said that that was not the place for
this invaluable thing, this temple was the right place. Whereupon the king
brought it here and placed it, incidentally, under the emerald tree. So long as
these two objects were separate none of them emitted so much light, the moment
these two were united, such tremendous light flooded the hall that since then
the lamps were not in use. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

am neither hungry nor thirsty, though it is passed two thirty in the afternoon.
I feel a new strength and power in my body, as if I am a dweller in the world
of the immortals. Now we have to return and the lady said, we will come again
in the evening. Outside the hall many people are now seen coming, or going. In
the centre of the courtyard six women-like fairy-daughters, are sitting and
about them a few musical instruments which some handsome men are feeling. At
the end of the courtyard I was admiring the frescoes when in entered a man
about seven feet tall; he is blue and shining. I see here people with shining
bodies and of various shades of complexions, and it seems as though they are
somewhat transparent, as if something of their inner glow is emerging out. This
man’s body is covered with precious ornaments. He has blood-shot eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I come across this phenomenon elsewhere, I would have been scared. Pointing her
finger at him my lady companion said, “Devaraj”, which literally means king of
the gods, or Indra. So I enquired dubiously, “Indra, perhaps?” She grinned and
said, “No! In charge of the temple.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

then Devaraj, seeing her, came quickly towards her. She greeted him with a
hearty smile. He responded by lifting her up with his huge arms and embracing
her and kissing her cheeks. Placing her back on the ground he stared at her
questioningly after noticing me. What she said in an affectionate tone is, in
effect, that I am an Indian Aryan from the south of the Himalayas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

returned from the temple vibrating with a wonderful discovery. Situated in the
northern most fringe of India, I have a strong feeling that this is a land of
the Gandharvas, of gods. Now I asked my generous hostess her permission for
seeing more of this place. She pointed towards the north and said that I could
go in that direction and I shall see many things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

at the nearest gateway a boy of about seven years. His hair is raised up to

questions. In <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>reply </span>the boy
said something; so he looked at me. Then coming before me he suddenly expressed
great joy as though a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>complex problem </span>is
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>solved. </span>Saying something to the

met the housewife on the doorway. Though <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>slightly

boy after exchanging a few words with <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his
</span>mother, moved on and, glancing at the wonderful furniture and other
appliances, I followed him. Most of the things are silver-coloured. In one room
I got a sweet smell; I looked on all sides. I picked up one of the translucent
objects before me that are piled one on top of the other on a stool. It’s about
a foot long and an inch in width. The boy scurried to a corner and pouring in a
bowl a liquid substance from a jar, he carne to me and breaking a portion off
the thing I had picked up, he dropped it in the bowl. Then he quickly brought a
spoon. He was restive with joy. Meantime that broken piece started dilating and
softening and finally the bowl was filled. He picked up one spoonful and held
it to my mouth. Now it is clear to me of what that smell was when I entered the
room. Its taste is unforgettable and incomparable. They call this food “niravatika.”

a while a handsome and virile-looking man of about twenty-three years carne
into the room. His attire is not much different from that of others. As he
entered, the boy retired. That youth grasped my hand and said something
pointing outside. I only could understand the words <i>nrittya </i>and <i>samgeet,
</i>dance and music. The youth–he has a wand in his hand, the free end of which
has the form of a snake’s hood–and myself came out of the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

started talking merrily. Shortly my eyes met a prodigious man attired in a
blood-red cloth. Unlike other men here he wears his long hair braided which
hangs down the back. Here usually men make their hair in such a manner that all
the hair remains on the head forming a crest. This man is wearing a type of
carpet boots–strange in this place, though they are knee-high. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

other characteristics, this man had a square face and high cheek-bones. He
gives me the impression that he is a stranger in this land, for here all are
passing graceful. He too is holding a staff. Two of his upper front teeth are
missing as also any sign of beard or moustache. His huge chest displays a dozen
or more of necklaces of brownish beads. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he carne and started walking beside my companion in a peculiar gait. Now and
then my Aryan friend would say something which would make this long-haired man
laugh merrily. There were still those houses surrounded by gardens, on both
sides of the road. Overhead, a vast spotless blue. Oh, the thrill of that
morning, for the pure clarion air, and the Sun without heat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

long I did not notice that the staff in the stranger’s hand had a gold knob and
on top a small ivory ball. He stopped short on the way and started turning his
hand with the wand–round and round in the air. After a few such movements I saw
that a bird came spiraling down from the sky and sat on the stranger’s topi.
Then this magician made the bird sit on his staff. It’s a snow-white bird with
a girdle of pale blue around the neck, a pair of blue beaks and red eyes. My
friend then held his wand towards the bird which came down on it. He should
have known better, for this displeased the magician who tapped the bird’s head
with the ivory ball of his wand and the poor bird flew away shrieking. At this
the magician smiled a little while my friend became grave. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ten minutes after this incident, my friend abruptly lunged the ivory ball of
the magician’s wand with his own staff. The dislocated ivory ball went like a
shot and dropped on the road and swiftly my friend secured it. And now the
magician became grave. The walk continued; there was no talking, though. Not
long after we found ourselves inside a wood. I would fain stand and stare at
the magnificent plants and trees through hours; and such white and hard clay is
perhaps unimaginable elsewhere. In time we came near a bridge where–upon the
bidding of my friend–the magician quickened his steps and disappeared beyond
the other end of the bridge. Gradually a stream came within our sight then a
garden-far away in that garden we saw a palatial castle. The bow-shaped bridge
is about thirty yards long and about four yards wide. The railings on either
side are one yard high and probably made of leaves and branches of different
colours. At the two ends of this bridge there are two engaging gateways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

on the bridge my companion drew my attention to a music. At first I heard
nothing, then some slow and soft tunes and then the more we neared the garden
the clearer became that heavenly music. Upon entering the garden an exquisite
voice accompanied by veena, a seven-stringed instrument, was heard. The tune
was so full of life that all my hair stood on end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

music could not have been coming from the palace which was too far. I asked my
companion. He pointed to a grove a little way off. I was too eager to go there
quickly, so I hastened; but the melody became scarcely audible now. My friend
seized my hand. I judged that he wanted me to control myself. So long as I
walked steadily I heard the music perfectly well, but the moment I hastened to
arrive there early I could not hear the music. Now I could hear that golden
voice anew. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the grove I saw an extensive circular area surrounded by a variety of trees and
creepers. At the centre there is a round terrace, a flight of seven steps lead on
to it. Upon it too there are beautiful plants round the edge. After a while we
came up on the terrace whereupon the terrace could not be seen any more–in its
stead an open hall below me. Again seven steps take one down into the hall.
There are many people down there, males and females, all very wonderfully
attired. In the centre a few persons were dancing in a circle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

peace; so I almost lost my separateness from others. We climbed down like cats
and stole ourselves near the central dancing spot and sat down. Then he
released my hand. Now a change came over me, momentary though. I found myself
in that peaceful or blissful state which occurs in deep sleep. Then things became
normal. What I witnessed from my seat were all a dream, a waking dream for that

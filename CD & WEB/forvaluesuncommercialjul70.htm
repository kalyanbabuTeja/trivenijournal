it would hardly be doing justice to the breath of poetry that he brought to a

success and solvency. To the casual onlooker, who tends to take most things for

heart on his sleeve. He was too shy and reticent for that. He preferred not to
draw too much attention to himself by any of the external aspects that had <span

“Image-building” was not in his line. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was some three decades ago that I chanced to see him in the flesh for the first
time in my life. He was invited to preside over the cultural section of a
students’ conference in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Guntur</span></st1:place></st1:City>. That he was introduced by
one of the <span class=SpellE>organisers</span> as a “leading journalist” did
not mean very much to the noisy youngsters, fresh from school, who did not
quite know a ‘journalist’ from a ‘terrorist’. But one had vague memories of
one’s Headmaster (one of the many Dr. Arnolds of those days) often carrying
with him an English periodical called <i>Triveni Quarterly. </i>Obviously, he
thought highly of the journal and its editor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ramakotiswara Rau was
essentially a simple man–simple in his dress and deportment, in his talk and in
everything else. But neat and tidy he was. Perhaps, he could not help being so,
as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
thought, word and deed. He had the fairness and absolute <span class=SpellE>candour</span>
to declare how impressed he was with the paper in English read by a young man,
a student leader, whose political antecedents were not quite acceptable to many
of the elders of the day. It was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>on the role of youth
in modern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or something of the kind. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If the politics of that student leader did
not make the grown-ups <span class=SpellE>favourably</span> disposed to him,
his language was much too <span class=SpellE>highflown</span> for the
youngsters, with little English and less politics in them. But the chairman of
the meeting had no hesitation in declaring it to be the best speech of the day.
And so it must have been, as I look back on it now. Ramakotiswara Rau’s words
always had a ring of finality about them and an air of urbanity. He could at
once be firm and gentle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

before the lapse of a few more years it was that I began to discover, for
myself, the priceless treasures hidden in the back numbers of <i>Triveni. </i>The
severe simplicity of its cover pages would give no clue to the quality and
variety of the contents. Once the outer crust is broken by the sharpening
intelligence of the initiated reader, he has found an opening into the
limitless realms of gold. I can never forget the hours of unmixed delight that
I used to spend in the Municipal library at <span class=SpellE>Tenali</span>
and the <span class=SpellE>Connemara</span> Public Library in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

How is one to describe the coruscating brilliance of the political and literary
pieces of the young Mr. M. <span class=SpellE>Chalapathi</span> Rau, including
the ‘Indian Caravan’ and ‘Viceroys of India’ ‘G. K. Chesterton’ and others? <span
class=SpellE>Iswara</span> <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> could be seen in the
pages, refining his brush for the paintings in his portrait gallery. The
editor’s <i>Triple Stream </i>would be a much-needed change from an array of
such multi-<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> springs and waterfalls to clear <span
class=SpellE>springwater</span>, cool and soothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the journal represented the triple stream of art, literature and history, the
editor <span class=SpellE>symbolised</span>, in his person, the triple stream
of love, friendship and empathy. The first was necessarily restricted<b> </b>to
a few. The second extended to a wider circle that cut across all barriers of
language, region, and religious faith. The third he could withhold from none of
his contributors, whatever be the degree of personal acquaintance. He was quick
to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> promise, not as a patron, but as a
friend and elder brother. He was absolutely sincere and could at times be
sentimental–embarrassingly so. He would go out of his way to tell the young
writer what he liked in him, and what he should do well to guard against. Quite
a few brilliant young men, who became well-known writers and journalists, in
due course, would have preferred to be office superintendents or, middling
lawyers in the <span class=SpellE>moffusil</span> courts but for <i>Triveni </i>and
its editor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

twenty-five reprints sent by Ramakotiswara Rau were cherished by his contributors
in the good old days more than as many Rupees from other hands. <span
class=GramE>(And this when a Rupee meant a lot more in its purchasing power
than it does now.)</span> More than being a writer himself he was the cause
that writing was and grew in others. One man tried to do, as a <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> of love, for the Indian Renaissance. What a number
of institutions are now proud to do for a price and an army of individuals for
a living. The periodical that he started was not only his shield and <span
class=SpellE>armour</span>. It was a mirror to his soul. Many an editor there
is who lives on his periodical. Ramakotiswara Rau lived for it. Each issue of <i>Triveni
</i>was, for him, a dream come true. It was a continual process. He is gone
from us. But the dream remains. For, without dreams, life won’t be worth living.
At least, for those not content merely to exist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is remarkable to see how Ramayana, the most ancient all epic stories, rendered
into great poetry in the Sanskrit language by the sage <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>,
has lived through many vicissitudes of history–particularly in the Eastern
world. Perhaps many of us in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
have been under the impression that Ramayana is indeed a story only for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In fact,
there are many in the South, who <span class=GramE>are</span> not even

 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But, <span class=GramE>there</span>
is no doubt that the story of Ramayana is such that one can never be tired and
which lends itself to every aspect of life. Therefore, it has been the object
of interest for the painter, the sculptor, the poet, the musician, the dancer and
many others who have interpreted the story in a thousand different ways. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
pervaded by this story of Sri Rama, in plays, in musical discourses,
folk-dances and many other art forms like the puppet-shows. But to find it to
be a living tradition in so many other Eastern countries is <span class=GramE>really<span

what I have learnt by attending the International Ramayana Festival, I
discovered that Ramayana was even rendered into <span class=SpellE>Jataka</span>

Director of the International Academy of Indian Culture, even in <st1:place
w:st="on">Siberia</st1:place>, the Ramayana is well-known. In modern days the
story of Ramayana is gradually being presented in dance form in <span

very short tradition and was, therefore, more modern in presentation was <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But,

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The presentation of Ramayana in the Burmese version
was, of course, done in the Burmese style of dancing. But the story is similar
to the Bengali version,* where the hero seems to be <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span>
and so the Ramayana story is called the story of Maharaja <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span>.
But, here, of course, the conception is that Sita was the daughter of <span
class=SpellE>Ravana</span>, and though the dance-drama was performed both in
temples and palaces, and in the villages, the most important part of it is the
inspiring character of Rama and the story’s ethical value. The Costumes were unique
in the old Burmese style, for, as one of them remarked, Rama, though he was
born in India, is a person of the world and his story is the story of the
people of the entire world, and, therefore, Rama, who was born in India, is no
more Indian, but is a Burmese as he has been adopted into that land. In the
same way, we can find that Ramayana is adopted in a fashion by each country as
if it is its own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Burmese version is also interesting, because they accept the appearance of Maya
Sita. As in the <span class=SpellE>Adhyatma</span> Ramayana and some other
Indian <span class=SpellE>Ramayanas</span>, <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span>
does not abduct the real Sita at all but only a Maya Sita. Again, when the <span
class=SpellE>Nagastra</span> is used, it is not only <span class=SpellE>Lakshmana</span>
but Rama also, who was overcome, and Hanuman comes to help them. But there is
no bringing of </span><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
or anything like that. In the actual presentation, a well is held between Sita
and <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span> and <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span> <span
class=GramE>sees</span> her only through this veil of Maya. The greatest
importance is placed not on the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>divine nature of Rama
but on the ethical value of the story and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the Thai version, originally it was called <span class=SpellE>Ramakien</span>,
which is the earliest version of the Rama legend in Thai literature, the music
is mainly instrumental with very little of singing. From the point of view of
production, the Thai production is very similar to the Cambodian. But there is
one small variation in the technique in that the Thai production brings in
slightly more properties on to the stage and also makes many poses and postures,
which are <span class=SpellE>sculpturesque</span> and beautiful. The costumes
are gorgeous and they have symbolic <span class=SpellE>colours</span> as in the
Cambodian. But the Cambodian has the, special feature of exquisite and most
delicate foot movements and greater grace. The remarkable point was the fact
that the finest characters of Rama and <span class=SpellE>Lakshmana</span> were
depicted in these countries by women, because these characters are of such
refinement that they have to express their gestures not with power and crudity
of man but with the delicate grace of women. Because of this, even in the war
between Rama and <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span>, <span class=SpellE>Rama’s</span>
arrows, which destroyed <span class=SpellE>Ravana</span>, are so delicately
shot and used with such grace and beauty that one might think that it was a
flower arrow rather than an arrow that kills. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The most remarkable country as far as the
preservation of the performing arts, particularly Ramayana is concerned, is <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Though I saw six different versions of the Ramayana in the same country by different
troupes who were all expert dancers and for centuries had kept up the
tradition, there was an immense amount of creative imagination expressed in
these. In the Indonesian version, I would say the chief keynote was the beauty
of the presentation with wonderfully charming traditional costumes, exquisite
music of the <span class=SpellE>Gamelang</span> and the extraordinary delicacy
and grace of movements. I saw different versions of <span class=SpellE>Jatayu</span>
and it was very difficult for me to say which was the most beautiful. Perhaps I
might say, to me the <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> was the <span
class=SpellE>Djogjakarta</span> version. All the monkeys used masks and Hanuman
was a great hero who was depicted with wonderful beauty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the most impressive things that I found was the large number of artists
participating in the Indonesian performances. Sometimes, there were hundreds on
the stage and each one knew his place and moved in the most harmonious way,
forming excellent floor patterns. It is very difficult to see such a large
number of artists. In the ballet from <span class=SpellE>Djogjakarta</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Agnipravesam</span> of Sita was beautifully shown. <span
class=SpellE>Agni</span> was represented by about 20 girls who used beautiful
yellow and orange scarves. One of the <span class=SpellE>specialities</span> of
Indonesian dance is the way they manipulate scarves. It is part of their
technique and they do it with very remarkable grace. At first I could not
understand what these 20 girls represented. Then it became obvious that they
were all supposed to be Fire <span class=SpellE>Devas</span>. When Sita
prepared to enter the fire these 20 girls started to move the scarves in such a
way that they looked like flames. It was beautifully done. Of course it was
clear that starves were being used. But they were most suggestive and was not
meant to be exact. It was wonderful for me to note the beauty of the costumes
and the <span class=SpellE>colour</span> schemes. And I must confess that in
these respects these countries, especially Indonesia has outshone India by far.

impressive scene was Hanuman setting fire to Lanka. In the Balinese version, <span

Hanuman’s tail. But he plays around them in such a very clever way and somehow
manages to capture the two torches and goes flying round setting fire to
everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Balinese version had the most vigorous movements, while the East Java Hanuman
was the most striking. The interesting thing about all these is the fact that
in none of these dance forms was there any accompaniment in the way of singing
the songs or the verses as we do in India. In short, there was no <span
class=SpellE>Vachika</span> <span class=SpellE>Abhinayam</span>. There were
songs here and there and the tune of some of the songs even resemble some of
our ragas. They do not have a raga system of music while they have names of
different melodies and special songs which represent different emotions like
sorrow, happiness, heroism and so on. The <span class=SpellE>Gamelang</span> is
a very elaborate accompaniment with a large number of instruments, gongs, etc.,
and it is played somewhat like our <span class=SpellE>Jalataranga</span>, and
it is exquisitely beautiful to the ear. Another feature which seems so
different from India is the lack of facial expression. <span class=SpellE>Satvika</span>

is also known that the story of Ramayana had spread even into Tibet and that
manuscripts had been found there and that from Tibet the story had spread even
to Mongolia and Siberia. When one sees these productions of the Ramayana–some,
perhaps with religious significance, some without any religious significance
but still inspiring to the people of the country; one <span class=SpellE>realises</span>
that not only has India been able to give a great message to the world, but
also that today India has to learn from these countries, to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
that the precious gift which inspires others, should not be lost in our
country, as it is being lost today, owing to our unfortunate imitation of
Western ideas and values which are only of temporary value. It is for this <span

of us who are interested in parliamentary democracy must give serious

is an illustration which our country should always bear in mind. In France
Ministries used to fall every six months and eight months. It was supposed to
be a Ministry of very great stability if it lasted ten months or twelve
months–which was hardly ever the case. Why was that? <span class=GramE>Because
there were no fixed parties, because there were constant fluctuations in
Parliament, because people did not adhere to any convictions or any principles.</span>
The result of that was that a dictator appeared on the scene, and the dictator
was General de Gaulle who practically put an end to the old system and
introduced a system where there was stability in the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

my opinion, crossing the floor may be the result of one or the other thing, and
we must judge it accordingly. It may be the result of a change of conviction,
or it may be the result of some temptation or some bribe given. If it is a

my opinion, we cannot prevent people from voting against their party. If it is
a matter of conscience, they will vote against their party, and they should not
be prevented except in extreme cases, to which I shall presently refer. I agree
that for the working of parliamentary institutions we do need parties which are
more or less stable. I do not agree with the observations in this Report that
there will be freezing of parties if crossing of the floor is not permitted.
The so-called crossing of the floor or change of conviction should normally
take place at the General Elections. It is at the General Elections that the
electorate decides who should be its representative. And once these
representatives are sent to Parliament and to the legislatures, by and large,
there should be stability in the formation of<i> </i>parties or groups of the
Opposition. This constant change is not desirable from the point of view of
parliamentary institutions. Therefore it is incorrect to say that we will
freeze the situation if we try and prevent people from crossing the floor.
There is always the General Election. There is always the electorate. Let the
electorate decide. But once it has decided, <span class=GramE>normally</span>
it is the duty of<i> </i>the member to respect the wishes of the electorate and
to remain in the party to which he has been elected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

think the members of<i> </i>the Congress Party–of other parties as well,–are
much too strict in issuing whips. On every subject a whip is issued, thereby
testing the loyalty of<i> </i>the <span class=GramE>member</span> and
compelling him to vote with the party, whether he believes in the particular
matter which is before the House or<i> </i>not. I think whip should be issued
very rarely, and a party should not look upon a defeat in the House necessarily
as a vote of<i> </i>no confidence. Now, take the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region>–you have the Senate; you have the House of
Representatives–where the parties are perhaps not <span class=GramE>so</span>
strong as they are here or in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.K.</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but nobody minds if the
President is a Republican and the Democrats carry a particular measure or pass
a particular resolution. Therefore, parties should not look upon every topic
that comes before Parliament as something that involves a vote of confidence.
It is only in matters of policy, in matters of grave importance, in matters of
national emergency that a whip should be issued, the matter being looked upon
as a vote of no confidence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And even there we should permit our members if they
say it is a matter of conscience to vote against us or at least abstain. We know
it is the usual Practice. Take the Labour Party; a member says: I do not agree
with the policy. Serious attention might be taken if he votes against the party
but he is permitted to abstain if he says it is a matter of conscience. Therefore
we should not be in a hurry to take disciplinary action against members of the
party because as a matter of conscience they do not see eye to eye with the
party and they abstain or do not vote for the party. </p>

is that the Council of Ministers should not be as large as it is today either
at the Centre or in the States. Now, I am not one of those who believe that we
should have a proportion fixed with regard to the Council of Ministers. To me
it seems all absurd <span class=GramE>proposal</span> that we must have 5 per
cent or 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the members of the legislature
constituting the Council of Ministers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There is no principle behind it at
all. We appoint the Council of <span class=SpellE>Mnisters</span> to do work.
We must decide what the work is. We must decide how many Ministers we want,
among whom the work should be distributed. We must decide how the work will be
done efficiently. But why is it that we have such large Council of Ministers? <span
class=GramE>Because nobody is thinking of work.</span> Nobody is thinking of
administration. What we are thinking all the time is how to retain certain groups
and factions and each group and faction has to be represented in the ministry.
That is the curse of our country today. What happened in <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>?
For one month we had Ministers without portfolios, <span class=GramE>who</span>
were drawing salaries out of the public revenue without doing a stroke of work.
I have never known in the history of the world <span class=GramE>In</span> any
country where we have parliamentary institutions such a thing happening. It
happens in our country and what do we do. Nothing, but shrug our shoulders.
Therefore the first principle that w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>e should lay down is
that the Council of Ministers should not be large either but its number should
depend upon the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>extent of the work, the nature of the work, the
quality of the work and the ability of the Minister who is going to do the work.
But no, that is not the principle. The first thing we do is, we say this group
has to be represented, this caste has to be represented, <span class=GramE>this</span>
community has to be represented. Is this democracy? Is this parliamentary
institution? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I quite agree with the Report that crossing the floor should not entail
disqualification. I see a suggestion was made that if a member leaves the party
on the ticket of which he had been elected he should be disqualified. I think
it is an impossible suggestion. We might amend the Constitution but it would
not be right. But what can be done? It is strong public opinion which should
condemn the action of a member who crosses the floor not out of conviction but
because he has been offered a <span class=SpellE>ministership</span> or offered
some bribe or some reward. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

am very much interested in the suggestion made about re-call. It is a highly
democratic process. It may be difficult to work it but this Committee should
have given some thought to it. Suppose a man is elected on the Congress ticket.
The electorate had selected him because they wanted a Congressman. If he
crosses the floor and joins the Communist Party or the Jana <span class=SpellE>Sangh</span>
or the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party, why should not the electorate
be given the right to say, ‘We do not want this man; we want a Congressman’ or
they might say, ‘Now, our views are changed; we want our representative to be
Jana <span class=SpellE>Sangh</span> or <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> or
Communists.’ Therefore I think this suggestion of recall is a suggestion which
should be carefully considered. I know it is difficult: I know it might be
expensive but it is democratic, and it is one of the ways of preventing
defections which is what we need most. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

do want to emphasize the fact that defections may ultimately lead to the
complete breakdown of parliamentary institutions. If we do not have stability
of Government, how can democracy function? I know of many States where the
Ministers have no time to attend to administration. Files are piling up all the
time while they are busy playing politics. Let us ask ourselves this
question–what does the average citizen in our country want? He wants an honest,
clean administration. He is not interested in politics; he is not interested in
parties. He wants, as I said, honest, clean administration. For heaven’s sake,
give it to him. But no; the Ministers have no time for it. There are other
things to do besides attending to administration. Therefore unless we stop this
crazy game, this foolish game, this mad game of having Ministries every six
months or eight months, of members crossing the floor, of defections, I think
parliamentary institutions will not be able to function in this country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have often suggested–and I know I have been criticized and condemned for
it–that we must give serious thought to the question whether at least in the
States we should have a presidential form of Government. The presidential form
of Government is as democratic as the parliamentary form of Government. The
advantage is that for five years, the President will not be constitutional
President but he will be the same as the Chief Minister. The President will
have his colleagues who will not be removed, who cannot be removed, and who
will attend to administration during those five years. They will not have to be
looking behind their back all the time to see whether there is a faction or a
group supporting them. For five years we will have strong, clean administration.
After all, the parliamentary form of Government is the most difficult form of
Government to work. We need certain requisites. We need a strong party in
Government. We need a strong alternative opposition to take over from the
ruling party. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has it; some other countries have it. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

said, there is nothing wrong in considering whether the alternative of
presidential system is not an improvement as far as our conditions are
concerned, compared to the parliamentary form of Government. I myself think
that the parliamentary form of Government is the best form and we rightly
selected it, but having selected it we must work it efficiently. We must not
allow this terrible corruption, this erosive factor which is eating into the
vitals of our country to permit parliamentary democracy to break-d</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Everyone
knows that Paul of Tarsus was smitten by a dazzling light on his way to
Damascus. With a little (pardonable) exaggeration I may say that I was smitten
by a no less brilliant illumination when, through a sheer stroke of good luck
rather than through any conscious contrivance on my part, I purchased a second-hand
copy of the <i>Jeeves Omnibus </i>from a roadside bookstall in Bombay. “P. G.
Wodehouse” was a new name to me then. I am conservative to a degree in my
literary tastes and, unless exceptional circumstances supervene, I much prefer
re-reading some old and tried authors to reading new and unknown ones. I have never
had occasion to regret this policy: certainly not in the matter of certain
ultra-modern writers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
explains why I came to the immortal “P. G. W.” (whom that Dean of British
dramatic critics in his day, the late Mr. James Agate, had been pleased to
place only next to William Shakes in the English literary hierarchy) so late in
my life. But, having come to him at long last (by way of that roadside bookstall
in Bombay aforementioned) I have not been slow to make up leeway. I have read a
score or so of his books and am eagerly looking forward to finishing the whole <i>corpus
</i>before the mushroom cloud threatens us all with complete oblivion. The <i>Jeeves
Omnibus </i>was, as I have indicated, my first introduction to the Master.
Afterwards I went through the remaining volumes that came into my hands like a devouring
flame. I may be mistaken, but I believe that I have read all the novels and
short stories in which the celebrated <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duo
</i>jeeves and Bertie, figure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
must confess at the outset that Bertie’s inspired idiocies fascinate me even
more than (and that is saying “an imperial quart”) Jeeves’s scintillating
strategems. In his higher flights Bertie is something of a poet. The imaginative
concreteness of his descriptions is extraordinarily impressive: as when, for instance,
suffering prodigies of boredom from the prolonged visit of his cousins, Claude
and Eustace, to his hospitable and luxurious flat, he expresses himself thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Bertie,
that last of the Woosters, can hardly, it seems, opens his mouth without
letting fall such gems of purest ray serene. The pithiness of his expression
is, indeed, marvellous to behold. As Contey said of Pindar, it forms “a vast
species alone.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
Jeeves has a blemish (and, even to imagine that he has, is tantamount to
uttering a blasphemy) it is that he is far too much addicted to what H. G.
Wells’s Mr. Polly, imprisoned in the mean trade-terms of haberdashery, loved to
call “sesquippledan verboojuice” and “eloquent rapsodooce”. His lofty utterance
is only too apt to go over the heads of his Drones Club clientele whose highest
form of sophistication, it may be recalled, consisted in throwing assorted
bread-crumbs at one another during luncheon-time. It is both interesting and
instructive then to watch Bertie take hold <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of<i> </i></span>the situation with his inimitable wizardry and
condense that alarming mass of verbiage into half-a-dozen pellucidly clear and
crisp words (of one syllable each) that can be easily understood by them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>His
adroit manipulation of language is unforgettable: as when, to take just one
example, his pal, “Catsmeet”, volunteering to deputise for Jeeves, is remiss in
the performance of his valet’s functions as a result of more rewarding
diversions elsewhere, Bertie consoles himself with the sage reflection: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Bertie’s
love-life <i>(or, rather, the incredible absence of it) </i>can be an
intriguing theme for thesis-writers. It is not (horrid thought!) that he loved
and lost. It is that the young and charming <i>debutantes </i>that fell for him
so solidly loved and lost. And in that single and solitary instance when he
himself, the much-sought-after boulvardier and man-about-town, loved and lost
(Pauline Stoker, to wit, as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>svelte </i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>and<i> </i></span>debonair as Mother makes
them), he contrived to reconcile himself to his disappointment without any

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Bertie,
in fact, is one of Nature’s bachelors. The very mention of the phrase, “the
holy state,” got in amongst him, to borrow a familiar Wodehousian locution. I
have always felt a deep pang of sorrow for Honoria Glossop (whose laugh, we are
told, was “like cavalry clattering over a tin-bridge”) and Florence Crage
(whose profile was <i>some </i>profile and who being “an egghead” and steeped
to the gills in serious purpose, was always maladroitly thrusting the frightening
tome, <i>Five Types of Ethical Theory, </i>into the unwary hands of her
admirers), both of whom had, at one time, aspired to his hand and heart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

what is really most exhilarating is what I may call the Bertie Wooster–Madeline
Bassett <i>impasse </i>or imbroglio. The Bassett, I need not remind my readers,
could somehow never get out of her nut that Bertie was simply dying of love for
her: whereas, of course, anyone with the least pretence to intelligence could
see for himself, or herself, that he would have preferred dying in a ditch to
walking up the aisle with her save and except under a powerful anaesthetic. I
have never been able to make out why Jeeves was always telling people: “Mr.
Wooster is, perhaps, mentally negligible, but he has a heart of gold.” That he
was, emphatically, <i>not “</i>mentally negligible” is evident from the fact
that he could see with half-an-eye, so to speak, that she (the Bassett) was not
the mate Heaven had ordained for him: as how could she be who, in her
mutton-headed way, believed that the “stars were God’s daisy-chain” and that “every
time a fairy hicups a wee babe is born”? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

endears him most to his admirers is his mortal dread of his Aunt Agatha–an aunt
in a million, to be sure–who “chews broken bottles and kills rats with her
teeth.” She was, by all accounts, <i>some </i>aunt, and, one gathers, the only
fly in his ointment, the only caterpillar in his salad. Whenever, it will be
recalled, she was after him “with her hatchet,” he made a beeline for America<i>–and

Wodehouse has, unaccountably, stopped writing about Jeeves and Bertie: there is
still a huge public for these hilarious <i>contes. </i>Moreover, let him
remember that he himself had, in his preface to the <i>Jeeves Omnibus, </i>promised
that a story containing Bertie’s settling of accounts with the redoubtable Tuppy
Glossop (who had once caused his falling into the Drones Club swimming pool “in
fun evening costume”) would see the light of day in due course. But what
supremely matters is that he should be spared to us long enough for at least
half-a-dozen more volumes from his inimitable pen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was unbeatable and that he was without question, the head of his profession.

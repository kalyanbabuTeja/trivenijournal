this emotion-charged debate certain basic facts seem to consistently ignored or
not mentioned. Many do not know what they say. Some who say the right things do
not mention the right reasons. It is not enough to say that you like
Shakespeare. You have to point out why all should study Shakespeare. This essay
tries to pinpoint these basic facts so that the issues might be viewed and
judged dispassionately. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no need to underline the importance of the study of languages. It is implied
in the word <i>Logos</i> which means word or thought. <i>Vaagarthaaviva sampruktau</i>.
Wittgenstein and others have pointed out that without language there is no
thought. Man is a talking animal. Remove talking; man is a mere animal.
Theoretically we can say that thought is wider than speech, that thinking is
possible without language. But for all practical purposes the limits of our
language are the limits of our thought. That is, without words there is no
thinking. If there are no words like tree, leaf, blossom, etc, we cannot think
about the tree. Henry James in an oft-quoted context remarked that all problems
come back to the question of speech. Simeon Potter in his <i>Language in the
Modern World </i>writes: “When there is any kind of interference with the free
speaking of a given language or dialect, or an endeavour to enforce </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>its
use, much more than the linguistic factor is at stake.” (p. 184) Bloomfield
suggests in his great book: “It<b> </b>is only a prospect, but not hopelessly
remote, that the study of language may help us towards the understanding and
control of human events.” (p. 509) To regard language as superfluous is to
regard lather as superfluous in shaving. Language is a social activity. It is
the instrument of human progress. Without it we are dumb statues. In Dewey’s
library classification language appropriately stands between Sociology and
Natural Sciences. So the attempt of our so-called educationists to reduce
language study is based on unawareness and sounds like Peter’s denial of
Christ. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is enough if we have language as a tool of communication. Where is the need to
study literature or old classics like Shakespeare and Milton instead of modern
writers?” is the second denial. It is not understood that the study of
literature is advocated because of the nature of man and the theory of
knowledge. Man is cognitive, conative and affective. Our education is said to
be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>purely cognitive and hence lopsided. Emotions are wild
horses that drag us hither and thither. They cannot be drilled into a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>queue
easily. Literature to some extent chastens the affective side of man. Newman
recognises the difficulty when he writes: “Quarry </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
granite rock with razors, or moor the vessel with a thread silk.” (<i>Knowledge
its own end</i>.) Unlike other disciplines literature brings the whole soul of
man into activity. We are, wrote Dr. Johnson in his <i>Life of Milton</i>:
“Geometricians by chance but perpetually moralists.” Bloom’s celebrated
taxonomy of educational objectives is helpful. Hence the need for the study of
literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

another way. The growth of the mind is facilitated by various disciplines.
Students are not noisy buckets into which knowledge can be pumped. The work of
Susan Isaacs and Valentine Bowlby and Paiget proves this. Kenneth Charlton
writes “In the 20th century, however, there appears to be a move towards a synthesis
of knowledge and this may very well lead us by the end of the century to a
quite different approach to the nature of knowledge and therefore of the
curriculum and curriculum theory.” (<i>Changing the Curriculum</i>, p. 76)
Hence Aldous Huxley’s plea for a Chair for Synthesis in every university in his
well-known <i>Ends and Means</i>. In a way we go back to Newman’s knowledge is
one and indivisible. In the words of John F. Kerr, we need to consider the
types of relationships that should obtain both <i>within</i> and <i>between </i>the
main areas of knowledge...“The theory of knowledge raises many questions about
the relationship of the various disciplines to the development of mind and to
the nature of knowledge.” (<i>Changing the Curriculum</i>, p. 27) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the creative use of language. It is through literature that we acquire even
language skills. As Carlyle puts it “the best grammarians have been the worst
writers.” It is poets who create language. That is why Prof. Raleigh quipped
that the philologist knows everything about the word except the use to which it
is put. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the principle of augmentation is not applicable to literature, old classics
cannot be set aside. When our meddlers with education abolish literature, their
ignorance is interesting in its variety and scope. They rush where angels fear

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next,
these meddlers say: “Let all these periods released by the abolition or
reduction of language study be devoted to science.” This conflicts with the
advanced theory of education in the West. Barker in his booklet on the British
universities writes that “the whole trend now is to see that Institutes of
Technology are not allowed to remain purely technological.” The lopsidedness of
a purely scientific and technological syllabus should be rectified by what he
calls ‘aesthetic technology’. This is the old warning of the humanist that we
have learnt to fly in the air, to cross the ocean but have not learnt how to
live. As Dr. Nisbet says: “We are plagued by our achievements, for material
progress has inevitably taken toll of traditional culture. There are, as the
recent Apollo moon landings make clear, great events taking place in our
society. But they are events of the technological, not the social, order.” (<i>The
American Review</i>, October, ’70, p. 27) Conquest of nature, initiated by
Bacon, is the boast of science. But Ecology tells us that this boast is pitiful
and absurd. It is Max Born’s mournful conclusion that the contemporary
scientific revolution has destroyed ethics. Thinkers realize now that science
can no longer remain ethically neutral as applied science degenerates into
mis-applied science. Harvey Wheeler pleads for bringing science under law. (<i>The
American Review</i>, July ’70, p. 55) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this is the pattern of thinking in the West, how is it our educationists force
on us obsolete ideas? It is just like obsolete military hardware of the West

he is not educated in the best sense of the word. Scientific boon-doggling has
been scandalous. Peterson suggests development of four main modes of thought:
the analytic, the empirical, the morals the aesthetic. Phenix classifies
knowledge into six realms: Symbolics, Emperics, Aesthetics, Ethics, Synoptics,
Synnoetics. It is even pointed out by Mario Poi that the student of science
needs training in language as much as or even more than the student of the arts
because most of the scientific terms are derived from Greek and Latin roots.
The student of science should have the linguistic training to know that
cyclotron should be cyclon, that the word scientist itself is wrong, that
splitting the atom is a contradiction in terms; he should get a diploma in
technical lexicography. Even a student of Economics should know why Slump was
replaced by Depression, Depression by Recession, Recession by Downturn. How do
terms Rightists and Leftists come into vogue? A student of politics should know
that they have reference to the Bible and the primitive idea of the right hand.

over the country the move now is to replace English by the mother-tongue
Telugu, Tamil, etc. For the sake of argument it should be pointed out that the
mother-tongue concept is absurd linguistically. There is no mother-tongue or
grandmother-tongue. In the study of language the distinction is drawn between
cultural transmission and genetic transmission, Sleeping, walking, etc., are
the result of genetic transmission but language is the product of cultural
transmission. That is, even if you are born in Tamil Nadu of Tamilian parents
you do not acquire proprietary rights over Tamil. You have to learn it as you
learn English. And it is not proved that we learn our mother-tongue more easily
and quickly than we do another language. “The debate as to whether the learning
of a foreign language by an adult is qualitatively different from a child’s
acquisition of his native language remains unsolved.” (<i>Linguistics</i>, VOA
Forum Lectures, Carroll, p. 187) In common parlance we use the expression
mother-tongue as we say: The sun rises, the sun sets, though the sun neither
rises nor sets. As Harry Hoijer puts it succinctly: “Human children have no
language at birth.” (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 61) Speaking pragmatically, not
theoretically, we have a mother-tongue. The adoption of the mother-tongue or
regional medium leads, as everybody knows, to balkanization of the country,
freezes mobility from one state to another, reduces ‘employment opportunities’,
is fatal to the unity of the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘language condition’ of our country is bedevilled by the use of many languages.
If there is only one, one can opt for it on linguistic (not patriotic) grounds.
No language as language is superior or inferior to another. A language may be
less rich at a point in time, but given the opportunity, it will develop. For
instance, there is astonishing resemblance between the language condition in
our country and that in England after the Norman Conquest. Just as Jeremiahs
here say: “What will happen to our Law and Medicine if English is removed?”
Jeremiahs in England at that time said: “What will happen to the Law Courts if
French removed?” As we know French was removed though terms like Oyez still
remain and English flourished. And Bacon’s despairing cry that English would
become bankrupt was falsified, Basham tells us that the doctors of the East
India Company learnt rhinoplasty from native physicians and Sine in
Trigonometry is Aryabhatta’s term <i>Jira</i> mistranslated by the Arab and the
Spaniard. Do the Russians and the Japanese wail: “What will happen if English
goes? - Did our ancients depend on English to make The Wonder was India?” But
as is pointed out earlier, there is not one language to replace English and
hence the need to retain it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

do realize the need for retaining English. It should be studied as a library
language, they say. If regional language is the medium in the high schools and
colleges and if English is retained in the post-Graduate courses, where is the
equipment for the student to use this library language? It is just like cutting
off a man’s legs and expecting him to sprint at the Olympic games. It is
difficult to understand the logic or commonsense behind this. You are asked to

fervour. The reason stares us in the face and we have eyes that see not. With the
going of the British rule their language has lost its prestige and there is no
incentive to study it well. A language is learnt effectively if there is an
incentive. Students used to flock to the Engineering course at one time; now
the rush is not great. Let every State Government notify that unless a student
gets 50 per cent in English he won’t get a job. Standards in English will go up
in no time. Philip H. Taylor says: “What has been missing until recently is
interest in the business of learning for its own sake, something which is
considered by many educationists to be a central feature.” (<i>Changing the
Curriculum</i>, p. 83) There is neither ‘the exploratory drive’ (as it is
termed) nor the temptation of cashing in the proficiency in English on
something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

makers shout: “Let us modernise the syllabi.” It shows an amazing capacity on
our part to deceive ourselves by words. ‘Modern’ is one such word. A modernised
syllabus for English published recently stresses the need for exercises in the
usage of words, elements of grammar and structure, etc. In all honesty, what is
the modernisation here? This insistence was there from the beginning when we
were students in the first form. We have all been products of the old system of
teaching and learning and we are not bad as far as the use of English goes. A
Professor of English in the Kings College, London, under whom I did research

consists of words and the syntax of words. A magical word like ‘modernise’ does
not bring about a change. A language has to be learnt the hard way. When a King
asked Euclid to teach him geometry easily, he was told: “O King, there is no
royal road to geometry.” Even teachers of English suggest naively that
Shakespeare and Milton should be replaced by modern poets forgetting that
Shakespeare is understood much easier than a modern poet. You can read a whole
play of Shakespeare in two hours than half a dozen lines of a modern poet in a
day. That is why C. S. Lewis stated in <i>De Discriptione Temoprum</i> that
seven scholars conducted a seminar on Eliot’s <i>A Cooking Egg </i>and could
not come to any agreement about its interpretation. This is modern poetry! And
we fall plump for it! And one is amused at the seriousness with which these
suggestions are made. A student of literary criticism knows that some old
authors may be modern and a writer of today may not be modern at all. Plato is
said to be perpetually modern. Donne is modem but Bridges is not, though Donne
is Elizabethan and Bridges is of the 20th century. Swift’s English is modern
though he belongs to the 18th century, whereas Hardy’s is said to be slipshod
though he is a late Victorian. ‘Modernise the syllabus’ is fatuous in its
naivety; it is the class-rooms which have to be modernised. The teacher
lectures to masses, not classes. The overcrowded class-rooms are a negation of
education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it often happens that language bears rule over their minds. Language is there

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">'O Master, the merchant-prince, Anantha-Pindika, prays that you should accept his hospitality at Savathi': so entrated the disciples.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">'Much have I heard of how he brought the great Jetavana grove at Savathi paying for it as much gold as covered the ground, and more have I heard of a monastery he is building therein' said the Enlightened, and journeyed down from Rajagaha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">'What shall I do with grove and monastery?' asked Anatha-Pindika of the Enlightened when He had seen them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">'Bestow them on the Order,- the present one and the future': so replied the Buddha gently.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And Anatha-Pindika knelt before the Buddha and poured water into His hands and so made a gift of grove and monastery to the Order.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A firm resolve: a noble accomplishment: an humble gift.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A theme devoid of shades.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A picture like unto the old frescoes of Ajanta,- bold in line, simple in composition, deep in colour, and clear, though gentle, in contrast.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The artist, Sjt. Chakravarthy, is Headmaster of the Government School of Art, Calcutta. He had his training at the feet of Sjt. Nandalal Bose. For sometime he was art-teacher at the Andhra Jatheeya Kalasala and an esteemed colleague of the Editor, 'Triveni'. This is one of a series of Buddha pictures painted by him.</P>

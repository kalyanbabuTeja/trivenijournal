<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I was born at Almora, a beautiful town situated at
the foot of the Himalayas. Surrounded by innumerable mountains with beautiful
deodar and pine trees, waterfalls, lakes and orchards, Almora has been always a
place of inspiration for the seekers and aspirants of natural and supernatural
realities. When I was hardly five or six years old I had a special inclination
towards God. Of course then God was for me either Rama or Krishna and the Divwe
Mother was ‘Durga’. Very often I had the feeling as if the whole life which we
were living and with which we were moving about was nothing but a dream. Our
real life was somewhere else. When very young I used to bite sharply my fingers
in order to know whether it gives a real sensation of pain or not. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At the age of five I was
admitted in a local school. On the very first day, after spending one or two
hours there, I came back running home, leaving behind my notebook and pen. I
had no inclination for studies though I continued as a student for some years.
Rather my love was Nature, the forests with prolific trees and flowers and the
colourful birds singing amidst them. Most of my time was spent wandering
through nearby forests or in sitting in some temple. I used to love reading also;
not my school books, but books from my father’s library–the <i>Mahabharata,
Srimadbhagavata </i>or stories from the <i>Yogavasishta. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My father who was a man
of spiritual pursuits inculcated in me a deep love for spiritual life. He made
me remember by heart hundreds of beautiful Sanskrit verses and the <i>Vada
Mantras </i>and narrated to me stories from the <i>Upanishads </i>and the <i>Puranas.
</i>He taught me also how to do Pranavam and how to meditate. During this
period I had sometime psychic experiences and visions. When I was twelve or
thirteen years old, I heard from him about Sri Aurobindo. He said, “Sri
Aurobindo is a great Yogi.” I do not know why the name “Sri Aurobindo” became
so dear and loving to me. I did not know at that time anything about the Divine
Mother. So one day I sent a reply-postcard addressed to Sri Aurobindo,
conveying him my wish to join his Ashram and serve him. But I did not get any
reply. Four years passed. I was about eighteen. One evening along with a friend
I went to Sri Anandamayee’s Ashram–which was two miles away from my house. That
was the day of “Sankirtan”. We both participated in it. After the programme was
over someone distributed chocolates to all those present there. While
returning, on the way, it was my friend who told me about the Mother of Sri
Aurobindo Ashram. He said, “In Pondicherry Ashram there too is a Mother, very
beautiful and with fair complexion. Every morning she gives Darshan from her
balcony to her disciples and devotees and in the evening distributes sweets
after the playground programme.” It was a surprising enough experience: the
moment he uttered the word “Mother” I felt as if someone (or the vibrations of
the word “Mother”) lit a fire in my heart centre. It was an intense and at the
same time a soothing fire. It remained intense for few minutes but since then
it has never extinguished. I told my friend, “Then I must go to the Mother.”
This reminds me a line from the “Savitri”: “Thy unknown lover waiting for thee
unknown.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon the urge to see the
Mother became very strong in me. After some wandering I left for Delhi, where
my brother was living. I started learning photography with his help. But my
thoughts were always at Pondicherry and in the Mother. Sometimes I committed
blunders. Once when my brother asked me to develop five or six film rolls in
the dark-room, instead of developing the rolls first in developer solution I
put them in hypo solution. The result was all blank! My brother had to bear the
consequence while I got some scolding from him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But one fine morning some
work led me to Dr R. S. Agarwal who had been associated to the Sri Aurobindo
Ashram since 1932 and later became a disciple of Sri Aurobindo. He had opened a
centre, ‘Sri Aurobindo Mandir’, adjacent to his Eye Hospital. I found Sri
Aurobindo Mandir a place of peace and rest. It had a good library, with full
sets of Sri Aurobindo’s and the Mother’s books and records of various
devotional songs and several pictures and photographs of Sri Aurobindo and the
Mother. In a few days Dr Agarwal and myself became good friends. I started
visiting the Mandir regularly and participated in all their programmes. One
evening, after the meditation was over, I expressed my desire to visit the
Pondicherry Ashram to Dr Agarwal. He agreed to take me there as his assistant during
his all India tour. It was during November 1951 Darshan that we came to
Pondicherry and stayed for about 15 days. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As soon as my tour was
over I told Dr Agarwal that now that my contract with him to work as his
assistant is over, I would like to go back to Pondicherry Ashram to stay there
for good. He agreed. But I had to rush back to Allahabad as my father fell ill.
At Allahabad I often had the feeling–as if the Divine Mother was calling me
back to Pondicherry. One day I asked my brother for Rs. 50 only and told him
that the time had now come for me to go to the Mother and live at her feet. He
was good enough to give me the money. The next day I purchased a ticket for
Pondicherry for Rs. 42 and reached there on the morning of 7th July 1952. I
left my luggage at the Railway Station in the care of a clerk and came walking
to the Ashram. After reaching at the main building of the Ashram I met the
gentleman in charge of the Reception Service and conveyed to him my desire to
see the Secretary, Sri Nolini Kanta Gupta. He was kind enough to pass on my
request to the Secretary. Within a few minutes Nolini-da (as we Ashramites call
him affectionately) received me at the Ashram Reception Room. He asked me some
questions concerning my ideas and studies about Yoga. My answer was simple “I
have come here because the Mother is here. I want to stay here because She is
here. I want to work here because I want to serve Her. Nolini-da was satisfied
with my answers and told me that next day during the morning blessings he will
take me to the Mother. I was very happy. I had only about four rupees with me
and that was just enough for a day’s boarding and lodging charges in an Ashram
Guest House. I never thought about the next day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Next day, at about 9-30, Nolini-da took me to the
Mother. He told a few words to her which I do not remember because my whole concentration
was on the Mother’s face. She appeared to me the all loving, all-compassionate
Mother. I felt as if I had found something most intimate and dear that was
missing in my life perhaps since long centuries. She gave me a flower which
signifies ‘Psychic Prayer.’ The Pranaam was over and for a few moments I was
completely lost within myself.</p>

about an hour I enquired from Nolini-da what was the Mother’s decision about
me. He said, since the Mother did not say anything then, he will ask her later.
In the afternoon I went to him again. On seeing me, with a gentle smile, he
said “The Mother said you can stay on here.” I was overwhelmed with joy and
excite­ment. She allotted me work in one of the Ashram departments and
arrangements were made for my boarding and lodging and other needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unfelt self had been revealed to me when first time I heard about the Mother.
It was the Mother’s portion hidden deep in the heart, the “psychic being”, and
as a guide it brought me to the unknown that was “the Mother” herself. But all
this was only the first step for the beginning of Sadhana. In the physical, symbolically,
we had met. But I have yet to realise her in her true reality, in her
consciousness. Since then hundreds of times I have met her and received her
blessings. But rarely did I speak to her. Whenever she was physically present
before me I found myself either in silent prayers or in a state of aspiration,
amidst an opportu­nity to offer myself to her. And I always experienced how her
piercing look, going deeper and deeper into my inner region, was pouring down
there her honey-delight. I think it was for this reason that she graciously
granted me the privilege to have correspondence with her, writing whatever I
wanted in a notebook and herself replying in the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on expanding and growing, till the day when we shall feel her presence even in our

outside but she has come now close within us. From there she continues her
work. Now it is our sole task to rediscover her and manifest her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

showed in dealing with the rigidities and stupidities of our nature is beyond
imagination. Once she said, of all the difficulties the most difficult thing
was the conversion of the physical consciousness. This physical nature which is
rigid, obstinate, obscure and inconscient, she had to deal with infinite
patience and perseverance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Her love is eternal and
her compassion is limitless!” A devotee from the West was once found drunk and
stumbling half-consciously on the road. One of the Secretaries reported the
matter to the Mother. She listened quietly and did not say anything. I thought
that the man will be turned out. But she did not take any such action.
Afterwards when he apologised to her in writing, she wrote back, “My dear
child, my love and blessings are always with you.” And to another devotee from
outside who had the same habit, she wrote, “The intoxication that one gets in
union with the Divine is infinitely greater than one gets in drinking alcohol.”
Always she wanted to make us taste the happiness and joy that come by rising
above the lower consciousness and uniting with the higher consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To her there was nothing
like small or big work. Whether it was a great world problem or a small
individual problem, she gave an equal attention to each case. When a Sadhak
wrote to her, “I do not think it would be bad to let you know of a thought, an
idea which goes on in me, even if this idea, this thought is not good”, the
Mother answered, “on the contrary it will be good to let me know immediately.
Nothing is better than a confession for opening the closed doors. <i>Tell me
what you fear the most to tell me, </i>and immediately you will find yourself
closer to me.” She was always ready to answer any question however trivial–not
only answer but ready to solve the problem if it was put before her with a
child like simplicity. I had the habit of taking tea which I gave up for nearly
about twelve years after I came here. Afterwards I felt like taking tea again
and I asked the Mother for her sanction. She replied, “If you prepare tea by
yourself it will be wastage of time and energy; better to take with someone who
is ready to give you “little”. One of my friends who is in charge of one of our
guest houses, very often invited me for tea. I asked the Mother her advice. She
replied, “Yes, you can go there and have tea, provided you do not talk
uselessly”. She never liked useless talking. Once she wrote to a disciple. “I
have had the experience myself that one can be fully concentrated and have
union with the Divine even whilst working physically with one’s hands; but
naturally this asks for a little practice, and for this the most important
thing is to avoid useless talking. It is not work but useless talk which takes
us away from the Divine.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether it was an
ordinary work or so-called big work, she said, “The Yogic life does not depend
on what one does but how one does it; I mean it is not so much the action which
counts as the attitude, the spirit in which one acts. To know how to give
yourself while washing dishes or serving meals brings you much nearer to the
Divine than doing what we call “Great things” in a spirit of vanity and pride. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

her, “The person I love belongs to me”, the Mother replied, “This is a very
ugly love, quite egoistic”. “The Ashram is not a place for being in love with
anyone. If you want to lapse into such a stupidity, you may do it elsewhere,
not here. It is not this person or that who attracts you...it is the eternal
feminine in the lower Nature which attracts the eternal masculine in the lower
Nature and creates an illusion in the mind; it is the great game, obscure and
semi-conscious, of the forces of unillumined Nature, and as soon as one
succeeds in escaping from its violent whirlwind, one finds very quickly that
all desires and all attractions vanish, only the ardent aspiration for the
Divine remains.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

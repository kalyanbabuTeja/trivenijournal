<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was the month of October, 1944. The Rt. Hon. V. S. <span class=SpellE>Srinivasa</span>
<span class=SpellE>Shastri</span> spoke at the <span class=SpellE>Mylapore</span>
branch of the Y. M. <span class=GramE>I</span>. <span class=GramE>A of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> after unveiling
the portrait of his dear old friend, V. <span class=SpellE>Krishnaswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>.</span> The portrait that he drew in words of his
departed friend was any day a more convincing picture than the one in black and
white which he was asked to expose to public gaze. I was then convalescing
after an illness, and therefore could not sit up with others in the audience,
but only listen to him from the rear seat of my car through a loud-speaker
installed outside the compound. I wrote out a note, the next morning, of my
deep appreciation of the speech of the previous evening, and asked my servant
to deliver it at <span class=SpellE>Sastriar’s</span> place. Unfortunately the
servant was confused, and instead of taking the letter with him, conveyed a
message that I would like to meet him. No sooner the information was given him
than <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> got into a rickshaw and <span
class=GramE>proceeded</span> to my house. But before he reached my place, I had
in the meanwhile detected the mistake, on seeing my letter lying undelivered on
my desk. I hastened to send a faster messenger to rectify the error. In the
interval, <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> had been moving on the road when
he was met by my second messenger with my letter. He read <span class=GramE>the</span>
contents while seated in the rickshaw and felt, as was learnt later, greatly
relieved of his anxiety. Anyhow he came to me straight, and the first words he
mentioned on sighting me were: “Imagine my trepidation on receiving the message
that you required me to meet you. I could not enjoy my morning coffee, since I
felt that there should have been some mistake of detail in my narration in
yesterday’s speech of mine, which you had evidently noticed and forthwith tried
to correct me. It is only after a perusal of the <span class=GramE>note, that</span>
I could breathe with ease in the relief from the erstwhile obsession.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Few
others would have shown the same concern over such a trifle of an error, even
should it have occurred. But <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> was of
different cast of mind altogether. He was never guilty of inadequate
preparation for <span class=GramE>a speech nor</span> allowing himself of any </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>such
commissions or omissions. His was a complete mastery of both detail and
delivery. He was punctilious even to a fault, when addressing others, with
regard to the correct way of spelling their names. If Sir P. S. <span
class=SpellE>Sivaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyer</span> spelt his suffix;
<span class=SpellE><i>Aiyer</i></span><i> </i>with an <i>e </i>instead of <span
class=GramE>an</span> <i>a </i>which is usual with others, <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>
appeared more fastidious about it than <span class=SpellE>Sivaswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aiyer</span> himself. If Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ismail</span> bore a family prefix, <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>
was careful to add always to his name the words ‘<span class=SpellE>Nizam-ul-Mulk</span>.’
He was never forgetful of such formalities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
perhaps may be deemed of little significance in a man’s achievements. But it
must be owned that people who are inclined to neglect formalities may slowly
forget the essentials as well, which are needed to keep up relations of
cordiality. It is not easy to be a gentleman without some of these gentle aids
to correct <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>
had many such graces along with other substantial traits of greatness. Normally
people would lack that amount of sobriety of outlook to view themselves placed
in others’ situations, before trying to <span class=SpellE>minimise</span> the
value of these “little charities that soothe, heal and bless.” <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> never failed to look at the other man’s point of
view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was another occasion which remains fixed in one’s memory; unforgettable because
of the unfathomable sense of magnanimity which was discovered in <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar’s</span> nature. It may be known only to some of his
close associates that he had an aversion to <span class=GramE>the <i>ifs</i></span><i>
</i>in biographies of great men. He held the view that any speculation about a
person, dead and gone, would only be conducive to the creation of
misconceptions regarding his character and achievement. In a speech by him,
delivered at Bombay while unveiling the statue of Sir D. E. <span class=SpellE>Wacha</span>,
he referred to the baneful habit persisting among biographers to indulge
(sometimes) in assessments of personalities by relating them to the times the
writers themselves lived in. No doubt it was a point of view only of his own,
as a host of modern biographers such as Nicholson, <span class=SpellE>Lytton</span>
<span class=SpellE>Strachy</span> and Spender were of the view that a biography
also bring out the ‘profounder truth’ in personalities, since great men like
great books acquired new meanings with the passing of time and it would be
impossible to correctly assess them without relating them to their own times.
So, one of his young admirers, when he had to review that speech in print on
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Wacha</span>, hinted at the <span class=SpellE>unsupportability</span>
of his arguments in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of abandonment of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
‘ifs’. The reviewer had drawn readers to some of the views expressed by the
modern biographers such as those mentioned above. It was revealing of <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar’s</span> higher nature, when on <span class=SpellE>realising</span>
the debatable point of view, he hastened in person to the writer of the review
and made handsome confessions of his erstwhile one-sided opinion in the matter.
Instead of keeping within himself the change inevitably he had to make in his
pet aversions, he had the sense of fairness in making an open avowal of it to
the very person with whom he had previously once happened to differ strongly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
are aware of the beautiful talk of his on the Mahatma, now included in the
volume <span class=GramE><i>The</i></span><i> Other Harmony </i>published by T.
N. <span class=SpellE>Jagadisan</span>. But a few, if none at all, knew the
history of its rescue from oblivion otherwise. At the time of the sixty-first
birthday of <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> in 1929, <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>
made a speech at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hindu</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">High School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, <span
class=SpellE>Triplicane</span>, <span class=GramE>paying</span> tribute to the
qualities of the Mahatma in a language which was remarkable for both its
simplicity and sincerity. The speech appeared nowhere in the press, though a
student of the Ramakrishna Home, <span class=SpellE>Mylapore</span>, took it
entirely in shorthand and got it published also in the Home Magazine,
circulated among the students. Long after (that is, in 1937) a friend of <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> happened to find the speech so enchantingly
couched in memorable words that he was induced to suggest its being given as a
piece of subject for an elocution competition for students. At the prize-giving
function over which <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> himself presided, the
winner repeated the performance of his to the audience gathered. <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Sastriar</span></span> who had completely
forgotten the text of his own speech, liked the matter very much and wanted to
know who was its author. When he was informed to his great satisfaction of its
being his own speech delivered nearly ten years back, he asked for a copy of it
in order to send it to <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> himself. When the
copy reached the Mahatma, unusually the recipient remained silent, throwing <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> in a mood of disappointment, vocal enough to make
him tell his friends that the copy sent by him “had attained <i>Nirvana</i>.”<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, it is well
known, felt no qualms in correcting the fish of <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span>
whenever it struck him to be faulty of grammar or inaccurate of idiom. It is
equally known to people how the Mahatma bowed to his mentor in such matters,
always taking it with a sense of good <span class=SpellE>humour</span> rarely
true of many others in a similar plight of being found fault with. There was an
unbreakable bond of fellowship between them both, which persisted to the last
despite the many occasions of political differences placing them in opposite
camps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
thing, at any rate, which may have escaped many observers of the <span
class=SpellE>Sastri</span>-Gandhi <span class=GramE>relationship</span> is the
total absence of reservation of mind which marked the exchange of their ideas.
If it was in the nature of the Mahatma to be absolutely frank when dealing with
an adversary, it was no less lacking in firmness in the case of <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> also in the expression of his differences with
others. But unlike Gandhi’s, <span class=SpellE>Sastriar’s</span> expression
always preserved all the graces of language and <span class=SpellE>demeanour</span>.
The essential disparity between a saint and a sensitive artist alone proved
responsible for the apparent diversity noticeable in the two. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Generally
humble of disposition, <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> was never willing to
appear needy or seeking help of others, however necessary it may be to his own
comfort. While his closest friend, Sri T. R. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarama</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sastri</span>, was ever-alert to attend to his comforts,
there was never an occasion when <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> had made
extra demands on him for anything. Even the use of <span class=SpellE>Venkatarama</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sastriar’s</span> car frequently by him was more at the
request of the latter than of his own asking. People today may have no idea how
hesitant and unwilling he was in receiving a gift from the late Raja of <span
class=SpellE>Chettinad</span>, Sir <span class=SpellE>Annamalai</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chettiar</span>, in the name of his wife on the occasion of his <span
class=SpellE>Shashtyabdapoorti</span> at <span class=SpellE>Bangalore</span>.
It required the combined strength of advice of all his friends to make him not
reject a gift which belonged legitimately to his wife, as the gift-deed
actually was in her <span class=SpellE>favour</span>. He had to reconcile to a
situation which denied him the freedom to interfere with his wife’s volition in
accepting the gift. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
tenderness towards those who had remained loyal to him with a sense of
dedication cannot be surpassed. To both Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Anasuya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Suryanarayana</span> Rao and T. N. <span class=SpellE>Jagadisan</span>
he was kindness personified, and if today they have each in his or her own manner
cherished his memory as an object of worship for the rest of their lives, it is
no little due to <span class=SpellE>Sastriar’s</span> unqualified confidence in
their ministrations to his needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever
other incidents of his life might slip from our memories, nothing can erase the
impression of unbounded love he bore the <i>Ramayana </i>of <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>
as a book of the highest poetical and ethical value to humanity. It may be
interesting to know how <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> started his
discourses on the epic towards the close of his life in 1944-45. There was a
raging controversy in <i>The Hindu</i> Daily about <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span>
lack of veracity in making a statement in answer to the <span class=SpellE>Rakshasis</span>
that she had hardly any knowledge of Hanuman’s purpose of advent to Lanka or
his antecedents. Partisans of both sides, namely those that argued she was not
untruthful and others who said that hers was falsehood totally, contributed
their respective opinions in the press, and <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>
also joined the fray. He was very cautious in saying that <span class=SpellE>Sita</span>,
judged by the standard of absolute truth, was lacking in it. But more than the
conclusion of the controversy, the occasion proved very useful to <span
class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> to dive into the text of the epic. Once he got
into it, his immersion </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>became more and more deep so that he began
to evince a desire to speak On the greatness and beauty of the Ramayana under
the auspices of the Madras <span class=SpellE>Samskrita</span> Academy, of
which he was president </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>then. It is now part of history that the
spell he cast on large audiences during his discourses was a source of immense
jubilation to those who had an undisguised suspicion that there might be an
estimate from him of the book according to the standards of mere literature.
The expectations were falsified in that he not only dwelt with reverence on the
character of Sri <span class=SpellE>Ramachandra</span> but he even tried to
make others ever consecrate the image of the hero of the immorta1 epic in their
hearts. Even on his death-bed, when visited by the Mahatma in January of 1946,
he could only recollect a verse from the Ramayana by way of reminding the
Mahatma of his great duty to the world, then in the throes of the after effects
of the second global war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a fitting finale for an integrated person’s adherence to some of the

the last, by dwelling on one of the greatest books that the world has treasured
so long with reverence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the orgy of uncritical adulation occasioned by the publication of Mr. Gordon N.
Ray’s book on Thackeray, it must look ungracious to strike a note of
disapproval. More than twelve years ago I felt the need to attempt a
re-valuation of Thackeray’s personal character and literary work, and I believe
it is necessary now more than ever before to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is now many years since a new edition of Melville’s Life of Thackeray was
brought out, and reviewing the book in a London weekly, Edwin Muir remarked
that an impartial biography of the novelist which offered an adequate account
of the dark and adventurous parts of Thackeray’s career was yet to be presented
to the world. The verdict passed on Thackeray was not in absolute terms and
always left room for doubt and controversy. The careful student will perceive
that the assured and unquestionable position fiction accorded to Sir Walter
Scott, Jane Austen, Dickens, George Eliot, Meredith, or Trollope has never
belonged to Thackeray. Critics who have spoken in passionate praise of
Thackeray have always betrayed that they armed themselves with the special
passion only to overthrow, if they could, the hostile criticism which they had
heard distinctly. Mr. Gordon N. Ray has betrayed this weakness even in the note
on the flap of the jacket by making unwarranted attacks on Thackeray’s
successful contemporaries. The sentence occurs in Saintsbury: “During his
lifetime some foolish persons called him cynical: since his death, others not
more wise have called him a sentimentalist.” It is not impossible that modern
investigation must lead to justifying the contemporary charge of cynicism and
the later one of sentimentalism. As against the numerous critics who have praised
Thackeray lavishly, a few courageous men have left on record their condemnation
of the vicious tendencies in the literary work and personal character of
Thackeray. In a letter to Arthur Hugh Clough, Matthew Arnold stated his
judgment that Thackeray was certainly a first-rate journeyman, though he was
not definitely a great artist. He also contrasted the work of Scott with that
of Thackeray, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>calling the former heaven-born, and the latter
un-heaven-born. Herbert Paul mentioned Arnold having said that Thackeray was
not a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>great writer, but unfortunately for us, he does not furnish
fuller details of Arnold’s attitude to Thackeray. Herbert Paul seems to lose
all his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>loyalty to the subject of his biography when he
characterises Arnold’s </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>judgment as <i>sagrenu </i>and states that
if Thackeray were not a great writer nobody else in English literature was. To
a diligent seeker the reasons</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> must be easily evident on which Arnold
based his condemnation. Again, Russell, the editor of Arnold’s letters, has
unluckily thought fit to omit the relevant words in a letter written by Arnold,
about Thackeray. Years after Thackeray had died, Beaconsfield the great
Victorian statesman, chose to draw a portrait of Thackeray in his novel,
“Endymion” in the character of St. Barbe. St. Barbe is a mean and envious
person who yet wields the power of creating vast amusement for the people of
his time. Beaconsfield is known to have transcribed numerous real persons in
his fictitious books, but we have not heard it suggested that personal malice rendered
these portraits unfair to their originals. But the English conspiracy to
protect Thackeray is once again in operation. Mr. Buckle, the biographer of
Beaconsfield, dismisses the creation of St. Barbe as a cruel portrait. Mr.
Buckle thinks that though Thackeray had offended Beaconsfield by his parody of
“Coningsby,” he made amends by paying handsome compliments later. Thackeray
spoke in praise of Beaconsfield on a public occasion and took care to
communicate the praise to Beaconsfield’s wife, pointing out that some authors
can praise other authors behind their back. Mr. Buckle does not pause to
consider whether this praising was kept quite behind the back. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the late evening of his life Saintsbury collected his Introductory essays to
the Oxford Thackeray in a book entitled “A Consideration of Thackeray.” It was
reasonable to expect that a note here and a note there would be inserted by the
author to recognise new facts revealed in the course of passing years.
Saintsbury however stuck resolutely and unrepentingly to his earlier
pronouncements. He did not mean to do more than putting together in bookform
the essays he had written for separate books. But it was surprising that Mr.
Malcolm Elwin was able to produce a biography in 1932 without the least evidence
of any advance from the traditional uncritical attitude towards the novelist.
Mr. Elwin called the book “Thackeray–A Personality.” He claimed to supply the
deficiency in previous books. Yet it may be confessed that Trollope, Merivale
and Marzials, and Whibley, help us better to form an impartial estimate of the
novelist than Mr. Elwin who indulges in the adulatory style of the Boswellean
type.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have yet another reason to justify a fresh appraisement of Thackeray. It is
possible to pursue a new line of analysis which helps us to gain an intimate
view of the methods employed by the novelist in constructing his characters. My
own investigations have revealed the secret of the composition of four
significant characters in the “New-comes,” and the facts derived by me joined
to others previously known, help us to pass judgment confidently on Thackeray.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Before attempting a brief review of his principal
novels I must remark on the important lessons in novel-writing which Thackeray
learnt of his great guru, Sir Walter Scott. We recognise easily that
Thackeray’s facility in writing is both his strength and his weakness. The mass
of non-descript and shapeless productions of his, before the publication of
“Vanity Fair” was amazing. He would perhaps never have found his way out of
that welter of writing but for the gleams of the novelist’s art which he caught
from Sir Walter Scott. He derived enlightenment from Scott about the historical
novel though he never practised Scott’s high ideals of historical truth. A more
important lesson was the basing of every novel on a definite historical period,
bringing it within the novelist’s own time. From Scott again, Thackeray learnt
to introduce the Indian nabob in his novels, though the foolish Joseph Sedley,
the mean Colonel Altamont, or even Colonel Newcome is nothing like the
dignified Colonel Mannering or the adorable Peregrine Touchwood. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>With “Vanity Fair” Thackeray came into his own. But
what was the story of this work? It concerned the career of a self-seeking and
unscrupulous governess, in other words, the novel portrays English life from
the point of view of a governess. In the first instance we learn about the
family of a baronet, Sir Pitt Crawley. It has been said that Sir Pitt was
copied from real life, and are we to infer a picture of the English aristocracy
form that of Sir Pitt? Of other important character, we first note Joseph
Sedley, the Collector of Boggley Wallah, than whom we cannot imagine a vainer
or more gullible person. Then there is the pair of friends, Osborne and Dobbin.
Osborne was a snob and fool and Dobbin, wholly virtuous, is yet made
ridiculous. Some of the comments on the Marquis of Steyne seem to suggest that
Thackeray could have recorded no higher type of Victorian political life.
Whibley has discussed this character and pointed out how Beaconsfield’s
treatment of the man is real and Thackeray’s unreal. In Thackeray the good man
is ridiculous and the good woman weak. “He had declared with some rashness that
he was creating in “Vanity Fair” a set of people without God. Saintsbury
presumes gratuitously that Thackeray has made an effective picture of life and
for that reason it cannot have left out God. Harriet Martineau wrote in her
Autobiography: “I confess to being unable to read “Vanity Fair” from the
disgust it occasions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Turning
to “Pendeanis” we note that the story of Colonel Altamont, the Claverings, and
Miss Amory, is the record of disgusting happenings in Anglo-India. Major
Pendennis seems to represent the height of virtue possible in Thackeray’s
novels. “Esmond” has been held up as the great example of the English
historical novel. Once again Thackeray’s sheer facility in writing has carried
the day. He imitated the style of the eighteenth century and created an
illusion on the reader that he is taken back to the earlier century. Critics
like Saintsbury have expressed a theatrical passion for the heroine, Beatrix.
The particular scandalous life on which Thackeray based that character is well
known. The Duchess of Kingston who was tried for bigamy is known to have
furnished the original. Several historical figures come into “Esmond.” Whibley
has pointed out how perverted the picture of Marlborough is. Swift is portrayed
with the meanest human qualities. “The Newcomes” is painted on larger canvas
than the other books. Colonel Newcome is a noble creation and the pathos of his
sufferings has been regarded as unsurpassed elsewhere. But we cannot forget
that he is so foolish that he cannot protect himself against the impositions of
the world. Barnes Newcome is a type of monstrous villainy, treated with a
cruelty found nowhere else. Like his generation Thackeray held the absurd
belief that young men must sow their wild oats, and after a time all will be
well–a belief attacked effectively in Meredith’s novel, “Ordeal of Richard
Feverel.” But what is peculiar to Thackeray is the difference with which he
applies this tolerant theory of wild oats to the different characters in his
novels. He has no word of reproach to Lord Kew or Arthur Pendennis, but on
Barnes Newcome and Charles Honeyman he pours unmitigated wrath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reference
has so far been made to the material of the four principal novels. It may be
contended that no literary work is to be judged by its matter. But no formal
beauty is possible without organic connection with worthy matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
must demand of critics that they adhere to a constant standard in judging the
work of different authors. About Scott for instance, Saintsbury writes: “He
left the novel the equal of any literary department in repute, profit,
possibility, and (which must be said, though it is travelling out of our usual
record) he infused into it, as Fielding had begun to do before him, a tradition
of moral and intellectual health, of manliness, of truth and honour, freedom
and courtesy, which has distinguished the best days of the English novel, as it
distinguishes those of hardly any other literary kind.” When considering
Thackeray however, Saintsbury does not apply the test of wholesomeness, but
dwells on his style, and states towards the end that he was the recorder of the
higher English life in the middle nineteenth century. One must form a very poor
opinion of the higher English life if it has been faithfully reflected in
Thackeray’s novels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
charge of cynicism against Thackeray cannot be dismissed. The author betrays an
incurable envy in the creation of his characters. Either he could brook no one
being spoken of with entire admiration or he was incapable of realising that
perfect balance and restraint in human character which shape the better types
of human beings in the world. Anthony Trollope concedes Thackeray’s cynical
quality but thinks that every other artist also has to be called a cynic,
instancing Swift, Pope and Juvenal. It must be however easy to differentiate
the satire of impersonal indignation from that of personal malice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Thackeray’s personal snobbery is apparent in the
pages of his writing. The novelist stands for the gentlemanly class not in the
sense of the word expounded by Newman, but in the vulgar sense of the tradesman
who values men according to their buying capacity. There is indeed in his
novels no sense of the great democracy of the common and poor people. Gentlemen
may of course joke about their servants in waiting, but viewing the world from the
poor man’s point of view would have shocked the gentlemanly sense of Thackeray.
It is not for nothing that Dickens is held higher than Thackeray in the
estimate of the majority of readers. The heart of Humanity lay close to
Dickens, while Thackeray consumed his heart in the restless ambition of rising
to eminence in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a literary critic or rambling essayist Thackeray’s powers are insignificant.
The lectures on the humourists of the eighteenth century are attractive only
for their chatty style. Thackeray could no more analyse the subject of humour
than he could interpret the philosophy of life. Nor is his characterisation of
the great writers always true to facts or fair in judgment. The most notorious
portrait is that of Swift, who, in the words of Whibley, never put pen to paper
save in scorn of stupidity, or with a fixed desire to reform abuses.” Whibley
comments on Thackeray’s antipathy to Swift thus: “And the easy-going man about
town not unnaturally saddled his back with all the sins and all the absurdities
that he castigated in others.” Whibley remarks again that Thuckeray begins his
discourse on Swift with an irrelevant question, “Would we have liked to live
with him?” Whibley answers the question<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“.... it is indubitably true that the best of Swift’s contemporaries did
like to live with him and felt honoured in his acquaintance.” We may further
suggest that if the same question were asked in reference to Thackeray, the
answer would have to be: “Decidedly not, unless we were of his family or had
some claim on his homage.” Yet another vice of Thackeray’s manner has been
pointed out in the needless condescension and pity bestowed by him on the
writers who formed the theme of his lectures, in expressions like “poor Dick
Steele”, “poor Henry Fielding” and “poor Congreve,” The whirlgig of time must
point to “poor Thackeray.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
qualities which render Thackeray’s writing attractive are obvious. The
matchless fluency of his style and the wealth of creation in his novels are
remarkable. The characters are life-like, because the novelist seems to make
them act and speak as if on their own initiative. The incidental observations
on human nature are sufficiently penetrating, though not profound. Most readers
are so charmed by these features that they do not stop to judge the whole
scheme of his writings. Human nature is often tickled by the extravagant
account of the lower nature of man, and to all who have the instinct for
scandal Thackeray becomes the patron-saint. But the defective understanding of
human nature which renders his writing unwholesome is obvious. This lack of
spiritual health is also betrayed in his imperfect art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writers are but men, with imperfections like any other set of men in the world,
but the world is apt to regard a prominent writer or artist as an adorable man.
Yet some very good writers have been terrible sinners themselves, but it is not
the sinning part 0f their composition that produces the literary work. It also
happens sometimes that by sinning the writers have been led to repentance, and
the unpractised purity of their imagination has produced some of the best
literature. But the imperfections of Thackeray as a man show themselves clearly
in the imperfections of his literary work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
study of the material on which Thackeray based his fictitious characters helps
to throw light on his personality. It has become a fashion among some literary
critics to condemn the attempt to trace fictitious characters to their
originals in life as a vulgar occupation bereft </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of all critical
value. But this attitude is born usually of laziness. The tracing of originals
may be done both rightly and wrongly, and we are not concerned with the wrong
way. Where we may, by a perfectly logical method, derive certain results
calculated to be useful to us in the appraisement of the literary worth of the
author, it will amount to perversity to reject it. After all we may remember
with what assiduity scholars have studied the sources of Shakespeare’s plays as
an indispensable part of their critical work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
his Introduction to “Vanity Fair” Saintsbury writes: “Of the famous studies, or
supposed studies, of real life in public or private characters one must say a
little more. Of late the tendency has been to exaggerate their coincidence with
their originals.” Saintsbury does not however omit to mention as many of the
originals as have been known, in his Introductions to the novels. He quotes Sir
Leslie Stephen’s caution against emphasising too much the coincidences between
real persons and the characters of novels. Saintsbury also refers, with obvious
like, to a German monograph in which the life of the novelist is laboriously
inferred from his work. The book is not before us, but the idea of the German
writer must be unexceptionable, provided the reasoning is carried on soundly.
Saintsbury is always apt to presume a little too much in favour of the famous
names of literature and in reference to constructing novels on real characters,
says that though a large number of traits, incidents, individual details, are
taken from actuality, they are “all passed through the alembic or the loom of
art–redistilled or rewoven into original and independent composition.” It often
happens that this alembic or loom proves defective in its functioning, and the
critic then sees more of the raw material than the writer could have wished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years ago, from December 1927 to March 1928, I contributed to the pages of the
Cornhill Magazine a study of four characters in the “Newcomes”, tracing them to
the originals on which I showed them to be obviously based. By my pointing to
remarkable details of the Colonel’s likeness to Sir Thomas Munro, all previous
suggestions about the Colonel’s original became less important. James Binnie
was shown to be a composite picture of Lord Macaulay and Mountstuart
Elphinstone. Rummon Loll was an unimaginably perverted account of Raja Rammohun
Roy who was much more than an ambassador from India in the political sense.
Lastly, Charles Honeyman, the hypocritical priest, was seen to reflect no other
than the Rev. W. H. Brookfield, one of Thackeray’s intimate friends. Munro and
Elphinstone are obviously dwarfed in the re-creation in the novel. The perverse
transformation of Rammohun Roy retains a lasting bitterness. The presence of an
Indian in London society was a rare phenomenon in the thirties of the last
certury, and one Indian of high attainments appeared there to rouse the warmest
plaudits of all classes. Yet poor Thackeray who could spare room for only one
Indian character chose to immortalise an Indian cheat in his novel, who yet
succeeded in receiving the warmest favours of English society. It was not a
thoughtless accident which led Thackeray to give a preverted reflexion of
Rammohun Roy in Rummun Loll. It was revealed in the pages of the “Modern
Review” (Calcutta) a few years ago that the uncle of the novelist who was
Secretary of the Bengal Government at the time was filled with such
unreasonable antipathy to Rammohun Roy as to threaten to visit his wrath on the
British official Digby for recommending his Indian subordinate, Rammohun Roy,
unceasingly for promotion. The novelist was adopting a family prejudice in
presenting the malicious picture of the Indian gentleman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

if the unscrupulous portrayal of an Indian did not disturb the complacency of
the English critic, the secret of Charles Honeyman, when revealed, has not left
them undisturbed. When I first built up the hypothesis of Honeyman being a
reflexion of Brookfield, I was asked to give it up, by a kinsman of the
novelist. But my proposition has since become an accepted fact. Mr. Elwin has
stated that Thackeray launched a gibe against his friend, who was now a
fashionable preacher at Berkley Chapel, in the satirical picture of Charles
Honeyman as the rhetorical prophet of Lady Whittlesea’s Chapel. Mr. Elwin has
not however chosen to acknowledge the discovery having been made by me. Mr.
Robert Lynd has stated in his review of Mr. Elwin’s book that Thackeray did
scarcely forgivable things as when he put Brookfield into Honeyman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
it is easy to infer the peculiar manner of Thackeray’s translation of real
characters into his novels from my own investigations, the inference gains
added importance by other examples of the novelist’s practice having been
previously known. H. G. Keene has pointed out how unfair to the memory of Col.
James Gardner the story of Major Gahagan is, while Gahagan is still a copy of
Garner. Thackeray cast an unwarranted slur on Marlborough in “Esmond.” Whibley
remarks: “It is unnecessary to say that the portrait is inconsistent with
history as with itself. The Duke, indeed, as Thackeray paints him, is no man
but a monster, a mere epitome of the vices...” Thackeray’s rancour is usually
betrayed by his artistic failure. I have pointed out that Charles Honeyman is
not a convincing character. His attractiveness and success as a preacher are
ill harmonised with the humiliation to which he is reduced, as a consequence of
pecuniary difficulties, though taking perhaps his cue from Dickens’s management
of Micawber, the author redeems Honeyman at the end of the story by making him
return gratefully the money advanced for his benefit by Colonel Newcome.
Thackeray’s rancour is evident also in the creation of Barnes Newcome which I
have explained, in a separate study, is unreal. Barnes is a combination of
vices too many and too incompatible with one another for one human being to
possess. It is known that Thackeray copied his friend Arcedecne of the Garrick
Club in his Harry Foker. Mr. Elwin tries to justify Thackeray by referring to
the offending acts of Arcedecne against the novelist. The only proves that the
novelist used his fictitious characters to vent his personal spleen, a pitiful
motive for a literary artist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

readers had long been led to believe that the Rev. W. H. Brookfield had been of
the very few and very select friends of the novelist. Many proofs of this
attachment have been quoted. But a breach between the two has left its lasting
reflexion in the picture of Honeyman, Mr. Elwin took upon himself to make a
statement of the Thackeray-Brookfield case. Briefly, Thackeray’s personal life
was rendered miserable by his wife turning mad and he sought elsewhere womanly </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>companionship
and friendship, which he found in the beautiful wife of his friend Brookfield.

description, Mr. Elwin gives us a detailed account of the lady’s charms, to
justify the attraction exercised on Thackeray. Men of achievement do not
observe the scruples of convention. It is part of their character to create
conditions for their comfortable living. That Thackeray went about explaining
elaborately in his letters the blamelessness of his relations with Mrs.
Brookfield is less important to us than that it was necessary at all for him to
offer explanations. Having obviously benefited immensely by the affectionate
womanly friendship of Mrs. Brookfield, Thackeray might have shown a generous
feeling to Mr. Brookfield, the husband, and not nurtured a secret malice such
as is reflected in the picture of Honeyman. The irony of this act lies in the
haughty contempt with which Thackeray treated Edmund Yates, who, he alleged,
violated the sacredness of club confidences by commenting on his own personal
characteristics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
presenting the Edmund Yates story, Mr. Elwin is very distrustful of the reader
making his own inferences from the evidence available on the subject, for
otherwise he would not lavish such scurrilous language on Yates, as he has. He
refers to “one of those enterprising scavenging scribblers, who have festered
in every age, since Edmund Curll fostered his own breed mistaking impertinence
for wit, and slander for criticism.” Mr. Elwin’s brilliant logic lies in his
implying that the offence of Yates was accentuated by the fact that the great
novelist had sometimes smiled on him in kindly courtesy. If every condescending
smile should disarm criticism, we do not know what the world will come to. Mr.
Elwin is childish enough to suggest that Thackeray showed too much
consideration by merely communicating to Yates his resentment of the latter’s
remarks and not suing him in court and making certain of a heavy sum in
damages. The novelist was of course wiser than Mr. Elwin. Yet Mr. Elwin had the
goodness to place before the reader the better parts of the offending writer’s
comment. Edmund may not have developed eminence in the literary world, but the
shrewd and penetrating character of his criticism is evident. If we should
construct the personality of the novelist by a process of inference from his
writings the picture will confirm exactly the description by Yates: “...his
bearing is cold and uninviting, his style of conversation either openly cynical
or affectedly good-natured and benevolent, his <i>bonhomie </i>forced, his wit
biting, his pride easily touched–but his appearance is invariably that of the
cool, sauve, well-bred gentleman, who, whatever may be rankling within, suffers
no surface display of emotion.” We must be grateful to Yates for bearing
testimony to the personal qualities of the writer which are only too well
reflected in the writings. After all, the world is interested in the personal
qualities of Thackeray only as the author of a number of novels, essays, and
sketches. These convey certain distinct impressions to the reader. Details of personal
testimony which confirm the impressions derived from the writings are of value

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
constant repetition in his writings of a certain type of character and
experience, is obvious. Young men sowing wild oats appear frequently. Among
other vices gambling attracts the chief characters, and this propensity,
Thackeray will make it appear to us, is not expressive of the innate evil in
the young men, but is produced by an external tempter who haunts the author’s
imagination as a definite ogre. The novelist is thoroughly at home in creating
the type of Rawdon Crawley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

novels bear out fully that to Thackeray the material pleasures of the world are
of the greatest account. Descriptions of food occur endlessly. Drink and
revelry and gaming and the theatre are the other exciting topics. His
attachment to the pleasures of the table was so intense that he would give up a
social engagement in favour of eating a delicious dish at the club. His
excessive devotion to the pleasures is mentioned in the biography of his
friends. Writing on Fitzgerald, A. C. Benson compares the two friends: There
was a radical difference between the two men. Thackeray had a full-blooded love
of life and living and an inveterate sociability of disposition. Fitzgerald had
far less vitality and animal spirits, and found the kind of life in which
Thackeray revelled a decided strain.” Benson also mentions that there was a
certain cynicism in Thackeray which was unpalatable to Fitzgerald. Thackeray
grew so haughty in the days of his success that Fitzgerald made a
complaint<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

assumption of the moralist’s role by a man who is enslaved by the pleasures of
the world leads to absurdity. He alternates between extremes of being too
severe and too lenient. The leniency with which </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he treats the
relations of Pendennis with women is as noteworthy as the severity with which
Honeyman’s weaknesses are commented on. In dwelling on the worse side of human
nature, Thackeray, unlike Swift </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>who was of a mournful
and stoic cast of mind, shows himself guilty of heartless railing. It is
amusing to note the tenderness with which some critics seek to explain away
recorded instances of Thackeray’s rude behaviour to others. “Poor Thackeray was
unhappy, and what sins may not be forgiven in one sick at heart!” The humour
lies in the reversal of the functions appropriate to the author and to the
reader. The creative artist is one who grasps the inner secrets of the world
and offers a satisfactory interpretation thereof. Should not the man of such
exceptional gifts know how to conduct himself so as to be above the
compassionate indulgence of friendly critics? Men who are guilty of even the
worst offence against the world may yet be heroes claiming the deepest love of
their own families. A successful man in life makes a large circle of friends
who in their partisanship for him are like members of his own family. The
purpose of criticism is ill served by the testimony of such friends. Again,
generosity in making gifts to others is a doubtful measure of a man’s large-heartedness.
The most pleasure-loving and selfish men are known to scatter their gifts with
recklessness. Such giving is part of a man’s over-bearing haughtiness which is
farthest removed from the spirit of goodness. The charges of pride, haughtiness
and overbearing conduct against Thackeray have not been disproved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then was Thackeray. His birth and breeding in India till the sixth year, when
he must have been surrounded by an array of black servants had evidently left a
lasting injury on his character. Haughty and ambitious by nature, he had brains
and talents to aspire to literary distinction which should, before all, bring
him ample means of comfortable and luxurious living. The facility of style and
quickness of invention, in his writing, dazzled the readers and he succeeded.
Success is an almost impenetrable veil through which to assess the real worth
on which it is based. Thoughtful men had not however been deceived–Carlyle had
a poor opinion of his work, and if he seemed to be converted, it is like the
old story of Johnson and Wilkes. As Arnold put it, Thackeray was a first-rate
journeyman, one who studied the successful ways of capturing the clients and
obtained unheard of wages for his work. But he did not attain real art and
could not know the happiness of supreme artistic creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

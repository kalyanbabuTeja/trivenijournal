age of Krishnadevaraya in Telugu literature is generally considered as the
Golden Age of Telugu literature. It is otherwise called the Prabandha Age
because poets like Allasani Peddana wrote during this period Kavyas which are
named and popularly known as the ‘Prabandhas’. If one wishes to enjoy the
richness of imagina­tion, the unparalelled scholarship, the use of sweet and
mellifluous words, and the grand ornate style of the Telugu poets, one has
invariably to read the Prabandhas. In the extensive garden of Telugu literature
the Prabandha age is a beautiful flower park wherein we come across at every
step streams of flowery juice, platforms of pollen and abundant fragrance of innumerable
flowers. It is no exaggeration to say that when people enter this park they
forget themselves and feel as if they are in the heart of paradise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
word Prabandha is derived from the root ‘bandh’ with the prefix ‘pra’. It means
a work or Kavya with dignified composition or arrangement of words. According
to this, any work with such composition can be called a ‘Prabandha’. In
Sanskrit the word Prabandha is more or less a synonym to Kavya. Thus we come
across the compounds Gadya Prabandha, Padya Prabandha and Drisya Prabandha in
Sanskrit. In Telugu also the word Prabandha seems to have been used in the same
sense before the age of Krishnadevaraya. The famous poet Tikkana Somayaji who complet­ed
the translation of the Sanskrit Bharata into Telugu by writing fifteen Parvas,
beginning from the Virataparva, called the Parvas written by him as “Prabandha
Mandali” which means a group of Prabandhas. In his opinion each Parva of the
Mahabharata written by him is a Prabandha in itself. Yerrapragada of the
Kavitraya or the Trinity of the poets has got the title ‘Prabandha­parameswara’.
It means a master <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or<i> </i></span>an
expert in writing a Prabandha. Here also the word Prabandha means Kavya in general.
Some other poets who lived before the 16th century used the word Prabandha in
the Gadyas of their works and they also meant by it Kavya in general. They
never wanted to denote a particular sense by using that word. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
the beginning of the 16th century the word Prabandha began to be used in a
different connotation. The Emperor Krishnadevaraya was not only a great patron
of letters but also a great poet in both Sanskrit and Telugu. He wrote a Prabandha
by name ‘Amuktamalyada’ or ‘Vishnuchitteeyamu’ in Telugu and dedicated it to
Lord Venkateswara. He patronised eight great poets who are called the
Ashtadiggajas and carried on poetical discourses with them in his court which
is popularly known as the ‘Bhuvana vijaya mahasabha’. These Ashtadiggajas were
all poets of high order and vied with one another in writing Prabandhas and
gaining approbation from the Emperor-poet. Allasani peddana is the foremost
among them not only from the point of age but also from the point of
scholarship and poetic talent. He wrote ‘Manucharitra’ or ‘Swarochisha Manusambhava’
in six Aswasas or cantos and dedicated it to his patron. He named it a Prabandha
and this is considered as the first Prabandha in Telugu which is the model for
all the Prabandhas written afterwards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Though
Prabandha is nothing but a Kavya in general it attained a particular meaning or
Roodhartha from the beginning of the 16th century. Its main characteristic features
may be described as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
theme in Prabandha should be Prakhyata or well-known, i.e., it must be taken
from the well-known Puranas or epics like the Mahabhrata and the Ramayana.
There should be unity of plot in it. The main Rasa or sentiment in it should be
Sringara and the hero a Dheerodatta. The eighteen descriptions that are round
in the Sanskrit Mahakavya should be introduced into it. It must be divided into
five or six cantos according to convenience. It is written in Champu form in a
dignified stile with figures of speech of both word and sense. It has an
Avatarika or the introductory portion in the beginning containing benedictory
verses, praise of the ancient poets, censure of the bad poets, description of
the lineage of the Kritipati or the dedicatee, the circumstances in which the
work was begun and the Shashtyanthas or verses ending in the genitive at the
end of each canto, all containing adjectives in the vocative case addressed to
the dedicatee. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Taking
into consideration all the above characteristics it can be concluded that a Telugu
Prabandha blends in it the characteristic features of the Sanskrit Padyakavya,
Champukavya and the Nataka to some extent. According to Sanskrit Rhetoricians a
Mahakavya contains the eighteen descriptions, a hero of the Dheerodatta type,
and either Sringara or Veera as the main Rasa. Sahityadarpana is of opinion
that even Santha can be described as the main Rasa in a Mahakavya. The Telugu
Prabandha borrowed these characteristics with some modifications. The main Rasa
in a Prabandha should be invariably Sringara and it contains only five or six
cantos, whereas we find in a Mahakavya cantos numbering upto twenty or more,
Generally the metre used in each canto of the Mahakavya is the same with one or
two different metres in the end. Variety of metres inter­spersed with prose
passages here and there are used in the Prabandha perhaps to avoid monotony and
in this respect it can be compared with the Sanskrit Champukavya. The tradition
of writing one or two Slokas with different metre in the end of each canto of
the Mahakavya is found in the Prabandha also, but in a different way. The
authors of the Prabandha write three verses at the end of each canto with rare
and peculiar metres and with adjectives in the vocative case describing the
qualities of the dedicatee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are ten Rupakas in Sanskrit and the Nataka is the most popular among them. The
Telugu Prabandha contains some characteristics of the Nataka also. The Nataka
is written in dialogue form and can be considered a Champukavya as it contains
verses and prose pieces also. Though the Prabandha is a narrative poem we find
in it beautiful poetic dialogues and prose pieces here and there, of course,
not as frequently as in the Nataka. The theme is Prakhyata and the hero
Dhirodatta in both. The main Rasa in the Nataka is either Sringara or Veera
whereas in the Prabandha it is Sringara alone. The Nataka generally contains
five to six acts and the Prabandha five to six cantos. Though they have similar
characteristics as stated above they differ from each other as one is mainly a
Drisyakavya and the other a Sravyakavya, and in the matter of style also they
are more dissimilar than similar. The Nataka is generally written in simple
style so that the audience may understand and enjoy it even at the first
hearing, whereas we find in the Prabandha highly ornate and pedantic style
understandable to learned scholars alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
appearance of the Nataka in Telugu is very late, due to many causes, and the
first Nataka has been written in the middle of the 19th century. No doubt, many
Drisyakavyas called the Yakshaganas were written in the 17th and 18th centuries
in the south but they are Rupakas of the indigenous type and can not be called
Natakas in the strictest sense of the word. Some Telugu poets felt the absence
of the Nataka in their language and tried to translate a few Sanskrit Natakas
in the form of Sravyakavyas as they could not maintain the same dramatic form
due to several reasons. The Prabandha poets also might have borrowed some
characteristics of the Sanskrit Nataka and introduced them in the new literary
form which they were trying to evolve to compensate for the absence of the
Nataka. They might have satisfied themselves for the time being with reading
the Prabandha which possessed some Lakshnas of the Nataka. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sanskrit Puranas were translated into Telugu in the period between the 11th and
the 15th centuries and the poets who translated them were no doubt experts in
the art of poetry. But the extensive nature of the Puranas, the lack of unity
of plot and the supernatural element in them, encouraged the poets of the 16th
century to invent a new literary form which generally <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>maintains the unity of plot which, as it is smaller in size, can be
read in a few hours and which can give the highest poetic pleasure to the
readers. The time was also favourable for the emergence of such an exhilarating
novel literary form as in the benign rule of the Emperor Krishnadevaraya the
country was free from external danger and the people were happy enjoying all
kinds of pomp and prosperity. The generous patronage given to the poets by the scholarly
emperor attracted many first-rate poets to his court and prompted them to
compose beautiful Prabandhas trying to excel one another in a spirit of
competition. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nannechoda,
the first Saivite poet in Telugu who lived in the 12th century, wrote a Kavya
by name “Kumarasambhava” in which he described the marriage of Siva and
Parvati, the birth of Kumaraswami and his victory over the demon Taraka. It has
twelve cantos and contains all the characteristic features of later Prabhandha
and truly speaking it deserves to be called the first Prabhanda in Telugu. But
unfortunately it remained in darkness for more than seven centuries and owing
perhaps to the religious creed followed by the poet and to the independent attitude
taken <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>by<i> </i></span>him in the use
of language, neither the poets nor Lakshanikas mentioned his name in their
works. In this way it could not gain popularity and remained almost obscure. The
“Nrisimhapurana” of Yerrapragada is in fact a Prabhandha notwithstanding its
name but the main Rasa in it is not Sringara. The “Uttaraharivamsa” of Nachana
Somanadha contains some character­istics of the Prabandha but it lacks unity of
plot. Sreenadha’s “Naishadha” has <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>got<i>
</i></span>all the qualities of a Prabandha but it is not reckoned to be so as
it is a mere translation of the Sanskrit Naishadha Kavya. Pillalamarri
Pinaveerabhadra’s “Sringara Sakuntalam” lost its eligibility for being the
first Prabandha in Telugu as it is not completely original, many of the verses
in it having been borrowed or translated from Kalidasa’s “Abhijnana Sakuntalam.”
No doubt all the works mentioned above helped the evolution of Prabandha in
Telugu to a great extent but the credit of being the first Prabandha in Telugu
goes to “Manucharitra” or “Swarochisha Manusambhava” written by Allasani
Peddana the favourite poet of the Emperor, Krishnadevaraya.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

good Prabandhas were written during the 16th century and the most prominent
among them are “Manuchritra” of Allasani Peddana, “Parijatapaharanamu” of Nandi
Timmana, “Amukta­malyada” of the Emperor Krishnadevaraya, “Vasucharitra” of
Bhattumoorthy, “Kalapurnodayamu” and “Prabhavatipradyumnamu” of Pingali Surana.
“Rajasekharacharitra” of Madayagari Mallana is another Prabandha written in the
same period but it is not very popular. “Sreekalahastimahatmyamu” and “Pandurangamahatmyamu”
of the famous poets Dhurjati and Tenali Ramakrishna are also called Prabandhas
and are widely read by the scholars put really speaking they belong to a
separate type of Kavya called the Kshetra Mahatmya. They describe the greatness
of a particular Kshetra, its presiding deity and the stories of several
devotees who attained Moksha by dint of the sanctity of the Kshetra and of the
grace of the deity presiding over it. They combine in them the characteristic features
of the Purana and the Prabandha. They are Puranic in theme and Prabandhic in
style.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

“Manucharitra” and Sreekrishnadevaraya’s “Amukta­malyadaa” also lack unity of
plot to some extent but the rich imagery of the poets, their extraordinary
power of description, their skill in characterisation and delineating the
Rasas, their scholarship and observation of nature have raised them to the highest
place which they deservedly occupy. “Parijatapaharanam” of Timmana <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is<i> </i></span>famous for characterisation
and sweetness of language. Bhattumoorthy’s “Vasucharitra” is a perfect
Prabandba having all the qualities and stands unique among the Prabandhas of
the age on account of the all-pervading qualities of Slesha and Dhwani, of the
unprecedented dexterity in the use of sweet and meaningful words and by the
un-paralelled scholarship exhibited by the poet. Surana’s <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>“Prabhavati</span>pradyumnamu” is a Nataka
in the form of Prabandha and has attracted critics and scholars by the
beautiful dramatic situations described in it. Special mention may here be made
of “Kalapurnodayamu” of the same poet. In speciality lies in the theme which is
as interesting as it is complicated and which is entirely invented by the poet.
While all the other poets of the age have taken Prakhyata themes for their
Prabandhas, he is the only poet who ventured to weave and develop an original
theme making a dancing girl as the heroine in it deviating from the established
tradition. It is generally called a poetic novel and has some accidental
resemblance with the story of the “Comedy of Errors” of the great English
dramatist William Shakespeare. It is surprising to note that both of them lived
in the same age, though in different countries, without any chance of knowing
each other. His skill in narrating the story is superb and his power of
creating interesting dialogues excellent. Bhattumoorthy remarks in the
introduction of his “Vasucharitra” that “invented stories are artificial
diamonds, old stories are unpolished diamonds and mixed stories are polished diamonds
of the highest quality”. This is perhaps an aspersion thrown at Surana who
invented the story in his Prabandha. This kind of criticism might have
discouraged Surana to continue his new experiment as he himself resorted back
to Prakhyata theme in his “Prabhavatipradyumna” which he wrote afterwards. In
spite of all this his “Kalapurnodayamu” enjoys unique popularity and is
extolled by all critics for its novelty, originality and for the many other
poetic qualities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

poets continued to write Prabandhas even after the fall of the Vijayanagar
Empire till about the beginning of present century. But many of them are mere
imitations of either Manucharitra or Vasucharitra and have little or no
originality in them. “Vijayavilasam” of Chemakura Venkatakavi (1620) “Rasikajanamanobhiramamu”
of Kuchimanchi Timmakavi( 1730) “Kavijanaranjanamu” alias “Chandramatiparinayamu”
of Adidam Surakavi (1740) and “Kavirajamanoranjanam” of Abbayamatya (1760) are considered
to be the best among the later Prabandhas. The last two are called “Pilla-Vasucharitralu”
(miniature Vasucharitras) as they imitate and resemble <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>it<i> </i></span>in many respects. Quality of the Prabandha gradually
deteriorated as the later poets were satisfied with mere imitation and resorted
to Sabda-chitra and Sabdalankaras. Late Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu, one of
the pioneers of modern Telugu literature, described the various aspects of this
deterioration in his small poem “Saraswati Narada Vilapamu”. This decadence
prompted the young Telugu poets in the beginning of the present century to
write new type of poetry which is called ‘Bhavakavitwam’ or romantic poetry on
the lines of the English romantic poets. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

hero goes for hunt and hears the sound of music while returning. He goes to the
spot from where the music is coming and sees the heroine with her female
friends. He falls in love with her and the heroine also loves him in return.
They leave each other and return home only to suffer from the pangs of
separation. This state of Viraha of both the hero and the heroine is described at
length in all the Prabandhas. Through the mediation of friends on both sides
they meet and their marriage is performed with pomp. The Prabandha ends with
the description of Sambhoga Sringara. The Prabandha poets managed to introduce
the eighteen kinds of descriptions in the course of the story and these
descriptions, rich in imagination, observation and figures of speech, occupy a
major portion of the Pradandha. Anandavardhana and others are of opinion that “the
construction of the plot should subserve the sentiment and that a plot device
is certainly to be condemned whether it be in a play or an epic poem if it does
not contribute to the development of Rasa.” We can say that the Prabandha poets
in Telugu, at least some of them, are indifferent in this respect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

shining mirrors which reflect not only the social and cultural conditions of
the age but also the discriminating, appreciative taste of excellence and beauty

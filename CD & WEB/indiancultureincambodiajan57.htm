style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ancient
and colourful Cambodia is fast becoming the cockpit between French colonialism
and Asian nationalism. Subject for centuries to foreign incursions and mandarin
exactions, the Cambodian whose only pride is ancient glory, now stands divided
between two warring ideologies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cambodia
is one of the eastern countries which have been influenced by Indian culture to
a high degree. As a matter of fact, it is the only foreign culture so far
discovered in Cambodia. Whether it is art, religion, mode of living, sculpture,
literature or language, there is a touch of Indian culture everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ancient glory of Cambodia reads like a fairy tale. Over 1000 years ago, it was
the hub of a vast Hindu empire extending from the Bay of Bengal to the China
Sea. Cambodia was then prosperous and thickly populated. Being, by nature,
lovers of music and all forms of arts and crafts, the people erected colossal
palaces and temples, whose architectural beauty has been unexcelled elsewhere.
The wisdom of the enlightened kings and priests was influential in making the
Khmer tribes civilised. Their culture spread even to the tropical jungles of
Cambodia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cambodia
was already a powerful State long before the Sailendra kings had consolidated
their power. Whether this country was under the sway of the Sailendras is open
to debate, but it is clear that Cambodia was fully independent in the 9th
century and its empire existed till the close of the 13th century. Under the
rule of such great builders as Jayavarman and Indravarman, the country was
covered with a wonderful network of roads, which have since been obliterated.
The area which they ran through is now a wilderness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Angkor,
the capital of the empire, was known as the Magnificent City, in which
flourished a million inhabitants. All of a sudden, disintegration set in. One
by one the provinces were torn from the old empire by the Mongol Emperors of
China, and the northern invaders of Tibetan stock. During the collapse, a
number of monuments were left unfinished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the jungle tribes had shrunk to insignificant numbers owing to tropical
disease, and again lapsed into a pitiable state. </span><span style='font-size:

little remains of the great and glorious work of Hindu civilisation, except a

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>under French
protection, and a few monuments by Hindu architects and sculptors and a royal

dances in immortal Bali. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Writing
about Cambodia without mentioning Angkor Vat would be incomplete. Angkor Vat is
to Cambodia what the Taj Mahal is to India. It is a living memory of the Khmer
genius </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

in the reign of Jayavarman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The main temple of Angkor Vat is over 270 yards long
and about a furlong wide. It is formed in terraces, one above the other. There
are five towers of which the central one is about 125 feet high. Every inch of
stone work is finished to the smallest details. Round this great edifice is a
vast area of mighty ruins, with tanks and pools. Along one terrace are
life-size elephants, sculptured from one end to the other. The five gates of
this town are also formed in sculptured elephants picking lotus flowers with
their trunks. The favourite subject of sculpture is that of women in the form
of dancers and goddesses. It is the marvellous dress and posture, which are to
this day adopted in all dances and ceremonies in Cambodia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
greatness of Angkor has been praised to the skies by many authorities on
Oriental sculpture, but there is no better description than that of Osbert
Sitwell, who states: “Let it be said immediately that Angkor, as it stands,
ranks as the chief wonder of the world today, one of the summits to which human
genius has reached in stone, infinitely more impressive, lovely, and as well
romantic, than anything that can be seen in China.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India’s
connection with most of the countries in the East dates back to over 2000
years. India’s traders ventured across the Bay of Bengal to ply their trades.
Stories of the fabulous wealth of the East soon spread in India, creating great
interest among the people. Indian scholars in Sanskrit accompanied these
traders to study these lands. The inhabitants began to appreciate the doctrines
of these scholars so much that by stages they found themselves converted to
Hinduism and Buddhism. It was therefore from India that Buddhism and Indian
culture spread over the East, including Cambodia, which was essentially a
Buddhist empire, and to this day Buddhism flourishes there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the first 1000 years of the Christian era, according to various authorities of
ancient Oriental history, there were four or five waves of colonisation by
Indian adventurers all over the East. Scattered as these colonies were, they
were ‘mainly situated on strategic points and on trade routes. These
settlements were given old Indian names. Thus Cambodia, as it is known now, was
called Kambhoja, which was a well-known town in ancient India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
early Buddhist scholars were instrumental in establishing various institutions
of Sanskrit learning. One such centre was situated at Angkor in Cambodia.
Sanskrit was absorbed to such an extent in the life of the people, that
everything came to be known by a Sanskrit name. In Cambodia, the alphabet was
derived from South Indian script. There is also evidence of ‘records of regular
Sanskrit recitations and dramas too in Cambodia in the 7th century.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
persistence of Indian culture in Cambodian life in every sphere has been due to
the fact that after the Buddhist scholars had crossed the dangerous land and
sea routes, many of those who survived the ordeal (a number of them perished <i>en
route) </i>settled in the new lands of the East and adopted them as their own.
Their enlightened teachings and art took the inhabitants as if by storm. As a
result, Cambodian culture is actually a mixture of Indian and Khmer culture. It
was the genius of this fusion that produced the magnificent monuments of Angkor
Vat and elsewhere in Cambodia. Since then, Indian culture has literally flowed
in the veins of the Cambodians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
greater tribute has ever been paid to Indian culture than that of Dr. Quaritch
Wales, the noted archaeologist, who says: “When the guiding hand of India was
removed, her inspiration was not forgotten, but the Khmer genius was released
to mould from it vast new conceptions of amazing vitality different from, and,
hence not properly to be compared with anything matured in a purely Indian
environment...It must be admitted that here, more than anywhere else in Greater
India, this inspiration fell on fertile soil.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are about 8,000 Indians in Indo-China, out of whom there are nearly 1000 in
Cambodia. Found in all sorts of small trades, their main business is in cloth
and cotton piece-goods. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The majority of them are Sikhs and
Sindhis. As traders, they have won the respect of the Cambodians, with whom
they maintain cordial relations. The Indians there are a living link between </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>their
motherland and the land of their adoption. By settling there they have become
permanent ambassadors of India in Cambodia. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having lived long
enough in that country, they have attained domicile benefits. During their
residence, they have been successful in bringing into closer relationship the
two ancient lands whose past is so full of glory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indians
have always been sympathetic towards the genuine aspirations of the Cambodians.
As far back as 1927, when the Indian National Congress met to evolve its
foreign policy, Indians developed an interest in the national movement of
Indo-China. This policy of supporting genuine nationalism on democratic lines
has never abated. For that matter, India has always stood for the freedom of
all subject nations, especially those in Asia. The Cambodians reciprocate their
sentiments by cordial relations with the Indians living among them. It is for
this reason that India’s relations with Cambodia are closer than ever before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Cambodians, being a religious and freedom loving people, least of all desire
their country coming into the grips of the present strife in Indo-China. Who
knows, by some miracle the Cambodians may escape the horrors of war. Perhaps,
it is not too late for the democratic forces among the French to strengthen
their own hands by recognising the complete independence of Cambodia. They
would thus<i> </i>gain the goodwill of not only Cambodia, but also the rest of
the nations of Asia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

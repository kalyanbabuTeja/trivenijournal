his broadcast from London on January 12, 1951 Prime Minister Nehru observed
thus: “Of my generation many have lived the greater part of our lives and only
a few years remain to us. It matters little what happens to our generation but
it does matter a great deal what happens to hundreds of millions of others and
to the world at large. <i>Today these hundreds of millions all over the world
live under a kind of suspended sentence of death. </i>And from day to day an
atmosphere is created in people’s mines of the inevitability of war.” The
tragedy of the world today is in truth this suspended sentence of death under
which the millions of the people of all countries are made to live in
consequence of the game of power politics in which the rulers of Soviet Russia
and the United States, added by their allies and satellites, are indulging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the survey for the previous quarter it was remarked that with the crossing of
the South Korean and the United States’ forces into North Korea beyond the
thirty eighth parallel the Korean War became an aggressive war the aggressor
being the United States. It was against this aggression that the Chinese moved
their forces. The move was not a sudden one. Notice of it was given in the
speech delivered by Chow-En-Lai, China’s Foreign Minister, on the occasion of
the celebration of the first anniversary of the establishment of Communist
Government in China. Prime Minister Nehru conveyed to the Government of the
United States that what the Chinese Foreign Minister stated should not be
regarded as an empty threat or boast but should be taken seriously and he
advised the United States not to cross the thirty eighth parallel. No heed,
however, was paid to his sage counsel with the result that the Korean War
became transformed into a war between the United States on one side and China
on the other. The danger now is that it might develop into a global war unless
the United States takes a commonsense view of the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the early stages of the Chinese intervention there was some uncertainty as to
what the real objectives of Communist China were in sending her forces into
Korea. Was it merely to defend her frontiers and to prevent the hydro-electric
works in Korea which supplied energy to her industries in Manchuria from being
destroyed or from falling into the hands of the Americans that she intervened?
No clear-cut answer was forthcoming to these questions. But as time went on and
as the military situation developed more and more favourably for her the
answers also became clearer although some of these answers were found in the
speech of Chow-En-Lai referred to above. Every one now understands that China
has a number of objectives before her and that she is determined to fight until
she realises all of them. To liberate Korea from the aggression of the United
States and to unify it under a Communist Government are not the only aims that
she has before her. More important than these are the securing of recognition
as a great power from the United States, consequently of a seat in the Security
Council and in the United Nations Organisation, the establishment of her rule
over Formosa which she claims to be a legitimate and lawful part of her
territory, the liberation of Indo-China and Malaya from the yoke of the
European colonial powers and the introduction of Communism into these and other
countries of South-East Asia–Burma, Malaya, Thailand, Indo-China, Indonesia and
Philippines. The first three are her immediate and short-period aims and the
past two the long-period ones. She will carry on the struggle with the United
States until all these aims are secured. They are all of them intimately
inter-related.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The campaign in Korea has been an unprecedented
triumph for her–a triumph even far greater than what Japan won against Czarist
Russia half a century ago. Obtaining Formosa and a seat on the Security Council
depend very much on the attitude of the United States, An invasion of Formosa
is not so easy as the intervention in Korea. The primary difficulty here is the
absence of a navy. While Communist China has inexhaustible military forces at
her disposal–and this has been at the basis of her victory so far–she has no
navy with which she can fight the American navy guarding the waters round
Formosa. In this respect her position is similar to that of Napoleon in his
wars with the British. The only alternative therefore left for her is to create
trouble for the United States and her allies in other parts of Asia in which
they are vitally interested–prominently in Malaya and Indo-China. That this
will be her next move if in the meanwhile diplomacy doesn’t succeed in bringing
about a truce or an armistice has already become clear. Forces are ready for
undertaking an invasion of Indo-China and for strengthening the Communist
Government of Viet-Nam under Ho-Chi-Minh and it will be an impossible task for
the French even with more substantial help from the United States to resist
these forces. In addition to this the Government of China has protested to the
British against the alleged persecution of the Chinese settlers in Malaya and
this is regarded as a preparatory step for sending help to the Communist
Guerillas fighting there against Britain. If naval weakness prevents China from
invading Formosa it will only encourage her to make the fullest use of her
superiority in land armies.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is this numerical strength of the Chinese ground forces and the military
equipment that they have been able to get from Russia that have been causing
worry to the United States. These have been responsible for her defeats in
Korea and they may result in her being driven out from that peninsula. She was
never prepared to face such a situation. When MacArthur began his offensive in
November he was under the impression that all Korea could be occupied in about
a month and that most of his men could return to their homes for Christmas. So
confident were he and his Government of a speedy victory that they refused even
to consider the proposal made by the British to create a neutral zone in Korea
bordering the Chinese territory and give assurance to the Chinese that the U.N.
forces operating in Korea had no aggressive designs in China. Things however
took a worse turn. Everyone in America grew hysterical and the President
himself came forward with his formula that he would not hesitate to use the
Atom bomb. It was this more than anything else that opened the eyes of the
world to the seriousness of the situation and the need for all reasonable
peoples to bring pressure on the United States to dissuade her against the use
of the bomb. Prime Minister Attlee went all the way to Washington to make
President Truman and his advisers adopt a more reasonable and balanced attitude
towards China. This had some sobering effect although it required more blows
from the Chinese and the North Korean forces to make the United States come
down to the earth and view things in their proper perspective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stiff attitude of the United States in the days when her forces were being
marched towards the Manchurian frontier and before they had to beat a hasty
retreat to escape from complete annihilation was also illustrated by the
treatment accorded to the Chinese Mission headed by General Wu which came to
Lake Success to represent China’s case against the United States. The Mission
was not given adequate opportunity to express its views and it had to return
completely disappointed. This was to a great extent responsible for the
unwillingness of the Chinese Government to enter into any kind of negotiations
on the subject of cease-fire in Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>`During
all these months there has been a contrast between the stiffness of the United
States and the more conciliatory policy for which Britain stood. Public opinion
not only in Britain but also in the other countries of Western Europe was
averse to the United States becoming heavily involved in a war with China in
the Far East. There was a general reason for it. It was the fear that it would
weaken the defences of Western Europe. Russia had nearly four million men ready
to march into Western Europe. The Atlantic Pact was formed to resist such a
march. But so far not even a million men could be recruited for the purpose.
There were internal dissensions regarding the control to be exercised over the
armies to be raised. There was a feeling that after all nothing could save the
West from the Soviet armies and that it would be futile to try to resist them.
The will to fight has become considerably weakened in France and other
countries. This was one of the reasons for the insistent demand that more and
more United States forces should be stationed in these areas. Strategically
also the idea gained ground that if Communism is to be resisted it should be
done in Europe and not in Asia as the real protagonist of this faith is Russia
and not China. One of the objects of Premier Attlee’s visit to Truman was to
impress on him this view of the strategic situation. It therefore became
necessary for the United States to reconsider the Korean affair in the light of
this global strategy. So great has been the importance attached to
concentration of all available defence forces in Western Europe that several
responsible statesmen in the democratic States even went to the extent of
telling the Americans that it would be best for them to withdraw from Korea
without waiting as it were for being pushed out by the Chinese. It was the
movement of West European opinion in a direction like this that was to some
extent responsible for the growing willingness on the part of the United States
to reconsider her policy towards China and to think of some kind of compromise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Chinese war has also been responsible for some other developments during the
quarter. One such development was in regard to the problem of the rearmament of
Germany and the rearmament of Japan. With the establishment of Communism in
China nearly nine hundred millions of people have been included in the
Communist part of the world. This meant all inexhaustible source of man power
for Communism in its war with the democratic States. In contrast to this the
peoples included in the Atlantic Pact countries and the Pan-American Union come
to about only 500 millions. It therefore became plain that if Western Europe is
to be defended against a Soviet onslaught the people of Germany should be made
use of and that for arresting Chinese Communism in the Far East the people of
Japan should be made use of. Discussions have been going as to how this has to
be brought about and within what limits. The rearming of Western Germany and
Japan will no doubt add to the military forces of the democratic States. But
there is also a fear that it might prove dangerous in the long run. The world
had already suffered a great deal at the hands of German and Japanese
militarism and imperialism. There are therefore many sections of people in the
democratic camp who are opposed to the revival of these militarisms. In
addition to this another difficulty has naturally cropped. The Germans feel
that opportunity has now come to them to dictate their own terms before willing
to join the democratic armies and fight against the Communist forces. They are
demanding complete equality with the other West European nations. They are
prepared to become recruits only on condition that they are organised as a
national army just like the other armies in Europe. Negotiations are now going
on in regard to these various issues and it may perhaps become necessary or the
nations of the Atlantic Pact to accept some of the terms at least as put
forward by the Germans inspite of the risks involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
effect of the move of the democratic States to rearm Germany is seen in the
correspondence that is going on between Soviet Russia on one side and the
United States, Britain and France on the other on the desirability of the
revival of the Foreign Ministers’ Conference which actively functioned in the
settlement of treaties with Italy and some of the other enemy States in South
Eastern Europe but which fell into abeyance in consequence of the growth of
acute and irreconcilable differences between the two blocs into which the great
powers came to be divided from 1946. The proposal for the rearmament of Germany
has created alarm in the minds of the Soviet leaders. From their standpoint
this amounts to a revival of Hitlerism especially in view of the fact that in
working out the proposal some of the ex-German generals are being consulted.
Soviet Russia is therefore anxious that the problem of Germany should be
considered in the conference of foreign ministers on the basis of the war-time agreement
concluded at Potsdam. The democratic States are not very hopeful the outcome of
such a conference and they have put forward the view that if at all a
conference is convened it must be convened not merely to discuss the German
problem but all the other issues which have become the source of dispute
between themselves and Soviet Russia. It is to be hoped that Russia would agree
to such a demand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similar
are the problems that have emerged as a result of tile proposal to rearm Japan.
It is not merely from the Soviet camp that opposition to this proposal has
emanated. Even Australia and New Zealand are opposed to it. As there is no
likelihood of agreement among all the countries interested in the issue the
United States is determined on entering into a separate peace treaty with
Japan. In view of the dependence of Australia and New Zealand on the United
States in all matters of defence it looks likely that they may not persist in
their opposition to the rearmament proposals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was to consider all these international problems that the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers held a conference in London from the 4th January for a period of ten
days. There was free and frank discussion among them. One of the aims of the
conference–although it was not explicitly stated–was to bring the combined
weight of the opinion of all the members of the Commonwealth on the United
States and induce her to revise her policy towards China. The question of the
recognition of China naturally occupied a prominent place in the discussions.
Britain and India which along with Pakistan and Ceylon had already recognised
Communist China tried their best to prevail on Canada, South Africa, Australia
and New Zealand to do the same. But they have not succeeded in their attempts.
Prime Minister Nehru was emphatic in asserting that China had no aggressive
designs, that she was not a satellite of Soviet Russia and that independently
of questions like these it would be most unrealistic to refuse to recognise the
fact of China now being under a Communist Government. These assertions have not
however been able to convert Australia and other members of the Commonwealth.
This does not however mean that the conference was fruitless. It is not usual
for the conference to arrive at any decisions. Its main purpose is to create a
better understanding among the members and the present session has succeeded in
this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had also produced an indirect result. The trend of discussions at the
conference and the views expressed by Nehru and Bevin have been able to influence
the attitude of the United States towards China. For sometime before the
conference and during the days when it was holding its session there was a move
on the part of United States to have China declared by the U. N. as an
aggressor. Nothing would have been gained by such a declaration. On the other
hand much would have been lost. It would certainly have embittered still
further the relations between China and the United States. Fortunately the
United States had given up the move and has agreed to have all the issues
between her and China–including the issues of seating China in the Security
Council and the future of Formosa–being discussed in a conference representing
Soviet Russia, Communist China, Britain and herself provided that China agrees
to a cease-fire in Korea. This willingness on the part of the United States to
sit along with a representative of Communist China and discuss issues with him
is an indication of the influence that the deliberations of the Commonwealth
conference have been able to exercise on her. It does not follow from this that
China would agree to a cease fire in Korea but it is a reasonable inference
from all this that the United States is now disposed to take a more realistic
view of the situation in the Far East which has emerged from the establishment
of the Communist regime there. This is a step in the direction of world peace
and away from the global war with which mankind is being threatened. Many more
steps however will have to be taken before the threat disappears completely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='tab-stops:.5in'>The world is now passing
through a most critical stage. The crisis has been developing for the last six
years. But it has reached an acute stage as a consequence of the rise of China
as a united country under a strong Communist Government. This need not have
intensified the crisis if the United States had reconciled herself to the
emergence of this new power in Asia and on the borders of the Pacific. But she
has not done so as yet. She is suspicious of Communist China and her suspicions
are being strengthened as a result of the close ties that have come to be
established between new China and Soviet Russia. There are certain forces and
factors especially those represented by the statesmanship of Nehru and the
mature political experience of Britain which are striving hard to bring about
this required change in the attitude of the United States. And the future of
the world depends on the success of these attempts. (15-1-51)</p>

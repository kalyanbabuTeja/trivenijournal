<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
drama Julius Caesar occupies a special position in the canon of Shakespeare. It
has often been described as a gateway to the great tragedies that followed it.
Its affinities with the four great tragedies, especially with Hamlet and
Macbeth, are pointed out many a time. Professor Bradley has found the play
falling short of his famous recipe for tragedy and refused to consider it as
typical Shakespearean tragedy.<sup>1</sup> Some recent Shakespearean critics
have considered it to be a group tragedy.<sup> 2</sup> The divergence of
opinion concerning the nature of the play is a proof positive that it is a
class by itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Shakespeare
does not seem to hold a theory of his own concerning the nature of tragedy. He
might have certain opinions but he made no attempt to give a connected account
of the tragic idea. The nature of the play, it seems, depends on the story he
selects for the nonce. We know that Shakespeare borrowed his plots from many
sources and it is the borrowed elements in the process of getting transformed
at his artistic touch that give a particular pattern to the play, making it
different from the other plays though the art that went into the making is
broadly the same. The pattern may be readily seen or missed altogether but it is
this pattern imposed by the “content” that determines the “form” of the play.
As the content is often borrowed the author himself may not be conscious of its
full potentiality sometimes. Nevertheless the content will have its impact and
the wary reader may notice a pattern that escapes notice at first. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
mythical basis of Julius Caesar is not as readily seen as the historical and Plutarchan
consent. In the course of the drama we observe that Caesar does little to save
himself. The forces that work for Caesar are feeble and insignificant. The
soothsayer and Artemidorus do not constitute a force to reckon with. Caesar is entirely
passive and altogether will-less. Not that he has no will of his own. Far from
it. He is a self-willed man and appears to us as a man of indomitable will. “Wilt
thou lift up Olympus?”, he challenges one of the conspirators in the Senate.
His proud speeches in his house and at the Senate clearly <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>show </span>how strong-willed he is. Yet his
will works in unison with the superior <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will
</span>called Fate. He resigns himself to fate or, better still, he resolves to
accept his fate. It is important to note this trait in his character. We do not
come across this type of presentation of tragic hero in other tragedies.
Individual will elsewhere in the tragedies comes into clash with the general
will and it is the individual will that ultimately surrenders in the conflict.
This conflict is totally absent in the character of Caesar. Caesar falls
without striking a blow, both literally and metaphorically. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cannot accept the argument of Bernard Shaw that Caesar fought to defend himself
until Brutus stabbed him and then fell because of the great betrayal on the
part of Brutus.<sup> 3</sup> Shaw’s account is based on the funeral oration of
Mark Antony. The lines are as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
should bear in mind in this connection that there is no stage direction
suggesting that Caesar tried to defend himself and that Antony’s speech was not
based upon facts. He was absent in the Senate when the murder of Caesar took
place. His invention was only to rouse the sympathies of the people for the
murdered Caesar. What is really funny is that Antony had so successfully deceived
the people and got away with it and not Caesar as Shaw would have us believe.
There is nothing comic about Shakespeare’s Caesar. Caesar, on the other hand,
was pure and his death was a sacrifice. He was not a tiger but a sacrificial
beast, say a lamb (Christ if you like). The following speeches of Brutus should
dispel any doubt in this regard: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

knew that he was sacrificing his life at the altar of Rome. He is just as

that his will works in accordance with the general will whether he believes it
or not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

does Shakespeare present him so? Tragic heroes are no doubt passive in other
plays too. But is it not the passivity that matters here. What is specially
noteworthy is his acceptance of the fate. Hamlet who acknowledges “There is a
special providence in the fall of a sparrow” at least tries to muster forces to
reconquer his lost kingdom from his ‘Pelican daughters’. Macbeth and Othello
fight to defend themselves but not so Caesar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

character of Caesar as drawn by Shakespeare and the other details pertaining to
him suggest that Caesar of Shakespeare is a mythical figure rather than a
historical person. What we mean to say is that the myth of Caesar is lost in
the dramatic account of Caesar’s death. The object of this paper is to explain
in detail the mythological basis of the character of Caesar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Julius
Caesar had become a legend even in his own time. As time wore on, he passed
into myth and was duly identified with Egyptian Sun God, Osiris. Later on he
found a place even in Christian mythology and was identified with Jesus Christ,
who in his turn, was also identified as Pagan Sun God.<sup> 4</sup> In the
Julius Caesar of Shakespeare, Caesar strikes us as a Christ figure. The events
that precede his death and his character lend substance to our surmise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are certain obvious similarities between Caesar and Christ in their lives and
circumstances. Both are decendants of a Royal family which once held sway but
ceased to rule for a very long time. The etymological meaning of Caesar is king
while that of Christ (Kristos) also is king. Neither of them however really
claimed kingship although both of them were accused of being ambitious. Christ
was tried and sentenced to death by Pilate for being an impostor though Christ
repeatedly denied that he was one. Now Caesar too does not wish to be a king.
In the drama itself we do not have positive evidence to show that Caesar ever wanted
to become king. Even <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>on </span>the
Ides <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or </span>March, Caesar was reluctant
to accept the crown. The following is the report on the final decision arrived
at by the Senate and Caesar: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
passage suggests that Caesar was persuaded to accept kingship in spite of
himself and the decision was a compromise between the wish of Caesar and the
will of the Senate. In the case of Christ, the kingship is entirely spiritual
and never temporal. But these distinctions seem to be of no avail in a world
ruled by rhetoric and prejudice. The word ‘king’ is enough to rouse the ire of
the people, no matter what it stands for. Is it not interesting to note that in
the same play Shakespeare shows <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>how<i>
</i></span>the rabble refused to draw a distinction between Cinna, the poet,
and Cinna the conspirator and murdered innocent Cinna weeping and wailing? It
is the way of the world. It is no use saying that those who murdered Caesar and
Christ were enlightened and exalted citizens, whereas Cinna’s murderers were
mere unruly mob. The truth about the matter, however, was summed up once for
all by Christ himself when he said “Father forgive them; for they know not what
they do.” Christ never seems to have claimed that he was the “Son of man”.
Nevertheless his admirers and followers claimed that he was divine, to the woe
of Christ. Judas would not have betrayed his master if he believed that his
master was a mere “Son or man” and had no power to save himself under all
circumstances. Caesar’s followers made a God of him in spite of Caesar and
Caesar’s enemies made excellent use of it. Here is Cassius exploiting the
alleged divinity of Caesar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

also seem to have believed that men that are not born in the natural way are
divine. A woman delivers her child in the ninth month after the conception. It
is the natural way. If the child comes into the world in any other way, it is
divine. Such children are not treated as “Sons of man.” In Macbeth, Shakespeare
says that Macbeth will not be killed by one “that is the son of a woman.” It
turns out that Macbeth was not born in the natural way, he being what we call
today a ‘forceps child.’ Now Christ according to a Christian tradition was not
delivered forth by Mary in due course but came out through her ear much in the
same way as Karna the celebrated hero of Mahaabhaarata. As for Julius Caesar,
history tells us that he was the first known child in the world to have come into
the world by what we call today ‘Caesarian operation’. No wonder if Caesar was
considered divine in those remote days of less scientific advancement. Caesar
certainly did not claim immortality; yet it is possible he believed in this
type of divinity. This alone explains the haughty language he uses, which
critics quote to show his pride. The proud speeches of Caesar such as “wilt
thou lift up Olympus” but prove Caesar was as much a child of his times as
anyone today or ever is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

us now consider the similarity between the two in relation to the circumstances
of their death. Caesar’s controversy with Pompey may be compared with Christ’s
criticism of the rabbinical elders of Jerusalem. Caesar’s triumphal march into
Rome is like Christ’s arrival in the Holy City on the back of an ass on Palmsunday.
The attempts of Flavius and Marullus remind us of the neglect by Jews of Christ’s
arrival in the city. The deliberations of Cassius, Brutus and the other
conspirators bring to our mind the activities in the synagogue at Jerusalem
which culminated in the arrest of Christ to be produced before Pilate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is important to note that Caesar sends for the priests to know the ‘success’ of
the prodigies seen on the night of 14th March, that he yields to the request of
his wife and agrees to send a message to the effect that he was ill through
Antony to the Senate: later he changes his mind at the instance of Decius Brutus.
He goes to the Senate and gets killed there with “Et tu Brute?–Then fall,
Caesar” on his lips. The sequence of events remind us of Christ’s passion and
crucifixion. Christ takes his Last Supper with his twelve disciples before he
was taken into custody, in the same way as Caesar takes wine with the twelve
conspirators before he sets out to the Capitol. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

attempt to have Caesar is like the errand of St. Mark. Caesar’s vacillating
mind is reminiscent of Christ’s disturbed mind in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Christ prays three times to be saved and at last surrenders to the will of the
Lord. The human will of Christ is in conflict with the divine will for the time
being and in the end the conflict disappears. The “Son of man” remembers he had
a mission to fulfil as Messiah and whole-heartedly surrenders to the will of
the God. Nevertheless there seems to be a sense of betrayal <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Eli lama Sabachthani”, that is to say, “My God, My God, why has’t thou forsaken
me” bear resemblance to Caesar’s “Et tu Brute?–Then fall, Caesar!” Christ dies
on the cross redeeming the world of its sins and Caesar dies at the foot of
Pompey’s statue in a symbolic redemption of the past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

conclude: The play of Caesar though based on historical facts reveals a pattern
of Christian myth on inspection. The pattern may be accidental but it explains
the character of Caesar and his tragedy. Bradleyan analysis does not find the
play satisfactory precisely because of this internal organisation which makes
Caesar the tragic figure in terms of Christ’s crucifixion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

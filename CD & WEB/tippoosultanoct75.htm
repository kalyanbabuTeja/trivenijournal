attitude towards the main character, for the activities of thugs were in no way
affecting the British interests in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The Thugs were actually only
an administrative problem so far as the British were concerned out they were
not a potential danger to their power. Besides, the various gruesome studies
about the activities of the Thugs <span class=GramE>was</span> one way of
justifying the British cause India–magnifying the reformist attitude and the
missionary zeal that the <span class=SpellE>Whiteman</span> was supposed to
have had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

regard to Tippoo Sultan, however, the attitude, though <span class=SpellE>basical</span>
by the same, is slightly different. Care is taken to increase and exaggerate
the faults of Tippoo Sultan and his so-called cruel and atrocious deeds so that
there could be some justification for British action in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place>. It should not, however, be forgotten that at the close of
the Second <span class=SpellE>Mysore</span> War in 1784 the leading power in the
State was <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:City></st1:place>
under the able leadership of Tippoo </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was the only opposing factor in the South
and was the only obstacle to British Supremacy in that area, it can be
understood the portrayal of the character of Tippoo Sultan is biased and has
been presented only from the British point of view. Most books on Indian
history have given a very inadequate account of the life and character of
Tippoo Sultan. He has been compared with disadvantage to his father <span
class=SpellE>Haider</span> Ali. Some English historians have even made efforts
to blacken his<i> </i>character and paint him as a cruel and fanatic tyrant.
Few have realized that Tippoo Sultan, ‘The Tiger<i> </i>of <span class=SpellE>Mysore</span>’,
was the sole champion of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the novel <i>Tippoo Sultan, </i>Meadows Taylor has very cleverly manipulated
historical events and romance. A close study of the book reveals that the
emphasis was more on the story of the other characters than on the story of
Tippoo Sultan. There is no distortion of the historical events, on the other
hand they have been very faithfully presented but the title is quite
misleading, for the plot is built round two characters, <span class=SpellE>Meer</span>
<span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali and Herbert Compton and not on the
character of Tippoo Sultan. Very few events from the life of Tippoo Sultan
figure in the novel, only those that are relevant to the stories of these two
characters of <span class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span>
Ali and Herbert Compton are given prominence. What was of primary importance
was the struggle of the British against the might of Tippoo Sultan, and the
effect it had on the life of two characters–one an Indian and the other an
Englishman. It was absolutely important to magnify the defects of the Indian
rulers and justify the British rule. Thus the story of the two characters,
though dissimilar are also similar and coincide at certain points like two
circles which are also so close to each other than they overlap at two points.
Then again <span class=SpellE>Tippoo’s</span> character is not directly
presented but only through the attitudes of these two characters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
novel starts with the description of a party of people on horseback being
escorted across the plains of <span class=SpellE>Adoni</span> by a strikingly
stalwart man of middle age, elaborately dressed in very rich garments. This is
Abdul <span class=SpellE>Rhyman</span> Khan, one of <span class=SpellE>Tippoo’s</span>
<span class=SpellE>favourite</span> commanders at <span class=SpellE>Seringapatam</span>.
He was <span class=SpellE>travelling</span> with his third wife, a young girl
of striking beauty, called <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span>. Suddenly a
terrific storm arose and the party was completely <span class=SpellE>shelterless</span>
and their only refuge was a small village across a stream which the rain had
transformed into muddy torrent. The rest of the party crossed the stream with
the aid of their horses, but <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span> insisted on being
carried across in her palanquin; while the bearers were carrying the palanquin
through the raging waters, one of them slipped and the palanquin fell into the
water. <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span> had not a chance of saving herself and
was carried off swiftly down the stream. The rest of the people were
dumb-founded and thunder-struck by this unforeseen calamity and the Khan was
absolutely grief-stricken and gave <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span> up for
lost. In the meanwhile a little distance down the stream a young man, <span
class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali, who belonged to
the village, was watching the rising waters of the stream. Seeing <span
class=SpellE>Ameena</span> floating past, he jumped into the stream at the risk
of his own life and rescued her. <span class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali carried <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span> home and
then came to know that she was the Khan’s wife. He speedily went to inform the
Khan that his wife had been saved. The Khan was filled with admiration for this
brave young man <span class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span>
Ali and was thankful for <span class=SpellE>Ameena’s</span> safety. He gladly
became <span class=SpellE>Kasim’s</span> guest for the night and he made up his
mind to reward the young man for his brave act. <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span>
Ali, on the other hand, had been so impressed by the beauty of <span
class=SpellE>Ameena</span> that he spent a restless night. His mother, <span
class=SpellE>realising</span> his feelings, quietly suggested that since <span
class=SpellE>Ameena</span> was already married he should banish all thoughts of
her from his mind. <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali quietly said, “Her fate
is with mine, mother, from the moment I was impelled to rescue her from the
waters, I felt that my life was connected with hers”.<sup>1</sup> Next morning
at the time of departure, the Khan felt that the most fitting reward for <span
class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span class=SpellE>Kasim’s</span> services was a
position in <span class=SpellE>Tippoo’s</span> army. He offered to take him to
the court of Tippoo and give him a good position in the army. <span
class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> readily agreed, for he
looked upon this offer as the only way in which he could at least be near <span
class=SpellE>Ameena</span>. Thus <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali gladly
joined the Khan’s group when they resumed their journey. While passing through
the town of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bellary</span></st1:place></st1:City>,
<span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> had again an opportunity of showing his courage
and <span class=SpellE>valour</span> when they were involved in a skirmish with
a group of <span class=SpellE>Mahrattas</span>. <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span>
slowly comes to admire and respect <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

scene now shifts to the West, in the words of the author, “To the perfect
understanding of the events connected with this veritable history, therefore,
we feel ourselves obliged to retrograde, a few years, and to leave the glowing
climate of the East for a while, to breathe in idea the colder yet more
congenial air of England”.<sup>2</sup> The narrative then moves on to the
family of the Rector Mr. Compton. His eldest son Herbert Compton had joined the
army and was proceeding with his regiment to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to afford protection to the
position of the East India Company. It was a day of sad news and gloom for the
family for a posting to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the 18th century was like a journey to the unknown. Here again the author
stresses on the loyalty and the nobility of the British and the personal
sacrifices they made in acquiring a dominion which though an asset was difficult
to maintain. This news w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

back to the story of Abdul <span class=SpellE>Rhyman</span> Khan and <span
class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali. The party had now
arrived at <st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bangalore</span></st1:City>
and they had been asked to escort a party of English prisoners, and military
stores to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:place></st1:City>.
Among the prisoners was Herbert Compton who with other English soldiers had
been captured at the battle of <span class=SpellE>Bednore</span>. This was <span
class=SpellE>Kasim’s</span> first encounter with an Englishman and he was full
of admiration for the heroic and handsome <span class=SpellE>demeanour</span>
of Herbert Compton. He went out of his way to make his acquaintance and make
his journey as comfortable as possible. At the court of Tippoo, when some of
the soldiers assaulted Herbert and would have killed him, <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span>
Ali intervened and prevented his death. Tippoo was irritated with <span
class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali and for some time he was in disgrace for having
befriended a foreigner. Herbert Compton was imprisoned at the fort of <span
class=SpellE>Nundidroog</span> and subsequently very cruelly treated and
tortured. On one occasion when he was about to be thrown from<i> </i>a steep
precipice, he fainted from sheer exhaustion and fatigue but was saved by the
kindness of a <span class=SpellE>Fakeer</span>. He was then consigned to the
prison at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bangalore</span></st1:place></st1:City>.
In the meanwhile the family of Herbert Compton and Amy Hayward had given him up
for lost. Philip Dalton, who had been Herbert’s good friend in the same
regiment, had returned to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for a short while. He had brought with him a packet containing the treasured
belongings of his friend for Amy Hayward who was grief-stricken with this sad
news. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the court of Tippoo there were violent misgivings about an impending battle
with the English. It was absolutely essential to have the help of the <span

But at the last moment the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span> goes back on his

Ali badly injured. The British captured him and it was here that he met Philip
Dalton who was anxious for news about. Herbert Compton. <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span>
Ali was touched by the humane treatment of the English which was quite a
contrast to the cruel treatment of Tippoo. He gradually developed a hatred for
the tyrannical acts of Tippoo Sultan and consequently great admiration for the
English. The treaty by which most of the dominions of Tippoo Sultan were taken
away and given to the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span> effected the possessions
of <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali. All his lands were annexed now to the <span
class=SpellE>Nizam</span> and this facilitated his resignation from <span

English. In the final attack of the English on <span class=SpellE>Seringapatam</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali helped the English and showed them a route
into the fort that was known only to him. Tippoo Sultan was killed and the
English brought the Hindu dynasty to the throne of <span class=SpellE>Mysore</span>.
The conflict with Tippoo comes to an end, and Meadows Taylor rounds off the
story of Herbert Compton and <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali. He is too
competent a story-teller to leave the narrative unfinished. Herbert Compton who
was found in a prison in <span class=SpellE>Coorg</span> is saved and
subsequently reunited with his family and Amy Hayward. <span class=SpellE>Kasim</span>
Ali managed to find <span class=SpellE>Ameena</span> and settles down happily
with her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sultan </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is more a romance than a historical novel. The
actual facts have been very carefully maintained in the book and the story is
very <span class=SpellE>skilfully</span> manipulated into the framework of
history. Meadows Taylor is certainly a very interesting story-teller and he
uses all the traditional tricks of intrigue, suspense and mystery. The novel
starts after the Second <span class=SpellE>Mysore</span> War when Tippoo
Sultan’s supremacy in the South had been established. The novel deal’s with ten
years from 1789 to 1800. In the account that Meadows Taylor gives of the
British attack of <span class=SpellE>Bednore</span> and the <span class=SpellE>seige</span>
and capture of <span class=SpellE>Anantapur</span>, he makes it quite clear
that his main intention was not to state facts of history but to make it a
proper <span class=SpellE>backround</span> for the story of Herbert Compton.
“It is far from our intention” he says, “to follow seriatim the operations of
this campaign, which are already the matters of history, except as they are
necessary to the explanation of the positions into which the fate Herbert
Compton led him”.<sup> 3</sup> Tippoo Sultan’s attack on <span class=SpellE>Travancore</span>
is also described at length, and here again the stress is not on the historical
significance but the way these events are described. ”It is foreign to our tale
to describe every event of the war, which has already been so much more
efficiently done in the histories of the periods, besides we have a pleasant <span
class=SpellE>lience</span> in such matters without which it would be impossible
for us to conduct our readers to any satisfactory conclusions of our history”.<sup>4</sup>
All the important events of the year are very faithfully described but not with
much stress on the historical significance. There is a very happy blending of
fact and fiction. The death of Tippoo Sultan, though of vital importance in
Indian history, brings the novel to a happy conclusion so far as the main
characters are concerned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is more amazing is the skill with which Meadows Taylor keeps up the continuity
of the story, in spite of the confusing details and numerous characters. His
style of narration follows the zigzag method where alternatively he narrates
the story of each character up to a certain point and then finally brings all
the characters together. The method is very much like a pendulum oscillating between
two important points, and in between he narrates also the intrigues of the
wives of Abdul <span class=SpellE>Rhyman</span> Khan, the story of Philip
Dalton, but he maintains the unity by connecting everything finally to the two
important characters, Herbert Compton and <span class=SpellE>Meer</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kasim</span>. Tippoo Sultan is the final binding factor in all
this confusion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is interesting to note the attitude that Meadows Taylor had towards Tippoo
Sultan. Most of the time only his faults have been highlighted and he has been
portrayed as a fanatic, superstitious and cruel. Only rarely does Meadows
Taylor refer to his good points. He indirectly points out the staunch views of
Tippoo Sultan. “He is faithful to those he loves, but a bitter foe to those who
provoke him”.<sup>5</sup> The author is not completely <span class=SpellE>biassed</span>
in his assessment of <span class=SpellE>Tippoo’s</span> character, for he
explains and gives reasons for his hatred of the English. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sees their restless love of intrigue and power, he knows how they have sown
dissensions in Bengal and wrested many fair provinces from the sway of the true
believers”.<sup> 6</sup> There is the incident of the slaughtering of the bull
and the smearing of the blood on the face of a Brahmin, which is most
revolting. One does not know the truth behind such stories. By hearsay Tippoo
Sultan, though a staunch Muslim, had respect and regard for the Hindu religion
as can be seen from the various temples he allowed in the kingdom–the chief, of
course, being </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the temple of <span class=SpellE>Sriranga</span>
from which the town of <span class=SpellE>Seringapatam</span> takes its name. <span
class=SpellE>Tippoo’s</span> ill-treatment of English prisoners might be true
enough, but when he was out to defend his own country he had every
justification to act in this manner. Tippoo was by nature very superstitious
and on this quality most writers </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>have stressed upon. A
completely different picture is presented in a Bengali drama on Tippoo Sultan,
written by <span class=SpellE>Mahendra</span> Gu</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pta. Here he is
portrayed as a very heroic character with no signs of meanness in his attitude.
The supreme moment </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of frustration and tragedy in his life
comes when he <span class=SpellE>realises</span> that he is alone in his

and the <span class=SpellE>Peshwas</span> have deceived him. There is a great
deal of exaggeration in the delineation of <span class=SpellE>Tippoo’s</span>
character by Meadows Taylor. Consequently in the character of <span
class=SpellE>Kasim</span> Ali, Meadows Taylor makes every effort to justify his
actions. Right from the start he has been pictured as a very heroic, handsome
and noble figure. Lest this figure be tarnished by his act of treachery to
Tippoo Sultan, the author makes haste to reassure us that at the time of the
betrayal he was no longer in the employment of Tippoo Sultan. Besides, Tippoo
Sultan’s own actions had destroyed the feeling of loyalty that <span
class=SpellE>Kasim</span> had towards his king. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Taylor has a very pleasing style. As seen in <i>The Confessions of a Thug </i>he
excels in descriptions. Though in many ways the subject he has concentrated
upon paints a very hostile picture of India, he makes up for this by
concentrating on the scenic grandeur of the country. To the 18th century
Englishman, India was a land of adventures, battles, curious and interesting
people with different faiths, superstitions and ceremonies–a land which was the
grave of many Englishmen. Nevertheless, it was a charming country which excited
the imagination. Descriptions are an absolute necessity to the novel as the
topography of the country is essential for completing the picture of India that
Meadows Taylor was trying to paint. He was definitely a lover of beauty and
whatever the defects of India in the English eyes, it was certainly a rich jewel
of great value. About the mountains of the South, the author writes “Mountains
of very strange and varied form, whose naked tops displayed bright hues of <span
class=SpellE>colour</span>, rose in their precipices out of eternal forests,
and formed combinations of beautiful forms not to be </span><span

interest in the novel. The story of Tippoo Sultan is relegated to the
background and occupies only a minor place. The prejudice that the English
would have had towards this character is easily perceptible. The novel is,
however, a good document of the English attitude towards India in the 18th
century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

feeble voice came through the half-shut door of the front bedroom. The child
listened for a while, looked vaguely towards the room and then turned to the
clay which she was moulding with her tiny fingers. She had been absorbed in
that work from the early hours of the morning. It was a day dedicated to the <i>puja
</i>of Goddess Gowri. Bina, however, was not interested in Gowri. All her
interest was focussed on Gowri’s mighty son, God Ganesha, and tomorrow was the
merry festival of Ganesha! Only the previous day, Bina had gone round with her
mother visiting a few friends and had seen at Vinoo’s house a particularly
lovely image of God Ganesha taking glorious shape through the deft fingers of
Vinoo’s elder brother, Mohan, whose skill in making such things was famous
throughout the town. Bina, like all children of her age, loved to make things.
She had seen a crowd of giggling children surrounding Mohan and watching him
with breathless interest as the various parts of God Ganesha’s grotesque
anatomy took form and became vividly familiar to them. They sat for long times
observing the skilful artist at work. Mohan had become another God in their
eyes, a supreme creator. They sat chattering away, singing snatches of their
school-book song about Ganesha, improvising ludicrous incidents about the God,
and teasing Mohan. They told each other stories of Ganesha’s fantastic
adventures, referred again and again to his voracious appetite, his insatiable
greed for all his favourite delicacies, mimicked his uncouth gait and made fun
of his small eyes, large ears and long trunk. Ganesha, the being who was
half-God, half-Elephant, had suddenly become a friend, a companion, a playmate
to these children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Bina returned from her visits, her one thought was about Ganesha. Tomorrow was
the happy day, she said to herself, and she longed to make an image of this
beloved God with her own hands. She begged her mother and got her permission to
scoop up a few handfuls of wet clay in the garden. Bina had never known such
excitement. Her imagination was on fire. Sitting with the lump of wet clay in
her hands, a whole world of strange beings and wonderful adventures was born in
her imagination–a huge universe peopled with gods, goddesses, giants and ogres
whose breath-taking adventures she enacted again and again in her mind. And
then her mind, after voyaging through this bewildering world, rested on the
tranquil figure of Ganesha. Here was some one who appealed to her, as he
appealed to all children–some one </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>who was so serene and
benevolent, and yet so laughably quizzical, strange and grotesque! Bina’s
fingers worked assiduously’ with the clay. She would make a beautiful image of
the God. Had not her father, her own beloved Papa, promised to instal the
figures and offer <i>puja </i>to the God? ‘ Yes, she would make a lovely image,
far more wonderful than Mohan’s. Suddenly Mohan’s idol which she had so admired
yesterday, lost all its glamour and beauty. It became, curiously enough, a
rival figure to her own, and with that swift change of mind, so natural to
children, she decided that her image was going to beat Mohan’s…..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worked in the shade of a cluster of plantain trees in a nook of her father’s garden,
blissfully oblivious to her environment and utterly absorbed in giving a shape
to her idea of the God. She went on, moulding the clay in numberless
permutations and combinations, doing, undoing and re-doing, her delicate
fingers clogged with the clay, her clothes soiled, her hair untidy. Tenderly
she shaped the beloved God’s familiar limbs, his protruding belly, his large
sweeping ears, the small twinkling eyes, the curling trunk, the crossed legs
and the tiny mouse on which Ganesha is supposed to ride! To her child’s ayes,
this ludicrous, disproportionate and grotesquely ugly figure was the last word
in divine perfection! She breathed a sigh of triumph, and took a careful survey
of her handiwork. Yes, a few finishing touches and then the lovely colours with
which Father had promised to paint the God, and her Ganesha would be the lord
of the other images in the town! Then pleasant thoughts were crowding upon her
mind. And then her father’s feeble voice carne to her once again–a soft,
musical voice, packed with suffering and pain, and yet, as her child’s heart
knew, eager, urgent, and longing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lay on his bed–a pale emaciated figure. His still handsome face was quiet,
shrewdly kind and humorous. There were wrinkles on his face, and in spite of
his illness, he had not lost his serenity. He had been ill for a long time, now
nearly six months. A simple ‘breakdown’ the doctor had said at the beginning.
Narayan was a teacher in the local High School, a hard-working conscientious
man loved by his boys and respected by his Colleagues. After a brilliant
academic career, he entered the teaching profession, full of hopes and high
aspirations. He had married the girl of his choice, an orphan brought up by her
old aunt. His Parents had died while he was at college and Narayan had to wage
a heroic, but extremely painful struggle against Poverty and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>discouragement.
After his graduation, he married. Then came the offer from the Principal of the
local High School, and his heart, full of idealism and a deep, unconquerable
longing to serve the children of his country, yielded to the offer. He had
served the school for nearly fifteen years, was a popular teacher and a
respected citizen. His married life had been happy and was blessed by the birth
of his only daughter, Bina, who was now seven years of age. He devoted his
entire life to the child. She was literally the apple of his eye. Life was, on
the whole happy for Narayan. But trouble came. His health </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>began
to fail, mostly as a result of overwork at the school. The worries and
harassments of a poor teacher’s life when prices were soaring higher </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
higher every day, were too much for him. One day, valuing a bundle of answer
papers of his Form, he had felt a funny sensation in his head, a sudden
darkening of things around him and a sharp pain in his chest, accompanied by
shortness of breath and utter exhaustion. The doctor said it was simple
exhaustion due to overwork, ordered complete rest and wrote out a couple of
tonics, cheerfully promising that Narayan would be up and doing in a week’s
time. Narayan, however, did not improve. That funny feeling in the head
persisted, the pain became constant and soon he was unable even to move out of
his bed without getting exhausted and breathless. “Nothing serious,” assured
the doctor who was a prosperous local practitioner, whose strongest point was
an invincible optimism accompanied by a breezy, cheerful manner towards all his
patients. “A few days of complete rest, another course of these injections, and
you will want to join the next Mount Everest Expedition,” were the doctor’s
encouraging words. Days passed, the injections were given, the medicines were
drunk, the bills were paid, but Narayan did not get up from his bed. He
remained there, vanquished and depressed, all his hopes shattered and his
visions destroyed. Gradually a feeling of intense loneliness began to overwhelm
him. He felt as though he was insulated from the main current of life that
incessantly flowed around him. His world began to shrink till at last its
boundaries were limited to his bedroom. Only two people mattered to him now–his
devoted wife, Lakshmi, and his child. It was Bina’s laughter that still
reminded him of the glory that was life. Bina was the precious link that bound
him to the magic world that lay beyond his room. He listened to her childish
chatter and her songs, and his mind attained some sort of tranquility.
Otherwise he knew no peace. He lost count of the days, but lingered on his bed,
struggling inwardly to make something coherent out of the vast incoherence
which life was to him on his sickbed. He who had dreamt dreams and seen visions
was now reduced to the position of clutching at the most trivial thing,
provided it was stable and secure. How long was he going to last? What about
the future of his wife and daughter? The thought filled him with despair. Bina,
so innocent and playful, accustomed to love joy–what would happen to her after
he was gone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Today he had felt particularly wretched and
miserable. He lay utterly prostrated on his bed. The slightest effort made him
pant for breath. The darkness inside him was something impenetrable. He made no
effort to think, for his mind was a vast ocean of incoherence. Things somehow
seemed to be slipping away from him more rapidly than ever before. The doctor
had no doubt seen him on his usual rounds that morning, put his stethescope for
the thousandth time on his chest, listened to the struggles of his poor heart,
given him an injection, pronounced the usual encouraging words to him, ordered
a hot-water bag to relieve his pain, and had gone away promising to look him up
that evening. Narayan did not want to alarm his poor wife. Today his heart went
to her in silent sympathy. Six months of patient devotion and ungrudging
ministry to him on his sickbed, the accumulating drudgery of the household, the
fear and sense of insecurity steadily gnawing at her heart, the growing
premonition of the darkness that would sooner or later engulf her and her
beloved child, the poverty and the hourly struggle she had to wage against–a
these had shattered Lakshmi. Her painful martyrdom tortured Narayan’s soul. He
did not want to disturb her. He knew she was busy preparing for her annual
Gowri <i>puja</i>. It was a day sacred to the Hindu wife–a day dedicated to the
great Goddess Parvati, wife of Shiva, mother of Ganesha, the Goddess of
chastity and wifely devotion, of purity and sacrificial renunciation, whose
worship, so many thousands of Hindu women believed, would ensure eternal
wifehood for them. Poor Lakshmi! The idea of her worshipping Gowri sent a pang
through his heart. What a mockery life was! How the gods played with men! In
the meantime his pain and discomfort were increasing. He wanted at least Bina
to be by his side, and even as his mind was fighting for reassurance, his
thoughts were on his child. He called her feebly. It was the cry of an
anguished heart in desperate search for something to soothe and strengthen it
on the eve of its final dissolution....</p>

the whole land in golden light. The town was agog with joy and excitement.
Innumerable processions of coloured images of God Ganesha accompanied by <i>nagaswaram

whole juvenile population of the town was abroad, gay, noisy and uproariously
happy. Bina woke up in great excitement. All night, as long as she could keep

health. She joined in the morning a large group of children who went scurrying
through the neighbouring groves and valleys for flowers and leaves of all kinds
required for the great <i>puja. </i>She brought a basketful of these flowers
and leaves, sweetly smelling and of variegated colours and patterns. She was
sure that her father would be well today. He would bathe and wear his
rose-coloured silk <i>dhoti, </i>smear his forehead with the sacred ash and sit
before the idol and do the <i>puja. </i>He would prepare a beautiful <i>mantapam

house, her heart throbbing with glad expectation. She opened the gate. But what
was that? She saw a group of women who, instead of smiling at her, as they
usually did, raised a pitiful wail as she entered! Bina wondered what it was
all about. She would find out, of course. Her father...No, he would be quite
well. God Ganesha would not fail her, for had she not moulded him tenderly with
her own hands into His divine shape? She ran into the house. Somehow everything
looked so strange and bewildering and queer. Why such wailing and weeping in a
house that was the abode of Lord Vighneswara? Then she saw her mother stretched
on the floor in the hall and women sat round her beating their breasts and
wailing. The doctor came out of Papa’s room, looking woe-begone and broken; his
usual cheerfulness was not there. He, who had never left the house without a
tender word to her, now seemed to avoid her. And he was in such a dreadful
hurry to leave the house too! Bina did not understand all these things...this
mystery, this terrible up-setting of all her beautiful plans. Then she </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>looked
in the direction of her father’s room. The door was half-open and she caught
sight of her Papa lying on the bed, his face ivory-white, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>his
eyes closed. Someone caught her by the hand. And into the child’s </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>heart
flashed the truth. Her world had crumbled....Papa would not perform the <i>puja
</i>today!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
suddenly she remembered her idol–the idol of the God over which she had taken
such pains and uttered so many prayers. She wrenched herself away from the
woman who was trying to caress her and speaking soft words into her ears....She
ran into the garden, saw her idol. Ganesha’s merry twinkle which had so
bewitched her a few hours earlier, appeared something terribly sardonic and
menacing. He became at that moment not a God of life, but of death. In a fit of
sudden fury she lifted the half-wet clay figure and dashed it to the ground
where it lay, sprawled most undivinely, a sorry mess of broken limbs and sticky
lumps!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

processions of God Ganesha continued throughout the morning with band and
music, shouts of men and the laughter of children. But Bina was not among the
children, and her sweet, pure laughter was not heard in that merry crowd that
morning. And when these processions had passed, towards the noon, another
procession left the house of Narayan, a silent and melancholy one, and wended
its way solemnly to the banks of the river, a mile from the town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

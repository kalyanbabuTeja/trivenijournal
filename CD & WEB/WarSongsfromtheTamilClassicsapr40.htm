<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B></FONT><I><P ALIGN="CENTER">(Rendered from </I>Tamil <I>by Vidwan K. P. V. Krishnamacharya and S. Rangaswami)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[The following translations from the <I>Pura-Nanuru, </I>an ancient Tamil classical anthology, compiled many hundred years ago, illustrate the martial qualities of the Tamil-speaking races in Southern India, and may be read with interest in these war-ridden days.]</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The o'erflowing floods, no sluice can stop;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The devastating fire, no safe refuge can avoid;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stormy wind, even the mightiest cannot bear:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even so is the red anger of the Pandya King’s warfare.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Tamil country is common land (to all the three kings) he will not accept.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before his advancing host, only chiefs who yield tribute are bereft of fear.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They that have refused and lost his mercy are indeed to be pitied-for they resemble the winged white-ants escaping out of their red-ant hills for a brief day’s respite.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Pura-Nanuru, </I>Stanza 51)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resting thine arm on a fine pillar in my little house,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thou art asking me, &quot;Madam! where is your dear son?&quot; Wherever my son might be, I know naught of it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mountain-cave where the tiger had once sojourned knows as much now of the tiger’s haunt as my womb about my son.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the battlefield only may’st thou meet him.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Pura-Nanuru, </I>Stanza 86)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">III</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the spouse of a bright-faced girl, the lamp of her house, This tall warrior stood with his conquering spear at the battlefield’s front.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His stone-image now brightens the war-camp, covered o’er with leaves,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the small village whose dry fields show but the slender ‘nelli’ trees.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Himself subject and king alike of that barren hamlet,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He stands guard o’er the disarrayed forces, bearing their banner aloft.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A leader still he seems!</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Pura-Nanuru, </I>Stanza 314)</P>

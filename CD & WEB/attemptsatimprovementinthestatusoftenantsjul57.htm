style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
main object of this Paper is to examine the two aspects of Tenancy legislation
in recent years, namely, the effectiveness of provisions for (i) security of
tenure and (ii) improvement of tenurial status of tenants, which are proposed
by the sponsors of this Conference; and I propose to deal with those aspects
with particular reference to the recent legislation undertaken in the States of
Orissa, Madras and Andhra.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
must, at the very outset, confess that the subject chosen by the sponsors, as
it is worded, had intrigued me a bit. We want to examine the effectiveness of
tenancy legislation–but ‘effectiveness’ from what point of view, if not from <i>whose
</i>point of view? It should mean that what we desire to examine here is to
what extent this legislation has given ‘permanency of tenure’ to the
cultivating tenant, but this view can be examined only on a legal plane and at
a conference of practising lawyers but not by, what we call ourselves,
‘agricultural economists.’ Or it could mean–and I take it that this is the
meaning intended–that we try to examine the effectiveness as far as this
legislation could assist the tenant in security of tenure and a share in the
produce so as to act effectively as a producer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
second meaning makes the subject less objectionable as a topic of discussion
here. I deliberately say ‘less’ because in theoretically supporting tenancy
legislation, we, the economists, as economists, are treading on slippery
grounds and making the biggest assumption, no doubt supported by many
authorities, that land tenure system has anything to do at all with production
from land, or which is much worse, that security of tenure or owner-cultivation
necessarily results in greater production from land and therefore is the best.
This belief is much ingrained in us, so much that even the
scientifically-minded sceptics among us do not pause and try to verify the
veracity of the belief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
once had the temerity to question it, and I compared the yields of lands in the
Zamindari areas and ryotwari areas, and in owner-cultivated and lands held
under a temporary tenure. And believe me–or anyone of you can conduct surveys
now and verify–there is absolutely no truth in the statement that yields are
better in the owner-cultivated lands. On the other hand, in some cases, at
least, yields were larger in the case of lands held under a temporary tenure.
It is not surprising; for, as economists we know that the yield from land
depends upon so many factors which are common to both kinds of lands–the only
difference comes in the entrepreneurial capacity and the incentive to cultivate
on the part of the actual cultivator. It is a mistake to suppose that incentive
on the part of the cultivator comes only if he owns the land; fear of losing
tenure might be a greater incentive. But let us grant it. Even then it does not
mean that every owner cultivator is a better entrepreneur than the so-called
‘absentee owner’. Other things remaining the same, we can say, that the
production from land increases with the entrepreneurial capacity of the owner,
be he the actual cultivator or the supervisor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
acceptance of this rule has far reaching consequences; for, unless we can prove
that incentive from ownership plays a far greater part than managerial or
entrepreneurial capacity, we are treading on doubtful grounds, when we talk
about the ‘effectiveness of the legislation’ from the economists’ point of
view. On the other hand, if we admit, as we ought to, that incentive could as
well be provided by fear of eviction, <sup>1</sup> then we have also to admit
that by changing hands in ownership and supervision, <i>land has a possibility </i>of
coming from the hands of a good entrepreneur into those of a bad one. This
possibility is all the great in the case of ‘the bhoodan lands’; <sup>2</sup>
because the donors of these lands are certainly people of proved
entrepreneurial ability–otherwise they would not have acquired so much land as
to be disposed to make a gift–while the beneficiaries are of almost proved
inability–as otherwise, in this political system of equal opportunity and
competition, they would not have remained so poor so long as to deserve a gift.
And in this case land also happened to be of a bad quality so that in the case
of ‘bhoodan lands’ at least we can say that we are placing sub-</span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>marginal
lands in the hands of submarginal cultivators, and the </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>results
are also bound to be sub-marginal.<sup> 3</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dividing
owners into efficient and inefficient, and also the cultivators into efficient
and inefficient, we see that production from land is protected in three out of
four cases, in the system of crop sharing, whereas in owner-cultivation, there
is no protection at all in fifty per cent of cases where the owner-cultivator happens
to be inefficient.<sup> 4</sup> On the whole, it is undoubted that security of
tenure need not necessarily mean an increase in production from land.<sup> 5</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
does not mean that there need be no security of tenure. Far from it. But what I
say is that it is not a question of economics, but only one of socio-politics,
especially the second part of our problem, unless one goes to the extent of
saying that by this transfer of a greater share of the produce from land, if we
are sure of affecting it from the richer to the comparatively poorer sections
of the community, and also that we are effecting greater economic activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Equity,
in Dr. Dalton’s words, is an evasive mistress, and the economist is too old and
worn out to be fascinated by her. Even supposing that we, as economists, are
fit enough to dabble, in socio-economic problems, we have a duty to be sure of
our ground–at least we must make sure that what we support as a <i>just cause </i>is
really resulting in that accepted goal. But here again we do injustice to
ourselves. In the first place, as the Planning Commission say, it is very
difficult to define social justice accurately. Then, I ask, is it not
intellectual dishonesty to prepare a whole scheme of reforms without even being
sure of the goal? In the second place, accepting that the ends of justice would
be met if land is redistributed among the landless and security of tenure is
assured to the cultivator, are we, the economists, sure that such transfer is
really taking place from the rich to the needy? In other words, have we, either
the Planning Commission, or the Government, or the economists, conducted even a
sample survey to find out how many people ‘gain’ and how many ‘lose’ as a
result of this transfer, so as to calculate the maximum social advantage?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
again, I had the temerity to attempt a sample survey. I admit that my sample is
a drop in the ocean and cannot satisfy the needs of a scientist. But it
indicates the need for such surveys throughout the country before any
legislation of this sort is resorted to. My survey shows that a large
percentage of the so-called absentee landlords are no better in economic status
than those that will gain by this transfer of land to the actual tiller. If a
sort of a <i>means test </i>is adopted, what we may find is that a larger
proportion of the absentee owners than what the Planning Commission suppose
today, probably wil1 have to be allowed exemption and a right to reserve
cultivation at will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the criticism made above applies well to the legislation undertaken in Madras,
Andhra and Orissa. In all the three States, it is promised to be a temporary
and transitory measure to be followed by more permanent ‘reforms’. The most
important point in these measures is that the actual cultivator has been given
a more secure tenure on the land, and the share of the owner has been defined,
To that extent it is an undoubted improvement in the status of the tenant and
might induce him to take a more lasting interest in his land; but I cannot call
it a one-sided advantage to the tenant. It has some inherent drawbacks which
act as double-edged weapons likely to cut both ways; and the very law itself
might help the eviction of the tenant more easily than before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first point is that while fixing the share of the owner as a definite proportion
of the crop (at about 2/5 of the gross), the law definitely provides for the
ejectment of the tenant for default in payment. Now, the proportion fixed is
not definitely in favour of the tenant because the tenant now loses the
advantages he was getting from the owner in terms of capital investment,
supervision and advice, so that it would now be doubtful if the tenant could
really bear that proportion. Secondly, in the case of a vast majority of
cases–here again a sample survey is indicated–the really absentee landlord has
not been getting his lion’s share of the produce from the tenant as is commonly
supposed. The relations between the tenant and the owner have been so elastic
in practice that a fifty per cent share was the maximum that could be taken by
a lucky owner in exceptionally favourable years. But now the law helps the
owners to be sure of their share; and, while in the old system the burden of
collection was on the owner, now the onus of payment is on the tenant on
penalty of ejectment, and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there is no more any question of
bargaining. It looks as though Shylock has been ensured of his pound of flesh!
As far as I can see, as Indian agriculture is still a gamble with the monsoon,
there will be more defaulters under the new conditions, and consequently more
easy it would be for ejectment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second point is about the definition of owner-cultivator, or the actual
cultivator. While it is a very difficult task to define it so exactly as to
achieve the objective, and the attempt made by the Planning Commission has not
been very helpful, in their anxiety to eliminate the sinning landlord
completely, the three Acts have cut the cloth the other way so as to eliminate
the efficient tenant as well as to defeat the other broader objectives of
social justice. Take, for instance, the Madras Act. The object of the
Cultivating Tenants’ Protection Act enacted recently is, in the words of the
Revenue Minister of Madras, that the cultivator “should take to the job fully
and must be able to turn a sod of earth or pour a bucket of water, etc.” The
Act actually achieves this by requiring that the owner-cultivator or the tenant
should have no other job that might make them liable to pay sales tax or
profession tax. While the actual definition is so vague that it will help the
cunning owners to deceive the law by simply ‘turning a sod of earth and pouring
a bucket of water,’ in practice it will deprive the actual tiller of another
source which might supplement his income. And here comes the real ambiguity in
our aims!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
instance, is it not the aim of our Plans, both immediately and ultimately, that
the small cultivator should be helped to earn extra income in his spare time?
And why should we place an upper-limit, which after all can be altered by a
small Panchayat? If we can permit a small tenant to make use of his spare time
to get an extra income, why can we not look at it from the other side and
enable the small income-holder to utilise his spare time in cultivating his or
somebody else’s land?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Secondly,
why are we making a fetish of owner-cultivation and depriving the means of
livelihood from a great number of families, in the transitory period, when the
ultimate objective, according to the Planning Commission, is either village
management or co-operative farming, where the actual cultivator would cease to
be the owner? This is a serious point that requires very careful thought–the
wisdom of conferring permanent rights on some small tenants now when we want to
deprive them of the rights later–especially in the light of what I will say at
the end of this essay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
supposing that co-operative farming is a far off cry, are we doing justice to
the owner-cultivator in the long run? By fixing a ceiling at about 6 acres, and
insisting on owner-cultivation, are we not creating a class of people who will
be ‘poor cultivators’? The net income from six acres might represent a fairly
big sum at the present per capita income rates of India, but with the progress
of the Plans and the rapid rise in National Income, will not agriculture become
a still worse economic occupation than now? Naturally what follows is the
organisation of small-scale industry and subsidiary occupations on a permanent
basis, and as they can never compete with mills subsidies will also become a
permanent basis of our economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

France gives us an example and a warning as to the possibilities of such action
now; and in France which has small peasant proprietors on a large scale, both
small scale industry and agriculture are subsidised!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Worse
than that. As in France, we will be creating a new class of peasant-proprietors
who will organise themselves as a political force and who will always insist
upon a small-scale economy and subsidies. When this new pressure group is
formed, will it be possible to dislodge them from ownership to create our
ultimate Co-operatives? Already in the industrial sector the Leviathan of
Labour is calling the tune, and we are creating another Leviathan in the
agricultural section!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>an American literary periodical
(1914-1929), is considered one of the most outstanding of the Little Magazines.
<i>The Little Review </i>championed all experimental movements of this century
and published the work of eminent American and European writers. It was in this
magazine that Arnold Bennett read fragments of <i>Ulysses </i>after having been
told by Wells of the new writer Joyce. A taste of Joyce made Bennett puzzled,
but the older author recalled “the time when I laughed at Cezanne’s pictures. I
wondered whether there might not be something real in the pages after all.” The
serialization of <i>Ulysses </i>nearly resulted in the suppression of the
magazine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

America the generic term has been taken as “Little Magazine” of which <i>The
Little Review </i>is an example. In Britain however the term preferred is
“Little Review”, taking its name from the famous New York <i>Little Review. </i>Should
we use the term Little Magazine(s) or Little Review(s)? The chief aim of a
periodical of this type is the promotion of literary experiment and reform and
the encouragement of obscure and hitherto unpublished authors. This is done
frequently in accordance with a definite editorial viewpoint in the matter of aesthetics
or politics. Such a magazine is not concerned much with high sales or
profit-making. By the very nature of its activity it cannot appeal to all and
sundry, and if it can impose itself on a large public, well and good, but if it
fails to do so, it does not care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Little Magazines are an interesting feature of the present century. Both in the
U.S.A. and England there have been some influential periodicals of this type.
One of the earliest in Britain was Katherine Mansfield and Middleton Murry’s <i>Rhythm
</i>(1911). It was the first to publish Picasso and discuss Van Gogh, Gauguin,
and Croce. And what was the financial status of this brave magazine? Stephen
Swift, the publisher of Katherine Mansfield’s books and <i>Rhythm, </i>failed,
leaving Mansfield and Murry with a printer’s debt of £400. They however decided
to continue the magazine and clear the debt from the allowance she used to get
from her father. The magazine belied their hopes and in July 1913 publication
ceased. Another English magazine had more influence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“No
poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance,
his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and
artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and
comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely
historical, criticism...the emotion of art is impersonal. And the poet cannot
reach this impersonality without surrendering himself wholly to the work to be
done. And he is not likely to know what is to be done unless he lives in what
is not merely the present, but the present moment of the past, unless he is
conscious, not of what is dead, but of what is already living.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was in <i>The Egoist </i>that in April 1918 May Sinclair wrote an article

called “the stream of consciousness” method of writing fiction. A more
influential magazine was the quarterly <i>The Criterion, </i>founded by T. S.
Eliot in 1922 and edited by him till its disappearance in 1939. The first
number of this </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

fact considerably fortified Eliot’s critical reputation. The Editor broadcast a
series </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of talks to Germany in 1946 on “The Unity of
European Culture,” and in one of these talks he spoke on the policy with which
he had started <i>The Criterion. </i>He made it clear that the magazine did not
have any particular credo, excepting an unconscious assumption “that there existed
an international fraternity of men of letters, within Europe: a bond which did
not replace, but was perfectly compatible with, national loyalties, religious
loyalties, and differences of political philosophy. And that it was our
business not so much to make any particular ideas prevail, as to maintain
intellectual activity on the highest level.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

essays that T. S. Eliot wrote for <i>The Egoist, </i>the <i>Atheneum, </i>or <i>The
Criterion </i>were the portents of a new movement in the literature of the
present century. Another magazine of considerable influence was Cyril Connoly’s
<i>Horizon </i>(1940–49). Some of the articles of this review were recently
anthologized under the title <i>The Golden Horizon.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

battlegrounds of new movements and new ideas, the seed-grounds of all new
literature, sheltering the young writers while they are growing, bringing them,
while they are new, to the audiences ready for them, and offering them to the
commercial world, which will decide their fame or their fate...The function of
such reviews, as Mr. Allan Tate says, is “not to give the public what it wants,
or what it thinks it wants, but what, through the medium of its most
intelligent members, it ought to have.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

India possibly most magazines are of the Little Magazine type. In a land where
most of the population is illiterate and where all cultural moves have to be
made by the educated few, however reactionary they may be on occasions, each
magazine has its own coterie to inject it with life-blood and hope. Only as an
exception does it attain to a wide circulation. In Assam it is more so.
Assamese magazines do not have a wide audience, either because they are not well
edited or because they are in truth Little Magazines. The fortnightly <i>Jayanti
</i>(and its monthly shape during the war years) was a Little Magazine and it
could patronise a handful of young writers who are going strong even now.
Hemkanta Barua’s <i>Pachowa </i>was another such magazine. A more famous one
was the <i>Jonaki </i>founded towards the end of the last century by three
students studying in Calcutta. The <i>Jonaki </i>fought strenuously for the
restoration of the prestige of Assamese in its home-place, for the language had
been groaning under the imposition of Bengali, and ushered in what is known as
modern Assamese literature. The literary history of the Assamese people cannot
be rightly assessed without a consideration of these short-lived but
influential vehicles of new thought and fresh experiment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

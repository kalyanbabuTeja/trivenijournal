w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
re-affirm their faith in the democratic process and in democracy as a way of
life. Our new won freedom from British colonialism can mean nothing to us
unless it is accompanied by a growing sense of the value of the individual
citizen, fulfilling himself as a vital unit in a free, co-operative
commonwealth, and governed by a Constitution <span class=SpellE>broadbased</span>
on the will of the people. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>

to achieve rapid industrialisation and a balanced economy without resorting to
totalitarian methods. The Indian experiment is being watched with interest by
observers from abroad, and the consensus of opinion among them is that the
country is progressing on the right lines, though the pace of that progress is
not commensurate with the expenditure involved and the huge official hierarchy
recruited in recent years for working the Plans. Regimentation of the people,
conscription of <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, and the forcing of reforms on
large masses of citizens unprepared for them, are all ruled out in our infant
democracy. The examples of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are before us and we are not anxious to copy their methods, even to attain
desirable ends. We have to depend largely on the co-operation of the public,
and the chief means of enlisting that co-operation is peaceful persuasion
through a widespread campaign of publicity. Ultimately, publicity tells,
provided the activities <span class=SpellE>publicised</span> are genuine
efforts to build a new <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
not in the cities only but also in the tens of thousands of our villages. There
must be a new awareness of our needs and of the means of satisfying them. It is
through the co-ordination of the activities of officials and non-officials that
our plans will become fruitful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Economic re-construction through democratic methods
is, however, a partial <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> of the dreams of
our prophets and seers. It is but the outer framework, which needs to be
ensou1ed by what are usually termed the things of the mind and the spirit.
These ‘more excellent’ things find expression through Art, Literature and
Philosophy. A failure to properly assess the value of the humanities in
enriching a nation’s life, and an undue emphasis on industrial and
technological advance, will gradually lead to an all-round lowering of standards
in education, in public life, and in the purity and efficiency of the
administration. A touch of idealism will transform the outlook of workers in
any field of activity and promote that element of un-selfishness which lies at
the root of all right <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>, whether national or
individual. The last decade in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has witnessed a definite set-back in the matter of action which ennobles the
doer because of the devotion behind it. Till we can recapture something of the
emotional <span class=SpellE>fervour</span> of the pre-Independence era and
realise that, even in a prosaic work-a-day world, purity of aim and loftiness
of sentiment can be allied to a high level of efficiency, out best-laid plans
may not yield the best of results. In addition to the material and mental
attributes usually associated with every institution for the achievement of
public welfare, there is an intangible, yet very real, moral element whose
power for good is inestimable. This moral element, which is indeed a reflection
of the supreme Goodness overshadowing all existence, has to be awakened,
through the proper education of the young, and even more by the personal
example of those who are at the helm of a nation’s affairs. <span class=GramE>A
recognition</span> of this need is the first step in the march towards a nobler
life. It is not enough if a few individuals are idealists. Their idealism must
leaven the mass. The race among public men for office and power, for wealth and
luxury, is improper at any time. It is particularly so in the present condition
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Day after day we hear of efforts to cleanse our political parties and to make
them more effective instruments of service to the nation. It is not the <span
class=SpellE>organisational</span> methods that are faulty, but the emotional
make-up of the people who run the party machines at various levels. It is a
cleansing of hearts that is needed. This applies to every one of our parties.
If all of them function in the public interest, Governments and Oppositions
everywhere in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will reflect in varying degrees the popular feeling. And if every party, without
exception, offers whole-hearted allegiance to the Constitution and to
constitutional and peaceful methods for the working of their programmes, the
foundations of Indian democracy will have been truly laid. The spectre of
dictatorships and of Army <i>coups</i> will be exorcised, and the Army chiefs
will continue to function in loyal subordination to the Civil Power and the
Constitution.</p>

the major problems claiming the attention of our public men and of leading
scholars associated with our Universities, is that of a re-orientation of our
educational system in the light of a rapidly changing environment. The Senates

and the various <i>ad hoc </i>bodies set up by the Government of India to
report on specific </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
convocation addresses delivered year after year exhorting the young graduates
to conduct themselves in a manner worthy of their <i>Alma Mater</i>. The
impression which emerges from a study of this vast mass of material is that of
an ever-widening gulf between the old and the young, that is to say, between
those who guide our educational policies and those for whose benefit such
policies are being shaped. An indifference to studies and an unwillingness to
submit to discipline are the main features of student life on which the
nation’s attention is being <span class=SpellE>focussed</span>. In a place like
<st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Banaras</span></st1:place>, the evils
seem to have been accentuated by the staff of the University using different
sections of the students for the furtherance of their own group activities. And
the political parties are not disinterested spectators. In every University
there are as many politically minded student groups as there are political
parties in the country. Each party is anxious that the youth of the country
should align themselves behind their particular party and become the mainstay
of political agitation for party purposes. This evil is as widespread in the
ranks of students as in the ranks of <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, and the
results are even more disastrous. The springs of our national life are being
poisoned at the very source and incalculable harm is being done to the
generation now at school and college. The students grow up in an atmosphere of
disorder and discontent, and the main work of equipping them for the great
tasks ahead is neglected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
hears of the enormous growth in the number of under-graduates and the resulting
inability of the staff to pay individual attention to their young charges. One
hears also of widespread un-employment among the educated youth of the land, of
frustration of spirit, of emotional distempers. These are evils which may be
successfully tackled by the application of stringent rules for admission, by
diversified courses of study suited to different temperaments, and by schemes
calculated to <span class=SpellE>decentralise</span> industry and to permit
agriculture and the small-scale and cottage industries to play an important role
in our national economy. All this is a matter of framing regulations, <span
class=SpellE>remodelling</span> our educational institutions and finding new
avenues of employment. It does not, however, go to the root of<i> </i>the
problem, which is the achievement of emotional integration as between the older
generation and the younger. A bridge has to be built between them, and our main
hope lies in the age-group consisting of persons between thirty-five and
forty-five. These have watched the unselfish <span class=SpellE>labours</span>
of the national leaders, and sat at the feet of the eminent thinkers of an
earlier generation. They are young enough to establish friendly contacts with
the younger generation now at college and to understand their point of view on
most questions which are vital to the nation’s growth. From this particular
age-group should be drawn the lecturers and professors in our colleges. They
should discipline themselves and interpret the mind of the generation that is
fast passing out of active public life to the rising generation which contains
the builders of tomorrow. This linking of the generations,–one to another,
through bonds of sympathy and understanding, is work of the highest importance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

side-issue which has assumed prominence in recent years is that of the medium
of instruction in our colleges. The change-over to the regional languages has
to be phased properly, but an early beginning has to be made in that direction.
While the regional languages must eventually become the media of instruction,
there is need for fostering a sound knowledge of English and Hindi in all our
educational institutions. For an indefinite period, both these languages may be
used for purposes of Central administration and for inter-State contacts. And
for contacts with the rest of the world, English must always be taught
compulsorily to our students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nomination of the Vice-Chancellor by the Chancellor, out of a panel of names
submitted by a special committee, which is itself nominated partly by the

ruled out as likely to lead to undesirable factions in the administration of

the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Madras</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, by which the

hoped that this system will be adopted on a uniform basis, so as to combine the
advantages of the methods of election and nomination. The Vice-Chancellor is
really the key-stone of the University arch, and his dignity and independence

to felicitate him on the completion of sixty years of a noble, strenuous life.
That was on the 28th of September. Events have moved fast since then, and Dutt
is laying down his office as Secretary of the National Book Trust. What a

steadily at his desk and built up a reputation for sanity and balance. This did
not, however, prevent him from moving on terms of intimacy with the leaders of
the Congress, including top-ranking individuals like Rajaji and Jawaharlal

highest art,” <span class=SpellE>Lascelles</span> Abercrombie wrote in his book
on Hardy, “must have a metaphysic; the final satisfaction of man’s creative
desire is only to be found in aesthetic formation of some credible
correspondence between perceived existence and a conceived absoluteness of
reality.” Graham Greene’s novels have a consistent “metaphysic” and we see in
them a “credible correspondence” between his perception of existence and his
conception of reality. Greene is an artist whose work makes manifest the
aesthetic formation of his metaphysic; he is one of the most skilled and
powerful of creative artists who have a standpoint and a vision. His is an
appalling vision. The existence of evil in this world as a predominant and
driving force fascinates him. His presentation of man’s predicament, though a
little exaggerated, is still a recognizable one. He does justice to his subject
by bringing the full weight of his artistry to bear upon the appalling vision.
Life, for him, is an endless quest for the understanding of certain serious
matters like good and evil, justice and grace. Art is the reflection of life
and we find in Greene’s fiction a preoccupation with eschatological issues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Greene has to his credit more than thirty volumes of fiction, essays, stories
and plays. He has travelled extensively and he brings his varied experience,
worldly as well as artistic, to bear upon his fiction. He is a major force in
English fiction, continuing the tradition of the Victorian novelists,
displaying a vigorous individual talent for observation and analysis of the appalling
vision, the human impasse and the “terrible aboriginal calamity” in which
Newman saw the human race implicated. After a long quest, Greene has arrived at
a standpoint. His works reveal an intensely personal vision. In terms of his
vision, evil is a predominant force in life: man is susceptible to temptation and
sin but there is God’s grace. At the same time this is not a complacent
attitude. The struggles and conflicts in Greene’s world are extremely violent.
They are physical, mental and spiritual and into these are brought all the sins
in the calendar. Life is a violent conflict, but it is also a comedy and even a
farce sometimes. Greene’s standpoint is that hope and faith in divine grace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Evil
in this world as envisaged by Greene is an extremely powerful force. In his
essay on Walter de la Mare Greene wrote: “Every creative writer worth our
consideration, every writer who can be called in the wide eighteenth century
use of the term a poet, is a victim: a man given to an obsession.” In Henry
James’s case the obsession of the artist is betrayal. In <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span>
case, it is pity: in Greene’s case, it is pity and evil. But there is an
essential difference between <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span> outlook and
Greene’s. <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span> characters are impelled by fate
towards their terrible ends, Greene’s by their own choice and commitment to evil.
Evil is the force, as Greene finds <span class=GramE>it, that</span> drives
existence. He quotes Eliot: “It is true to say that the glory of man is his
capacity for salvation: it is also true to say that his glory is his capacity
for damnation. The worst that can be said of most malefactors, from statesmen
to thieves, is that they are not men enough to be damned.” Greene’s works
consistently reaffirm and illustrate this statement. What is right may not be
good and what is wrong may not be evil. Right and wrong, morality and
immorality are relative terms, whereas good and evil in the theological sense are
unvarying absolutes. With all his preoccupation with evil Greene does not
condemn it; he analyses it. He does not damn his sinners; he sympathizes with
them. Though the vision that he displays is diabolic, it is sufficiently
convincing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
major themes in Greene’s fiction are closely related to evil and they recur in
several of his novels. Betrayal, the Judas complex, is one of the most
recurring themes we find in his fiction. To these we may add ‘justice’, ‘pity’,
‘responsibility’, ‘jealousy’ and ‘innocence’. Greene’s obsession with the seedy
and the shabby and his fascination for failure come up in every of his books.
The radical themes in his novels are: betrayal and jealousy in <i>The man
within, The name of action, Basement room and <span class=SpellE>Stamboul</span>
train; </i>justice and “<span class=SpellE>honour</span> among thieves” in <i>A
gun for sale, It’s a battlefield </i>and <i>England made me; </i>childhood and
its terrible impact in <i>Brighton rock </i>and <i>A gun for sale; </i>pursuit
in <i>The confidential agent </i>and <i>The ministry of fear; </i>pity and
responsibility in <i>The power and the glory </i>and <i>The heart of the matter;
</i>love and hate <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in<i> The end of the
affair; </i></span>fear and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>suspicion<i>
</i>in<i> The third man </i></span>and <i>Our man in Havana; </i>the
unintelligibility, absurdity and illogicality of existence in a <i>Burnt-out
case, The comedians </i>and <i>Travels with my aunt. </i>Then there <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is<i> </i></span>his idea of resurrection
and reanimation which comes out <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>some
of his novels and plays. Greene’s principles are torn between ambivalent
attitudes <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>like </span>love and hate
and sympathy and jealousy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Greene’s
novels introduce us to a world which to a large extent resembles our own. But
his vision apprehends reality in such a way as to reveal a new perception. But <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>any artist, as only some aspects
of experience shape his imagination and guide his creativity, his achievement <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>necessarily limited to the
presentation of his own perception. That <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is
</span>to say, the artist’s imagination limits the range of his perception.
David Cecil pointed out <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>his
lectures on Hardy: “Hardy said that the highest art was that which, though
changing the appearance of what it describes, only does so in order the better
to bring out its essential quality.” Greene’s view of life has the limitations
imposed upon him by his range but his view of life is consistent and it has a
sharp quality of reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Greene’s
vision has two facets, each distinct and clear-cut. The world is seen as a
subtle combination of appearance and reality. The creative artist sees flashes
of illusion and flashes of reality. The vision of appearance is sordid and
seedy, squalid and trivial. Human existence in the vision of reality is tragic.
In the vision of appearance it is comic, almost farcical. Men in this world can
be divided into two sharply opposite types; those who are committed to reality
and those who are afraid of it. Characters like <span class=SpellE>Scobie</span>,
the whiskey priest and Dr <span class=SpellE>Magiot</span> are alive to the tragic
reality. <span class=SpellE>Wormold</span> and Aunt Augusta cling to
appearance. Greene in his serious books deals with people who display a sense of
commitment. Those who are afraid of reality and those who are congenitally
deficient and cannot envisage it, are content with the peripheral, the
external, the appearance and the illusion. Such are Greene’s characters in his
lighter fiction. These men and women are mere products of the age in which they
live, their environment and upbringing <span class=GramE>They</span> are more
worldly than the men and women in his serious novels. Though their attitudes
are different both the types live in the same world of violence and distrust.
Reality for them is something horrifying–hence their attempt to escape and
strive for something which appears to be within their reach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
aim of fiction is the creation of a world through the presentation of ideas;
the artist’s task is to present a world that is philosophically adequate. While
the presentation part of it requires skill, the philosophical part requires
sensibility. Greene’s philosophy may not be acceptable as true but it is
adequate. The great artists of the past who remade the world are eminent
writers like Dickens and Hardy, though by no means can it be said that their
worlds are entirely similar. Dickens’s, <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span> and
Greene’s–each <span class=GramE>is</span> a world distorted in some measure by
the standpoint of the individual artist. Greene’s work is nearer to the English
novels of Dickens and Hardy than to those of the innovators like Joyce and <span
class=SpellE>Woolf</span>, since he is preoccupied with the presentation of,
and comment on, what is going on around him. Greene is accused of having an eye
for the <span class=SpellE>unsavoury</span> and the brutal which of itself, it
is further alleged, does not betoken any greatness. But his greatness lies in
what he does with it. He succeeds in exercising the capacity of the reader’s
pity for the condemned and communicates his conviction that God’s mercy is
appallingly strange. With his thesis that none is sinner enough to be condemned
to Hell, he stings his readers into a new awareness of puzzlement and in the
end throws at them his conclusion that existence is absurd and that nothing in
life really matters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seems to believe that there is no fundamental dissonance between man and his
environment which Lord David Cecil saw in <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span>
work. He has successfully plodded through his death-wish to a point where one
acquires a jest for life. He has displayed more than fellow feeling for other
men: he has evoked our sympathy and made us appreciate the normal satisfactions
of human life. He is endowed with a highly intense creative imagination and his
work never fails to convince us as good fiction. He tells us, having shown sin
in all its rawness, that the greatest things are understanding, sympathy and
charity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

world is inhabited by lewd people, demoniacs, criminals, sexual monsters,
satyrs, lechers, drunkards, fornicators, liars and the like. It stinks with a
musty smell; there are cockroaches and spiders everywhere. His works are
chronicles of sin and suffering where we hardly come across genuine love or genuine
happiness. Love, for the characters in Greene, is only reckoned in terms of
affairs and an affair, by his definition, must come to an end, more often than
not, leaving a bad taste in the mouth. This attitude has been severely <span
class=SpellE>criticised</span> as emanating from Greene’s <span class=SpellE>Jansenist</span>
tendencies. In fact Greene’s portrayal of evil is so vivid that critics have
accused him of <span class=SpellE>Manichaenism</span>. But it should be noted
that his preoccupation with evil is a process of rendering justice to God in an
artistic tradition exemplified in the novels of Dickens, Henry James and
Conrad. In the artistic expression of the creative writer an attitude towards
the world has to be presented and it happens that in Greene’s picture of the
world, sin and evil are more striking than everything else. Though the weakness
of the flesh appears to be his primary focus, Greene is more interested in the
sinner than in the sin itself.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span>His characters
compel our sympathy.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>Ida Arnold says in <i>Brighton
<span class=GramE>Rock <span style='font-style:normal'><span

rock; bite it all the way down, you’ll still read <st1:place w:st="on">Brighton</st1:place>.
That’s human nature.” Characters like Ida Arnold and Anthony <span
class=SpellE>Farrant</span> justify their conduct by asserting that God does
not mind a bit of human nature. Sin, Greene appears to assert, is not very
important, at least not <span class=GramE>so</span> important as understanding.
Martha, a character in <i>The Comedians, </i>in a letter to her lover says: “Perhaps
the sexual life is the great test. If we can survive it with charity to those
we love and with affection to those we have betrayed<span class=GramE>,</span>
we needn’t worry so much about good and the bad in us. But <span class=GramE>jealousy,
distrust, cruelty, revenge, recrimination...then we fail</span>. The wrong is
in that failure even if we are the victims and the executioners. Virtue is no excuse.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An optimistic belief in the mysteries of divine
grace is the distinctive quality of Greene’s writing. The appalling vision of
existence, the horrors of life and the presence of evil have turned Huxley into
a cynic. Greene is also accused of cynicism and expressions like “Hell lay
about them in their infancy” have been cited to prove the point. It has to be
pointed out here that Greene hated complacency and only as a protest against
this that the line from Wordsworth’s Immortality Ode: “Heaven lies about us in
our infancy” has been twisted. The evil that Greene paints with a vividness
that he alone can manage tempts us to draw the unjust conclusion that he is a
pessimist. Man finds himself faced with, insoluble problems; human intellect
cannot grapple with matters like sin and damnation. But the realization that
God is in His Heaven that life itself, however absurd or farcical, is worth
living is an acceptance of the terms of life. With a largeness of heart that is
remarkable Greene exercises our pity and urges us to be charitable to his
sinners without parading moral righteousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Greene’s vision of the world is horrifying, he <span class=GramE>do</span> not

mercy of the Creator, which however eludes human comprehension. We, hollow men,
are taught by him never to condemn anybody or anything since our conception and
understanding of divine mercy are distressingly limited. Ours is human
understanding and for that very reason, a very deficient one. Given proper
understanding, we tend to pity the worst sinner. <span class=SpellE>Scobie</span>,

a novelist, Greene has made manifest to his readers the creative <span

contribution to the world of fiction. The myth and its background are so
recognizable that one is tempted very to murmur: “Why this is <span

class=SpellE>Greeneland</span> is a distinct and easily recognizable setting against
which the action in the various novels takes place. Wherever the scene is laid
the qualities of the Greene hero are always the same, the qualities of his
world unmistakable. <span class=GramE>We same the sordidness and squalor.</span>
Human beings are always the same here, the adulterous and fornicating pairs,
the sensitive sinners and the hunted criminals. They are always under the
all-seeing eye of their Creator. They are often pursued by the cruel hounds of
their desires, for in Greene, we come across very frequently schizophrenic
characters. Whatever might be the external manifestations of their deep guilt

exemplified in their introspection and self-analysis. With his clinical
detachment while surveying sin, Greene reminds us of the lines of T. S. Eliot: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is curious of good and evil and his long journeys and electrifying career as a
novelist are protracted attempts to find a foothold. The foothold that he has
found is humility, the acceptance of faith reached by intellectual conviction.
The outcome of this humility and implicit faith in God is the conviction that divine
grace is limitless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The ancient Vedic seers
had a famous appellation for the Godhead Agni, the Mystic Fire, through whom
they invoked and received the favours of<i> </i>all the Gods. They called him
the wonderful fire, <i>Agni Adbhuta. </i>The Upanishadic bards acclaimed that
the Brahman is <i>aascaryam, </i>a marvel. The marvel in this twentieth century
is the manifestation amongst us on earth, known as The Mother, the spiritual
collaborator or Sri Aurobindo. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“She is the golden
bridge, the wonderful fire.” This luminous line from the epic poem “Savitri” of
Sri Aurobindo sums up her personality. When the Mother, as Madam Mira Richard
first met Sri Aurobindo, she wrote in her diary as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It matters not if there
are hundreds of beings plunged in densest ignorance. He whom we saw yesterday
is on earth. His presence is enough to prove that a day will come when darkness
shall be transformed into light, when Thy reign shall be indeed established
upon earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>O Lord, Divine Builder
of this marvel, my heart overflows with joy<i> </i>and gratitude.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What is this marvel and
what is marvellous about the Mother? At all times, in India there have been
great sages and saints and spiritual personalities. They have been a haven of
refuge for humanity, practising in their lifetime what they preached. And when
in due time they departed from the earthly scene, their spiritual message has
survived and has become part and parcel of the rich inheritance of<i> </i>this
country. Is the Mother just one more such spiritual personality in the long
heirarchy of Eternal Mentors who leaven our very existence? Is Sri Aurobindo
Ashram of which she has been the presiding genius and the moving Spirit, one
more or the Ashrams that are littered all over the country? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All along, the spiritual
tradition in India has been to build up the Spirit at the cost of Matter. Life
is negated in order to affirm God. It has all along been deemed that Matter and
Spirit are at cross purposes and one can be victorious only when the other is
annihilated. It was left to Sri Aurobindo to rally the whole Indian thought
back to the Vedas and early Vedanta where it<i> </i>is declared that the man is
the offspring of Heaven and Earth and he cannot disown his parentage from
either of them, where again it is categorically stated that God is not realised
in some remote Elsewhere but Here, in this life on earth itself, <i>atra brahma
samasnute. </i>What has been wrong with the East is that it has been stressing
on the Spirit at the cost of Matter and What has been ailing the West is that
it has been emphasizing on Matter ignoring the Spirit. The time has come in the
evolution of humanity when both the East and the West should unite in the
common endeavour of welding Matter and Spirit together. It is by no accident
that Sri Aurobindo, by birth belonged to the East and the Mother his close
collaborator hailed from the West. Sri Aurobindo who inherited by<i> </i>birth
the hoary spirituality of the East had to spend his formative years in the West
and the Mother who was heir to the pragmatic approach of the West had to repair
to the East for the fulfilment of her life mission. Again, it was no historical
accident that a Western settlement in the heart of Eastern culture and
civilization was chosen as the place of their life-work, as the living
laboratory of their breath-taking experiments. From Pondicherry in India has
been radiating the Light that is the harbinger of a new world, the hope of
humanity. It is the marvellous Hour of God, as Sri Aurobindo calls it, when the
whole of humanity is being prepared for the next step in evolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This collaboration
itself is a marvel. History has not witnessed such a united endeavour, close
collaboration between two<i> </i>contemporary spiritual stalwarts. Instances
have been, where equally famous Master and Disciple have carried on at the same
time the spiritual work taken up by them. Even in the case of great Descents of
Divinity which occur from time to time to give a push to the tardy evolution of
humanity, the force behind such Descents, the <i>Avataara Shakti </i>has always
been in the background. Not that the Force that motivated the descent was not
recognised in its time–the Primordial Poet saw his work Ramayana intuitively as
the great story of Sita, <i>sitaayaah</i> <i>caritam</i> <i>mahat</i>–but it
was fused in the light of the <i>Avataara</i>. It is a marvel that Sri
Aurobindo and the Mother, as the Shakta and the Shakti, as the Two in One, have
been acting with such identified spirit and purpose. The supremacy of the
Purusha stressed by the Vedantic ideal and the paramountcy of the Shakti
emphasized by the Tantric goal find a happy fulfilment in the equal partnership
of an integral realisation that is Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. The identity
is so complete that the Mother has made this declaration about Sri Aurobindo:
“Without him, I exist not; without me, he is unmanifest.” Indeed, for the <i>Mantra,
</i>the gospel of Integral Yoga, the <i>Rishi </i>is Sri Aurobindo, the <i>candas
</i>is the Divine Will and the <i>Devataa </i>is the Mother. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri Aurobindo Ashram, a
standing testimony to<i> </i>the organisational capacity of the Mother, is a
marvel by itself. It is not like any other Ashram where practisants far moved
from earthly life in the solitude of caves and forests contemplate in serenity
on the evanescence of existence. It is situated in the heart of a busy city and
hums with the activities that constitute the normal chores of life. It is a
human laboratory where each soul is tested in the crucible of Integral Yoga and
a new consciousness developed for the advent of a New Life. About founding of
the Ashram the Mother herself has said the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“At the beginning of my
present earthly existence I was put into touch with many people who said they
had a great inner aspiration, an urge towards something deeper and truer, but
were tied down, subjected, slaves of that brutal necessity of earning their
livelihood and that this weighed down upon them so much, took away so much of
their time and energy that they could not engage in any other activity, inner
or outer. I heard that very often. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“I was very young at
that time and always I used to tell myself that if ever I could do it, I would
try to<i> </i>create a little world–oh! quite a small one but still–a small
world where people would be able to live without having to<i> </i>be
preoccupied by problems of food and lodging and clothing and the imperious
necessities of life, to see if all the energies freed by this certainty of an
assumed material living, would spontaneously be turned towards the divine life
and inner realisation. Well, towards the middle of my life–at least what is
generally considered the middle of human life–the means was given to me and I
could realise this, that is, create these conditions of living.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Mother’s concern has
never been for herself. Personal liberation, <i>mukti</i>, she had achieved
long ago. Her sole preoccupation had been, to quote the entry in her diary, “to<i>
</i>live Thy Love, to radiate Thy Love with such potency and effectiveness that
all may feel fortified, regenerated and illumined by our contact; to have power
to heal life, to relieve suffering, to generate peace and calm confidence, to
efface anguish and replace it by the sense of the one true happiness, the
happiness that is founded in Thee and never fades.” It is a marvel that with
such incessant contacts she had with all the motley multitudes of restless
humanity, her soul consented to rest in a human body for such a length of time.
It is a marvel again that she could have a unique relationship with each
individual who looked up to her and at the same time maintain her universal
consciousness. Her Light of Grace has shone equally on the summit of the Spirit
and in the abyss of Matter. Identifying herself with this Earth and its
suffering inhabitants, taking upon herself the burden of the evolving humanity
her life has been one of unfailing hope, abiding faith and endless toil. Her
early dream of a place “somewhere upon earth that no nation can claim as the
sole property, a place where all human beings of goodwill, sincere in their
aspiration, could live freely as citizens of the world, obeying one single
authority, that of the supreme Truth, a place of peace, concord, harmony where
all the fighting instincts of man would be used exclusively to conquer the
cause of his sufferings and miseries, to surmount his weakness and ignorance,
to triumph over his limitations and incapacities, a place where the needs of
the spirit and the care for progress would get precedence over the satisfaction
of desires, passions, the seeking for material pleasures and employment”–such a
place is already taking shape in the pilot project of Auroville, the City of
Dawn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Mother’s teaching is simple and direct. It
transcends all religion. Her writings are full of spiritual clarity and
directed towards the heart of humanity. Her ‘Supreme Discovery’, ‘Four Austerities
and Four Liberations’ her essays on education, her vibrant messages, her pithy
sayings–by their literary value alone–have earned for her a permanent place in
modern French literature. To understand the writings of Sri Aurobindo, one
should have some sort of background of Indian religion and philosophy. The
Mother’s writings do not demand any preknowledge of anything. Their appeal is
so direct, so lucid. One should have the sincerity and receptivity of a child.
That’s all. Her “Conversations”, “Questions and Answers” are a veritable
treasure-house of occult wisdom and spiritual teaching. There has been no work
of this kind in the spiritual field so far that lays bare the occult phenomena
and the secret workings of the cosmic set-up and the human soul. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Truth, the Right,
the Vast that have been held in a physical body is the marvel that is the
Mother. She has declared in unequivocal terms; “I belong to no nation, no
civilization, no society, no race, but to the Divine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

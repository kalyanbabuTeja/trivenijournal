Kingsley Martin. The first died in the third or fourth week of November, 1968;
the second on February 16, 1969. The public, however, knows more about Martin
than about Barry. I know about both and have a softer corner in my heart for
Barry than for Martin; if only because I have derived immensely greater profit
and pleasure from him than from the other. But let me start with Martin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mr.
Kingsley Martin had the distinction of presiding over the destinies of the
celebrated <i>New Statesman </i>of London for full three decades: from 1931 to
1961. He had been a leader-writer on the <i>Manchester Guardian </i>(his
stable-mate was Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge) before taking over the editorship of
the <i>New Statesman. </i>The story of his elevation to this highly onerous
position makes hilarious reading. Arnold Bennett was the Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the paper at the time: the prize-post was entirely in his
hands. He gave an unforgettable luncheon-party at a posh restaurant in the
metropolis, and Mr. Martin was one of the distinguished guests. Bennett, as is
well-known, was a gourmet and he took enormous pains over the menu. He ordered
(so the anecdote runs) a rare fish from (I believe) Italy and it was consumed
with terrific relish by everyone. Bennett–as is the habit of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>all<i> </i></span>discerning hosts–asked his
guests to guess why it had tasted so fine and fresh. Only Mr. Martin ventured
the opinion that it might have been caught that very morning <i>and immediately
flown to London. </i>He got the much-coveted editorship. Moral: set a gourmet
to catch a gourmet! The story may well be apocryphal; but it shows that the
future editor of the <i>New Statesman </i>knew his onions, as the colloquial
expression is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

predecessor, the <i>first </i>editor of the weekly as well as (in my view) its <i>best
</i>to date: the late Mr. Clifford Sharp. I call him the best editor to date in
spite of the incontestable fact that his politics were not my cup of coffee. He
was really a Tory in his political outlook. But, somehow, the Webbs, who
founded the <i>New Statesman, </i>were immensely enamoured of him and offered
him the editorship which he held from 1913 (the year of its inception) until
1930: he could easily have held it for much longer had he not been an
irremediable dipsomaniac (the bottle, it would appear, was never far from his
reach). But, drunk or sober, he had, it must be confessed, a consummate flair
for writing editorials; and, in my considered opinion, was a much more adroit
hand at these than any of his three successors: Kingsley Martin or John Freeman
or Paul Johnson. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was a delightful quality of astringency about his writings that, so to speak,
stuck out a mile. He had a knack of saying what he wanted to say with admirable
precision, there never having been any pretence of beating about the bush, or
of softening the impact of his hammer-blows. His aim, throughout, was to inflict
the maximum amount of punishment on his opponents; and his instinct was
unerring in the matter of choosing the most vulnerable spots for the infliction
of such punishment. Nor had he any undue respect for hallowed names and for
established reputations. He contrived to put even the redoubtable Bernard Shaw
in his place more than once: Bernard Shaw, be it noted, who was one of the
proprietors of the <i>New Statesman! <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

Sharp's regime ended in 1930. Thereafter Mr. Martin took over as editor of the <i>New

Under Mr. Martin’s aegis <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>N. S. &amp; N</i>.
prospered prodigiously and, in fact, his name is more widely known than that of
Mr. Sharp. His reign lasted for full three decades: full three decades, let us
remind ourselves, of unprecedented strains and stresses in the international
sphere. They were, unfortunately, noted for Mr. Martin’s agitated and confused
handling of them. He was, we can now see, not seldom in two minds about the
policy he ought to pursue: sometimes his wobbling became a thorough nuisance.
For instance, he signally failed to the radical line that was expected of him
on more than one critical occasion–the Sudetan crisis, to mention one such: this
in no small measure, pricked the bubble of his socialistic reputation. Dr.
Conor Cruise O’Brien thus summarises Mr. Martin’s predicament: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

surely, is the real treason of the clerks: that leaders of opinion, instead of
showing to the very best of their ability and knowledge how things actually
are, should, in the interests of something or other which usually looks pretty
shabby in retrospect, present them with a version which is thought to be better
for them or more suited to their limited capacity of understanding, their ‘wooden
heads.’ Plato’s Noble Lie is really just another lie, the nobility being in the
vocabulary of the liar.” (The <i>N. S. </i>of April 19, 1963.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

however, must be given where credit is due, and I think Mr. Martin’s two most
glorious titles to fame were his tireless advocacy of India’s independence and
the none too inconsiderable part he played in the promotion of the C. N. D.
Movement in Britain, he having been one of its “founding fathers,” no less. The
movement is now practically dead–the British being what they notoriously are, a
race of only intermittently generous emotions; and the paper, under the
editorship of his successor, Mr. John Freeman, had no compunction in reversing
his heart-warming line on the monstrous “nuclear deterrent”. The present policy
of the <i>N. S. </i>is as far from being “socialistic” as chalk is from cheese,
or as Khorassan from Kidderminster. On India the journal has little, or
nothing, to say; and, when it condescends to say anything, it is to conduct a
veritable commination service on its policies <i>vis-a-vis </i>Goa and Kashmir.
It has always “a rod in pickle” for the poor and hapless Hindus and an
affectionate pat on the back for the lucky Muslims. (In this, let me
interpolate, Mr. Martin had been no whit different from his successors.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Twenties and the Thirties were the Golden Age of English weekly journalism.
Among the editors of that period two stand out most prominently: H. W.
Massingham of the <i>Nation </i>and Gerald (later Sir Gerald) Barry of the <i>Saturday
Review </i>and, subsequently, of the <i>Week-end Review. </i>Massingham died in
1924; Barry in 1968. The journals they edited with so much verve and vivacity
have also gone the way of “the many Ninevehs and Hecatempoli”. But, while they
were in being, they made history, each of them having been a glorious landmark
in English weekly journalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

W. Massingham (“H. W. M.”), of course, stood in a class by himself: as Cowley
said of Pindar, “he formed a vast species alone”. He was a genius if ever there
was one. There was nothing on which he wrote which he did not touch to fine
issues. As a leader-writer, as a “feuilletonist”, as a dramatic critic, and as
a book-reviewer, he “flamed in the forehead of the morning sky”. When he left
the <i>Nation </i>the paper, like an unwatered plant, drooped and languished.
Gerald Barry, if the gods had been merciful towards him, could easily have been
another Massingham. But the gods were not merciful. Both were “live wires”;
both had what I may call the eternal freshness of youth. And both had to sever
their connection with the weeklies they had been editing with so much
distinction, with so much <i>savoir faire, </i>just when their services were
most in requisition. Massingham had to leave the <i>Nation </i>on a matter of
high principle; Barry had to do the same with respect to the <i>Saturday Review
</i>and the <i>Week-end Review. </i>In so far as any English journalist could
ever have been expected to wear the mantle of “H. W. M.”, it was, assuredly,
Barry and no other. He was, however, not given sufficient time and opportunity,
misfortune having continuously dogged his footsteps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have, as it happens, a special reason for remembering him. His most
distinguished contributor in both the weeklies he edited was the late Mr. T.
Earle Welby, a one-time editor of the <i>Madras Mail, </i>who, after returning
to England from the land he daily calumniated, in bewitching style, in the
columns of that Madras daily, devoted himself wholly to literary criticism.
When he died, and the correspondence columns of the <i>Week-end Review </i>were
thrown wide open to his eulogisers, I too, wished to add my feeble voice to
that mighty paean of praise. But the editor had, by then, “closed”, that
correspondence. I was in Trivandrum at the time, and there was only “surface
mail,” not “air mail,” to London. Still, I sent in my humble contribution and
Barry published it, commenting that he had seen fit to “re-open” the “closed”
correspondence to accommodate my eulogy as I could not have known that it had
been “closed”. That, let me point out, gives us the measure of his
broadmindedness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

started his journalistic career as assistant to Filson Young, editor of the <i>Saturday
Review. </i>In 1924, or thereabouts, he succeeded Young in the editorial <i>gadi,
</i>continuing in it until 1930. During that short period he contrived to
transform it out of all recognition. Every issue was a veritable literary
feast, a battle of wits almost: it coruscated with brilliant writing, with such
stuff “as dreams are made on.” He gathered together under his benevolent wing
some of the finest journalistic and literary talent available: T. Earle Welby,
and Ivor Brown, and Gerald Gould, and Edward Shanks, and, above all, J. B.
Priestley. Barry himself wielded an exceptionally fluent and powerful pen.
Earle Welby (“Stet”) was a host in himself. It was Barry’s singular distinction
that he “discovered” Welby’s genius. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ill luck would have it, however, he had to leave the <i>Saturday Review </i>in
1930 owing to proprietorial <i>zoolum. </i>Lord Beaverbrook had just then
inaugurated a furious campaign in favour of what he was pleased to designate as
“Empire Free Trade” which Barry could not bring himself to touch with the
longest of bargepoles. So he wrote straightaway in his paper that the noble
lord’s newest stunt was not to his taste. Thereupon the proprietor, who found
himself in the same political tabernacle as his lordship, demanded from Barry
that, in the following week, he should, without fail, insert a leader rendering
the fullest support to “E. F. T.”. That, predictably, let to his resignation–as

best-written and the best-read weekly review in the country. It is well-known

parson and whose opinions are not so non-committal that they offend nobody have
a hard struggle for existence. The <i>Week-end Review </i>could not expect not
to lose money during its first years, and the losses were diminishing.
Nevertheless the proprietor felt that it was time for somebody else to hold the
baby, failing which publication must be discontinued. Once more Gerald did his

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Without
water a plant withers and without feeling a man. Never since his birth, had
Binu experienced a deficiency of the liquid element. To tell the truth there
had been too much of it. Too much, like too little, kills. And Binu would have
died not his life been saved by the Person who, off-stage Himself, provides the
rain. Excess water is drained away by cutting channels. Music, poetry, drama
and the dance, sculpture, painting and the other arts are practised that
feeling may find outlet. To Binu was given the knowledge of what to say to whom
in order to afford a passage for the excess of his sensibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

twenty years of his life were to pass in the efforts to decipher his fate. It
is only in the mirroring eyes of another that we can read what we are destined
to be. That other may be dearer than oneself. So it was in the stars of
another’s eyes that Binu one day discovered what he was to become. He could no
longer doubt then that he was a poet. Up to that time it had been doubtful, and
because it was doubtful his early poems had not revealed him to himself. They
had been a make-believe, a dressing-up, not the real Binu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

these first twenty years constituted his period of training; the exertions he
made were equivalent to his stage of struggle. Partly as in a dream, partly
unknown to himself, partly in imitation of others and partly through bad (or
good!) company he made some progress. He was helped even by his mistakes. At
times these appeared less errors of sense than practical wisdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

end of all effort is effortlessness, <i>moksha. </i>Binu’s efforts were
directed to the release of the waters of his sensibility; his ultimate goal was
their free and unimpeded flow. When would he achieve it? How was he to know
that he would ever be able to do so? His allotted task was to make the attempt
and towards its accomplishment he had to work his way. Later in life he again
doubted and ran after will-o-the-wisps, but he never took a wrong turning.
Every time he came safely back to the highway of his destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Binu
had an advantage over other boys of his age. So much was forgiven him! At night
other boys had to memorise their lessons but Binu read the <i>Chandi </i>of
Kavikankan to his grandmother or went out with parties of<i> kirtan </i>singers.
Other boys had to be present in class every day but Binu was permitted to go
into the common room during class time. There he could sit and turn over the
pages of magazines or browse in the library. At home he had a library of his
own, the gift of his father. Nobody ever disturbed him when he was reading.
Only his mother, whenever she saw a book of any kind in his hand, would begin
to scold, “O! Those novels again!” His father said nothing. But Binu did not
give him occasion to, for he was afraid of his father and he was careful not to
read novels in front of him. Newspapers and magazines were the only things he
dared to read openly. Through these he acquired a taste for literature. Binu
wished to write himself and to run a manuscript magazine, but he lacked the
requisite ability. Almost all the pieces that appeared in his magazine were
imitations. His apprenticeship began with imitation. Binu was not the boy to
enjoy such work. There were many other things to be enthusiastic about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
we have seen, his liking for literature began with the reading of newspapers
and magazines. There was also another opening, the Raja’s theatre. His father
was the manager of the theatre. Why a person of such a grave disposition should
have been made the theatre manager was a mystery. Perhaps it was because he
knew how to manage. Performances started on time ended on time and there were
light refreshments afterwards. Binu’s father was not the person to put up with
any sort of disorderliness. And he was a man of feeling though he kept his
feelings to himself. No occasion quite came off unless he was present, whether
it was a game of dice or a <i>kirtan </i>concert. He could not sing and acted
very rarely. Dramatic performances took place once or twice a month. Binu went.
When he saw plays being acted he felt like writing them himself and he wanted
his acted too. The boys of his own age did him the honour of staging some of
his worthless productions but they refused to give him an important role!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Binu gradually lost his enthusiasm. That is to say
it found other objects. This narrative of ours is not a biography of Binu; very
little of his life will be in it. The change in the his enthusiasm is
irrelevant.</p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Binu’s monthly magazine came to a
stop and his home theatre as well. There was no encouragement to go on with
them from any direction, inner or outer. Unless some compelling need behind an
idea spurs it on to achievement, it soon peters out even though no one can
create without an idea. The need is the creator’s or his audience’s; sometimes
it is felt by both. The one who feels the need urges creation. Only then does
the sap of life flow freely from a pen, only then does the honey of emotion
pour into the sound a flute or passion take shape in the colours of a brush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no encouragement from<i> </i>outside nor was there likely to be. Who wanted
the compositions of a boy eleven or twelve years old except his playmates? And his
playmates had many interests of their own in addition to their studies. Those
who used to contribute to Binu’s magazine forgot to do so. Setting out to fill
it entirely by himself Binu discovered it was wasted labour, for no one read
it. As for the theatre–the home theatre–he found that the actors said whatever
they liked, got up again after they had been overthrown and slain, fought
another round and were applauded. Nobody cared for the dramatist. It was an
honour to seven generations of his ancestors that his play was being performed
at all! What pleasure was there in writing, plays!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
still greater consideration was that he felt no urge from within either. The
flame of a fancy soon burns itself out. To keep it alight throughout the night,
outside incitement is not enough; there must also be an inner burning. Binu
felt no wild eagerness to write at all costs. The reason may have been that his
heart was not full to overflowing at that age. Emotion accumulates, rising to
flood level slowly. Internal pressure then forces a lightening of the burden.
One suffers unless his feelings are relieved at such a time. If he has a pen he
has to write and he will write even if he is obstructed and forbidden to do so.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

took Binu twenty years to learn this, though he had dimly guessed it through
reading the works of others at the age of twelve or thirteen. When he
discovered the <i>Sabuj Patra </i>he decided that if one wrote at all one
should write like Birbal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was in the <i>Sabuj Patra </i>that he found the word art. He could not forget
it. Though he himself was not very keen on writing he was interested in knowing
what sort of writing is art, what writing that is not art lacks, and which
books are or are not art. He began to examine carefully the magazines he had
been in the habit of swallowing whole. It no longer seemed so easy to gulp down
novels and plays indiscriminately. They stuck in his throat when he tried. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was not among the boys who stood first or second in class. He could not be
called clever. He was unknown. Those who cared for him cared not because he was
clever or gifted but just because he was Binu. Such was the boy whom the group
of writers associated with the <i>Sabuj Patra </i>educated. Rabindranath was
among them and so was Satyendranath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

them cleverness meant skilful living, not mere facility in the handling of
words. For Rabindranath or Prarnatha Chaudhuri a talent far writing meant a
talent for living. Their eyes were skilful, their ears were trained, their taste
was expert. Their minds were discerning. There is a certain kind of mind, the <i>bidagdha
</i>mind, a mind from which its grosser parts have been fired away, in which
there is no foreign matter unconsumed, in whhich there is no obstruction. A
person who does not have such a mind may write with facility and brilliance but
he will convey only a suggestion of passion, not passion itself. That does not
satisfy the spirit; at the most it can startle. The excellence of <i>Home and
the World, </i>or <i>The Tales of Four Friends </i>is not lip-deep; it is the
flashing of a lightning that burns. The excellence of <i>The Cloud Messenger </i>is
of the same kind. An interest in the classics was aroused in Binu. But the cast

learn to write? He composes his songs orally like women make up nursery rhymes.
Line rhymes with line and the metre does not break down only because his ear is
alert. His poetry is liked not for its skilfulness but for its innate
sweetness. This sweetness flowing fresh from its source, the heart, is caught
and held in the poet’s work; it does not wait upon technique. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

surprise was boundless when, as a child, he first tasted Vaishnava poetry. He
did not believe that Chandidas was either very skilful or had a <i>bidagdha </i>mind;
nor was he particularly clever. Yet his poems spoke the language of the heart
to the heart. Tears started to his eyes, tears that shone also in the eyes of
the poet. Is it an easy thing to awaken such sympathy with suffering? Yet
Chandidas was what is called a <i>Sahaj </i>or simple poet. There are no traces
of effort anywhere in the language of<i> </i>his poems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that time Binu was unable to solve this mystery. Later he did. When feeling is very
deep it cuts its own channel, without taking the help of the mind. The mind can
make alterations here and there, polishing up a little, poetry written in the
heart’s blood. Otherwise it is related to it only distantly. In such cases
intellectual cleverness is an affliction and an aspirant is afraid of it. He
desires to be completely simple, direct, unadorned, to forget all conceits. He
wishes to do away with every trace of ostentation, to conceal his virtuosity.
This is another kind of refinement, a burning away of the grosser parts of the
heart instead of the mind. It results not from the charring of one’s world but
from the conflagration of love.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

begun to strive for it in <i>Kheya</i>. As a boy Binu had liked the selections
from <i>Kheya </i>best when he read <i>Chayannika. </i>Subsequently the poet’s
earlier poetry also moved him, <i>Manoshi, Shonar Tori</i>, <i>Chitra, </i>but
the Rabindranath of his first acquaintance was a simple poet. Binu loved the
sweet pensiveness of his music. It is akin, not to the Vaishnavas, but to the
Bauls. Westerners were not mistaken in calling him a mystic. Those who tell us
of the highest truth with the utmost simplicity are mystics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

He liked Jefferson as much as Washington and he liked the later Lincoln too.
America is the Playground of freedom; everyone is equal there; no distinction
is made between East and West; all who go to America prosper. In magazines he
read the testimony of Indians who had gone to America and he began to count the

a more useful one, than that obtainable in a school or a college. How many come
out of school and college real men? Most of them are slaves! He cursed all work
for wages because he had to take a job himself. He wanted his son to be a man
among men, not just a good employee. He was of an extremely independent turn of
mind and had once resigned his post. At the age of eighteen he had been
compelled to take a job out of consideration for his parents and brothers and
sisters. He did not want Binu to have to do the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

him and they did not diminish the value of his freedom. On the other hand he

to greet the ocean.. Through the darkness he heard the surge of it, though he

been so strongly attracted by anything. The sea intoxicated him. Arrangements
were made for him to go to school at Puri. Day after day and night after night
passed beside the sea. His acquaintance with it became intimate. It was now an
old friend. During college vacations the sea summoned him back to Puri. After
he sailed upon it. The blue of the sea set the seal of freedom upon his life. </p>

life of the place where Binu was born revolved around the temple. The old
temple-centred civilisation of India has not yet disappeared from the ‘Native
States’, that is, it had not at that time. Binu’s mother and grandmother
frequently repaired to the temple and Binu went along. The enclosure of the
temple was as spacious as the building was large. Bowing down to the floor
before<i> </i>the idol was not the only thing that Binu did; sitting apart in a
secluded spot he discovered that Something which is the core of all religions.
He was reluctant to come home and came only because he had to<i>. </i>This
meditation of his was a sort of escape, not an escape from the world, but an
escape into the heart of it. Binu was an inhabitant of the infinite, eternal
immense cosmos. The world ignored that and often made him forget it. When he
visited the temple he remembered. He did not bother his head about pious merit.
What wrong had he done that he should grovel in the temple to deserve better?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as such interested him. He went to church with his uncle and joined in the
prayers. Although he did not attend services in a mosque he and his brother
were often sent to participate in the lathi play which is a feature of the
Moharrum festival, for his grandmother had vowed to a god that they would go.
The <i>sinni</i> of Satya Pir used to be brought to the house and the name of
the person who brought it was Bokhari Saheb. Binu and his family had great
respect for him. Binu went to the length of fasting on the eleventh day of the
waxing month. He suffered no inconvenience at all, however, for his
compassionate mother stuffed him with fruit the whole day. And he used to join
processions of <i>kirtan</i> singers, dancing with raised arms, though he did
it more out of greed for the sweetmeats that were distributed afterwards than
from piety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
religions researches gradually led him to a belief in the creed of the Bramos.
He lost his faith in idolatry for good. When he visited the temple it was in
search of beauty or to take part in some festival. A great deal of our
civilisation which is distinct from religion also centres in the temple. To
eliminate the temple is to eliminate tradition. Binu was not prepared to do
that then or now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

speaking of the temple much more is implied than the worship of an idol. The
whole town gathered there and women moved about freely, women of all classes
and kinds. Binu matured rather early. And why should he not? Negotiations for
his marriage had been in progress since he was six months old! If he had
married all the girls proposed he would have had a vast harem. His grandmother
used to promise the hand of her grandson to every girl who took her fancy. Poor
Binu was discouraged with waiting. When he asked why no wife came for him he
was told one would come when he grew up. What could he do about growing up?
Binu gave up hope of marriage and contented himself with seeing. Those upon
whom he gazed when he went to the temple were not goddesses but the daughters
of men. For Binu their attraction was greater than that of the divinities. It
has to be admitted that he noticed older girls most. For they are not girls,
they are women! Mysterious woman!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Full Moon of Spring, at the Festival of the Swing, at the ceremonial bathing on
the dawn of the Ras Moon, at the Varuni Yog–Binu’was born on Varuni day. The
custom of seclusion was not as slack as it is today. Women were permitted to
visit back and forth among a few well-known families but these families
belonged to the same <i>gotra </i>or clan. Men would have been entirely
deprived of feminine beauty by this custom if it had not been for temple
services, ceremonials and religious fairs. Bottled up in a dark container the
variegated lovliness of women would have been invisible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the house, asked for water, set up permanent bonds of kinship and departed. At
night women gathered near the Car. Binu would be there also with his mother and
grandmother. His reverence for the deity was genuine but the attraction of the
daughters of men was irresistible. He had not yet become conscious of his body

a year a party of snake charmers came. They had great respect for Binu’s

bits of knowledge, medicines and odds and ends of various kinds. No one knew
better how to treat cows and calves. The snake charmers used to give him the <i>jarmahura

of the local shopkeepers were uncles. One of them presented Binu with a small

was connected with all and sundry, often without his knowledge. His grandmother
was most forward in making these alliances. She had innumerable
relatives-in-law. Curiously they belonged to all<span style="mso-spacerun:

the seller of popcorn balls, the girl sweeper or the girl gardener. His
grandmother, though old-fashioned, was surprisingly liberal. In her stock of
stories she had the Hindu <i>Ramayana </i>and <i>Mahabharata, </i>the Muslim <i>Golebakaoli,
</i>two or three Christian tales, and fairy stories from all lands. That was
why there were Muslims and Christians among the children she made her kindred.
Binu’s mother had a horror of pollution, so they did not frequent the house but
Binu often went to visit them. He would go to the Pathan schoolmaster’s wife
when he wanted to eat chicken’s eggs. She was an aunt. <i>Halwa </i>he used to
get at the house of a Muslim official who was a brother-in-law. Binu’s mother,
though she did not like overdoing things, also had numerous brothers and
sisters, fathers and mothers. Binu used to go to see them. They belonged to all
castes. In this way Binu gradually came to disbelieve in caste differences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

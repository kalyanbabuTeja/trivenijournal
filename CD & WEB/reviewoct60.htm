<span class=SpellE>Woolf</span> once remarked: “Journalism embalmed in a book
is unreadable”. As a broad affirmation it is nothing to cavil at, though there
are the inevitable exceptions to this rule as there are to so many others.
After all, <span class=SpellE>Cobbett</span> and <span class=SpellE>Hazlitt</span>
were journalists; so were Stevenson and <span class=SpellE>Beerbohm</span>; so,
in our own day, were <span class=SpellE>Lytton</span> <span class=SpellE>Strachey</span>
and Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Woolf</span> herself. The modern age of urban
concentration and mass production is no doubt little congenial to the
cultivation of the art of the essay. There has been a steady dilution of
quality, a thinness of intellectual and emotional content, a blatant <span
class=SpellE>vulgarisation</span> of taste. When one writes for an audience of
two hundred thousand or four or five million, one has necessarily to avoid all
nuances in thought and expression, and confine oneself to the familiar grooves,
the stereotyped responses, the stale <span class=SpellE>similitudes</span>. But
even in these degenerate days there are <span class=GramE>papers</span> that
manage to retain some individuality and independence. There is the <i>Spectator,
</i>of <st1:City w:st="on">London</st1:City>, for instance; and, in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, there is
<i>Swarajya. </i>Their circulation is limited. But the audience, fit though
few, has a taste for what may often prove to be <span class=SpellE>caviare</span>
to the general. In the <i>Spectator, </i>a writer like Bernard Levin gives to
whatever he writes a piquant and an almost biting quality. But it is doubtful
if his essays could be collected, or would then still <span class=GramE>retain</span>
their strong <span class=SpellE>flavour</span> and burning taste. The
brilliance of journalism often wears off all too soon, like scent in the bottle
when the cork is removed. “The newspaper crocus...radiates a golden glow...It
is beautifully finished...But the night comes and these flowers fade”. The <span
class=SpellE>more’s</span> the pity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are journalists in India–<span class=SpellE>Pothan</span> Joseph, <span
class=SpellE>Chalapati</span> Rau, Frank <span class=SpellE>Moraes</span>,
Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>, <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Khasa</span></span>
<span class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rau–who too can exploit topicality to superb
effect. Yet ‘<span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span>’ (N. <span class=SpellE>Raghunathan</span>)
is in a class apart. For long regularly yoked to the heavy editorial wheels of
the <i>Hindu, </i>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunathan</span> was no ‘free lance’
pugilist; but late in life he became one for a change and wrote the now famous,
‘Sotto Voce’ column, first in <span class=SpellE><i>Swatantra</i></span><i> </i>and
later in <i>Swarajya. </i>If one </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>chang</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>e
was permissible, another became for him almost inevitable: <span class=GramE>the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>purveyor</span> of serious political comment
in a daily paper of national vogue became the miscellaneous columnist of an
individualist weekly paper, and the columnist revealed himself as the perfect
humanist and the flawless literary craftsman. A life-time of training in the
exacting discipline of expression in a difficult foreign language now yielded
significant results. Week after week the essays appeared–with their tone of
quiet assurance and look of effortless ease–and, as the weeks gathered into
months and years, the ‘Sotto Voce’ feature became almost the sole
standard-bearer of traditional values and robust sanity in a world of rattle
and glare and noise. <span class=SpellE>Vighneswara’s</span> is often the
conservative, unpopular, ‘diehard’ view; his assent with tradition is apt to
take on the tone of dissent with current notions of propriety and progress; and
yet his views cannot be dismissed as of no consequence, for these undertones of
assent and dissent come with an accent of authority that compels attention. The
Elephant God of the Hindu Pantheon is both massive in bulk and slow in gait,
but he has an infallible skill in works, he has a steady and clear and whole
view of what he designs to see, and he has a sense of <span class=SpellE>unruflled</span>
commitment to the work on hand. He is at once the perfect guide to the world of
knowledge and the perfect dispeller of the obstacles to right knowledge. There
was a certain challenge in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunathan’s</span> initial
assumption of ‘<span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span>’ as his nom-de-plume, even
though it was made with an appropriate “votive coconut”. But we can now see
that the name has not been taken in vain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
Bacon’s ‘Essays’ it has been said that they might be Minerva’s own <span
class=SpellE>lucubrations</span>. Of the piece in <span class=SpellE><i>Satta</i></span><i>
Voce </i>also it could be said that they might be the Elephant God’s own
sallies of the mind. Whatever the subject–economics, politics, education,
social life, language problems, literature, music, philosophy, commemoration,
obituary, even <span class=SpellE>chillies</span> and <span class=SpellE><i>avakkai</i></span>–the<i>
</i>transient is touched with the seal of universality, the trivial is seen to
be shorn of its triviality. The 150 essays collected in the present volume were
written a decade or more ago in the course of the three years of ‘the Coming of
Freedom’ (1946-48), but the effect they now produce on the reader is nearly
unique. It is a <i>book </i>that we are reading, not a collection of stray
articles, A ribbon, of stern purpose runs through and holds firmly together the
many items in this ‘social and political commentary’. Beneath the <span
class=SpellE>superfices</span> of contemporary life and the blaze of opinion
and action there is the deep underground river–seldom seen but real all the
same–which is the true source of vegetation and life on earth. The culture of
the people,–the complex of <span class=SpellE><i>swabhava</i></span><i>, <span
class=SpellE>swadharma</span>, <span class=SpellE>swatantra</span>, </i>and <span
class=SpellE><i>swarajya</i></span><i> </i>that is the true index of this
culture,–has been the slow creation of the ages, and may not now be violently
tampered with except to our total discomfiture. Such is the core, the heart, of
the body of <span class=SpellE>Vighneswara’s</span> musings and animadversions
and gentle exhortations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How,
it may be asked, about the tempo of change in this age of nuclear power and
space travel? Change is easy, and as dangerous as it is easy; but stagnation is
no less dangerous. The problem is to preserve the right balance between change
and stagnation–to retain the soul in its purity and power, yet permit the
body’s growth and development; and facilitate the education and resilience of
the mind in the context of advancing science and technology. The Church, the
Academy, the University–Religion, Philosophy, Education–have at different times
fulfilled the role of preserver of the values of culture without preventing
legitimate change and healthy growth. F. R. <span class=SpellE>Leavis</span>
says rightly that the University is <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“...society
trying to preserve and develop a continuity of consciousness and a mature directing
sense of value–a sense of value informed by a traditional wisdom. The
Universities are <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> symbols of cultural
tradition–of cultural tradition still conceived as a directing force,
representing a wisdom older than modern civilisation and having an authority
that should check and control the blind drive onward of material and mechanical
development...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tradition
(the total contents of a cultural heritage) is preserved and kept alive through
study, appreciation and healthy criticism, and it is helped through contact
with other or ‘alien’ traditions and new ideas to refresh itself and march
towards the horizons of the future. But a hideous Bottom-like translation–a
sudden artificial transformation–cannot be a wise thing, or lead to good
results. The Church and the Academy have fallen into <span class=SpellE>disfavour</span>
in the modern age. The University has therefore the heavier responsibility.
There, if anywhere, we have to locate the springs of a healthy tradition; there
culture should hold its own, unafraid of the weights and measures of the
political and economic market place; there at least the ‘intellectual’ should
be able to call his soul his own, to follow his demon whithersoever it might
lead him, and to reject compromises even if dictated by authority. But our universities
have as a whole failed the country: they can neither <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span>
their essential role as the preserver of “a sense of value informed by a
traditional wisdom” nor even deliver the goods that a Planner’s God-State
stands in need of. <span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span> cannot but spot out
this failure at the fount: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are assured comfort and consideration and they are left free to follow their

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But we are content to order things otherwise in our
country. On the other hand, the University itself has necessarily to be reared
on the broad foundations or a sound system of secondary education. While the
‘autonomy’ of the University has within limits saved it from too much political
interference (except in so far as the Vice-Chancellor himself is a politician
in disguise. as he only too often is), at the primary and the secondary stages
the politician has been having things his own way. Of the redoubtable Mr. <span

the first causerie to the last, one <span class=SpellE>realises</span> how
correct <span class=SpellE>Buffon</span> was when he said that the style is the
man. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunathan</span> was more than the grave
leader-writer of the <i>Hindu</i>. As <span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span> he
is seen as the man of steady wisdom, the scholar steeped in Sanskrit, Tamil and
English, the reverent student of the sacred lore of India, and the bemused and
ironic observer of the Indian scene from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the vantage ground of
his scholar’s sanctum. He writes with classic sobriety although the pen may be
dipped in sarcasm or satire; he is unperturbed even when the mighty or the
majority are against him, and he is imperturbable whatever the immediate
provocation. With a disdain worthy of Queen Victoria’s “We are not amused!”, he
often flings his verbal chastisements with never a semblance of agitation or
fret. The river of his style</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>flows
on and on, and we too are carried along with it. It is no use murmuring or
protesting: the massive scholarship, the rapier intelligence, and the momentum
of the dialectic make a formidable irresistible combination. The style is
indeed the man, and is the expression of a consistent and rounded philosophy of
life: one must respect it even if one cannot always agree with its conclusions.
It is a very personal style, too, for nobody else in India or abroad quite

<span class=SpellE>Chaudhuri’s</span>, yet Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunathan’s</span>
style has a distinctiveness of its own, marked by a <span class=SpellE>Sanskritic</span>
richness in phrasing, a sweep of comprehension that takes all knowledge for its
province, an <span class=SpellE>understone</span> of <span class=SpellE><i>dhwani</i></span><i>
</i>that insinuates many things actually unsaid, and, above all, a poise, a
cadence, a structural amplitude and adequacy that go with an almost absolute
mastery of the medium. Autobiography fuses with reminiscence, literary echoes
mingle with criticism, and candid comment nestles with <span class=SpellE>jewelled</span>
obiter dicta; the quotations are apt and telling, and are drawn from divers
sources; and the pen-portraits</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

has a sense of belonging utterly to the great cultural tradition of our
country, and as one who is unafraid to participate in the splendorous adventure

also because he writes on things that really matter to him. <span class=SpellE><i>Sotta</i></span><i>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A dark sea and white waves creeping inscrutably towards the shore.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The slow languid curving fingers of light clutching the darkness: the white wave of foam and beauty born of the darkness of the Night.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dark sea and white wave moving inexorably to shore and mingling in a scarf about the bosom of the earth . . .</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The slow languid curving fingers of light curl the scarf loosely around the throat of the Beloved, winding and unwinding it in a myriad patterns; the glory of light born of darkness is on her face, the whiteness of the scarf gleams purely on the blackness of her hair.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">O mystic Scarf, fraught with the terror of ocean, the mystery of night, and the pure whiteness of light, O Scarf, eternally wound and unwound about the bosom of the Beloved by the slow languid curving fingers of light clutching the darkness, what perfected glory is it not when curving and rising about her throat thou caressest the dark wonder of her hair?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dark sea and white wave moving inexorably to shore; and mingling in a scarf about the dark wonder of her hair. . . .</P>

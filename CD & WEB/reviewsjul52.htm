or the perfected language is a name to conjure with. All Indian languages, in
some way or other, owe their very existence to this divine tongue. Once it held
its sovereign sway over all India, and even now, though circumstances have
conspired to dethrone it from its exalted position, it does not cease to exert
its influence upon the minds of millions of Indians and the cultured literati
all the world over. The Upanishads that gave solace to foreigners also are the
life and soul of India and her culture. Samskrit is the language of the
Upanishads. If India wants to live, Samskrit must live.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one interested in any aspect of Indian life and culture can afford to ignore
the study of Samskrit Literature, and this handy volume written by two eminent
scholars serves as a helpful introduction to that. As far as we are aware, this
is the first book written on Samskrit Literature in a brief compass by Indians,
purely from the orthodox Indian point of view. The authors with incredible
velocity survey the whole field of Samskrit Literature from the Vedic period to
the modern age, wherein the living Samskrit poets like Sri Y. Mahalinga Sastri
and Srimati Kshamabai Rao also find their due place, within a short space of
300 pages, without at the same time ignoring the individual and distinguishing
traits of each important author and book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

declared intention of the learned authors in writing this book is “to give a
connected account of salient facts about the origin and growth of Samskrit
Literature, from the literary point of view only, and hence, as far as possible
they have shunned all controversy over dates.” They also make no secret of the
fact that “in the matter of opinion and criticism they have set down their
honest impressions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first chapter deals with Samskrit Language proper, and therein, the authors
explain at length, with pleasing analogies and convincing arguments, how
Samskrit is not a dead language, how it was once a spoken tongue, and how it
deserves to be called “Samskrit” or the perfected tongue. Then the authors
approach the Vedas with due reverence, and, after cautioning the readers not to
dismiss lightly ancient Indian theories of the origin of sound, try to make out
a case for the reasonableness of the orthodox Indian point of view, according
to which the Vedas are authorless, eternal, and innumerable. After a peep into
the field of Sastras, they arrive at the domain of Kavyas, where at the very
entrance, the aims and ideals of Indian art and poetry are made clear. “Our
ancient aestheticians looked to poetry to elevate the morals and to
substantiate the ideals of humanity. Theories like ‘Art for art’s sake’ never
had an iota of appeal to them...Art and literature should paint man as born and
destined to strive only for higher ideals.” The readers are then introduced to
a discussion on the soul of poetry. Different rhetoricians, like Bhamaha, and
Dandin, Bhatta, Lollata, Srisankuka, Bhatta Nayaka, and Abhinavagupta, the
exponents of ‘Rasa-sutra,’ are also introduced to us, and the authors make the
following observation while dealing with Abhinavagupta and Jagannatha:
“According to Abhinavagupta, a <i>rasika </i>becomes impersonal from the moment
of his preparation to enjoy a piece of art. He cares only for the resultant
pleasure from the art of the dramatist and the skill of the actors in the
presentation. Pandita Jagannatha criticised Abhinavagupta and expressed ‘Rasa’
as of a Rasika’s own making, and never the result of the dramatic performance.”
A brief survey of all the major Rhetoricians and their works follows next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The authors now alight at the shrine of Valmiki the
‘adikavi’ who they think is the author of Balakanda and Uttarakandas also of
the Ramayana. After paying homage to him, and noticing Asvaghosha, they lead
the readers to Kalidasa, the prince of poets, who flourished in the 4th and 5th
centuries of the Christian era, and offer their unstinted meed of praise to
him. Our attention is drawn to Bharavi’s originality of method which is
illustrated, and then we are led to Sri Harsha “whose work smacks so much of
Sastras, and who, by a peculiar deftness of language, can hit off many
suggestions and ideas in one and the same stanza.” Thus on our way we are shown
80 other authors of Mahakavyas including Srimati Kshamabai Rao the living
poetess, “whose capacity for versification in simple Samskrit cannot be forgotten.”
While treating of Bana, the foremost among prose writers, the authors attempt
to silence the critics “who doubt whether Bana cares for the execution of a
fine plot or for any of those situations which bear the stamp of probability.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
we are led to the domain of Samskrit Drama, wherein the dramatists, in order
“to secure an idealistic atmosphere and their chief aim of painting the ideal
in order to elevate the minds of the audience who witness a performance, chose
episodes for treatment from great epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata.” Absence
of tragedies in Samskrit Literature is ably accounted for. “Idealism as painted
by Samskrit writers will not permit of any defeat for the hero on the stage.
Even Fate’s severest strokes will have to be cancelled by supernatural powers
and efficacy of penance. The ideal chosen as the motive of the play should be
such that people beholding it should return with their faith strengthened in
the good resulting from high endeavours and their senses soothed by the happiness
crowning human efforts….If a successful end is certain for human strivings,
whether in one life or after many lives, that truth must be represented in a
drama.” Nearly 40 dramatists beginning from Asvaghosha, who, according to the
authors, preceded Kalidasa, and ending with Sri Y. Mahalinga Sastri of modern
times, pass before us in their characteristic colours, in this short survey of
Samskrit Drama. At the end of their long but happy survey, in the last chapter,
the authors ponder over the beauties that contributed to the immortality of
Samskrit poetry, and broadcast to the world at large the message of our
Samskrit poets, that nothing but a harmony of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is a reprint of the author’s book on the
subject first published in 1908. The sub-title “A study in Comparative
Religion” is a mere correct description of the contents of the book. Sri Bipin
Chandra Pal is well known as one of the foremost of the pioneers in the
nationalist movement in the country to whose brave and selfless efforts towards
the end of the last century the country owes the political awakening, the
organisation of the Indian National Congress and the struggle for political
freedom which resulted in complete Independence in 1947. But his attainments
and his views as a religious and social thinker are not as familiar to the
public at least outside Bengal as they should be; this will be readily conceded
after a perusal of the volume under review.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
nationalist movement was many sided and from the beginning, and all through,
the leaders at any rate conceived it as an assertion and claim of the nation
for independent development on its own natural and self-chosen and
self-directed paths in all aspects of social and cultural life. Also the
characteristic spiritual outlook of the nation could not but influence the mentality,
out-look and interests of our prominent leaders, almost without any exception,
to study the history of our civilisation and culture and the influence of our
religion on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this book Sri Pal contends successfully against the facile and superficial and
sometimes conceited and prejudiced interpretations of our culture and complex
religion by ill-qualified and in-competent foreigners, and makes out an
irrefutable case for the study of our religion by the thoughtful among our
nationals, so that it may continue to evolve towards greater and greater
perfection and also, by its correct presentation to the world, exert its proper
influence on the evolution of the religious thought of humanity which is
advancing with time towards closer unity. The book provides an introduction not
merely to the study of Hinduism but to the study of comparative religion and is
bound to be of great interest and benefit to the English educated young men of
the day who may be anxious to understand the genesis and history and meaning
and value of our religious texts, traditions and institutions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

organic conception of the relation between the individual and social life and
development, Sri Pal himself explains the value of his autobiography to
students of the history of the period covered by his life, which constitutes
one of the most eventful and significant epochs in the history of our
civilisation and culture. And Sri Pal was no ordinary individual but a leader,
one of the foremost of his day, and not merely witnessed but personally shared
the toils and turmoils through which the mighty transformation in Indian
thought and life was achieved during this period of violent religious and
social revolt and then a tremendous political upheaval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

value and essential. The book throws a flood of light on the thought currents
and cultural life of Bengal, which was the centre of social reform and
political revolt and led the other Provinces in all aspects of the national
renaissance; and Sri Pal was closely associated with all these movements. In
fact he was almost entirely devoted to public life, and was one of the leading
personalities in his Province and exerted considerable influence upon his
generation. As such this record of his experiences and activities, especially

the editorial columns of the <i>Prabuddha Bharata </i>and suggested chiefly by
the ethical and religious aspects of the advancing national movement in the
early decades of this century. The terms Religion and Dharma stand for the
monastic ideal and the ideal of National righteousness, the social conception
of law and conduct and worship. Sister Nivedita believed in the power of the
Indian consciousness to absorb and transmute the contribution of the Western
civilisation with which India came into contact in the British period. She
showed the way to it through an exchange of organic ideals between East and
West and, for India, a reinterpretation in modern times of the faith and
practice of the past, a shifting of the emphasis from the monastic ideal to the
ideal of social service, the exaltation of work, of positive character and of
knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

absorption by us of the contribution of the West is in no sense complete. The
problems, dangers and difficulties inherent in the process which occasioned
these wise reflections, comments and exhortations to the young men of her time,

author terms it with characteristic modesty an essay in understanding and not
an interpretation or a defence. But the book is really all these at the same
time, and the General Editors must be complimented on the choice of the author
who is very well qualified for the task by his close proximity and intimate
personal contacts with Gandhiji during his life time, his intelligent, sincere
and ardent appreciation of the Mahatma and his view of life, his careful and
devoted study of the writings and speeches and activities of the great leader,
with a number of books already to his credit on Gandhiji’s life and personality
and message.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

volume also serves the general objective of the Book University to present to
the readers in the country and outside, the literature which stands for India
and the fundamentals of Indian culture. The first book of the series, already
reviewed in this Journal, is a summary, in a series of stories, of the great
national epic of India, <i>The Mahabharata, </i>by Rajaji, embodying the
traditional ideals of the nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second is on the <i>Gita, </i>the quintessence of the Hindu religion in all its
aspects of Metaphysics, Philosophy and Ethics, by the eminent jurist and
student of philosophy, H. V. Divatia. Now, quite properly, we find in this
volume of “Gandhi’s view of life” an exposition of Indian culture and its
fundamentals as they stand revealed clearly in the process of assimilation and
absorption of the best elements of European culture and adjustment to modern
conditions of life. There can be no better interpretation of the fundamentals
of a culture than the life of the most typical representative of it, and there
can be no two opinions regarding the fact that Gandhiji’s life is at once the
most typical and representative and at the same time the noblest expression of
the fundamentals of our hoary culture which reaches forth in his hands to the
glory of pointing the way to the evolution of one Universal culture and a
peaceful and tolerant way of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
view of life of Gandhiji presented in this volume is not based exclusively on
the teachings or utterances of the great man or his declared principles. The
author is well aware of the inherent complexity and difficulty of the subject
in view of the continual process of evolution in Gandhiji’s view of life, the
principles being exemplified and gaining in accuracy and definiteness by their
application to actual personal and public situations in life of the great man
who was at once a man of thought, a theorist, and a man of action, a leader.
The author has attempted laudably to get at the view of Gandhiji who saw life
‘steadily’ and saw it ‘as a whole’, by a reverent study of the utterances and
the life of the Mahatma as well as the various interpretations of the same by
several eminent contemporaries already available to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Congress is the first held in Asia in support of the movement for a permanent
international congress for cultural freedom to combat the suppression of
intellectual freedom, wherever and in whatever form the danger might manifest
itself. The Government of India, in their anxiety to hold the scales even and
to appear to do so beyond any doubt, between the partisans and admirers of
Russian Communism and American Democracy, each with its own culture front,
prohibited at the last moment the holding of the conference at Delhi according
to the original intention of the sponsors. But undeterred by this initial
damper on their enthusiasm, the sponsors proceeded to arrange for the holding
of the conference at Bombay and succeeded admirably in their attempt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguished men of culture from the different parts of the country
participated in the proceedings, and there was also a considerable contingent
of fraternal delegates from Europe and America to add to the dignity and
international status of the conference. The presence of men of culture like the
poets Auden and Spender, philosophers like Burnham and Norman Thomas and
leaders of social movements like Muller, Yergan and Margolin and Madariaga
revealed the international magnitude and value of the proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is true some of the speeches of the sponsors seem to indicate an obsession with
the Communist culture front and the dangers from it, but some of the speeches
and especially the papers contributed by Dr. Bhagavandas and Dr. Hafiz Syed on
Indian culture and the Indian ideal of freedom of thought respectively, and of
Mr. Masani on Neutralism in India are undoubtedly of remarkable value and
interest to Indian readers. They help to place the present movement for the
preservation of cultural freedom in the proper perspective in the context of
Indian culture and its evolution through the centuries, and also explain
clearly the rationale and justification of the peculiar policy of positive
neutrality pursued by our Government of national leaders in the present crisis
in the international situation, when the whole world is rapidly tending to a
division into two hostile camps led by America and Russia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</SUP><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">INDIA’S AMBASSADOR</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two weeks ago, it looked as if the Delhi Pact was at an end–as if the Civil Service had triumphed, and while Irwin proposed Hotson disposed. But the eleventh-hour efforts of the peace-makers have borne fruit, and, to the Nation's immense relief, Gandhiji is on his way to the Round Table Conference. Persistent violation of the Truce terms by nearly every Provincial Government exhausted the patience of Gandhiji and the Congress Working Committee. What was worse, the Government of India would not concede that there had been any serious breaches; they arrogated to themselves the sole right to determine the points in dispute. Answering the Congress charge-sheet, they merely quoted the replies of the Provincial Governments. Gandhiji felt that the great Civil Service did not wish him to attend the Conference. He would not go except with their goodwill and blessings. And so, the Nation was alternating between hope and fear; the position was similar to that in the first days of March when negotiations were in progress between the Viceroy's Executive Council and the Congress Cabinet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even now, nothing has been conceded beyond an enquiry into the Bardoli dispute by the Collector of Nasik. Cynics are not wanting who exclaim that Gandhiji might as well have sailed a fortnight earlier without creating all this trouble. This criticism is of a piece with the statement of Mr. Jinnah, that the Delhi Pact had not advanced matters very far, and that the Congress could have participated in the first R.T.C. instead of plunging the country into the turmoil and suffering of last year. But these critics forget that the assertion of a Nation's rights, and its readiness to vindicate those rights, are the best guarantees of a lasting peace. If the Congress had participated in the first R. T .C., or if Gandhiji had sailed on the 15th, the Nation's honour would have suffered. It is not the particular terms of the Delhi Settlement between Gandhiji and Lord Irwin, or of the Simla Settlement between him and Lord Willingdon that matter, so much as the circumstances that led to those settlements and the manner in which a strong and prestige-ridden Government found it necessary to bend to a Nation's will. That was how Gandhiji was content to waive his demand for a Court of Arbitration. He is essentially a man of peace, determined to present India's case at the bar of world-opinion, through the R.T.C. If, ultimately, it should be war and not peace, no blame will attach to him. God grant that it may be peace!</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A 'NATIONAL' GOVERNMENT</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An unprecedented economic crisis has led to the formation of a ‘National’ Government in Britain. Mr. MacDonald continues to be Premier, but the hostility of his former colleagues and of the vast majority of the Labour Party, will make it impossible for him to retain office for long. The General Elections within the next few months may result in a victory for the Conservatives. Even if Labour should return to power–an extremely unlikely contingency,–Mr. MacDonald will be kept out of the Cabinet. In either case Mr. MacDonald's political career will have ended. He is not blind to this possibility, but, with rare courage and insight, he has chosen to place country above person or party. During the Great War, he was hounded out of public life for being a pacifist. Yet he rose within a decade to the summit of political power. It is painful to break with old comrades, and sever party loyalties, but Time will vindicate the Premier and assign him a position among the very greatest of British statesmen. The actual proposals for meeting the crisis will come up shortly before Parliament, and despite opposition, they may be accepted by a majority. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as India is concerned, the change of Government is of little significance. The British parties have ever presented a united front to the Indian demand. In that sense, as Pandit Jawaharlal said, there is always a National Government in Britain. The Indian R. T. C. will pursue its appointed course. Whatever proposals may emerge from its discussions will be carried through Parliament. Labour in opposition may be trusted to be not less sympathetic than Labour in office.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LAURELS FOR VENKATARAMANI</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fresh laurels are crowning Venkataramani's brow. His Holiness Sri Sankaracharya of the Kamakoti Pitham has blessed his literary efforts. In accordance with the traditions of his high office, and keeping in view the needs of the modern age, His Holiness presented to this South Indian savant an ivory shield of exquisite workmanship inscribed with the legend, "Steer thou with thy pen to the goal of universal happiness". The manner of the presentation of the shield at a gathering of the <I>elite </I>of South India, and the association of Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar with the unique function, lent additional charm to the auspicious gift. From time to time, eminent individuals of the type of the Advocate-General of Madras and His Holiness, have conspired to draw him into the open and honour him as he deserves to be. Incidentally, we are reminded that, right in our midst, is a gifted writer whose contribution to recent Indian thought has more than fulfilled the rich promise held out by his early work, and who, in uncongenial and depressing conditions, is keeping bright the torch of learning. Venkataramani belongs to the small band of Indian scholars who are interpreting the best in Indian life with singular felicity and grace. To those of us who have the privilege of his friendship, Venkataramani is a perennial source of inspiration and solace. Are we not entitled to rejoice in his triumphs?</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE ANDHRA UNIVERSITY</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another event of far-reaching importance in the cultural history of South India is the accession to the Jeypore <I>gadi </I>of Rajah Sri Vikrama Deo. A versatile scholar and poet and a munificent patron of learning, the Rajah has signalised his accession by an annual grant of one lakh of rupees to the Andhra University, to be earmarked for a Science Institute. The University starts on a fresh career under happy auspices. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the recent appointments to the staff is one to which we wish to invite particular attention. In our view, the Professorship of Telugu Poetry in the Andhra University should carry with it the highest emoluments as well as honour, next, if at all, to the Vice-Chancellorship. It ought to be the same with regard to the Professorship of Bengali Poetry in the Calcutta University, or of Marathi Poetry in the University of Poona, if ever there should be such an institution. Modern Indians are painfully slow to recognise that the future of the race depends a great deal on the poets and scholars working in the different linguistic units of India. These are the ‘music makers and the dreamers of dreams’ who are privileged to mould the culture of unborn generations. Judged in this light, a paltry lecturership in Telugu for a poet like Pingali Lakshmikantam is something pathetic. But Lakshmikantam will invest even this petty post with a halo of glorious achievement, even as his revered <I>Guru, </I>Venkata Kavi, filled Andhradesa with the fragrance of his poetry from his position as a low-paid <I>Pandit </I>at the Hindu High School, Masulipatam. For the benefit of our non-Andhra readers, we may mention that Venkata Kavi and Tirupati Kavi were life-long friends and twin-poets who gave a new turn to Telugu poetry three decades ago. Lakshmikantam and Katuri Venkateswara Rao are again twin-poets who occupy a leading position in modern Telugu literary circles. By a fortunate concidence, at the very moment that Lakshmikantam is appointed to the lecturership at the official University, his friend Venkateswara Rao fills the corresponding place at the unofficial temple of learning–the Jatheeya Kalasala Masulipatam. The future is therefore full of promise.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE SARANATH VIHARA</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The venerable Anagarika Dharmapala sends the following welcome communication:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DEAR BROTHER,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The great Vihara at Sarnath is at last complete. The finishing touches have been given to the 110 feet high main tower of the Vihara and the work of cleaning the platform has also been completed. The interior of the Vihara is ready except the frescoe work which, thanks to the generous promise of Mr. B. L. Broughton, will be taken up as soon as possible. The only Buddha image of the Shrine which is in the preaching attitude is being made by the School of Art, Jaipur, on the model of the famous image in the Sarnath Museum and will be ready within two months. Thus after many vicissitudes the scheme of the Vihara has become an accomplished fact. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the suggestion of the Archeological Department of the Government of India, the opening ceremony and the enshrinement of the sacred relic have been fixed to take place in November this year, and I invite Buddhists of all countries to participate in this historic event. As this is the first Vihara we have erected at the sacred spot after 800 years, I trust the Buddhists will gather in their hundreds to take part in the ceremony and usher in this new era of Buddhist revival at the sacred Migadaya. Our Society will make arrangements to accommodate visitors if they inform us in time of their willingness to take part in the event. Formal invitations will be sent later on.</P><DIR>

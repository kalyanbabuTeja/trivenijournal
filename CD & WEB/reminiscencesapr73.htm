the beginning of 1921, Gandhiji had given the call for non-co-operation with
the British Government. A new life appeared to pulsate through the country; a
new spirit of self-denial and of self-reliance. Some of us who were in
Government service resigned and joined the band of teachers who were intent on
rehabilitating the National High School, which, started in 1917, seemed to be
tottering to a fall in the summer vacation of 1921, owing to serious disharmony
among the staff, and between the staff and students. Some teachers had also
resigned and left. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Gandhian National Schools in British India, we were recognised by the
Department of Public Instruction and did not shrink from taking grant (it was a
meagre Rs. 70 per month). This exposed us to uncomplementary comments from
orthodox Gandhians, many of whom put on self-righteous airs and were censorious
to a degree. This applies mostly to the Congress workers from British India,
who occasionally dropped in, and “openly” ridiculed our claim to call ourselves
National School. Of course, such ridicule caused us pain. On the other side,
there were our own officers in the Educational Department, who looked on as
rebels. We teachers wore what was called the national dress, not coat and
turban, according to the accepted conventions. Possibly, they imagined we were
doing Congress propaganda in the classroom. This, of course, was far from true.
We went through the course of studies dutifully, but of course supplemented it
by other lessons not prescribed–like Civics, Hindi, Moral and Religious
Instruction. In this way, we tried to build up an atmosphere of patriotism and
celebrated the days of great men, introducing our young pupils to the thought
of the great national leaders like Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore and
Mahatma Gandhi. The Government was rather suspicious about us. We were far too
Gandhian. On the other hand, many of our national workers thought we were not
national enough. Caught between two stools, as it were, we had our moments of
wavering. But we had burnt our boats, and had banded ourselves together. This
feeling of belonging to a brotherhood upheld our spirits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

must here mention the great encouragement we got from about 1922 from Rajaji,
who along with our Karnatak leader, Gangadhar Rao Deshpande, used to visit the
school, and talk to boys about Swadeshi and Khaddar. Rajaji used to refer to
himself as an honorary teacher of our school. He looked our programme and
wished us godspeed. Our spirit was greatly strengthened by his words of
approval and appreciation. He was an acknowledged authority on Gandhian ideals
and technique. When we had the blessing of such a one, we could afford to
ignore the criticism of smaller men who assumed “Holier than thou” attitudes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

system of education that obtained when I passed through high school and

the end of the primary stage, one entered the high school, (I-VI Form) where
English was not only the first language, but the medium of instruction. There
was provision for the mother-tongue or regional language to the extent of being
able to write a composition in it on topics found in a prescribed non-detailed
book. There was also Sanskrit. The Indian language teachers commanded little
respect (to put it mildly), and pupils took delight and even pride, in
neglecting Indian languages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

took up Sanskrit as my second language in the High School, but the syllabus was
such that one could get no more than a mere smattering of it. In my case, I had
the misfortune to have a Sanskrit teacher, who was cursed with impatience and
bad temper, and fully believed in the saying “Spare the rod and spoil the
child”. Only in his case the word ‘rod’ should be substituted by “beatings and
pinchings”! As a result, I emerged out of the school with the knowledge of the
Sanskrit alphabet intact and little more. When I joined the Christian College
for the Intermediate, I should have offered Sanskrit Translation, under second
language. Instead, I offered Telugu Composition, as some one at the time told
me it was an easy alternative. I realised too late I had made a mistake. I
learnt that though I obtained a First Class in the Intermediate Examination, I
had just scraped through Telugu Composition with grace marks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was my mother-tongue and spoken at home. Madhvas generally carry the language
with them wherever they happen to reside, just as Srivaishnavas carry some
Tamil with them. But the Kannada was of the variety one usually hears in
Triplicane at Madras or in Coimbatore. I was innocent of its literature, the
only exception being the songs of Purandaradasa and other saints and the
Harikathamritasara, with all of which my mother had fairly intimate knowledge.
She had a hauntingly sweet thin voice and an extensive repertoire of Dasa’s
songs stored up in her memory. My introduction to Kannada literature, while I
lived in Andhra and Tamil Nadu in my earlier years was through listening to my
mother’s songs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

me greatly. Kadapa Raghavendra Rao and Mudved Krishna Rao, who gave many of us
glimpses of the possibilites of Kannada eloquence, not only goaded me but even

in English, say for a year, talk only in Kannada–until you get used to it.” The

story from English to Kannada, it would be much better to translate the story
from Tamil directly into Kannada, as both were Dravidian languages and had
syntax and many words in common. He asked me if I would do it. He also sent me
the original Tamil story. My<i> </i>own knowledge of Tamil was greatly limited,
being confined to its colloquial for purpose of conversation. But when I read
the Tamil story, I found that Rajaji himself had written it in popular style
and its diction offered no difficulty. I therefore translated it into Kannada,
and had the story published in, I believe, “Jaya Karnataka” of Dharwar. Rajaji
was greatly satisfied that I had done the assignment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

none at the time, so far as I knew, and I told him so. The version produced by
S. G. Sastry and A. N. Murthy Rao were published later. So, Rajaji persuaded me
to render into Kannada his abridged version of the Trial and Death of Socrates,
which he had prepared while in Vellore jail, calling it “Satyagraha Vijayam.”
He had Indianised Socrates’ name into “Sukrutar”. He wanted the book to be priced
cheap so that it could have a wide circulation. I took up the assignment and
finished it, admiring all the time the masterly way in which Rajaji had done
the abridgement. It was published by the Satyasodhana Book Depot run by my

discovered that rendering. Rajaji’s Tamil sentences into Kannada was absurdly
easy. You had only to think of the proper Kannada word for a Tamil word now and
then. The order of words was, in most cases, the same, and most words were
common. So when the late A. R. Krishna Sastry complimented me on my ‘Ramayana’
in Kannada, calling it the ideal prose style of his conception, I told my
revered friend promptly that the entire credit for it should go to Rajaji and
not to me. Some years later the Sahitya Akademi at Delhi entrusted me with the
task of translating a collection of modern Tamil stories, by different authors,
into Kannada. I undertook the task rather light-heartedly. I soon realized that
I could not make such headway without a Tamil dictionary and even referring
some passages to Tamil scholars for elucidation. It was then I realized the
reason for the extraordinary vogue Rajaji’s writings enjoyed in Tamil Nadu. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sand carrying our kit for over two mites to Dhanushkodi, where the ceremonial
sea-bath had to be taken twice: once in a calm salt lake on one side and again
in a rough sea on the other. As we started on the weary walk in the sand, rain
overtook us; not just a drizzle, but a heavy downpour. Not only the clothes we
wore soaked through, but the kit which carried our dry change of clothes became
wet. The wet clothes we wore impeded the walk and so we got rid of them and
bundled them on our head, wearing either mere shirts and a kaupina–or only the
latter. We looked not much different from the fishermen and fisher boys that

to his house in Mylapore late one evening. I knocked at the door in front of a
dark passage. The person who came to the door asked for my name. On hearing it,
Sastriar sent word that I might come in. He was resting on a cot and made me
sit on it. He made kind enquiries of friends in Bangalore. He referred to
Gandhiji’s visit to him a few days earlier, in touching tones, that are
imprinted in my memory. I thought I should not tax him further. I touched his
feet and got up to leave. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

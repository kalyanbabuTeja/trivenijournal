numbers do not come nor does a poet sing as the linnets sing; the craft of

road to every singer’s <span class=SpellE>Xanadu</span> and note the drops of
water that make the mighty ocean and the pebbles that make the mighty
mountains. The composition of verse, wrote Wordsworth, is infinitely more of an
art than men are prepared to believe; and absolute success in it depends on
innumerable minutiae...Milton talks of pouring ‘easy his unpremeditated verse’.
It would be harsh, untrue, and odious to say there is anything like cant in
this, but it is not true to the letter, and tends to mislead (Letters: Later
Years). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

essay combats in Section I the time-<span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
statement that the poet is more important than the critic, assuming that the
poet and critic are separate and distinct; in Section II this very assumption
is questioned; the poet and the critic are said to be one; Section III harks
back to Section I and <span class=SpellE>topsy-turvily</span> states that the
critic is richer than the poet, as against the generally accepted view that the
poet is more precious than the critic. If it is said that the poet is born, we
can as well lay down that a critic too is born. Arnolds and <span class=SpellE>Eliots</span>
are as rare as <span class=SpellE>Shelleys</span> and <span class=SpellE>Keatses</span>.
We hesitate even to state that a critic is as important as the poet. We take the
poet’s importance for granted and we are niggardly in according an equally high
place to the critic. If we say cabbage is as important as potato in the
kitchen, the implication is that the potato’s importance is above dispute
(hence the Essay on <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City>
under the caption Potatoes) and the claims of the cabbage, in the writer’s
view, are high though not generally recognized; the statement is like special
pleading. The critical power is, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arnold</st1:place></st1:City>
declared roundly, of lower rank than the creative. Some may relent towards the
critic grudgingly and concede that he is important but not as important as the
poet. If the child were to say: My father is important in the house when mother
is away, the father need not feel aggrieved; he should thank God for having at
least secondary importance when there was the risk of complete annihilation as
in Gardiner’s essay <i>The Carriage Window. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

adorer of poets may even argue that the critic is <span class=GramE>not only
not important</span> but is even a drag, a nuisance. Then comes the rub: You praise
one as a Hercules and your opponent denies that he is even a human being and
remarks that he is a rat and you retort: If he is a rat, you are a mouse. An
academic controversy becomes an interesting Bestiary of abuse. A champion of
criticism opposing the advocate of poets may assert that the critic is more
important than the poet. No criticism, no poetry–is his war cry and he is ready
for scalping. We have funny notions about a critic and funnier ones about a
poet. We envisage a kind of blood feud between the critic and the poet.
Creative activity is defiant of critical ‘bossing’; hot blood leaps over a cold
decree. It is even suggested that great periods of creation are followed by
periods of criticism; the ebb of creation is the tide of criticism and we
forget Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Arnold and others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
hear such statements: Has any one succeeded in writing a competent tragedy by a
study of Aristotle’s Poetics? Does one become an excellent cook by reading a
book on cookery or obtain the love of a woman by <span class=SpellE>memorising</span>
<span class=SpellE>Vatsayana</span>? <span class=SpellE>Quintilian</span> said
long ago that a treatise on agriculture does not yield a bumper harvest and a
booklet ‘How to do it yourself’ on swimming does not keep one afloat on the
waters. We are reminded of Richards’ observation that we become poets by
ordering our <span class=SpellE>experiennce</span>, not by mastering a
technique. We thus reduce the critic to a portentous budget of Do’s and <span
class=SpellE>Dont’s</span> which invariably make or mar poetry. To be
polemically successful we forget the Poetics is derived from the Greek Drama
and that rules by themselves are not the forbidden fruit that brings death into
the world of art. In the age of science we are not justified in <span
class=SpellE>criticising</span> critical canons. P. A. W. Collins points out
justly: This process of formulating rules is analogous to the scientist’s
generalizing after observing many particular instances….No literary critics
denied that poets needed nature (inborn abilities) as well as Art (which
included a knowledge of the rules) but they thought that in poetry as in
science ‘Well begun is half done’. The rules by themselves do not part the
waves as a treatise on music does not make one sing. Addison wrote: (Spectator;
592) who would not read one of Shakespeare’s plays where there is not a single
rule of the stage observed than any production of a modern critic where there
is not one of them violated. Shakespeare is the great In Spite Of. This
attitude is ungenerous and meaningless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

critic is also described as a frustrated poet who wreaks vengeance by damning all
poets just as a male scorned by a woman damns all women as riotous mares. Such
a frustrated poet will do well to follow Wilde’s advice and join the conspiracy
of silence. The story of the tailless fox is enacted and the limping <span
class=SpellE>Hephaistos</span> jeers at the straight-legged Ares. There is one
sort of criticism, says <span class=GramE>Maugham, that</span> is evidently
futile. This is that which is written by the critic to compensate himself for
humiliations he has suffered in his early years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

function of the critic is viewed in various ways. Criticism is a spiritual
adventure, and is creation based on creation, and it has autonomous existence.
It is valuable in itself as secondary or derivative inspiration. “Who, again,
cares whether Mr. <span class=SpellE>Pater</span> has put into the portrait of
Mona Lisa <span class=GramE>something<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>that</span> Leonardo never dreamed of...And so the picture becomes more
wonderful to us than it really is and reveals to us a secret of which, in
truth, it knows nothing and the music of the mystical prose is as sweet in our
ears as was the flute player’s music that lent to the lips of La <span
class=SpellE>Gioconda</span> those subtle and poisonous curves.” (Oscar Wilde:
The Critic as Artist) It is dangerous for the critic, writes Maugham, to look
upon his activity as creative. His business is to guide, to appraise and to point
to new avenues of creation. (The Summing Up) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

critic is the interpreter of literature. Honestly speaking, not many have the
capacity of grasping a great poet; as has been caustically said, we have a
tongue in our mouth, not in our minds and that is unfortunate. A great critic
is as rare as a great poet and Dissociation of Sensibility is as capital a
contribution to the vocabulary of criticism as ‘It beggared all description’ is
to the vocabulary of poetry. The jocular statement is made that Shakespeare
failed in the paper on <span class=SpellE>Shakesperian</span> Tragedy because
he did not study Bradley. There is the popular saying: What does the father
know of his daughter? It is son-in-law who knows her. There is close similarity
between this popular saying and Shaw’s retort when asked to comment: How should
I know? I am only their author. Browning once asked by a friend to explain his
poem, as the story goes, observed: At the time of composing the poem two
persons knew its meaning: God and Browning. Now God alone knows its meaning. It
is not a funny anecdote but an important statement made by Prof. Abercrombie in
his <i>Principles. </i>He begins with the story of Socrates approaching some
poets for an explanation of their poems and they expressed their inability.
These anecdotes posit a separate critical activity. Criticism is the last <span
class=GramE>reward<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>of</span> consummate
scholarship. It is harder to be a critic than to be a poet. At twenty one can
afford to be a poet but it is only at forty one can achieve criticism. In the
words of Dr. Johnson in the <i>Preface to Shakespeare:</i> As among the works
of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high without the
knowledge of many mountains and many rivers. So in the production of genius
nothing can be styled excellent till it has been compared with other works of
the same kind.” The poet can be viewed either as a deliberate and conscious
artist or as a reed rough which music blows, that is, an unconscious artist who
does not know what he is doing. That is why poetry is defined as an irrational
faculty, as even madness. Not even the greatest poet can say: I will compose
poetry at 8 a. m., just as he can say: I will have my breakfast at 8 a. m. How
the smell of the cooking egg, the hum of the typewriter and a page of Spinoza
get unified is a mystery and lies on the Road to <span class=SpellE>Xanadu</span>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far we have assumed that the critical and the creative are two separate and
distinct activities. The critic may be as important as the poet or the poet may
be as important as the critic; the assumption is presumptuous. What should be
emphasized is the truth that the poet and critic are one; the poet is the
critic and the critic is the poet. The first critic of a poem is the poet
himself. The first critic of <span class=SpellE>Lycidas</span> is the author of
<span class=SpellE>Lycidas</span>; the second critic is the chorus of <i>Samson
<span class=SpellE>Agonistes</span></i>; the third critic is the total poetry
of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City> and
still the fourth critic is the Greek and Hebrew poetry; <span class=SpellE>Tillyard</span>
is perhaps the fifth critic. The best commentary on Keats’ <i>The Nightingale
Ode </i>is not Middleton <span class=SpellE>Murry</span> but Keats’ <i>Ode on
the Grecian Urn;</i> the Nightingale and the Grecian Urn are one soul in two
bodies. Eliot profoundly remarked that the critical function operating in
poetry is far in advance of the critical function operating on poetry. This is
in complete agreement with what we find in Samskrit. Samskrit <span
class=SpellE>Alamkara</span> <span class=SpellE>sastra</span> refuses to draw
any distinction between the two functions; ‘<span class=SpellE>pratibha</span>’
is bifurcated into <span class=SpellE>karayitri</span> and <span class=SpellE>bhavayitri</span>.
The poet is a maker and the critic a man of discernment, as the etymology
points out. How can one<i> </i>be a maker if one is not a Person of
discernment? <span class=SpellE>Kavi</span> is a seer, a singer; <span
class=SpellE>sahridaya</span> is one who is identical with the poet. The best
description of a critic is<i> </i>the oft-quoted: <span class=SpellE><i>yesham</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>kavyanusilana</span> <span class=SpellE>abhayasavasat</span>
<span class=SpellE>visadibhute</span> <span class=SpellE>manomukure</span> <span

class=GramE>te</span></span> <span class=SpellE>svahridayasamvadabhajah</span> <span
class=SpellE>sahrdayah</span>. </i>By the habit of contemplating great poems
the critic’s mind is enlarged and spotless like a mirror, meaning that his mind
is free from various prejudices that conflict with connoisseurship; he acquires
the capacity of being moved by what is described and finally becomes ‘<span
class=SpellE>oned</span>’ with the poet’s heart. A great Samskrit scholar
salutes this synthesis of <span class=SpellE>Sivaa</span> and Siva, mother and
father, woman and man, poet and critic, poetry and criticism, charm and
response, genius and taste, <span class=SpellE>kavi</span> and <span
class=SpellE>sahridaya</span> in a <span class=SpellE>sloka</span>: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That is why, one
surmises, Sanskrit literary criticism has always considered a poem not as the
unique product of a unique mind but as a unique object of unique, enjoyment;
that is, the emphasis is not on What mind created this poem (as Western
criticism always elaborates) but on How is this poem enjoyed; the dish as the
expression of the personality of a cook is ignored: dish as one meant for the
guest is discussed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

When there is identity of heart (<span class=SpellE>samana</span> dharma) in

time to time, every hundred years or so, it is desirable that some critic shall
appear to review the past of our literature and set the poets and the poems in
a new order, so wrote Eliot in<i> </i>the essay on Arnold. Today don’t we live
within the curve of Eliot’s critical idiom? He is entirely responsible for our present
attitude to the early poetic Drama, the <span class=SpellE>Metaphysicals</span>,
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City> and
Dryden. And who can do this except a major critic and poet? The critic is not
the enemy of the poet. <span class=SpellE>Bagehot</span> in his classic <i>The
English Constitution </i>remarked that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> coined the remarkable
expression: Her Majesty’s Opposition, calling with incredible political
generosity even the Opposition as Her Majesty’s. Such is the role of the critic
in the parliament of letters. The critic even adds to the poet. He gives no
less than he receives, lends as much as he borrows. “The poem,” wrote Eliot,
“if it is of any depth and complexity, will have meanings in it </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>concealed
from the author and should be capable of being read in many ways and with a
variety of emotional emphasis.” </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There is liberty of
interpreting. In this sense the critic is said to be richer than the poet.
Wilde, of course, exaggerates this liberty, ignoring blissfully the duty of
looking at the object as it really is: “Criticism treats the work of art simply
as a starting point for a new creation. It does not confine itself to
discovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final.” And
in this it is right, for the meaning of any beautiful created thing is, at
least, as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who
wrought it. Nay, it is rather the beholder who lends the beautiful thing its
myriad meanings and makes it <span class=SpellE>marvellous</span> for us and
sets it in some new relation to our age so that it becomes a vital portion of
our lives…..For when the work is finished it has as it were an independent life
of its own and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its
lips to say.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

two citations, the one sober and the other exaggerated, prove that the critic
is not a derivative parasitical hanger-on. Criticism can be as creative as
poetry. “It is undeniable,” writes <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arnold</st1:place></st1:City>,
“that the exercise of a creative power, that a free creative activity is the
true function of man; it is proved to be so by man’s finding in it his true
happiness. But it is undeniable also that man may have the sense of exercising
the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

works of literature or art; if it were not so all but a very few men would be
shut out from the true happiness of all men; they may have it in well-doing,
they may have it in learning, they may have it even in criticizing.” Who shall
say that Dr. Johnson’s <i>Preface </i>is less creative than his <i>Vanity of
Human wishes? </i>To deny creativity to criticism is to deprive creativity of
its vast estate. Just as in Language the word is said to be more and less than
the object for which it is a symbol, the critic too is more and less than the
poet–less that he fails to capture the first fine careless rapture, more that
he reacts in his unique way. The power to create, the power to enjoy, the power

</i>Criticism is considered in various ways, the enemy of creation, or itself
creation, or the pioneer of creation, or the interpretation of creation,
diachronically and synchronically, subjective or objective. The great critic,
writes Maugham in <i>The Summing Up, </i>should have sympathy as wide as his
knowledge is universal He must be a psychologist and physiologist...he must be
a philosopher. He must be familiar not only with the literature of his native
land...He must support himself on tradition. In fact a great critic must be a
great man. Max Eastman remarked that one who attempts literary criticism
without a diploma in psychology should be jailed at once; it shows how
well-equipped the critic has to be. As Forster points out, a critic has no
right to the narrowness which is the frequent prerogative of the creative
artist (Aspects of the Novel).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Chinese language is different from Indian or
European languages in that it has no alphabet. It has as many characters as
there are words. These characters originated from pictographs. The total number
of characters today is about fifty thousand. Dr. Lin Yu-tang has stated that
there are only about seven scholars in modern China who could read all these
characters. In the ancient classics there are about five thousand different
characters, mostly pictorial. About eight to nine thousand characters are used
today by the Chinese public. In printing houses about six thousand is all that
is found necessary for newspapers and books of general interest. A knowledge of
f<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt'>our thousand characters would be
sufficient for reading Chinese newspapers. All these characters are
monosyllabic. The spoken langu</span>age differs greatly from the written. Of
the spoken language, the Man<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt'>darin or
Kuan-Hua was first spoken by the officials at Peking. The standardised form of
the Peking </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt'>dialect is called
Kuo-Yu or the National language, now understood and spoken by almost all the
educated </span>people of modern China.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>China
may be divided into six linguistic areas in which about seventy dialects are
said to be spoken. The Mandarin area was estimated to have covered
three-fourths of China and her population. Peking and Nanking dialects,
formerly the two divisions of the Northern Mandarin, are closely related, while
the difference between Peking dialect and Cantonese, according to Prof. John De
Francis, is as great as between Italian and Spanish or between English and
Dutch. All these dialects have a common origin and the same script.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

written language is even more unique than the spoken. Pictographic in origin,
it Contained six hundred signs at the beginning. These signs are the
fundamental characters in Chinese writing. Some 214 of them have been named
‘radicals’ because they are the elements of the current language. Every word
and every idea has its own separate sign. Characters represented ideas. But
language reformers have overlaid the pictorial element with additions designed
to define the term specifically, usually through the indication of the sound.
“This system of writing.” says Will Durant, “is in every sense a high
intellectual achievement; it classified the whole world–of objects, activities
and qualities–under a few hundred roots or ‘radical signs’, combined with </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>these
signs some fifteen hundred distinguishing marks, and made them represent, in
their completed forms, all the ideas used in literature and life.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

missionaries who arrived in China during the 16th century were confronted with
the difficulties of learning the Chinese language. They, therefore, introduced
phonetic transcription of Chinese in Roman characters. These missionaries did
not intend to do away completely with the Chinese characters, but they wanted
to make their studies of the Chinese language easier through Romanisation. A
section of Chinese intellectuals looked at Romanisation with disfavour, but
many others evinced great interest in the alphabetisation of Chinese.
Protestant missionaries who came later also did much work in this direction.
Meanwhile, the Chinese intellectuals themselves launched a country-wide
movement of language reform called the National Language Romanisation–the
Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Different systems of alphabetisation were introduced by
Chinese and European linguists, either for promoting literacy or for making the
study of Chinese easier for foreigners. One such Romanisation,–the Yale
system–was created in 1943 largely through the efforts of Prof. George A.
Kennedy of the United States. An earlier system is the Wade system created by
an English linguist. These are evidently meant to speed up the study of Chinese
language among the illiterate or foreign beginners. But the script must be
learnt separately. It is the key to Chinese literature, both, ancient and </span><span

script and language are not difficult to learn in the sense in which all
foreign languages are construed by devoted students. By constant practice, any
difficult language could be learnt by any person. It all depended on the system
of teaching, the devotion of the student and the ability of the teacher who
conducted the classes. This is absolutely impossible without the aid of a
trained Chinese teacher. To learn the thousands of characters or even five
thousands and the spoken Peking dialect in its correct pronunciation would
normally take about ten to fifteen years, and a complete mastery of all the
characters would require about twenty-five years. A student studying a single
Indian script and language like Sanskrit, Tamil or Malayalam is in a more
advantageous position to master most of the spoken languages and scripts of
India than a student who is required to master a foreign script and language
like Chinese or Greek. It is easier for an Indian student to master the Indian
languages than for a Chinese to master his own script and the different
dialects spoken in China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
study of Chinese language is not a prerequisite for acquiring knowledge of
Chinese history, religion and literature, for most of the classics both ancient
and modern could be read in their English renderings brought out by eminent
Chinese and European savants. There are countless publications in English
dealing with every aspect of China –political, social, religious, historical,
linguistic,–and its art and literature. English literature on China is so vast
and varied that one should spend a life-time for ransacking it entirely. A
systematic study of these books, which in itself is a distinct education, would
normally take about ten years. But proficiency in language and script will be
immensely helpful in reading the originals and to further develop one’s wealth
of knowledge on China. Anyway, language study is an essential factor for
understanding China in true perspective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
cannot but pay tributes to European scholars who devoted themselves to Chinese
studies for several years. It was mainly due to their labours that we, Indians,
have come to know the glories of Ancient China, her enduring culture and
civilization, her three thousand years </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>old history and
linguistics. European scholars have taken to Chinese studies in all
earnestness, probing deep into her mysteries and unearth</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ing
many secrets hitherto unknown to the outside world. Western educated Chinese
have also proved equal to the task of interpreting China to us. Even the Oracle
Bone Inscriptions of the Shang dynasty have been deciphered by Chinese scholars
shedding more light on early Chinese civilization. The West can take pride in a
Giles, Brandt, Rockhill, Karlgren, Beal and Watters,–masters of Chinese script
and language; but India, despite her two thousand years old cultural relations,
has not produced a single scholar in modern times who can rightly claim the
title of Master in Chinese language and in its script. There are a few students
these days who have taken to Chinese studies. But they have to pursue their
studies for years before they obtain some knowledge of the script and the
language. The Government of India sent some of these students to China for
language studies, and they returned to India after two years. They learnt the
Chinese language for two years through the Yale system. Our knowledge of China
is lamentably superficial compared to the ocean of knowledge accumulated
Western scholars. In the olden days, there were several Indian monks who had
lived in China and learnt the language. They translated several Mahayanist
Buddhist Sanskrit texts into Chinese. The Sanskrit originals of these Buddhist
texts have been lost to India, either by the ravages of time or by foreign
invasions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

language reform movement in China initiated daring the early days of the
Chinese Republic is an important phase in the life of the Chinese nation
directed towards progress and national unity. Two names prominently associated
with the movement are those of Dr. Hu Shih and Mr. Y. C. James Yen. Hu Shih
advocated the adoption of the s</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

language for education and literary composition. China has one written
language, but two forms of literary composition, the classical and the plain.
The exponen</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ts of Pai-Hua contended that it was an effective
medium for educating the masses. James Yen inaugurated the Mass Education
Movement for promoting literacy by means of Thousand character lessons. Both
these reform movements received official support but lacked, popular approval.
Opponents contended that the Chinese characters were unsuited for mass
education. Hu Shih himself later admitted that the Pai Hua had merely been of
help to a few intellectuals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
the struggle between various groups of language reformers was in progress,
Chinese intellectuals in the Soviet Union created a new Chinese alphabet in the
Latinised script called the Sin-Wenz. It was first introduced among the Chinese
in Russia. Text-books were also published in the Sin-Wenz. This movement
gradually spread among the masses in Nationalist China. But the Government
interdicted it and confiscated its literature. Many of its leaders were
arrested and imprisoned. One of its top-rank leaders was shot dead by
reactionaries. However, the Sin-Wenz movement won the enthusiastic support of
popular leaders and litterateurs like the late celebrated Lu Hsun, the great
master of Chinese ideographs in modern China. Lu Hsun strongly advocated the
adoption of Sin-Wenz, or the New Writing as it is called in China. He also
demanded Latinisation of all regional languages for the speedy elimination of
illiteracy. Lu Hsun had said that if the ideographs were not destroyed, China
would surely perish. Several years and much money were required to acquire some
knowledge of the Chinese script. The masses, Lu Hsun contended, worked for more
than thirteen hours a day and they had neither money nor time to learn the
Chinese characters. What the masses wanted was a new phonetic writing, a new
writing without the nuisance of tones, a new writing that dealt with all the
regional languages. Sin-Wenz, Lu-Hsun asserted, met these requirements. This
movement, therefore, received the unstinted support of several intellectuals
including Madam Sun Yat-Sen, Dr. Sun-Fo, Dr. Hu Shih, Mr. Ko Mo-Joe, the late
Tsai Yuan-Pei and Dr. H. C. Chen, a veteran educationist of Hongkong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two-fold object of the language reform movement in China as in India is the
elimination of illiteracy and the strengthening of national unity. Of the
forty-five crores of Chinese, over ninety per cent are illiterate even today.
Therefore, the Latinxua and the Sin-Wenz may ultimately influence the
linguistic policy of the new Communist Government, although it is yet too early
to say anything about it. With the probable adoption of Sin-Wenz in Communist
China, Soviet Russia’s literary and cultural conquest of China would become a
reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

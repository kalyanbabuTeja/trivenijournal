<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Translation,
they say, is a necessary evil, rather like a woman, adds the male wit, who
never lets go the chance to have a fling at the fair sex. As of woman too, it
can be said of a translation that what is beautiful is not always faithful and <i>vice
versa! </i>Here for once, at any rate, the critic or the reader cannot sing
with Keats that Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty. All the hurdles
notwithstanding, there is no getting away from the fact that we can hardly do
with-out translation in a country like ours, with 15 major languages, besides
English, not to speak of many more not recognised, for official purposes, in
the Indian Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Any
number of Indian classics there are, modern as well as ancient, that call for
rendering into a common language like English or Hindi, for the benefit of
those who do not happen to know the original. There is no fighting shy of it,
taking shelter under the too familiar argument that the beauty of the original
masterpiece is lost. It is no doubt lost in many cases, and to a regrettable
extent. . But the consolation is from what remains after what is inevitably
lost. The Nobel Prize, it is well to remember, was awarded to Tagore on the
strength of the English version of <i>Gitanjali </i>and it must have retained
something of the poet Tagore in it. Bengali seems to be </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
and large, better served in its English translations than any other Indian
language. Almost all the works of Tagore have been available in fairly
satisfactory translations, some of which are done by Krishna Kriplani, who made
a notable success of <i>Binodini </i>in the English version. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most recent of the Tagore novels to be presented in English is <i>Chaturanga, </i>one
of his shortest and most powerful pieces in longer fiction. The translation,
competently done by Asok Mitra, is published by the Sahitya Akademi. In this
novel Tagore evokes an eventful period of about half-a-century in the social
and political life of Bengal. Unforgettable characters like Swami Vivekananda,
Sister Nivedita and Pandit Ishwarachandra Vidyasagar make their appearance in
recognisable forms. ‘The Uncle’ in the story, a saintly atheist, god-like in
his disposition, comes to the reader with all the power of a Greek catharsis.
Damini is almost the female principle incarnate, compelling, unpredictable, but
truly inexorable. (What a shape Damini was in, the next morning! It seemed as
though the storm of the night before had left the terrible dance of death on
this woman alone.) The translator has tried his utmost to capture the mystic
grandeur of the original. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vigil </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is also a translation from a Bengali novel–a
comparatively modern one, depicting the struggle of a patriotic Indian family
in the early Forties (following the August movement of 1942). It is the story
of a headmaster who had given up his job in the Freedom movement earlier, and
his wife and two sons, one of whom, Bilu, is awaiting the death sentence in the
jail. The story is told, not in the conventional form of a connected narrative,
but in the shape of musings by the convicted youth (Bilu), the ‘Father’, and
the ‘Mother’, and the younger brother Nilu, who does not see eye to eye with
the elder. The account is brimful of suspense and every line has a vivid sense
of detail and helps to create the atmosphere. Mrs. Lila Ray’s translation reads
well, as she has obviously done her best to put it in good English idiom without
quite losing the flavour and inflexion of the Bengali speech. The local colour
peeps through the pages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the, best-loved classics of Sanskrit love poetry is Jaya Deva’s <i>Gita
Govinda, </i>which stands midway between a lyric and a drama. The music and
suggestiveness of the original have been the despair of aspiring translators.
Not surprising that the sensitive artist from Ceylon, George Keyt, should have
been attracted to this poem of love, but that he should translate it in metre
and rhyme, as well as in line and colour. The pity of it is that his verse, for
all its sophistication, can hardly reach the tenderness and lyrical beauty of
the lines, which have a sensuous fullness and rounded perfection about them.
All the same, the book (now in its second edition) does drive the reader to the
matchless original. Another Sanskrit classic, of a different genre though, has
been available in an authoritative English translation. The American scholar
Dr. Franklin Edgerton’s version of the <i>Panchatantra </i>is now reissued in a
hard cover edition, after the lapse of many years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a democracy the elected representatives of the people constitute the supreme
Legislative authority, both at the State and the Union level. Legislative power
essentially rests with the Parliament. Yet, a lot more has to be done after
placing a piece of legislation on the statute book. There are bound to arise doubts
and difficulties in working out details, procedural and otherwise, when putting
the law in actual operation. The administrator who is in constant touch with
the working of the various laws, therefore, has to be invested with certain
powers to remove difficulties and to facilitate the smooth and effective
working of the laws. Government enjoined with the supreme task of
administration for the maximum good of the people functions through its three
limbs–the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. In the coordinated
working of these three institutions lies the merit of any administration. For
the smooth and efficient discharge of their respective functions, the Executive
and the Judiciary also are invested with certain rule-making powers. That which
is essentially a legislative function cannot be delegated by the Legislature to
any other body. The power of the Legislature to legislate is not an unlimited
power. It is subject to judicial scrutiny where the question of <i>vires </i>is
involved. If there is excessive use of the power in a given case, the
particular piece of Legislation will be struck down by the judiciary as <i>ultra
vires. </i>The same is the case with the power of the Executive or even the
Judiciary itself. There are instances where the High Court, having issued an
administrative instruction or having made a rule under its rule-making power,
held that the instruction or the rule was wrong when </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
matter was subjected to judicial scrutiny. Quite apart from occasions where
certain rules or regulations flowing from delegated legislation have been held
to be bad, there can be no gainsaying the fact that in a country where the aim
is the establishment of a Democratic society based on Socialistic principles,
there must be decentralisation of powers to a large extent. To ensure that
basic justice is not sacrificed in a speedy attempt to do good to the people,
in some states, committees of suitable persons are constituted as Subordinate
Legislation Committees. They make a preliminary survey of the need and scope of
Subordinate Legislation in a given case. After a process of screening made by
these committees, the Subordinate Legislation is pushed through. At the apex
there is the Judiciary to scrutinise the validity of any rule or set of rules
when the question is raised before it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

subject of delegated legislation which has in the present set up of things
assumed great importance needs a proper understanding Sri Chandrasekharan has
dealt with a vast subject in a narrow compass, compressing his vast knowledge
into a book of about 100 pages. Both in style and substance the author has
exhibited great skill. In presenting the subject in a clear and comprehensive
manner, the author has referred to the system obtaining in the United Kingdom,
the United States and in our own country. It is particularly significant to
notice that the author has not, in this small book, missed any important
detail. The book which is both informative and instructive is, therefore, bound
to be of great use and guidance, not merely to the practising lawyer but to the
legislator and to the members of the committees on Subordinate Legislation as
well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Prakasa says that the last days of the creator of Pakistan, Jinnah, were
apparently unhappy. He did not expect the exodus and the violence after
partition. Liaquat Ali was a “great gentleman.” Ghulam Mohammad was

(with a capital ‘L’) has been a dying force the world over, for some decades
now. It had its heyday in India as<b> </b>well as in England during the latter
half of the last century and the first quarter of this. In this country, this
hot house plant was swept away in the flood of the Gandhian movement in the
struggle for freedom. It had actually begun to wilt and wither when the
inspiration and nourishment its Indian protagonists hoped to draw from their
British mentors like Morley proved far from rejuvenating. The most unshakable
of the Indian liberals began to realise that it was quite in order for the most
admirable of the political exemplars of Liberalism at home (in Britain) to be
no better than the worst of imperialist diehards abroad (in India and
elsewhere). The fatal blow to their self-confidence was more devastating than
the blows to follow from their opponents. Their defeat was moral before it
became political. It was, however, a pity that we have had to lose, in the
process, much of what was of real value in the liberal tradition. This great
tradition was represented in public and private life by no other leader more
completely than by Sir P. S. Sivaswami Aiyar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

His decision to sell away his palatial residence “Sudharma” to find the

Intellectual integrity and accuracy of thought (and expression) were his chief
characteristics, all succinctly pointed out by Dr. Kunzru. He chose to place
truth in the first place rather than in the second, and his indifference to
popularity could be easily understood against this background. His habitual
moderation in everything was apt to be mistaken for diffidence and deliberate
abstention from emphasis taken for a sign of weakness. A perusal of this
volume, which has a high educative value, is sure to disabuse him of any false
impression and convince him of the sincerity and patriotism of the great
liberal. It is carefully compiled, but could have been better edited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the uninitiated reader, making him think of a new and thought-provoking
research work of a seminal nature, the book under notice brings together a
number of indifferent articles on a variety of topical subjects contributed to
the daily press during the years 1960-’62. There are also here a few speeches
delivered by the author on the floor of Parliament as a member of the Upper
House. There is no discernable unity of theme in this collection, except that
all of them are about some problem or the other, related in some way to modern
India. Not even that could be said, in all accuracy, as a few of them happen to
be about Malaya and Malaysia, which the author has had an opportunity to visit
on an official mission. </p>

commonplace and pedestrian. The complaint against him is not that he is not
thoughtful or persuasive, but involved and infelicitous. He is rather a
publicist, anxious to focus attention on some important issues, than a real
journalist who can hold attention or provoke a train of thought. What would be
a personal scrapbook of press cuttings has assumed the impressive shape of a
well got up book, thanks to the reputed publishers who specialise in the

behave that imparts to these playlets the quality of authentic social realism.

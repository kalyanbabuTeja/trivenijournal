mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>WE were seated, the three of us, one December
night, round a fire in front of Forest Officer Annappa’s tent, speeding in easy
talk the time between dinner and bed. I am the Distrret Medical Officer of
Rudranagar. My friend Dr. Narayana Rao, M.Sc., Ph.D., is Professor of Geology
in our College. He and I were classmates in the University College and took our
M. Sc. the same year. After taking the Degree I went to the Medical College,
and Narayana Rao went to Europe for his Doctorate in Geology. On his return he
was appointed a University Professor, and posted to Rudranagar College, and
thus it happened that we could recapture our old intimacy. We usually met at
the Club on working days, and when holidays approached, we put our heads
together to plan for spending them in a sort as unlike our daily work as
possible. When Christmas came, we had decided to spend a week or ten days in
the Ghat forests, shooting. When we broached the scheme, to the District Forest
Officer, Mr. Annappa, he fell in with it quite enthusiastically, took on
himself all the arrangements, and would not hear but we should be his guests.
And so we started.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Well, the shooting expedition must be pronounced a
success. That is to say, we had good food, plenty of exercise, excellent talk,
and companionship, sound sleep, romantic camping in beautiful forests. We
injured no living thing. Eager as we were to encounter game, we invariably were
on the spot a few hours or days after ferocious tigers, cunning panthers, and
other beasts of prey had left, but the place was alive with thrilling vestiges
of their recent presence,–spoors, droppings, etc.–which were pointed out to us
with ample expatiation. We usually left our camp each morning after an early
breakfast, worthy of the strenuous sportsmen we were, walked up hill and down
dale, into deep forest glades, and along pebbly streams, listening to the
shikar-lore of our <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lambanis</i> and
forest guards, persuading ourselves that we had learnt to distinguish between
trails and marks that looked the same, till the sun was high in the heavens,
and our breakfast had faded into a memory, and our rifles had grown intolerably
heavy; and then we went back to camp–no, not at the old place, but shifted to a
new and if possible lovelier spot by stream or lake in immemorial forest there
to take a good and well earned meal which disposed us to rest during the hot
afternoon hours on camp beds under shady trees. Then again we would resume in
the evening the interrupted labours of the day–and so earn a dinner worthy of
the appetite we brought to it. After dinner we used to go out and gather round
a camp fire in easy tobacco nourished talk till drowsiness weighed down words
and indicated bed. Is there anything here to which the greatest stickler for <i>Ahimsa
</i>could object? I love to think that this was the kind of life that the <i>rishis
</i>of old lived in Dandakaranya!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what I mean. To the man who loves forests and lives with them sharing their
springtime gladness, and their pangs in summer, and who can join with them in
their monsoon festival–to such a man the spirit reveals herself. She whispers

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>That reminded me of a thing which made me smile. In
my prentice days, it was my good fortune to work in the Victoria Hospital under
a great surgeon who was second to none in his profession, and whose fame
attracted to him patients from far and near. He gave his mind with such fierce
concentration to the disease that very often he had none to spare for the
patient, and it sometimes happened that though he had an excellent memory for
the one, he had no recollection of the other. Well it chance that this guru of
mine had, years ago, earned the gratitude of a rich Natukkottai Chettiyar by a
skilful operation. Once again the poor plutocrat had the same trouble–a
fistula–and once again he came to my guru for relief. Holding out his hands in
salutation he said in a voice frothy with gush: “Here I am again doctor, don’t
you remember me?”–but my master didn’t, but turned on him the cold eyes of an
utter stranger and said only: “Well, let us see your trouble.” And he did; and
then ah! recognition came on him in a flash. He turned his patient round shook
him warmly by the hand and said: “Oh, Mr. Shanmugam! How is every one at home,
sir? It is beastly this thing should trouble you again, but we shall soon put
you right; never fear.” This was a special faculty of identification of men not
unlike Mr. Annappa’s of forests. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was six years ago that the thing I am going to
tell happened–happened to me, I mean. I had passed my M. Sc. The big problem
was what to do next. One thing I had made up my mind about–I would take a
Doctorate in Geology in any case. It occurred to me I couldn’t do better to
start with than prospecting in our ghat region. If I made a careful scientific
survey, and prepared a map of the occurrence of ores of industrial value, not
only would I have first-hand material for my Doctorate thesis, but, who knows?
it might help me to find congenial employment if big capital was interested in
my researches, and an industry was started in consequence. Besides, it was my
profession, the work which interested me most in life, and field work in the
ghat regions did not cost a great deal–did not require much more than a good
grounding in Geology which I had, and sound health and enthusiasm for work
which also I had. I had always liked going about in forests, and here I could
combine business and pleasure. So I thought, and presently put my scheme under
way. I equipped myself with the tools of my trade,–hammer, chisel, magnifying
glass, compass, topo sheets, and all–which I carried in a strong canvas bag
over my shoulder, provided myself with stout clothes and boots suited for rough
wear, and a good walking stick, and started on my expedition. I travelled by
rail as far as it could take me on my way, and then with a stout heart plunged
on foot into the forests of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>malnad<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>,</b></i> with no other guide than a
compass in one pocket and a topo-sheet in the other. This was my daily
programme: follow interesting indications till noon, collecting specimens with
hammer and chisel; at noon make my way to the nearest village, and claim the
hospitality of the chief inhabitant for food and a place to rest in; start
again in the afternoon at about four o’clock and work till dusk; then return
either to the same village, or to go to another if it happened to be nearer,
for the night. As you know a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>malnad</i>
village is just a cluster of maybe half a dozen houses–more often than not
belonging to one expanded household–the <i>sahukar </i>and his <i>jeetals </i>or
agrestic labourers. Ignorant of <i>malnad </i>tradition, I first offered to pay
for my entertainment, but none would hear of it; and some took deep offence
till they realised I was but an ignorant plainsman and knew no better; and then
they forgave me my bad mariners and made me welcome. Then it was only a matter
of entering some village home at mealtime unbidden, with the certainty of a
cordial welcome, and such cheer as the house afforded–it was enough that you
were a stranger and hungry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I wandered about in this manner for many days. One
evening; more tired than usual, I climbed my way to the rocky crest of an
incline, and after a satisfying pull at my water bottle, sat idly looking down
into the valley where a vast ocean of green forest lay before me billowing in
the breeze far as eye could see. It grew to sunset. The beauty of the evening
entered and filled my very being, and made me insensible to the flight of time.
To me the West, red with the expiring day, became a Kurukshetra where of old
our best and bravest fell, and a Yuga crashed in ruin. Lines from the
Mahabharata rose unbidden to my mind–and presently the hero Karna’s father sank
in a welter of bloodstained clouds–the rack it seemed of a lost battle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

start. Good God! it was late, and soon it would be dark, and I was at least
three miles away from Adumbi, where I meant to go for the night. I must get
there somehow before it got too dark. I started up from my rock, and coming
down to the woods, turned my face in the direction where I believed Adumbi to
lie, and made what speed I could. Night falls swiftly in those mighty forests,
and it was presently quite dark. You are no doubt aware of this curious thing
about losing yourself in a forest–whichever way you turn, that seems to be the
right way for you; you get the illusion of walking along limitless avenues. I
struck a match and consulted my pocket compass, but since I did not know where
I was, the compass told me nothing to the purpose. And matches were precious.
One hears people who rather fancy themselves for poetical expression talk of
the silent midnight woods. What utter rubbish! At night every tree gives its
particular voice to the wind, boisterous or grave, joyful or sad. There you
are–I am just repeating Annappa, amn’t I?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to see. The very stars were hid by the unbroken canopy of mingling treetops.
Trees, trees, on every side–making a man feel so small and such a stranger in
the midst of all their vigorous life! And presently I could hear furtive
movements, low growls, as the denizens of that forest woke to their usual
lives. I could not see them, but they could of course see me. The thought
filled me with a creeping sense of animal fear–perhaps the submerged inheritance
of some far off past. I felt it was no use my groping my way about any further;
I had better seek some convenient tree and spend the night sheltered in its
branches. But those trees! The most of them were too big and too sheer in the
bole for me to get grip or foothold for a climb. At last I came to one which in
the light of my last match seemed more hopeful and hospitable than the rest;
with infinite toil and after many slips I worked my way up it to the place
where the trunk forked into the main branches and settled myself in the small
landing there as comfortably as I could. Tired and overwrought I was soon fast
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I don’t know how long I slept. I woke up suddenly.
My sleep could not have been sound owing to my cramped position, and the pain in
a side of my hip which had to bear all my weight. It was a tramp of hoofs which
broke my sleep. In the east, through the interspaces of trees, I glimpsed a
thin moon some fathoms up the sky. The hoof-beats approached, and seemed
passing right underneath my tree–and presently a cavalier rode into my view
along the path just in front of me. He was on a great <i>Mandesh </i>horse, bay
in colour so far as I could make out in the struggling light. Oh! the pride of
its port! It carried its head high with an arrogant curve like that of a
cobra’s angry hood, and moved with a high-stepping action as though in scorn of
the earth it trod. Was it pride of its own race, and strength and beauty, or,
was it the consciousness of the noble rider it bore? I couldn’t then see the virile
beauty of his face, but I was struck with his breadth of chest, his gallant
bearing, and the easy mastery which made his great horse a limb of himself. He
wore a riding coat and a turban like what one sees in pictures of Sivaji. From
a belt which passed over his right shoulder, there hung by his left thigh a
sword of the <i>talwar </i>type. I could see all this as the horse went past at
a swift walk. I rubbed my eyes, and watched the rider and horse as they passed,
wondering if it was not all a dream–the get-up seemed so fantastic and unlike
truth. And besides, what could any sensible man be doing riding at midnight in
a dense forest? While I was puzzling over this, the rider passed out of my
sight into the trees. Then it occurred to me that this man was surely going to
some town or village he knew, and if I was wise, and followed him, I could
escape spending the rest of the night in tapas doubled up in the fork of that
god-forsaken tree. Also, being within hail of an armed fellow-man, who however
funnily tricked up, did not look a thug, seemed preferable to solitary sojourn
amidst beasts of prey. I slid down my tree, and though by this time the
cavalier was out of sight, I had no difficulty in guiding myself by the
hoof-falls of his steed. After we had gone about a mile, the forest thinned a
little, and I could see the rider and horse again, and could keep easily in
their wake, without approaching too closely. So for two miles more, and then
across a small stream; and I caught a glimmer of lights amidst trees on a
rising bit of ground. To judge from the space covered by the lights that
twinkled here and there, it must have been a town of some size. My cavalier
entered that town, and I did likewise behind him. Some dogs barked, and that
brought a couple of armed men from somewhere, who interposed their spears
across the street, and cried–Halt! My cavalier bent forward, and saying
something I couldn’t catch, took something out of his belt or pocket and gave
it to them, at which they respectfully saluted and fell back. I went on too
unhindered, for they must have taken me for his servant. I saw one watchman
whispering to his companion, who threat turned round in surprise and stared at
the horseman. And then I heard them laugh a little, as I passed on. That town,
big as it was, and rich to judge from some of the houses I passed, must have
been wretchedly served by its municipality if it had one, for there were no
street lamps, and even the main thoroughfare was dark in the shadow of the tall
houses, and the air was noisome with neglected sanitation. Presently my
cavalier turned into a lane, and alighting in front of a house, made his horse
fast by the reins to a pillar which supported a sort of porch. At first he
knocked at the door without response, but after a while, I could see a glimmer
inside and footsteps approaching the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

blood which welling out from a long wound on his head had flowed down his face,
matting his hair, eyebrows and moustache. His sword was stained with blood; and
its hilt seemed glued to his grip with clotted gore. Strong and grim he looked,

shifting must have precipitated me down. And this soul-stirring drama of love

slipping from my perch and knocking my head against a clod or stone! I sat up

of what once had been walls. I must have hurt my head in falling against one
such reminder of the past which was right under my tree of shelter. My hammer

Tavarekote was an important ‘buffer’ palyapat as you might now call it, between
Vijayanagar and Bijapur. The Pallegar helped or betrayed as it suited him both
the Maharaja and the Sultan, and while the going was good, feathered his nest
petty comfortably from both; but he was never trusted by either. It is a
dangerous kind of prosperity this; and a turn of luck means utter destruction.
Well, his number was up at midnight on Ashada Bahula Panchami and Randhula Khan
the Bijapur General overwhelmed Tavarekote utterly with fire and sword and left
not a soul alive, man, woman, or child. The cause is not clear-but it is
believed that Randhula Khan had proof that the Pallegar was plotting with
Vijayanagar for a surprise attack on Bijapur. The purana says that the midnight
tragedy of Tavarekote in all its horror and pity will be revealed as in a
picture to any person, who born under a particular star spends in lonely vigil
the night of Ashada Bahula Panch ami on the site of that unhappy town. That is
what the purana says but nobody to my knowledge has tested the truth of it.

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not usual for an Editor to take his readers into confidence and tell them about the finances of his journal. But then, <I>Triveni </I>has run a very unusual course; for one reason or another, its difficulties have been widely advertised. In times of stress, economic and political, cultural enterprises inevitably suffer. The editing of a journal like <I>Triveni </I>is a great privilege, but it involves enormous strain. The lack of a little working capital has all along interfered with the normal progress of <I>Triveni.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nearly every number has been delayed far beyond the appointed date, and in April 1932, it looked as if the Journal was collapsing. The final number for 1931 was published in June 1932. There was obviously no sense in trying to bring out the January-February number in July or August. We therefore took a desperate step and announced that the Triveni year would run from July to June, instead of from January to December. This meant a virtual suspension of the Journal for six months, but there was a compensating advantage in that it held out a promise of regular publication after a temporary break.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even thus, the problem of providing the requisite working capital had to be solved; else, the old trouble might recur and the Journal be in perpetual arrears. A warm-hearted friend who insists on remaining <I>incognito, </I>suggested a scheme and worked strenuously to materialise it. The following announcement, sent to the Press on August 16, explains the nature of the help rendered to <I>Triveni </I>at a critical stage:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With a view to stabilise the <I>Triveni </I>and ensure its regular publication, fifteen of its ardent supporters have undertaken to advance a sum of Three Thousand Rupees for the time being, and several of them met today at the residence and under the presidency of Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar. Among those present were Messrs. T. R. Venkatarama Sastri, C.I.E., V. Govindarajachari, N. S, Srinivasa Aiyar, K. Chandrasekharan and P. N. Appuswami. On the motion of Mr. T. R. Venkatarama Sastri, Messrs, P. N. Appuswami Aiyar and K. Chandrasekhara Aiyar were appointed Treasurers. Arrangements have been made to have the Journal published regularly here-after. Vol. V, No.1 (July-August 1932) will be published before the end of August.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We appeal to the public to support the Journal by enlisting as subscribers. </P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">P. N. APPUSWAMI.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">K. CHANDRASKKHARAN.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money is advanced without any obligation to pay interest, and on the understanding that the principal is to be repaid in easy installments spread over a number of years. We are profoundly grateful to the worthy individuals who have thus associated themselves with the work of the Journal. It is now possible to make a definite promise about its regular and continuous publication.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that three hundred fresh subscribers must be enlisted between now and April next to make the Journal pay its way. May we request our subscribers, life-subscribers, contributors, and readers who are not subscribers, to help us to secure the necessary subscribers during the coming months? To one and all who have co-operated with us, we render thanks.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A WASTED OPPORTUNITY</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When some months ago, Babu Ramananda Chatterjee of <I>The Modern Review </I>quoted passages from the letters of the Special Correspondent of <I>The Manchester Guardian, </I>and surmised that the correspondent was Prof. Thompson of Oxford, we had a lingering suspicion that the learned Editor was not correctly informed, for, it was difficult to believe that an old friend of India and Indians could write the sorry stuff that the <I>Guardian </I>published week after week, while the Indian continent was passing through unprecedented trouble and suffering. But all suspicions are now set at rest by the publication of the Professor's "<I>A Letter from India</I>"<I> </I><SUP>1 </SUP>which makes painful reading. Prof. Thompson came out to India on a misson of cultural co-operation; in particular he wanted to survey the present condition of the various vernacular literatures of India and report to the Rhodes Trust. He began well, and under happy auspices. But soon the superiority complex ‘got’ him. He donned the robe of Omniscience and talked wildly about Gandhi's failure at the R. T. C., the Viceroy's long-suffering patience, the unwisdom of the Congress and, God save the mark!, the comparative innocence of General Dyer who ‘saved the Empire.’ Here was a well-meaning Briton, genuinely interested in Indian Art and Literature, seeking to promote better understanding between two races. But he wastes his opportunities, ignores South India altogether, and suddenly cuts short his visit. The only valuable section of the book is that relating to the literatures of Northern India. The author gives helpful suggestions for future work. He wants a series of ‘Oxford Books’ of Indian Verse to be published, and the more gifted Indian poets and writers in the vernaculars to be recognised and rewarded. All this is to the good. On our side we can promise whole-hearted co-operation to the Professor in his scheme, for <I>Triveni </I>is in a special manner devoted to the interpretation of the renaissance movements in the different linguistic units of India.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY–WITH RESERVATIONS</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Samuel Hoare has cut himself off from the Indian Liberals by his announcement of the change in the Reforms programme. It was known beforehand that Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar would non-co-operate. But that did not deter the all-wise Secretary of State from persisting in his course. He kept repeating that he was misunderstood; the Liberals retorted that they understood him perfectly. If non-co-operation has become a factor even in Indian Liberal politics, the British Cabinet have themselves to thank. In 1929, it was the appointment of the Simon Commission; in 1932, it is the scrapping of the Round Table Conference. No one in India takes Sir Samuel seriously when he pleads that his sole anxiety is to speed up the Reforms. The present move is due to the conviction that the Congress is crushed, that the Liberals do not count, and that with the goodwill of the Communalists and the Princes, the new Constitution is certain of a cordial reception. It is thus that men in power oftentimes blunder and alienate those that are willing to co-operate on honourable terms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Close upon this comes the Communal Award. Apparently, it has satisfied nobody, not even the Muslims, for their fourteen points are not conceded in their entirety. But what is most significant about the Award is the absence of any provisions regarding the Central Legislature. It is Provincial Autonomy that is in immediate prospect, and the Communal Award recognises this position. Central responsibility and federation will, of course, form part of ‘the picture’, but they cannot come into operation till many outstanding problems are settled. The Indian Constitution, like Dobbin's tail, is progressing backwards, and we should not wonder if the present stage ends in Provincial Autonomy,–with reservations. This always happens when the component elements of a nation fall apart, and community is placed above country.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ROAD SAHEB G. RAMASWAMI IYENGAR</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ramakrishna Students’ Home is one of the beauty-spots of Madras. As one goes round the pile of buildings, the gardens and the hospital, or watches the bright young lads at work, one is filled with admiration for the devout soul that planned it all, and laboured day and night for many long years to make the Home the premier institution of the province. The late Rao Saheb C. Ramaswami Iyengar loved the poor students that wandered to Madras in search of learning. His heart went out to them in their perpetual struggle for board and lodging. As a servant of the Lord, he chose to bear their burdens that they might study in peace. In their stead, he begged of the rich and the powerful, took rebuffs with equanimity, waited for hours in ante-chambers, and by the power of his devotion, won them over to the good cause. In the brief intervals of a strenuous official life, he watched over the dear institution, and literally spent himself in its service. Here is a great example to all public workers. May his soul rest in peace!</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. J. K. Meghani of Botad, Kathiawar, informs us that the two stories contributed to <I>Triveni </I>by Mr. N. M. Shah from Gujerati folklore: "The Postal Runner" (Vol. IV, No. 2) and "Jago Patel" (Vol IV, No.6), are translations from Mr. Meghani's collection of Gujerati folk-tales. We regret that no suitable acknowledgment was made at the time.</P>

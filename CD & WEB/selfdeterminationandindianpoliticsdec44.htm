style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has been well said that “ideas rule the world”. The idea of self-determination,
which has caught the imagination of all peoples today and is considered to be a
sovereign right of every nationality, had its origin in the 19th century.
People like Mazzini and J. S. Mill held that it is the natural right of every
nationality to mould its political destiny. The natural corollary of such a
view was that multi-national States were considered as unnatural unions and
“every nationality, a State” has become an axiom. J. S. Mill thought that “ it
is in general a necessary condition of free institutions, that the boundaries
of governments should coincide in the main with those of nationalities.” <sup>1</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
having taken its origin in the mid 19th century, self-determination became a
cardinal principle in framing the peace treaties after the Great War of 1914.
President Wilson, the ill-fated Utopian idealist, expressed his belief that
“self-determination is not a mere phrase; it is an imperative principle of
action, which statesmen will henceforth ignore at their peril.” In January,
1917, <i>i.e., </i>about a couple of months before America entered the Great
War, addressing the Senate on the future role of America in international
politics he said: “ I am proposing, as it were, that the nations should with
one accord adopt the Doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of the world:
That no nation should seek to extend its policy any over other nation or
people, but that every people should be left free to determine its own polity,
its own way of development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little
along with the great and the powerful.”<sup>2</sup> This doctrine of “exclusive
Universalism” underlies the peace treaties of 1918 and it has resulted in the
creation of nearly thirty individual sovereign Sates in Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
right of self-determination has gained strength with time and today it has
become the key-note of nationalism. Liberal thinkers of the present century
have unreservedly admitted that complete autonomy and independence is the
birth-right of every nationality. “It (the Nation-State) will not be
answerable, save in the arbitrament of war, to others outside itself. It will
claim to settle its own frontiers, its own tariffs, the privileges it will
accord to such minorities as dwell within its boundaries, the strangers it will
admit, the beliefs it will exclude, the form of government it desires.”<sup>3</sup>
The late Mr. Willkie, plainly stated, “if we want to enjoy freedom and fight </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for
it, we must be prepared to extend it to every one.”</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Thus we are to take it for granted that every nation, just because it is a
nation, has an inherent right to be united and to be free.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the liberal thought in the present age has considered self-determination as an
inviolable right of all<i> </i>people, it has become the touchstone of the good
intentions of the great Powers in the present war which is described an
ideological war–a war to establish peace, justice, and human liberty. Many
pious declarations have been hurled on this throbbing world, the most
authoritative of them being the Atlantic Charter. The right of
self-determination for all nations is admitted in the clause that “they respect
the right of <i>all </i>peoples to choose the form of government under which
they will live.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 5</span></sup><span style='font-size:

Roosevelt said, “we are committed to full support of those resolute peoples <i>everywhere

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
this we are led to hope that self-determination will be conceded to India also.
Liberal thinkers all over the world have categorically expressed the view that
the giving of independence to India is not only politically expedient but
morally necessary. Prof. Harold J. Laski remarked that “delaying in fulfilling
the unanswerable claim of India to self-government is indefensible.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
6</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> It is revealing to note the following words of
Mr. Willkie: “Cairo on, it (the question: what about India) confronted me at
every turn. The wisest man in China said to me, ‘when the aspiration of India
for freedom was put aside to some future date, it was not Great Britain that
suffered in public esteem in the Far East. It was the United States.” </span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Thus conceding of self-determination to India has become the touchstone of the
good intentions of the Allies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the pages of history we find nowhere a nation winning both the war and the
peace. We find a gulf of difference between<i> </i>the rosy ideals expressed
during the stress of war and the clauses in peace treaties. “This time we arc
getting the post-war disillusionment during the war.” Mr. Churchill, in
explaining the implications of the Eight-point Declaration, stated in the House
of Commons: “The Joint Declaration does not qualify in any way the various
statements of policy which have been made from time to time about the
development of constitutional government in India, Burma or other parts of the
British Empire.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 8</span></sup><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Thus it has
become clear that the principle of self-determination will be applied only with
certain reservations and modifications in view of imperial interests. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
trend towards such a qualified self-determination can be perceived in<i> </i>the
different pronouncements made by the British Government during the present war
on Indian constitutional problems. The first authoritative statement expressing
the British Government’s willingness to concede self-determination to India,
was made by the Viceroy on behalf of the British Government, and is now
commonly known as the “August Offer.” The Viceroy, with the full approval of
His Majesty’s Government, declared; “There has been very strong insistence that
the framing of that scheme (that is, the new constitutional scheme for India)
should be primarily the responsibility of Indians themselves and should
originate from Indian conceptions of the social, economic and political
structure of Indian life.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 9</span></sup><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> But in that
very ‘Offer’ it is revealed how the self-determination to be conceded to India
is qualified by certain ‘if’s.’ We are told that full independence, will be
given to India only after fulfillment of the obligations due to Great Britain,
which is an allusion to such questions as minority rights, the treaties with
the States, etc. Thus the ‘August Offer’ not only showed the unwillingness of
the British Government to part with power, but also raised the issue of
minorities “into an insuperable barrier to India’s progress.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
a great step forward was taken by the Cripps offer. In one of his conferences
in Delhi, Sir Stafford clearly and pointedly defined the purpose of the British
proposals as “complete and absolute self-determination and self-government for
India.” When he was asked by a pressman, “Is there any difficulty in the way of
India participating in the Atlantic Charter?” he replied, “None at all.” But
various forces led to the breakdown of the Cripps Mission. As Prof. Laski has
pointed out, “the instructions given to him were too rigid, and prevented the
requisite elasticity in negotiations, and moreover he was unlucky in his
colleagues, some of whom at least were afraid of the consequences of his
success.” <sup>10</sup> Thus ended the latest chapter in the story of India’s
advance towards self-determination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
India is thus struggling towards the attainment of self-determination, the
principle has taken a dangerous turn in her internal polity. The policy of
‘divide and rule’ has at last succeeded in raising the disruptive forces in
India. Before 1937, Mr. Jinnah wanted to work the new provincial constitution
‘for what it was worth’. By 1938, he found the weather favourable to launch on
a new adventure. “Democratic systems,” he wrote to a British Journal, “based on
the concept of a homogeneous nation are very definitely not applicable to
heterogeneous countries such as India, and this simple fact is the root cause
of all India’s constitutional ills.” </span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>11</span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
In the same article he put forth his theory of two nations. He argues that
Hindus and Muslims constitute two nations, with no affinities with each other.
Accordingly, as the Muslims are not a mere religious community but a nation,
Mr. Jinnah claims the right of self-determination for the Muslims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Self-determination
implies, <i>(a) </i>the right to frame the constitution, and <i>(b) </i>the
right to secede. Taking the former, “the first step in constitutional
self-determination is to determine by what kind of body the constitution is to
be made.”<sup>12</sup> In this connection a spirit of compromise is a
pre-requisite for any settlement<i> </i>regarding the nature of the
constitution making body. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Constitution is an accommodation. It<i> </i>is
a balance wherein there must be give and take.”<sup>13</sup> The concrete form
of the demand for self-determination </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for India put forth by
the Congress is the Constituent Assembly which is the usual democratic process
in framing a constitution. The Federal and State constitutions of the United
States of America, the constitutions of the British self-governing Dominions,
more especially those of Australia and Ireland, the constitution of France
under the Third French Republic, those of Switzerland of 1848 and 1875, were
all the work of representative bodies. On more than one occasion the<i> </i>Congress
expressed most succinctly and authoritatively its views regarding the
constitution making body. For example, in the Working Committee’s Resolution of
1939, it is stated: “They hold that a Constituent Assembly is the only
democratic method of determining the constitution of a free country…..The
Constituent Assembly should be elected on the basis of adult suffrage existing
separate electorates being retained for such minorities as desire them. The number
of members in the Assembly should reflect their numerical strength.”</span><sup><span

the Congress view has not<i> </i>received universal acceptance. Nor can we
expect it in India where division is the rule and compromise the exception.
Some intellectuals like Sir Maurice Gwyer expressed the view that
constitution-making should be done by a small group of experts, and especially
of men who are past-masters in the art of Government. The Constituent Assembly
plan was opposed even more vehemently by the Muslim League and other minority
parties like the Scheduled Castes. Their fear was that the strict adherence to
the ‘logic of democracy’ would lead to ‘numerical democracy’ and ‘majority
rule’. Anyway, “it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the idea of a
Constituent Assembly belongs to the period before the communal schism had
become so deep and difficult to bridge as it is now.”</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
As Mr. Jinnah says that the Muslims are a nation, he now argues, in strict
adherence to the logic of self-determination, that the Muslims must live under
a State organisation of their own choice and creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

implication the principle of self-determination is the right of secession. In a
multi-national State, If people are unwilling to be partners in the Union, they
have “a right to dissolve the partnership by withdrawal and to establish new
States on national foundations.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

In the Lahore resolution as well as in the press statement issued by Mr. Jinnah
after the termination of his talks with Gandhiji in Bombay, he has defined the
Pakistan boundaries as follows: “The division should be on the basis of the
present boundaries of the six provinces, namely the North-West Frontier
Province, Punjab, Sind, Bengal, Assam, and Baluchistan, subject to territorial
adjustments that might be necessary.” Today Mr. Jinnah has become the idol and
Pakistan the symbol of the Muslim League.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

historic Cripps offer marks an important stage in the progressive development
of responsible government, in India. It is historic in the sense that
Parliament has conceded to India the right to frame her own constitution. But
here it has introduced the novel and pernicious principle of non-accession. “If
some provinces decided not to accede, then so far as they were concerned, they
would not be parties to the constitution.” Sir S. Cripps trenchantly remarked
that if the Indian Communities fail to forge a United Constitution and<span

territorial self-determination gained further ground by the C. R. formula which
says that, (1) after the termination of the war a commission shall be appointed
for demarcating contiguous districts in the North-East and North-West India,
wherein the Muslim population is in absolute majority, (2) in the areas thus
demarcated a plebiscite shall ultimately decide the issue of separation from
Hindustan, and (3) the plebiscite shall be held on the basis of adult suffrage
or other practicable franchise. Mr. C. Rajagopalachari thinks it ‘childish’ to
quarrel over unity! His theory behind the formula which he has drawn up is that
“administrative unity was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

C. R. formula has gained publicity and importance as it became the basis of the
Gandhi Jinnah talks. Gandhiji’s formula, which was later on presented to Mr.
Jinnah, is mostly based on the C. R. formula. The Gandhi formula clearly
reveals the sincerity with which Gandhiji approached the problem. It “accepts
the principle of sovereign States, consistent with friendliness.” But will Mr.
Jinnah, who is now in the plenitude of power, agree to anything short of
complete surrender to the Muslim League’s Lahore resolution of 1940? He claims
the right of self-determination for Muslims as a nation and as a territorial
unit<i>. </i>He has chosen to understand the word ‘self-determination’ to mean <i>communal
</i>self-determination, and any other interpretation is a ‘misconception’ for
him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Muslims as a separate nation with no affinities with the rest of India, would
be untenable. To divide India into two separate nations is politically
inexpedient. As Lord Curzon remarked at the Lausanne Peace Conference (1923),
“the right of self-determination is like a two edged sword and can be admitted
only with reservations: It is, and has been in the past, a unifying force; but
it may be, and has recently become, also a disruptive force. Manifestly, if the
theory were actually applied in all cases it<i> </i>would lead to the
disruption of some of the oldest existing States of the world.”<sup> 18</sup>

that of Russia, has given self-determination for the minorities. To imitate the
Russian example without introducing the Russian background is to invite
dangerous and deleterious consequences. Russia being a classless State having
community of interests among the proletariat, combined with cultural autonomy,
has proved to be a success as a multi-national State. Self determination acts as
a supreme unifying force under such conditions, while in other countries it
generally leads to disintegration and disruption. Nor should we overlook the
fact that the right of self-determination of the Russian Republics is only

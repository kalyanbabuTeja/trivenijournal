United States of America have been pouring men, money and material into South
Vietnam in the hope of an early settlement. The U. S. enjoys the mastery of the
sea and air in the region. The material aid has been on a massive scale. Over
200,000 U. S. troops are now engaged in a fierce struggle with the Vietcong
forces and their allies in the jungles and hills of S. Vietnam. Yet this aid
instead of ending, apparently, seems only to be prolonging the struggle in this
corner of South East Asia. Not only the people in other countries but also the
citizens of U.S.A. are puzzled at continuation of the fighting. This article is
an attempt to explain the paradox of the fighting in S. Vietnam. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

came the Second World War. Japan took over the East Asia. Then also came the
Japanese surrender in August, 1945. This was a crucial time. I am not writing
this from hearsay. I had the misfortune to be a prisoner of war in Japanese
hands for 3 ½ years. From Singapore I was packed off with 300 Indian prisoners
of war to Hanoi in Tonking (N. Vietnam). The surrender, terms laid down that
North Anam (now N. Vietnam) was to be occupied by Chinese troops, whole South
Anam (now S. Vietnam) was to be occupied by British Indian troops. The British
were prompt in occupying the area allotted to them, but not so the Chinese. It
took them over 2 ½ months to assemble enough troops to occupy N. Anam. Thus
there was a political vacuum of over two and half months. This was fully
exploited by the Nationalist elements who took complete control of the
administrative machinery. If I remember right, Dr. Ho Chi Minh announced the
independence of his country at a mass rally in Hanoi either on 3rd or 4th
September, 1945. Later the Allies decided to restore French sovereignty over
Indo-China. This was the beginning of the trouble in Indo-China. The
Nationalists, naturally, vociferously opposed the restoration of French
Imperialism. They now wanted no foreign domination, either European or Asian.
The return of French Imperialism was a signal for the start of a liberation<i> </i>movement
in Indo-China, particularly in Tonking where the nationalists were strongly
entrenched. In the initial stages it was a peaceful movement like the one in
India. But repression invited retaliation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Minh may have had socialist leanings, but on the whole the movement was

Party. The movement was not confined to the north. It established its focal

Chinese province of Yunan is contiguous to Tonking. Vietnam’s culture
definitely still retains features which are Chinese in origin. Till the French
introduced the Roman script for the Anamite language it was written in Chinese
ideographs. There is also an influential Chinese Community in N. Vietnam. The
Viet Minh naturally turned to China for help. China was only too willing to do
so. The Viet Minh troops were trained in Yunan across the border, in the
successful technique of guerilla warfare, which had enabled the communists to
establish themselves in China. The Viet Minh volunteers were not only trained
but also armed and equipped by the Communist regime in China. It was,
therefore, no wonder that Communist ideology soon came to dominate the Viet
Minh polices in Vietnam.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

fighting not against a few rebels but against an ideology. France fought a
losing war in Indo-China and in spite of all the massive military hardware she
received from the U. S. A., the end came with the fall of Dien Bin Phu. The
sympathies of Afro-Asian countries were naturally with the Viet Minh who
represented nationalist struggling against colonialism. In the meantime India

Geneva Conference under the co-chairmanship of Britain and Russia succeeded in
ending the conflict in Indo-China. France realising that the battle had been

the elections could not come off in 1957 because N. and S. Vietnam could not
agree over the election procedure and the machinery to control the election.
This made these people feel that they were let down and doomed to remain under
the unsatisfactory S. Vietnam regime. They, therefore, resolved to stage a
struggle on their own against the regime, of course, with the assurance of the
moral and material support from the regime in the north. To avoid confusion and
deny the charge of collusion with the Viet Minh, they began to call themselves
the ‘Viet Cong’. This was nothing but a repetition of the same struggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vietnam. The new regime sought military aid from the U. S. A. who was only too
willing to oblige. U. S. Military personnel arrived to train the S. Vietnamese

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What is the secret of the apparent success of the
Viet Cong ? Their total strength can hardly exceed 1,25,000. Against them are
pitted 2,00,000 U. S. troops and perhaps 1,50,000 Government troops. This means
numerically they are inferior to the U. S. and S. Vietnamese forces. They have
no planes, no air cover and armour support. Yet the U. S. forces, with all
their modern weapons are unable to suppress them. Why? Because the U. S. forces
and their allies are not fighting an army but they are fighting a people. </p>

Viet Cong are local people, though their strength is supplemented by troops
from N. Vietnam. And even the Vietnamese are not foreigners in S. Vietnam. The
only foreigners are the U. S. troops. The terrain is admirably suited for
guerilla warfare. The American soldier can never be at home in the jungles and
paddy fields of Vietnam. He can be easily out made out by his colour, stature
and uniform, The Viet Cong guerilla is fighting in his own home, helped by his
own people, fed by his own people, eating the same food, wearing the same
clothes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

then is U. S. fighting an apparently losing war in Vietnam? The answer is to be
found in U. S. world strategy. The U. S. A. by now, is resigned to the
Existence of Communism. The U. S. A. and U. S. S. R. are drawing closer. But U.
S. A. is naturally worried about the expansionist tendency so apparent in
Chinese Communism. The fears have increased since China joined the ‘A’ Club two
years ago. China must, naturally be now busy developing rocket missiles to
carry atomic war heads over long distances. When she develops these, she will
become a power to reckon with. So the Chinese potential must be destroyed while
it is in the experimental stage. To do so U. S. A. must have an excuse to go at
China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
U. S. A. is seeking this excuse. One such excuse had presented itself in
October-November, 1962 when China invaded India. It will be recalled with what
alacrity both U. K. and U. S. A. had offered to extend air cover to India
against China. But the clever Chinese unilaterally stopped the fighting as they
realised the implications of U. S. intervention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
lies behind the escalation of fighting, particularly air bombing, of N.
Vietnam? It is simply a bait to China. Will China bite it? China is too shrewd
to walk into the parlour. What was the object of U. S. planes from Saipan
coming to bomb objectives in N. Vietnam? I feel it was to demonstrate to the
Chinese, the capacity of U. S. bombers to bomb objectives across a distance of
3000 miles. What will be the obvious target for U. S. bombers in case of a showdown
with China? I presume it is Sinkiang, the source of Chinese atomic power.
Chinese atomic plants are located in that province. A few atomic bombs on these
targets will destroy the Chinese atomic potential in its infancy. U. S.
military aid to Pakistan must also be viewed from this angle. Air bases in
Pakistan enabled U. S. planes to fly over Russia and in the future they can be
used to bomb Sinkiang from nearer, distance. This is the secret of U. S.
partiality for Pakistan. Chinese aspirations in Ladakh flow from this same
fear. The recent halt in U. S. bombing of N. Vietnam was prompted by, I feel, a

feel that U. S. will promptly stop the war if she was assured that United
Vietnam will not be a henchman of China, though she might become a Communist
State. The other solution to this tangle is more difficult and complicated. The
first requisite is to have a real stable government in S. Vietnam truly representative
of the Nation. Administrative reforms must be introduced to liquidate
corruption, nepotism and religious animosities. The farmer and the worker must
be given a fair deal. Law and Order must prevail over the countryside. But this
is a very tall order. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this connection U. S. feelers for settlement have so far produced no tangible
results. China refuses to be drawn into the struggle. The recent attempt on the
part of U. S. A. to bring in the U. N. is likely to fail because of Russian
opposition and possible veto. The only alternative which suggests itself is the
recall of the Geneva Conference which was instrumental in resolving the
Vietnamese-French struggle in 1954. But the members of the Geneva Conference
must be willing to enforce its majority decisions by collective sanctions
against the party violating the terms of truce. Only collective sanctions can
enforce peace. No country should enjoy the prerogative of veto whose use will
nullify the work of the Conference. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thing is certain. No decision can be forced on the warring parties by strength
of arms. Only sanity and a spirit of co-operation can solve the issue. The
fighting has brought untold sufferings to the masses in both N. and S. Vietnam.
Ultimately the people themselves must decide their future and the form of
government they want to live under. South East Asia needs peace to heal the
wounds of war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

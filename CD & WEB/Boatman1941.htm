</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anchor not your boat today, oh boatman!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">True, there is a storm and the waters are in blood-tide;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet I beseech, do not aspire to return home.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first rains of this earth, you sailed in your boat: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What makes you want today to return?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have gone from place to place; and now at last </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">you think of returning. Your hope is that at the </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">landing stage near your home, you will see a light.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alas! You know not:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summer, your house caught fire and was reduced to ashes;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She who was in it–nobody knows where she is gone:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">do you then intend to seek her from place to place? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Say the villagers: she has gone far away, she cares for you not!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will find your house deserted: how should you bear it, returning after so long?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So I say: let us not now return there;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather, let us sail on in our boat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the landing to some market, we shall halt:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And we shall ask the people:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Have any of you seen her whose eyes are black?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have you heard any song like hers that vibrates in the </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">sail of some boat on the river far away?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perchance, some afternoon we shall sight her:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall see her come to the river for water– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then, Oh boatman,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She won’t recognize you– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She will go back after filling her pitcher:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And again float on the waters shall we:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You and I, Oh boatman!</P></DIR>

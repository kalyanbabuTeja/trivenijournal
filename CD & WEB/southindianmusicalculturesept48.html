been long desirous to know my views on South Indian Musical Culture and the
best that the public has derived from it. At the outset let us make ourselves
definite about the meaning of culture in relation to music. You recollect, I
dare say well, what Clive Bell has to say of civilisation and culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NADA SUDHA: Culture is
that quality of the human mind in which it is at peace with the world and
enjoys the pleasures of the intellect and the emotions, and those of the senses
a little in the rear–from a charming background. Or, it is a living tree which
has its roots deep in the soil, making itself felt both by the rural and urban
civilisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>K.G.: Quite. And it
also means a leisured class producing a highly civilised and civilising elite.
Our great music makers, a hundred years ago, belonged to that leisured class,
that civilising elite. Our famous musical Trinity took the <i>ragas </i>of the
folk-songs like <i>Anandabhairavi</i>, <i>Bhairavai</i>, <i>Nadanamakriya</i>, <i>Yadukula
Kambodi</i>, and <i>Arabhi </i>and created pieces of infinite glory and
grandeur out of them. But their means of maintaining themselves were very
scanty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>K. G.: It meant that
they spent their best and happiest moments in the superior activity of creating
music, though perhaps not with the intent of informing their experience to the
lesser minds. For, they as musicians ‘knew’; it was for others to ‘reason and
welcome.’ And the peculiar feature of the melodies of the Trinity of South
India who lived in Tiruvaiyar is that not only was the subject-matter of their
compositions a lyric outpouring in praise of Rama, Iswara, or Iswari as mother
but that they revelled in the aesthetic flow of pure sound in vowels, thus
raising music to the level of art, embodying <i>raga </i>concepts or forms
though couched in words with soft consonants and vowel-endings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

India has been a United Nations Organisation by itself in regard to its musical
culture. The South Indian Tamil is a colonist and has an international mind. Has
he not carried the Ramayana and the Mahabharata to the island of Java and to
the fareast? He has absorbed all that is best in the religious and mythical
lore of the peoples speaking the six languages. Do we not in our <i>Harikathas</i>,
though the townspeople may be ignorant of this religious activity in the last
half century, sing Purandara Dasa’s <i>kirtanas</i>, Tukaram’s <i>abhangs</i>,
Tyagaraja’s <i>kritis</i>, in the bhagavatar’s narration of the lives of our
saints, bhaktas, heroes, and heroines? Dikshitar composed melodies in Sanskrit
several centuries after Jayadeva, the author of <i>Gita Govinda</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>K. G.: Thinkers are
many both in the East and in the West who have defined the function of music in
relation to the individual and the State. For instance, Plato. Plato said that
through music the soul learns harmony and rhythm and an even disposition to
justice. For how can he who is harmoniously constituted be ever unjust? Rhythm
and harmony find their way into the secret places of the soul bearing grace in
their movements and making the soul graceful. By music Plato meant the Nine
Muses. G. Lowes Dickinson in his book <i>After Two Thousand Years </i>puts the
following words in the mouth of Plato who comes back to the modern world from Elysian
fields after his decrying the orchestral, military, and sentimental music of
the West. He speaks: “Music should be carefully chosen so as to correspond to
that training in Reality, which my citizens were to undergo, so that it should
be neither an enchantment, evoking illusory expectations, nor yet a premature
unlocking of the gate through which all must pass in the end, but rather an
evocation of those emotions which are fit to sustain and inspire the very
actions, which reason tells men they ought to be learning to perform, and which
will lead them in due time, to the great change we call death, fit to encounter
its menace or its reward.” Thus music should lead man to <i>tattva gnana</i>, a
Hindu ideal clearly enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

abridge his ideas, we find that music, to his mind, represents the spirit of
man to interpret the harmony of the universe which can best be exemplified in the
harmonious government of a State. “It is by the odes that the mind is aroused.
It is by the rules of propriety that character is established. It is from music
that the finish is received. It should not be said of the King by the music of
the land: ‘Why does he reduce us to this extremity of distress?’ for happiness
of the people is the aim of a good State.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

music, unsophisticated, pure and simple, unaided by any harmonic orchestration
as in the West, that can be sung by a single human voice or played on a single
instrument like the <i>vina</i>, the <i>gottuvadyam</i>, the <i>nagaswaram</i>,
the flute, and the violin–the latest adjunct in our music-hall concerts–besides
the <i>tambura </i>or <i>othu </i>which keeps the drone and a musical drum,

talked only of the highest composed music in praise of Iswara, but there are
other types current both in the north and south of our country which are erotic
in character, like the <i>gazals</i> and the <i>padams </i>and the <i>javalis</i>.
Music in the early stages of sociological evolution was always connected with
dance and sex rituals, although latterly dance itself had become the
interpretation of the Cosmic Rhythm of the Lord in Creation and was sublimated
for higher purposes. Nevertheless, there was and still is a tendency in dance
music to descend to the sensual plane. It must be said to the credit of
Purandara Dasa, Tukaram, Tyagaraja, Syama Sastri, and Dikshitar and a few of
the earlier and later composers in Tamil like Arunachala Kavi that they
composed songs which delighted the ear alone and separated them from dance
music enrapturing as well the eye. Thus music became intensely devotional and
religious, an <i>atma vidya </i>bringing us nearer in our absorption in the
godhead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>K. G.: To carry on the
tradition is not a simple affair. It has been in the past that every composer
had a band of pupils who could sing and imitate the master, imbuing his
individual music with the best of his talent, and the master-pupil–<i>guru
sishya parampara</i>–system is still in vogue where the middle-classes are
learning these high art-songs. For instance: Within living memory Ariyakudi
Ramanuja Iyengar is the pupil of Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar who in turn was a
pupil of Pattanam Subrahmania Ayyar, a contemporary of Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan,
who imbibed his musical knowledge at Tiruvaiyar on the banks of the Kaveri
where the great Tyagaraja lived. And no student has yet appeared to continue
the tradition of Sri Ramanuja Iyengar. Isn’t this a sorry state of affairs?
Within the last about two decades the University of Madras has taken on Music
in the curricula of studies, not indeed of a very high standard, but has been
responsible, in its own humble way, of bringing out a band of teachers for
school education like the Teachers’ College of Music run by the Music Academy
of Madras which started similar activities a couple of years earlier than the
University. But let me tell you frankly, though my honesty may be a little
disconcerting to you, that these interpreters who sing in concert halls have
not lived that intense life of religious devotion and ethical character, to
communicate that supreme joy of god-intoxication as also <i>nada</i>, delicate
and balanced, to a wide public. They have, however, fairly preserved and
displayed to us good technical mastery of music on the purely aesthetic plane
of sound and that only when they sing the melodies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>K. G.: I am afraid we
will have to make a fresh start with a larger vision. The University education
in music awarding degrees, diplomas, and certificates has of late shown certain
evil tendencies noticed in Great Britain where such mass education in music has
been in vogue for centuries, such as liability to mechanical reproduction,
text-book analysis, and historical gossip–the class teaching containing very
little incentive to <i>active </i>personal experience and participation. When the
practical examination should carry a higher percentage for declaring success
and not a mere thirty-five per cent in this practical art, the study of theory
swallows a large amount of time of the students. So simple indeed is our theory
of melodic music when expressed in the terms of the twelve <i>swaras </i>or
frets to the octave or <i>sthayi </i>of the <i>vina</i>. The <i>talas </i>are
only seven in the highest art-music of the Trinity. Yet all crude mathematical
excrescences working up to hundred and eight <i>talas </i>are a burden to the
memory of the young student, besides dabbling in words such as quarter tones, <i>gramas</i>,
<i>murchanas</i>, all of them bearing no meaning in relation to living music.
Yet the art is difficult for the shades of sound and pitch have to be learnt by
the ear and initiated by a guru. We shall have to think of the art of playing
on instruments or of singing as vocations having ‘standards without limit.’ It
should be the function of academies to find out and encourage such superlative
talent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to a large extent, as the Committee which has been constituted does not
represent the living torch-bearers of our musical tradition, and many who are
there now have no business to be there for they have no qualifications that
made our great masters of music. All those custodians of the music of the
several languages have to be represented in the Committee, including those
top-ranking musicians who belong to the <i>guru sishya parampara </i>system, I
mean not only the vocalists but the instrumentalists–<i>vainikas</i>, <i>nagaswaram
</i>players, flutists, violinists, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

should be a place where invidious distinctions of caste, religion, or language
cannot cast their shadow; it should be holy ground. I am not talking as a
politician for our master composers like Tyagaraja taught all castes and
creeds, including a Muslim Durwan, I understand. Dikshitar has created a school
of <i>nagaswaram </i>players who carry on the tradition from father to son–two
of whom are Sri Nataraja Sundaram Pillai, the <i>nagaswaram </i>player, and the
flutist Sri Swaminatha Pillai. The scions of Syama Sastri have carried the
tradition of <i>vina </i>and vocal music, it is said, to the temple-girls in
Kanchipuram and elsewhere. The present repertoire of songs of the Tamil singers
is not restricted to one language as Tamil. It should be the function of that
Academy to resuscitate the folk-songs in the several South Indian languages, to
build a library of gramophone records, the copper plates becoming the nation’s
property, not to speak of the art-songs of the great composers rendered by our
best vocalists and instrumentalists, for ours is a great heritage of music.
Here shall not be any parochialism or narrow nationalism, here in this hall of
music. And it is absurd to think of every regional language constituting a
nation. The province of Madras including Hyderabad, Trivandrum, Mysore, and Cochin
has a historical background of common joys and sorrows, and there can be no
musical balkanisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

be content with quoting an old-world <i>sloka </i>of the second century B.C.,
vaguely defined without any scientific verification of the theory of twenty-two
<i>srutis </i>and no more–which however arise in the process of the fixation of
frets on the <i>vina </i>and can mathematically be deduced–when I can identify,
exemplify as many as thirty-two pitches within the octave or <i>sthayi </i>in
my violin play of the <i>raga </i>themes and Tyagaraja’s melodies. Research
must be conducted by modern physicists in collaboration with high artists in
relation to the living music of today, on delicate, scientific instruments such
as the Cathode ray oscillograph and others. The orchestral fiend in imitation
of Western style has possessed the A.I.R. for Indian Music. The same melody or
tune is played on several instruments, some of them Indian, the violin, the
cello and even equal-tempered instruments like the clarinet and the saxophone,
creating a muffling sound akin to noise so that the succeeding generation will
have lost its fine sensibility of the musical ear. And they have done this
without any scientific investigation as to the coalescence of the musical
sounds arising from the several instruments in relation to their upper
partials. All such monstrosities should be set aside immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Our music is full of the highest aim in life, the realisation of <i>shanti </i>or
peace by the individual soul. Our music is an individual music and art music
cannot be sung in chorus, for graces are individual. We in India are all agreed
that world peace should be ushered into being, and psychologists of the West
say that the inner conflict of the individual soul expresses itself, when
brought to the end of the tether, into the making of war on a global scale. The
mystic music of Tyagaraja has very largely all the painful impressions of
separation from the godhead. I am afraid even our age-long escapism taught by
the Buddhist religion and absorbed by the Hindus should be given up while not
following the Semitic ideal of conquest and exploitation of other human races.
While not giving up the <i>shanti </i>ideal, we have got to fall back on the
Rig Vedic ideal of an active joy and participation in life, its <i>human </i>instincts
and senses. We have to create a new type of melodic music where joy shall
prevail, its deepest core being a universal harmony. The Vedantic teaching of
the One manifesting itself as the Many, and the Many being absorbed in the One,
is largely depicted to my mind by the play of the aesthetic sounds on the <i>vina</i>,
for the four strings have got their own pitches merging in the drone, as the
music coming out of the frets does. And in the wake of our new-born freedom let
us rise to the great international level of joy in human life and song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

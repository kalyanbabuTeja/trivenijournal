Government of India, it is reported, have decided that, in view of the
adherence of the South African Government to the Group Areas Act, no useful
purpose would be served by holding the Round Table Conference between India,
Pakistan and South Africa, as was agreed to at the Preliminary Conference
between these parties which commenced in Cape Town on the 6th February, 1950.
Pakistan, it is reported, was however still hoping to persuade India to attend
the conference, inasmuch as South Africa had said that there was no prospect of
implementing the Group Areas Act till December; 1950, by which time the
Conference could be held. How did this situation come to pass, and what are the
courses open to India?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not necessary to delve deep into the past to understand India’s case against
South Africa, which is nearly a century old. South Africa’s policy can be
fairly summed up as follows: first, repatriation; second, segregation. The
Group Areas Act, recently enacted by the Government of Dr. Malan, is perhaps
the most apprehensive measure for racial segregation of the inhabitants of Soth
Africa. Segregation has been in operation to some extent or other statutorily
or otherwise, though not uniformly over the whole of South Africa. The Act
gives power to Government to set apart different areas for ownership and
occupation to the Whites, the Bantus and the coloured, the last to include the
Asiatics. It enables Government to compel within ten years the members of a
particular race to move from areas not meant for them to areas reserved for
them. All the Whites would be compelled to migrate to the White area; all the
Bantus to the Bantu area, and all the Coloured to the coloured area. An Indian
who, under the existing law, owned or occupied land in a particular area, will
be compelled to shift from that area if it be declared a White or Bantu area,
and to migrate to another area earmarked for Indians! The Natal Indian
Organisation, a body of moderates most anxious to co-operate honourably with
the South African Government, said that the Act would forcibly segregate the
Indian people throughot South Africa, annihilate every Indian business, small
or large, that falls outside the Indian group area, stultify the natural
development of the Indian people of South Africa and make them helots within
the Commonwealth, and take away every vestige of fundamental human rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
South African Government denied that the Group Areas Act amounted to racial
discrimination, inasmuch as it applied to all races and did not discriminate
against any particular race. Nobody is deceived by this plea. The Act is an
enabling one and vests considerable discretion in the Government. Dr. Malan
himself admitted that hundred per cent segregation of the races was
impracticable. The Act will be so worked as to cause no inconvenience or
hardship to the Whites but to repress and depress the Non-Whites. Most of the
unskilled lnbour is done by the Bantus in farms and factories owned by Whites
and in the railways, dockyards, etc., owned by Government, and in domestic
service of Whites. A hundred percent White area is almost inconceivable, and
would not be permitted by the Whites themselves who cannot do without the Non-Whites
for their menial services. The only people who would suffer even more than now
are the Non-Whites, and more particularly the Indians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
regard to Indians, the antipathy is greater and the favoured remedy more
drastic than segregation, namely, repatriation. Recently the South African
Government published the report of two joint committees, one for Natal and the
other for the Transvaal, appointed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to make recommendations
to amend the Asiatic Land Tenure Acts. The Report said that the best solution of
the Asiatic problem </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was repatriation. “Failing or pending
repatriation,” it was necessary continued the Report, to take some incisive
action if racial tension and strife were to be avoided. “We can see no way of
attaining this except to legislate for total segregation of the different
racial groups, so that in course of time homogeneous racial group areas are
brought about.” It went on to say: “These recommendations for </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>segregation
wi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>ll, on the one hand, not unduly endanger the possibility of
repatriation, and, on the other hand, will not fall far short of what<i> </i>we
regard as necessary to deal with the present situation.” It is likely that, far
from unduly endangering repatriation , segregation will promote it with a
vengeance. Such, apparently, was the anticipation of the Malan Government in
not providing in the Act for an area for Indians, as recommended in the Report.
There would be no need for an Indian area if all Indians were repatriated!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
antipathy of the South African Whites towards Indians is more intense because
Indians have, on the whole, been more </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>advanced educationally,
economically and in political consciousness and leadership; they had also an
external authority, India, to back them in their claims for equal status as
citizens; and through India they had access to the United Nations and the
Commonwealth. South Africa could get away with racial discrimination against
the Bantus as a domestic question, but could not prevent India or the
Commonwealth or the United Nations from asking questions regarding racial
discrimination against Indians. Indians, under Mahatma Gandhi and since,
offered <i>Satyagraha </i>against the Government of South Africa. India applied
trade and other sanctions. The United Nations practically censured South Africa
in 1946 for its attitude towards Indians in that country. Further, South
African Whites have to put up with the presence of the Bantus, because the
latter cannot be repatriated elsewhere and also because they need the services
of the Bantus for their own comfort and convenience. The case of Indians,
however, is different. The South African Whites could do without Indians, and
the latter could be repatriated to India. For all these reasons the tension
between the Whites and Indians in South Africa is keener than between any two
other races in that country. And the Group Areas Act will hit the Indians more
than the Bantus, at any rate immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indians
in South Africa, belonging both to the South African Indian Congress and the
South African Indian Organisation, have declared that they would not submit to
the Group Areas Act. The Congress organised <i>Satyagraha </i>sometime ago
against the Asiatic Land Tenure Act, but gave it up subsequently without
achieving the success hopeded for. The Organisation banked on a Round Table Conference
between India and South Africa to find an acceptable solution; it also appealed
to the United Nations to intervene and, if necessary, apply sanctions against
South Africa. The Congress proposed to make common cause with the leading
organisations of the other Non-White races in South Africa, in order to resist
the Group Areas Act by all means open to them. It may be mentioned that one of
the reasons why the South African Whites prefer the repatriation of Indians to
their segregation is the fear, not unfounded, that the politically more
advanced Indians would offer leadership to the Bantus and thereby make the
repression of the Bantus, who form the great majority of the population, more
difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

common Non-European Front, as it is sometimes called, has hitherto been
somewhat difficult to organise. Indeed, Indians in South Africa have in the
past been criticised, even by some friendly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>critics, for thinking
only of themselves and trying to safeguard their own interests, and hesitating,
if not declining, to make common cause with other Non-Whites, who suffered from
common disabilities. The attitude of Indians was perhaps excusable, if not
inevitable, in so far as they looked to India for help. India could claim a
voice only with regard to Indians who, in the first instance, migrated to South
Africa with the consent and the protection of India, and in whom, therefore,
India had a continuing interest. To the extent that Indians in South Africa
became nationals of that country and made common cause with other nationals
therein, to that extent India would be handicapped in backing them. India could
not interfere on behalf of the Bantus in South Africa or the Negroes in the
United States of America, even as South Africa could not interfere on behalf of
the Untouchables in India or the Negroes in America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was also felt at the time that any relief which Indians secured on account of
the good offices of India would ultimately accrue to the other Non-Whites also.
But the situation has been gradually changing. An increasing number of Indians
in South Africa were born in that country and are its nationals; they
constitute over ninety per cent of Indians now in South Africa. India’s claim
to back them is gradually tapering off, as it were. Indeed, it has been increasingly
urged by South African statesmen that the question of Indians in South Africa
was entirely a domestic question and India had no right to intervene in the
domestic affairs of South Africa, except at the invitation of south Africa and
for the purpose approved by South Africa, namely, repatriation of Indians to
India, This new development makes it easier for Indians in South Africa to make
common cause with other Non-Whites, but more difficult for India to intervene
on their behalf. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question whether the problem of Indians in South Africa was or was not a purely
domestic question was tossed about a good deal. The Cape Town Agreement of
1926, which was reviewed and renewed in 1932, admitted in so many words the
right of India to intervene on behalf of Indians in South Africa. As recently
as the 28th April, 1947, Gen. Smuts, then Prime Minister of South Africa,
thanked Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India for the “opportunity given to
the Union Government to discuss with the Government of India common
difficulties between the two Governments in regard to the treatment of Indians
in South Africa,” though in a subsequent letter, dated the 28th July, 1947, he
repudiated the right of India to intervene on behalf of Indians in South
Africa. Subsequently in 1949, Mr. Eric Louw, on behalf of South Africa, urged
at the politi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cal Committee of the United Nations that, as the
question of Indians in South Africa was a ‘domestic’ issue, the United Nations
was not competent to discuss it. On the 10th May, 1949, the Committee, however,
rejected the plea by 33 votes to 7, with 10 abstentions. The same plea was
urged in the General Assembly of the United Nations and rejected summarily on
the 11th May, 1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
South African Indians, as has been pointed out already, organised a campaign of
<i>Satyagraha </i>against the Asiatic Land Tenure Acts of the South African
Government and also appealed to India to raise the question in the Commonwealth
and the United Nations. The <i>Satyagraha </i>campaign brought no wished-for
relief, and it was abandoned. It had only stiffened the hostility of the Whites
towards Indians. There has as yet been no proposal to start a campaign of <i>Satyagraha
</i>against the Group Areas Act. It was hoped that the Round Table Conference
between South Africa, India and Pakistan would find an acceptable solution.
This was before the enactment of the Group Areas Act. But the enactment of the
Act has diluted the hope almost to the vanishing point. South African Indians
now look to the United Nations to find a solution by agreement or by the
application of international sanctions, if necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
another proposal has been put forward by some enlightened Whites in South
Africa and by some of the Non-European leaders. Mrs. Margaret Ballinger and Dr.
E. H. Brookes, both Senators, proposed that Dr. Malan should convene a Round
Table Conference of political leaders, including the Africans, to discuss the
race problem in South Africa. Dr. Rheinalt Jones, former Senator and now
director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, a non-political
study group, endorsed the suggestion for a Round Table Conference of all races
and political parties. Mr. J. Christie, leader of the Parliamentary Labour
Party in South Africa, favoured the proposal. The Hon. Mr. N. C. Havenga, Minister
of Finance in Dr. Malan’s Government, also favoured a joint solution to the
race problem. If the proposal for an internal Round Table Conference finds
favour with Dr. Malan’s Government and the leaders of all the critical groups,
including the Indian, it is well worth trying, though the hope of an agreed
solution is rather remote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
only to gain time, Dr. Malan’s Government may yet find it more prudent and
profitable to convene such a Conference, in view of the volume and intensity of
criticism against its present policy both from within and without South Africa.
The <i>Manchester Guardian, </i>in its leading article on the 2nd May, 1950,
said that Dr. Malan’s racial policy “tended to embody much of the Nazi
philosophy”. The <i>Economist </i>of London accused Dr. Malan’s Government of
authoritarian tendencies and suggested that Britain, should expel South Africa
from the Commonwealth, and added that Britain would gain rather than lose, by
such expulsion. Prof. Lancelot Hogben, writing in the <i>New Statesmen and Nation,
</i>said that South Africa should be declared a ‘pariah nation, unworthy to be
associated with the British Commonwealth at a time when we are giving a new
meaning to the British way of life.” He went on to say: “We can do something to
rehabilitate our credentials in Africa itself, if we dissociate ourselves from
a nation now irrevocably committed to the practice of a doctrine for preaching
which we hanged Alfred Rosenberg. Nothing could do more to reinforce Britain’s
moral prestige than the expulsion of the Union of South Africa from the
Commonwealth before the Union, as it will certainly do, deprive us of taking
the initiative.” Even the <i>New York Times </i>has been very critical of the
racial policies of South Africa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

diplomatic relations between India and South Africa however are somewhat
anomalous. India’s High Commissioner in South Africa has returned to India in
1946 and has not gone back yet. India did not withdraw the High Commissioner
and break off diplomatic relations with South Africa; she merely recalled her
High Commissioner for consultations. Gen. Smuts, in his letter of the 18th
June, 1947, to Prime Minister Nehru, said that the departure of the Indian High
Commissioner from South Africa “was not a rupture of relations between the
Governments but simply a recall of the High Commissioner to report to his
Government, while his office and staff remained to function as
before…Technically, we are on a footing of friendly Governments, and the Union
Government are anxious to treat the Indian Government on that footing.” Though
India and Pakistan have serious disputes over Kashmir and other matters and
have taken them to the United Nations, and though there was a trade war between
the two Governments, neither has withdrawn her diplomatic representative from
the other country. On the other hand, the two Prime Ministers met and concluded
the Delhi Pact to settle some of the disputes between the two countries.
Similarly, it would have been better if the Indian High Commissioner had been
sent back to South Africa after consultation. It would have been better still
if the Prime Ministers of India and South Africa had discussed the question
informally when they met in London in 1949; or if the matter was discussed at
the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers’ Conference at Colombo in early 1950. An
informal and private discussion has this advantage, that there would be no
occasion to highlight a failure to arrive at an agreement. Failure at a formal
conference, however preliminary in character, generally leads to
misunderstanding and mutual recrimination, and leaves the situation worse than

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Now that the Government of India has turned down the
proposition for a Round Table Conference, the only alternative left is to raise
the question again at the United Nations. The policy of the United Nations has
hitherto been one of retreat before the intransigence and defiance of South
Africa. On the merits of the case, the United Nations found against South
Africa in 1946 when it said that the friendly relations between two member
States, namely, India and South Africa, had been impaired and were likely to be
further impaired unless a satisfactory settlement was reached. It expressed the
view that the treatment of Indians in South Africa should be in conformity with
the international obligations under agreements between the two countries, and
the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter. It requested the two
Governments to report at the next session of the United Nations Assembly the
measures taken to that effect. The Resolution was passed by a majority of 32 to
15 votes, which was more than the two-thirds necessary. South Africa, under
Gen. Smuts, declined to accept the United Nations Resolution, with its implied
censure of South Africa, as the basis of talks between the two countries. India
raised the question again in 1947 at the United Nations, but this time the
relevant resolution failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority of votes
in the General Assembly. India brought up the matter again in 1948. The
representatives of Australia, Denmark and Sweden jointly suggested that India
and South Africa should seek a settlement of their dispute at a Round Table
Conference or by other means, such as mediation and conciliation through a
mediator appointed by the United Nations. The resolution was, however,
withdrawn. India proposed that the treatment of Indians in South Africa was not
in conformity with the United Nations Charter, with the previous resolutions of
the United Nations, and with international agreements between India and South
Africa, and that a commission should be appointed by the United Nations to
study the situation and make recommendations, She subsequently withdrew the
resolution. The resolution, proposed by France and Mexico, that India, Pakistan
and South Africa should discuss at a Round Table Conference the position of
Indians in South Africa ‘taking into consideration the purposes and principles
of the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration of Human Rights,” was
finally adopted by 47 votes to 1, with 10 abstentions. The retreat of the
United Nations from the position taken up in 1946 was thus complete. In 1949
South Africa agreed to a Round Table Conference, more to stave off a fresh
discussion of the subject at the United Nations.</p>

retreat of the United Nations was very largely, if not solely due to the
consistent support that the United States of America and the United Kingdom
gave to South Africa. Their support, however, took the form of doubting the
competence of the United Nations to deal with a subject which South Africa
claimed to be a ‘domestic’ matter outside the jurisdiction of the United
Nations. They wished that the question of competence should be referred to the
International Court of Justice. They thereby avoided having to pronounce on the
merits of the treatment of Indians in South Africa. It is not surprising that
in the absence of the support of the United Kingdom and the United States,
whose co-operation was essential for effective sanctions if necessary, the
United Nations thought it more prudent not to convict South Africa of violating
international obligations. For, in South Africa defied its verdict, the United
Nations was not in a position to apply effective sanctions which were sure to
be demanded by India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

situation has changed somewhat since the last session of the United Nations in
1949, but not enough to warrant the hope that the United Nations will and can
take more effective action against Africa. The position has changed for the worse
for South Africa inasmuch as she practically annexed South-West Africa in spite
of the mandate of the United Nations, and has, besides, committed herself
irrevocably to the policy of <i>apartheid </i>or racial segregation and
discrimination in South Africa by enacting the Group Areas Act. But the
position has not changed so far as to align the United Kingdom and the United
Nations with India and against South Africa. It is true that, on the question
of racial discrimination against the Negroes in the United States of America,
the Government of the country has taken a more enlightened attitude in
conformity with the United Nations Charter. Even the Supreme Court of the
United States of America has abandoned the older doctrine that ‘separate but
equal’ facilities did not violate the non-discriminatory clause of the
Constitution of the United States. It is, therefore, unlikely that the United
States will support the <i>apartheid </i>policy of South Africa on merits, but
she is likely to continue to evade the issue by continuing to question the
competence of the United Nations to discuss it. The United Kingdom is unlikely
to desert South Africa and support India. Notwithstanding all explanations to
the contrary, the action of the United Kingdom in the case of Seretse Khama is
not free from the charge that it was an accommodation to the racial policy of
South Africa. It is unlikely, therefore, that the United Kingdom and the Un</span><span

States will veer round now, particularly in view of their pre-occupation with
the war in Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian publicists in India and in South Africa have urged that India should
sever her membership of the Commonwealth as a protest against the treatment of
Indians in South Africa. But it is unlikely to give any relief to the Indians
in South Africa; it will only tend to alienate the other members of the
Commonwealth, for it is doubtful if even Pakistan and Ceylon, not to speak of
Canada, Auastralia or New Zealand, will line up with India in this matter.
Indeed, Pakistan is likely to gain, and India likely to lose, by the latter
quitting the Commonwealth. Mere quitting will not help. Some impression may be
produced if India threatened to align herself with the Soviet Union, which
consistently supported India against South Africa in the United Nations over
the issue of Indians in South Africa. But this will be a change from the frying
pan to the fire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

only alternative left is for India to take technical advantage of the case of
Indians in South Africa to champion the cause of all Non-White races in the
world who, at the moment; are being discriminated against in any part of the
world, and strive for the realization of the Charter of the United Nations and
the Fundamental Human Rights. It is a long-term programme, but noble,
honourable and worthwhile. India will then no longer be accused that she was
interested only in the emancipation from racial discrimination of a handful of
Indians in South Africa, most of whom are South African nationals, and not
equally keen on the abolition of racial discrimination as such from South
Africa and the world. India championed against political imperialism. Her
action has been widely appreciated. Let India now champion against racial
imperialism everywhere it occurs, and use the United Nations as the forum and
the Fundamental Human Rights as the Charter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

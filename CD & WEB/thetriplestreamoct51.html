<h5>Fighting the Congress</h5>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stage is now set for the first General Elections in India under the new
Republican Constitution. There is a bewildering multiplicity of parties seeking
the support of an electorate which is, without doubt, the largest in the world.
The Congress, the Party in power at the Centre and in the States, has already
published its list of candidates. The rest are finalising their lists, and
entering into combinations and ‘understandings’ among themselves with a view to
fighting the Congress. Nearest to the Congress in its aims and ideology, but the
most determined in its opposition, the Praja Party of Kripalani, Ghosh and
Prakasam has gathered momentum in Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Andhra. The
defection of Kidwai at the last intent has not unnerved his erstwhile leader
Kripalani, who is more intent on the defeat of the Congress than on the success
of his own Party<i>. </i>His slogan seems to be, “Vote for anyone except a
Congressman.” There is a touch of fanaticism in this attitude,–an eagerness to
depict the Congress as a monster of iniquity, an evil power which be exorcised
from the body politic. Apparently, the Acharya would like even the Communists,
the Justicites or the followers of Dr. Ambedkar to be returned to the
legislatures in preference to candidates set up by the Congress!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is easy to do propaganda against a Party which
has run the administration during a period of acute trouble, and to point to
its lapses. It is easier still to make large promises of a new heaven wherein
the utmost rectitude and devotion to the people’s interests will prevail. It is
not necessary to attach great importance to election speeches of this type. The
real value of the Praja Party lies in that it affords a chance to
Congress-minded electors to cast their votes in favour of candidates who, till
the other day, were within the Congress organisation and played a heroic role
in the fight for Independence. The choice really is between two groups of
Congressmen, divided not by principles but by personalities. And in every
constituency where the official Congress candidate is deemed unsatisfactory on
account or inefficiency or alleged corruption, the voter has an alternative
choice provided by the Praja Party, without being thrown perforce into the arms
of rank communalists, reactionaries, or violent revolutionaries To people who
have been satisfied with the general objectives of the Congress but felt
disappointed by its actual achievement in certain directions, it must be
disquieting to realise that a vote against the Congress must only mean a vote
for reaction or revolution The balance between these extremes is held by the
Congress, the Praja Party, and the Socialists. The hope for ordered progress at
home and for the maintenance of our status abroad lies in the wielding of power
by legislators belonging to these three moderate sections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
the experience of the coming elections and of the actual administration during
the next few years, a new alignment of parties is bound to shape itself. In
that alignment, progressive Congressmen, both official and Praja Party, will
coalesce with Socialists of the Jaya Prakash complexion, and form the great
Centre Party of India corresponding to the Labour Party in Britain. The
right-wing Congressmen will then merge in an Indian Conservative Party of
landlords, capitalists, and communalists. Whether the Communist Party will make
any headway and become a powerful Opposition group in our legislatures, now or
hereafter, will depend largely on the successful functioning of the three
elements composing the Centre Party envisaged above. If they can deliver the
goods, they will crowd out the Communists from our public life or absorb them.
From this analysis it will be clear that, whatever the slogans of the parties
contesting the forth coming elections, the cause of peace and progress demands
that the electors should either vote Congress or support the Praja
Party-Socialist alliance. The only feasible alternative to the Congress is this
alliance. In a majority of cases, the voter’s choice will depend not on the
party labels of any candidates belonging to these three important sections, but
on the individual merit and antecedents of the candidates. If a forecast may be
ventured at this stage, the Congress is likely to be returned by safe, but not
overwhelming, majorities to the Central Parliament and the Slate Legislatures.
The Praja Party, in alliance with the Socialists, will form the main
Opposition, and keep a vigilant watch over Congress administrations. Bearing
this in mind, it would be more proper for the Praja Party and the Socialists to
ask for support to either section of their alliance than to insist: <i>‘Anyone </i></span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>but
a Congressman.’<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for the candidates set up by the Congress, grave dissatisfaction has been
expressed at the reappearance of legislators with dubious records, and the
recruitment of others from powerful monied interests. Considerations based on
merit and achievement have not had their due weight. And, despite Nehru’s
earnest desire, few have been <i>invited </i>to contest on behalf of the
Congress, the choice being confined to applicants. But, subject to these
unwelcome features, the selection is in the main satisfactory. An organisation
which has had the wisdom to select from the South such trusted servants of the
nation as Giri, Avinashilingam, Tirumala Rao, Ananthasayanam Aiyangar and Durga
Bai, cannot be unworthy of esteem and support. And it has chosen fresh entrants
like Sri K. Raghuramaiah, who threw up a Law secretaryship in Madras to devote
himself to public life. The Congress rose to great heights in the past, and,
under proper guidance, it will once again prove worthy of the confidence of the
Indian democracy. But the drift to a one-party domination has to be checked by
a well-knit, intelligent Opposition, which can function efficiently and with
due restraint, bearing in mind that it may be called upon at any moment to
shoulder the burdens of office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Winston Churchill is back in office as Prime Minister, with a narrow
Conservative majority of lees than twenty. He hopes to annex a dozen seats by
reviving the representation of the Universities which have generally supported
his Party; but this move has been put off for the present. His effort to win
over the small group of Liberals under Mr. Clement Davies has not succeeded. It
was, in fact, the Liberal voters’ swing to the Right which determined the final
result of the elections, but the Party chiefs are unwilling to efface
themselves by a virtual merger with the Conservatives. A feature of the
election was the superiority in number of the total poll in favour of Labour,
though Labour’s strength in the House suffered a<i> </i>notable decrease. It is
yet to be seen for what length of time Mr. Churchill will be able to retain
power, in the face of an Opposition almost equal in strength and determined to
fight relentlessly. Within the Conservative fold are several who would prefer
Mr. Eden to Mr. Churchill. And prophets foresee an early overthrow of Mr.
Churchill from the leadership of the Party. Meanwhile this old war-horse is
carrying on with his accustomed vigour and enthusiasm. The King’s speech gives
an indication of the new Prime Minister’s domestic and foreign policy. State
supervison rather than State ownership of industries like steel and coal is
envisaged. In Persia and in Egypt, the British Government will pursue a policy
of firmness, while trying at the same time to negotiate with Russia in the
interests of peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
has cause to rejoice that she won Independence when a progressive statesman
like Mr. Attlee was in power. It is difficult to imagine the die-hard Mr.
Churchill agreeing to what he once termed as the liquidation of the Empire. Now
that Indian Independence is an accomplished fact, Mr. Churchill cannot put back
the clock. As for possible Anglo-American intrigues on the Kashmir issue, Mr.
Churchill, as a shrewd realist, can be trusted not to push matters too far, for
that might involve a risk of India openly aligning herself with Russia and
China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
the frenzy of political assassination overspreading Eastern lands should have
taken its toll of a front-rank statesman like Liaquat Ali Khan is very much to
be deplored. As the right-hand man of Jinnah and as an architect of Pakistan,
Liaquat Ali endeared himself to his Muslim co-religionists. By his suave manner
and spirit of accommodation, he won the respect of Nehru and other Indian
leaders despite the strained relations between the two new States. He was
vehement in speech but moderate in action, so that while he kept his hold on
his turbulent followers, he always refused to take the final step that might
precipitate war with India. An accomplished scholar and gentleman, and an
admirer of India’s past, he played a notable part in recent Indian history.
India mourns the loss of a great son who served the cause of progress according
to his lights. When the dust of acrimonious controversies is laid, and India
and Pakistan settle down under normal conditions as friendly neighbours, the
memory of Liaquat Ali Khan will be cherished on both sides of the border.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was feared that, with his passing away, the more fanatical elements in
Pakistan’s public life would gain the upper hand. But the new Prime Minister,
Kwaja Nazimuddin, has adopted a conciliatory tone in his utterances. The Prime
Ministers of India and Pakistan are anxious to settle all outstanding
differences by peaceful negotiations. The conoept of a theocratic State has
become an obsession with the leaders of Pakistan, and this has coloured their
outlook and influenced their treatment of non-Muslim minorities in the State.
It is to soon to expect a change in this outlook, but so long as the will to
peace is present, the hope of a settlement persists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

age of forty-two. While yet a student of the Noble College, Masulipatnam, he
made his <i>debut </i>as a poet in English. Later he was a post-graduate
student of English literature at the Benaras Hindu University, where he won
golden opinions from Prof. U.C. Nag, Head of the Department of English. As
Professor of English at Bikaner, Poona, Bijapur, and Bombay, he won the love of
his students; they were stimulated by his personal example to admire the
classics of English literature as well as post-war poetry and fiction. In a
series of volumes of verse, he expressed himself with remarkable felicity of
phrase, giving rein to a picturesque imagination. There was an element of
heaviness in his early productions, whether verse or prose, but with maturity
came ease of craftsmanship. He wrote excellent critical essays, edited
anthologies of Indo-English poetry and literary critici8m, and lectured to
appreciative audiences on cultural topics. His love of English was combined with
devotion to Telugu, and he attained a high level as a writer of Telugu short
stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

West. He was positive that Indian writers of English verse and prose could

a ‘foreign’ medium. He and his fellow literary artists are entitled to the

September, Bhushan promised to induce his Gujarati and Marathi colleagues at

The Editor hoped that, some day, he could welcome Bhushan at the poet’s
home-town of Masulipatam, but, instead, it fell to him to preside at the
condolence meeting held to mourn his demise. Such is the irony of Fate!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

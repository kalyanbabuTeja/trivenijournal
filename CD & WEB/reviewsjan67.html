style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
that intriguing question ‘After Nehru, who or what?’ has, in fact, been
answered, quite a few political writers seem to divert themselves with the
other question “Nehru’s India–whither or what?” It might be something of an
irony of fate that some of his old critics have since found it a profitable
hobby to find fault with his successors for not continuing his well-known
policies. On the other hand, some of his erstwhile admirers feel slightly
superior and derive a curious satisfaction from the new-found habit of
‘dispassionate’ analysis, in which they claim to find Nehru wanting in many
substantial respects. Mr. Walter Crocker, the Australian diplomat, in his <i>Contemporary’s
Estimate, </i>runs the risk of falling into the second category. He professes
to have been an ardent admirer of Nehru the man, though, when the reader is not
yet half through the book, the ardour cools off perceptibly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
his approach to Nehru, an observer like Mr. Crocker starts with a distinct
advantage. He can afford to be rather dispassionate, for he may remain
comparatively uncommitted. Not that in this case he is actually uncommitted. At
best, it is a semblance, at worst a pretension. Academically, it is just
possible that he can retain a certain balance. But does this balance always
imply that the writer should neatly cancel out every achievement with a black
mark for something else, momentous or trivial? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Crocker was in India for over six years between 1952 and 1962 as head of the
Australian mission (and later as High Commissioner) and had ample opportunities
to watch his subject at close quarters and study it in every detail. He does
justice to his own powers of description in presenting a vivid close-up of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
Indian Prime Minister; proud and chivalrous, sensitive and artistic, noble and
generous, impatient and irritable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is hardly possible to belittle the role of Gandhi and Nehru as the twin
apostles of Indian freedom and yet try to understand them as patriots and
political leaders. But this is just what Mr. Crocker would do, in his ingenious
excursion into political affairs. Now for a gem of political wisdom, one of the
many, he drops on the wayside, with a calculated prodigality: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Nehru’s
record for intransigence has to be stressed because there is grave question
whether his way of getting independence for India was the only way, or indeed a
good way. Equally patriotic and equally clever Indians – Indians, such as
Sapru, thought not.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
conveniently he forgets (or is he so blissfully unaware of the basic facts of
the history of Indian politics?) that but for the ‘intransigence’ of Nehru and
the millions who thought with him, there would not be the freedom that we know
of. And as for Sapru and company, it was true that they were as <i>clever</i>
as Nehru, or <i>cleverer</i> still, but all their <i>cleverness</i> could make
no dent on the <i>intransigence</i> of the British rulers for decades. And,
pray, who told Mr. Crocker that Nehru was <i>clever</i>? He was known to be
intelligent, yes, thoughtful and far-sighted; but far from being clever. Not
even his worst enemies could say that she was <i>clever</i> or <i>cunning</i>
(which Mr. Crocker does hint at directly or indirectly more than once in his
own attempts to be subtle as an analyst of human character and the political
situation). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two major issues on which Mr. Crocker virtually write Mr. Nehru off as a
statesman are the Sino-Indian dispute (leading to the invasion by China) and
the Goa problem, which was settled, once for all, by the India Government
occupying the Portuguese territory (actually, the Indian enclaves under
Portuguese hegemony, because of a historical accident, traceable to a
long-forgotten matrimonial deal between two European dynasties). On the Chinese
aggression, the author writes under the assumption that India was as much to
blame as China (luckily for us, he does not go as far as Bertrand Russell, who
seemed to feel that India was more to blame and should, therefore, make it up
with China).</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
assumes that a border dispute with China is just a border dispute, and that
Communist China is just like any other Asian or European State. Is Mr. Croker
so simple as not to realise that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as the leader of
militant communism in Asia and Africa, China has its own political dialectic
and military strategy? And it attacks not where it is most provoked from, but
where it knows that the other side is least protected. Hong Kong is still in
tact and Formosa is left untouched. Was there ever no provocation from the latter?
But Peking knows the strength of the American Seventh Fleet only too well. And
as for the other Asian neighbours, it knows how to pick and choose. But every
country will have its turn, in due course, may be not excluding Pakistan. If
the first blow fell on India, as the spearhead of a different way of life
(parliamentary democracy, socialist planning, personal liberty and so on), it
should not surprise any student of current affairs, not in the least, a shrewd
diplomat like Mr. Crocker. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
Goa Mr. Crocker chooses to be even more harsh and less perspicacious. He
suggests, almost like a leader of the opposition in the Indian Parliament, that
it was a put-up job and a sort of pre-election stunt. He stops at nothing, for
a man of his restraint: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

biographers, if they care for the high moral reputation which he had enjoyed
for so long, and for its decline, will have to seek for the reasons, which led
him to Goa, no less than for the reasons which led to his stand on Kashmir.
Until then, Nehru remains charged with machiavellianism….Nehru in spite of Goa,
was no hypocrite and no impostor...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author must have heard of Pondicherry and how its future was peacefully settled
by the French Government, whose title to it was no worse than that of the Portuguese.
The surprise was not that the occupation of Goa came off the way it did in
1962, but that it did not come earlier. He may also be aware of the Portugese
colonial methods in Angola and Mozambique. That they got a beating where they
deserved most should not have riled Mr. Crocker unduly. India’s territorial
sovereignty over the enclaves had been proved to the hilt by Mr. V. K. K. Menon
and Mr. Nehru himself. He seemed, however, to strain at a gnat in this as in
many other things in his account, the same author who could swallow camels
elsewhere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the overall estimate itself, Mr. Crocker, the career diplomat that he can never
cease to be even as an author, tends to scrutinise the life and work of Nehru
as if he were sitting in judgment over the confidential record of a junior
civil servant. Only too rarely do the realisation dawn on him that Nehru Was
the prime architect of the Indian Revolution, unfinished though it be (as it
must needs be continuing), besides being the first Prime Minister of Free India
and the leader of the freedom struggle in India and also its inspirer in some
of the other countries in Asia and Africa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the character of Krishna Menon, the author has something to say that comes near
the truth; and he says it with admirable subtlety. To the credit of Mr.
Crocker, it must be said that there is no padding in his book, which is tightly
packed with facts, opinions and arguments. But there is little in it, by way of
a transforming sympathy or a deep understanding of the subject to enthuse over
the publication, Prof. Toynbee’s good chit notwithstanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

benefit of Nehru himself as well the far-flung readers. In a way, it would
hardly be an exaggeration to state that he had shared, indirectly though, in
the task of evolving India’s foreign policy through the years. He rightly considers
Nehru, in foreign policy as in other things, the great educator. Here is his

as a success or failure. It keeps growing. But he saw the validity of some
principles, however much they are broken in practice. The Five Principles of
Peace remained valid for him, whatever may have happened. He annotated
co-existence into peaceful co-existence. He worked passionately for the future
and instructed Indian delegations to the U. N. to put their weight on the side
of peace, disarmament and international cooperation. He brought peace to Korea
and Indo-China. He sent Indian troops on mercy missions. He was not interested
in the meta-physics of non-violence, though he accepted its morality. He disliked
wars, the wars of history, imperialism’s wars, fascism’s wars and even cold
war…..”</p>

study of Hindu personality and culture, from the point of view of
psycho-analysis, attempted by the author in this book, on the other hand, leads
to the conclusion that Hindu culture, and he includes Buddhism and Jainism in
his conception of Hindu culture, is psychological theory which accounts for the
characteristic religious attitudes, philosophical doctrines, and social
practices, of Yoga, tapasya, satyagraha, nishkama karma and anatha, caste, the
village goddess cult, and the popular mythologies, and presents them as the
different phases and facets of the same personality type and cultural

explains that he has used them in his study in a scientific spirit, as
hypotheses to direct attention to truth which is not easily reached in any

range of the study attempted is so comprehensive, the knowledge of the subject
exhibited so detailed and accurate, and the explanation offered and conclusions
arrived at so logical, consistent and convincing and conducive to national
integration in the present and concerted endeavour towards adaptation to modern
circumstances and future progress, that the Indian reader is sure to be tempted

is a new, readable commentary in English on the Bhagavadgita by Sri Rohit
Mehta, an eminEnt Theosophist and art international lecturer. There are some
novel features in this commentary. Even in naming the chapters the author has
shown his originality. The 12th and the 13th chapters, for instance, are named
as “The one without a home” and the “Silent watcher” respectively. The author
selects a few slokas only in each chapter and expounds them in such a manner
that each chapter reads as a lecture coherent and complete in itself. He does
not delve deep into the technical subtleties of textual interpretations on
traditional lines. Nor does he devote himself to polemics. His approach is
psychological and practical, his presentation of the subject is clear and
analytical, so much so, this commentary has a direct appeal to the busy modern
man, who cannot wade through the traditional classical commentaries on the
Gita. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the opinion of the author, the Gita is a book dealing with the Yoga of

the three paths of (1) knowledge (2) devotion and (3) action as well. The Gita

Bhagavadgita, the author declares, enunciates the gospel of right action which
is possible through right perception alone, which again can be obtained through
Yoga which is defined in the Gita in three places as (1) dissociation from that
which gives an association with sorrow (2) equilibrium and (3) skill in action.
Dissociation from the three qualities, <i>sattva</i>, <i>rajas</i> and <i>tamas</i>
gives equilibrium. This gives skill in action, when man achieves right
perception, he becomes an integrated man <i>Yukta</i> and the creation of an
integrated individual is the purpose and the dynamic message of the Gita. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

most significant and interesting contribution that the author makes, consists
in the symbolical and Psychological interpretation of many of the words that we
come across in the text. Srikrishna represents the cosmic will and Arjuna
represents the individual will. The Kurukshetra war is only symbolical of this
inner war of two wills….<i>Yukta</i> or integrated man is one who combines in
himself knowledge, devotion and action. Samkhya and Yoga can be described as
right perception and right action (p, 22). Action without attachment is action
done not out of necessity but out of spontaneity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

meaning and purpose of an Avatara is scientifically explained with suitable
illustrations. The word <i>Vikarma </i>means reaction but not wrong action. The
state where all reactions drop away is <i>Akarma </i>or inaction which
corresponds to the skillness of mind (p. 48). To sacrifice is to be a witness
to oneself. The relation between Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga is that of
experience and expression (p. 56). The two lines of thought, Occultism and
Mystic approach, are seen in Samkhya and Yoga (p. 62). Knowledge is tuition
from without and wisdom is tuition from within...To think upon Him at the time
of death is, according to the author, but cessation of thought (p. 87). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Fire, light, daytime, bright fortnight and
Uttarayana mentioned in the 8th chapter represent the condition of alertness,
clarity of mind, period of action, feeling of abiding love and clear
consciousness. To see one self in the midst of routine of daily life, as a
witness, is the essence of Japa Yajria (p. 101). The saying of the Lord that
“He is the gambling of the cheat” means that the mystic and the devotee who can
gamble away their lives, and who in their communion with the unborn and the
unmanifest play high stakes in the game of life, find themselves in possession
of Life Eternal. </p>

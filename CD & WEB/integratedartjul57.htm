activity of the mind and the spirit in our country in the ancient past, and
even right up to the end of the later Middle Ages, seems to have been characterised
by synthesis and integration. Its ultimate objective, clearly and constantly
visualised, imposed upon it a unity truly remarkable. During this vast stretch
of time India occasionally lost her power, and even a substantial portion of
her fabled wealth, her throne and sceptre; but she never lost her soul. This
final disaster possibly overtook her since the political twilight of the 17th
century and the subsequent darkness of foreign domination and emasculation of
the 18th and 19th centuries, not suddenly but by slow and imperceptible
degrees. Renaissance, they say, commenced in the 20th century; and the promise
is held out that, in the era of peace and plenty that has dawned since
independence, it would reach its consummation. Perhaps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the present century all our activity of the higher and nobler type appears to
have suffered a sea-change. Maybe, it is due to the impact of the Scientific
Attitude or Outlook, or Approach. And synthesis and integration have given
place to the new order of analysis and specialisation. But what began as
analysis and specialisation seems to have degenerated into vivisection and
compartmentalisation; and lopsided monstrosity masquerades in the garb of
intensive development. This is as much true of Art as of any other branch of
human activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Architecture,
Sculpture and Painting are aptly called the ‘Allied Arts.’ This Trinity
apparently achieved in the past a unity that made it impossible to regard them
as anything except indivisible. That they should be distinct and separate
entities must have been hardly conceivable. The temple affords a typical
illustration of our argument. Architecture in this abode of worship provides
the opportunity for the display of sculpture and painting. While architecture
itself is subordinated to canonical discipline, sculpture and painting serve as
but decorative elements strictly contributing to the sum total of aesthetic
effect. Only as organic parts of a grand design do sculpture and painting
manifest themselves, the one in the bas-reliefs, along the <i>toranas, </i>in
the niches, by the brackets, and on the pillars; and the other as frescoes on
the ceilings and as scrolls along corridors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
however, they seem to have parted company. Presumably, engaged in an endeavour
of self-determination each one of them is seeking to fulfill an individual and
unique destiny. Look at the palace of a Jute King for an example of our thesis.
Architecture goes in search of a private mansion; sculpture stands apart on a
pedestal; and painting is mounted on the easel. While the building itself
reveals Indo-Persian influences, a Graeco-Roman statuette spouts water in the
fountain, and a Futurist drawing embelishes the calendar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
discerning critic of art cannot fail to perceive four fairly clear-cut stages
in the history of the basic concept that motivates and governs all artistic
activity. They may be called, for want of more adequate nomenclature by the
rather popular slogans– (a) ‘Art for God’s Sake,’ (b) ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ (c)
‘Art for My Sake’, and (d) ‘Art for Peoples’ Sake’. This classification of
course denotes an analytical and not necessarily a chronological approach. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
in the development of the central theme of this essay, a few generalisations
have to be indulged in: it is clear, they are not merely germane to the issue
but they are unavoidable, considering the nature of the subject. No judgment on
the merits and message of Mohenjo-daro art will be hazarded here, for in the
first place expert opinion has not yet crystallised in this respect; and in the
second, the data available is insufficient. So, it may be taken that the Allied
Arts in India stepped out of the mists of legend and myth onto the solid earth
of History in the Buddhist Era; from this point onwards till practically the
end of the Early Middle Ages or the 15th century, the principle of ‘Art for
God’s Sake’ serves as the key to the significance of Indian artistic creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
the Artist dedicated himself to the service of God, viewing his creative work
as but a species of worship; and architecture, sculpture and painting were
blended into an amazing harmony, sweet and satisfying, since they had a sense
of direction and singleness of purpose–that is, towards Heaven and the praise
of His Glory. The Stupas exemplified architecture, the Bodhi-sattvas and the
Buddhas exhibited sculpture, while the numerous Jatakas supplied an
inexhaustible theme for all the frescoes at Ajanta From the temple of Martanda
in Kashmir to the temple of the Virgin at the Cape, there was but one
endeavour: to give Divinity a form and a place. Rajput, Kangra or Pahari–no
matter to which school he belonged–the painter had a story ready to hand: <i>The
story </i>of Radha and Krishna; all he need do was to reveal the cunning of his
workmanship in a myriad subtleties of line and colour and design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
would of course be an inexcusable oversimplification of the issue to say that
during these many centuries no secular art was produced; but it would be quite
in order to say that it was the exception and not the rule. Seldom did a
painter essay to derive the sensuous pleasure of a keen and unswerving line, or
the purity and lustre of colour for their own sake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
soon as the Artist started to pursue ends other than God, of alien ends such as
aestheticism, his own self, or the modern myth called the People, the Allied
Arts appear to have been separated each from the other. The Grand Alliance was
indeed broken; architecture, sculpture and painting since then have gone their
distinct and individual ways and these ways scarcely show any tendency to
converge once again. Artists these days are specialists, in fact, purists; and
each art in the Trinity has mustered its own votaries, and evolved its own
ritual and dogma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Does
this mean the liberation of Sculpture and Painting from Architecture? Or is it
disintegration of the Trinity? Doubtless, an irreconcilable individualist would
interpret the process as liberation, eminently desirable in the interests of
enabling each art to realise its immense potentialities to the full. Each art
is to be regarded as an end in itself, and has to be practised for its own
sake. That is the reason why, perhaps, no common end can be discovered which a
modem piece of architecture, of sculpture, of painting, selected at random and
on merits, may conjointly sub-serve. If perchance they reveal any affinity, it
is more by accident than by design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cult of aestheticism which is neatly epitomised in the phrase ‘Art for Art’s
Sake’ was sedulously followed in the later Middle Ages. The Indo-Persian art
fulfilled itself by satisfying the instinct for beauty of the Mogul Emperors,
or the lesser princes, both Hindu and Muslim, that came under the imperial
sphere of influence. Architecture attains its meridian in the Hall of Audience,
which bears the inscription: ‘If there is a heaven, it is here’; craftsmanship
reaches its perfection in the Mogul miniature; and a painter in the court of
Shah Jehan excelled because he could handle a brush with but one hair of a
squirrel to draw a line with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
might be called religious<i> </i>art<i> </i>did not cease to be created in this
age; temples and mosques were built, images were carved and gods and godlings
continued to be drawn. Still, the entire output of the period cannot fail to
produce the impression that it was an art which pitifully struggled to deify
man, and not humanise God as was done in the days of old.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Or,
to take an example from the West. It was at this time that a painting with a
story, a painter with a message, were decried as irrelevencies; in fact, they
were even condemned as detractions from the pure aesthetic appeal of a work of
art. G. F. Watts, for instance, with his Allegories, was rejected as ‘out of
fashion’; while Whistler, with his ‘nocturnes’ was raised to the dizzy eminence
of a ‘painter for painters’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Afterwards
followed an era of experimentation, whose guiding motto seems to be ‘Art for My
Sake’. Artists seem to have been possessed by a craze for ‘originality’; and an
orgy of ‘isms’ developed–‘Impressionsim’, ‘Post-impressionsim’, ‘Cubism’,
‘Futurism’, ‘Expressionism’, ‘Dadaism’, ‘Vorticism.’ Possibly, a conspiracy of
adverse circumstances cut the Artist adrift on a sea of spiritual chaos; or
maybe, a real mood of introspection overtook him. His own self became the
supreme end of art; for all aesthetic activity is but an extension of his
personality. Some looked at nature as a mosaic of splashes of pure, opaque
colour; while some others reduced all living beings into an assemblage of a few
cubes. Thus each artist fashioned a language of his own–singular and absolutely
unlike anything known before–to express his own private agonies, yearnings,
passions. But mankind at large seemed to have looked at their work and “passed
by on the other side.” Soon the critics who sang the achievements of these
‘pioneers’ exhausted themselves; the Manets, the Monets, Piccassos, Cezannes,
and the rest of them had had their short term booms; and it may safely be
predicted that whatever might be the fate of these ‘pioneers’, a universal
slump has already engulfed the movements credited to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last, in the age in which we live and move, Art is supposed to be “for peoples’
Sake.” Communism, it is claimed in certain quarters, is the modern and
effective substitute for Religion. In the Communist philosophy the State usurps
the piece of God; the individual is subordinated to, and all his activity is
directed towards, the glorification of the State. Consequently a certain unity
is imposed from top on all aesthetic activity; regimentation as it is sometimes
called–integrated nonetheless. Individuality is the fundamental criterion of
all creative art in its origin, albeit its end-product acquires the stamp of
universality. But under Communism, the omni-competent Leviathan called the
State liquidates the individual; thus, in such a State indoctrination is
camouflaged as education of the people, and art is prostituted as the tool of
propaganda to keep the people enslaved to the State. ‘Art for Peoples’ Sake’ is
a commendable ideal, if </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

but in the Communistic climate it is nothing but the henchman of the Party and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
has not been left unaffected by these later-day developments in the realm of
art. Indeed, the ‘isms’ that arose in France found an echo in our country; for
quite a section of our artistic circles is only too ready to ape the West; in
point of fact, the discarded orthodoxies of yesterday of Europe become the
fashionable heterodoxies of today in India. But let us hope that this is but a
passing phase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

now to conclude: In this essay, with all possible objectivity, an analytical
estimate of the broad currents of art movements and their guiding principles
has been attempted. Nothing is extenuated; nor is aught set down in malice. I
disclaim any intention to pass a judgment on any aspect of art evolution, or to
pronounce a verdict on any artist and his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

article has been provoked by a doubt. Since the time when the principle ‘Art
for God’s Sake’ ceased to function, a liberation movement seems to have been
started. The impression is inescapable that what started as liberation ended as
disintegration. For, is it altogether a coincidence that the periods of
spiritual and aesthetic chaos corresponded with the other three principles
which one by one held the field? May it not be inferred that the process of
disintegration was completed in the age when the ruling motto was ‘Art for My
Sake’? Could architecture, sculpture and painting be any longer called Allied
Arts except by way of a euphemism?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from this, has the liberation movement, if there was one, succeeded in
achieving its objectives? It is a moot point whether the separated arts
developed any individuality, but it is absolutely certain that they lost their
underlying unity. The mistaken principles and the steady aesthetic
deterioration must have acted and reacted as cause and effect. In what way have
the scattered arts progressed? Can any modern painting compare with an Old
Master? Can any contemporary image be put on a par with the Trimurti? Is there
any name in the 20th century world that deserves to be uttered in the same
breath as that of Leonardo or that unknown genius who painted the Bodhisattva </span><span

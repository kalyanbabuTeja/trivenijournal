interesting aspect of the modern Western education in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has been
the creative release of the feminine sensibility. The history of modern <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> bears a
testimony to the fact that women in this country have not only shared the
exciting and dangerous burdens of the struggle for independence, but have also
articulated the national impulse and the awareness of cultural change in the
realm of art and literature. In the personality of <span class=SpellE>Sarojini</span>
<span class=SpellE>Naidu</span>, the temper of Indian womanhood achieved sit
comprehensive synthesis; “She was not only the lark of the Indian political
awakening but also the nightingale of the Indian imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the field of the
English Novel, women novelists like Jane Austen and George Eliot, Bronte
sisters and Mrs. Gaskell, Dorothy Richardson and Virginia <span class=SpellE>Woolf</span>
have already established their own “great tradition”; and today a woman
novelist in England, lacking neither a room of her own nor financial
independence, can well compete with the male counterparts. In the development
of the Indo-English novel, the women writers have also achieved a <span
class=GramE>remarkable<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>imaginative</span>
self-sufficiency which merits recognition in spite of<span

limitations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

conceded, are natural story-tellers <span class=SpellE>irespective</span> of
the fact that they don’t write or publish. And in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

class=SpellE>marvellous</span> Toru <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> wrote both <span
class=GramE>a French</span> and an English novel in her teens (she died at the
age of 21 in 1877). Her two novels <i>Bianca, or The Young Spanish Maiden </i>and
<i>Le Journal de <span class=SpellE>Mademoicelle</span> <span class=SpellE>d’Arvers</span>

<span class=SpellE>Satthianadhan’s</span> <i>Kamala, </i>a <i>Story of Hindu

<span class=SpellE>Hussain</span>, in her novel <span class=SpellE><i>Purdah</i></span><i>
and Polygamy; Life in an Indian Muslim Household </i>(1944) has also tried with
commendable success to present the currents and conflicts in a typical Muslim
family. As the title suggests the <span class=SpellE>purdah</span> and polygamy
are the twin evils which need to be attacked in the traditional Muslim society.
The novelist has artistically projected how Kabir, the chief character in the
novel, marries four wives mainly to satisfy his lust, taking advantage of the
religious sanction, how the mother-in-law is a dreaded tyrant, how the poor,
helpless women are socially compelled to spend all their lives behind the <span
class=SpellE>purdah</span> only, and how, finally <span class=SpellE>Akram</span>,
the son of Kabir, reacts violently against the hide-bound superstitions and
obsolete customs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Zohra’s</span> proud father, the <span class=SpellE>Nawab</span>

Heavens”. She stands torn<i> </i>between the old feudal and conventional social
life that was fading fast being replaced by new resurgent life and nationalism.
Modern politics of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> era have also been deftly
interwoven into the texture of this poignant story of a sensitive girl’s life
whose face even in death appears as a “face that has been filtered through
sorrow and suffering”. It is a touching story of Muslim social life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hindi dramatist, earned a sudden tremendous reputation with the publication of
her maiden attempt in Indo-English fiction. <span class=SpellE><i>Ambapali</i></span><i>

<span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span>, the ancient Machiavelli, there is the
Buddha, preaching his gospels and showing his path leading to the “<span

<span class=SpellE>Hossain’s</span> novel <i>Sunlight on a Broken Column </i>(1961)
and her earlier collection of short stories, <i>Phoenix Fled </i>(1953)
describe how at the time of partition, a Muslim family<i> </i>escaped to
Pakistan leaving behind their<i> </i>old grand-mother, who later on buries
under her burning house. <i>Sunlight on a Broken Column, </i>autobiographical
in its form, describes the life of a narrator–heroine <span class=SpellE>Laila</span>
from an orphan girl of fifteen to the widowed mother of a girl of that period.
It is a sensitive portrayal of the privileged class and its pangs of
extinction. In a period of twenty years, as <span class=SpellE>Laila’s</span>
fortunes<i> </i>change, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
too moves from colonialism to independence, losing old feudal order, its
property, privileges and poise, giving room to the exertion, strain,
frustration and toil of<i> </i>the post-independence era. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The book is not so much a “case” against <span
class=SpellE>Purdah</span> as a well-shaped, genuinely felt reconstruction of
life in such conditions, its collisions with the modern World, and the
astonishingly tough-minded women it breeds. She writes from a Muslim point of
view about the intense life of the Muslim family. Her study of <span
class=SpellE>Laila</span> is very firm, clear, and sympathetic, and exhibits
the sort of dilemma which the overwhelming <span class=SpellE>claustraphobic</span>
life of the family in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
tends to bring about–the character with a bias to independence and solitariness
who becomes almost a solipsist in reaction to the smothering family. In Miss <span
class=SpellE>Hossain’s</span> sensitive novel there is an attractive Persian
glitter, a kind of strange dignity, a mare masculine force in the character of
the women than one often gets in other Indian novels. This complicated and
impressive novel keeps a number of different themes smoothly in play and firmly
in order. The tense bitter <span class=SpellE>Laila</span> evokes in her
character and suffering a great section of life in the Indian sub-continent
which has been rarely heard of from the inside–the woman <span class=SpellE>smouldering</span>,
<span class=SpellE>snobbing</span> and suffocating in <span class=SpellE>Purdha</span>.

class=SpellE>Das’s</span> <i>Into the Sun (1933) </i>is one of the first works
produced under the impact of Mahatma Gandhi. The aim of the author is to show
how under the impact of the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> movement, the
very face of Indian social life was changing. The focal point is the
traditional Indian woman. The new set of values that are set afloat by the
reformative national movement, transforms an orthodox, diehard Brahmin family<i>
</i>into an ideal product of the cultural synthesis of modern <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Rama <span
class=SpellE>Devi</span>, the chief character of the novel, is symbolic of the
emancipated Indian womanhood. A young widow, condemned<i> </i>by the cruel
conventions to a secluded life, she is irresistibly drawn into the vortex of
non-violent freedom struggle–a struggle as much personal for her, as it is
national. “Confronted by her mother, representing the decadent orthodoxy, Rama <span
class=SpellE>Devi</span>, the ‘<span class=SpellE>Asuryampasya</span>’
triumphantly marches into the sun.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>fictionalised</span> the problems of the new generation of young
women <span class=GramE>falling</span> an easy prey to the enticing and
dangerous guiles of the modern and so-called sophisticated society. It is a
pleasing fictional song of the protagonist’s passage from the stage of romantic
innocence to that of marital experience. In contrast to her compatriots, <span

canvas to paint the complete picture of the renascent <st1:country-region

the <span class=SpellE>Ghandhian</span> era. It is this image of <st1:country-region

transition that <span class=SpellE>Chitale</span> attempts to describe in her
novel <i>In Transit </i>(1950). A Maharashtrian joint family with its destiny
dependent on the national <span class=GramE>movement,</span> forms the pivot of
the story. The narrative is woven from the warp and woof of the changes being
noiselessly effected in the lives of Indian families of culture and prestige.
Apart from the artistic <span class=SpellE>subsumption</span> of the vast
horizons of national experience, the novel presents vivid vignettes of the
joint Hindu family. It is generally said that the Hindu joint family is
breaking rapidly under the stress of modern forces, but, in this all round and
rapid metamorphosis, some may think it desirable to have preserved in a
permanent form a faithful picture of the cultural traditions, mental equipment
and customary observance of such families before their extinction becomes
complete. Viewed from this angle, this novel, written in a flowing and fervid
style, is a remarkable success. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writing for many years and has contributed innumerable articles, stories,
literary essays to various journals and magazines of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and abroad. Winner of a
number of first prizes in short-story competitions, she writes for the B. B. C.
frequently and has four books to her credit<i>-<span class=SpellE>Minari</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Neuer</span> a Dull moment, A Birthday Present </i>and <i>The
Sisters. <span class=SpellE>Minari</span> </i>is her first attempt at
fiction-writing and is a passionate story of love and politics set in a
hill-station of present day <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Despite credible characterization, an uncontrived plot and smoothly flowing
narrative, the novel fails to impress. As an immature artist, <span
class=SpellE>Dalal</span> in this ~book oversimplifies the things with the use
of popular psychology, insists on stating the obvious and fails to explore the
full potential of the interesting theme. \<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not a great work of art, but then the greening of the novelist is more

towards the novelist’s steady and assured progress to maturity. <i>The Sisters,

All her novels are full of local <span class=SpellE>colour</span> and <span

none-too-wise, and the old who are cool, calculating and rigid. She describes
the head on collision between the traditional and the modern, the East and the
West, and the confusion that follows in the wake of these collisions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>This Time of Morning </i>(1965), <i>Storm in <span class=SpellE>Chandigarh</span>
</i>(1960), and <i>The Day in Shadow </i>(1971), she writes about<i> </i>those
areas of life which she has known intimately and of which she has direct and
first hand experience. It is the upper strata, including the Upper middle
class, landlords, bureaucrats, business executives, industrialists,
administrators, politicians, university professors, diplomats and wealthy
well-to-dos in general. <i>A Time to be Happy </i>discusses the problem
springing from the slowly evolving<i> </i>socio-political situation in the
country in the turbulent forties: the theme of adjustment to a shifting
political panorama in a country struggling to be free. In <i>This Time of
Morning, </i>the author stands for the new humanism and a new morality,
according to which a woman is not to be taken a mere toy, an object of<i> </i>lust
and momentary pleasure, but man’s equal and <span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
partner. <i>Storm in <span class=SpellE>Chandigarh</span> </i>and <i>The Day in
Shadow </i>repeat the theme of “lack of sympathy and understanding between
man-woman <span class=GramE>relationship</span>”. In <i>The Day in Shadow </i>Mrs.
<span class=SpellE>Sahgal</span> has tried to figure out something that has
happened to her – the shattering experience of divorce. She has also tried to
show how even in a free country like ours, where women are equal <span

creating a ripple. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anita Desai, another
young, promising writer, rose to eminence with the publication of her first
novel, <i>Cry, the Peacock </i>(1963), which portrays a character
psychologically, a story of psychical, intangible happenings, through the
married life of Maya and <span class=SpellE>Gautama</span>, where a word, a
look, a gesture are as important events as the deceptive half-lights and the
brooding darkness. The distinctive style, intensely individual imagery with
sensuous richness is curiously characteristic of Maya’s hyper-sensitive
temperament. Anita’s next<i> </i>novel <i>Voices in the City </i>(1965)
describes the corrosive effects of city life upon an Indian family.’ The focus
here is on human futility. It is not a novel of action or character, but of
atmosphere, the atmosphere of doom and destruction, which the characters and
action help realize. The <span class=SpellE>sombre</span> atmosphere reminds
one of the cosmic tragedy in Emile Bronte’s <i>The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Wathering</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Heights</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. </i>Her third novel <i>Bye-bye
Blackbird </i>(1971) does not describe any mental or emotional state of an
individual’s mind. This time the author gives a refreshingly new treatment to a
familiar, weighty and topical theme of <span class=SpellE>coloured</span>
immigrants who have a difficult time in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>; and to whom that country
says “bye-bye” not always very politely. Against this background, the novelist
forges divers and powerful theme through vivid portrayal of Indian characters
steeped in a unique love-hatred relationship with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. There are <span
class=SpellE>Devs</span> among the “blackbirds” <span class=GramE>who</span>
prefer to stay on in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
though it means putting up with insults. On the other hand, there are
immigrants like <span class=SpellE>Adit</span>, in whom the insulting
environment creates nausea and aggravates homesickness. Although <span
class=SpellE>Adit</span> and his English wife Sarah decide to return to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> at the
end of the book, one can see this is not suggested as a solution to their basic
dilemma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In spite of a score of
weaknesses, it must be admitted that these women-writers are working, and their
novels on the whole have life and substance and present a convincing picture of
human existence. The total picture is one of hope. It may also be seen that
women have a more important role in Indo-English literature than their sisters
in any of the Indian languages. One of the major factors responsible for this
is that they all have come from the higher economic, social and educated strata
of Indian society–most of them educated abroad and thoroughly <span
class=SpellE>westernised</span> in their outlook. There can be no two opinions
that a good, sound education in English gives a woman-writer a big and
thrilling start in the writing career. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

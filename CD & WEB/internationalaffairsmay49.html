<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
long-expected conference of Dominion Prime Ministers has met and the
constitutional issue for the settlement of which it was assumed to have been
called has been settled to the satisfaction of all and that in a spirit of
complete harmony and friendliness. The question that it had to decide was
whether a Republic could become and remain a member of the Commonwealth. This
arose in consequence of the determination of India to become a Republic. All along
it was only the Dominions who accepted the Crown as the common constitutional
link that were admitted to the membership of the Commonwealth. This was
emphasized in the Balfour Declaration of 1926 which has all these years formed
the basis of Dominion Status. If India had no desire to continue to be actively
associated with Britain and with the other members of the Commonwealth the
question would not have arisen at all. As a Republic she will have to go
outside the Commonwealth. But the Indian National Congress as well as the front
rank leaders of the country expressed themselves in favour of intimate
association with the Commonwealth being continued. Britain as well as the other
members were also equally anxious for the continuance of the association. Hence
arose the constitutional issue. Now it has been settled that there is no
inconsistency between India becoming a Republic and her continuing as a full
and equal member of the Commonwealth of Nations.</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
does this involve? As a Republic India will be completely sovereign and
independent. The President of the Republic will exercise the functions hitherto
performed by the King and the latter will not have any constitutional functions
so far as India is concerned. There is therefore no question of allegiance to
him. But membership of the Commonwealth means that India along with others
recognises the Crown as the symbol of free association of its (Commonwealths)
independent member-nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth. In
practice this will mean nothing although it satisfies the sentiment of those
members of the Commonwealth who are traditionally attached to the Crown. India
will as a member continue to enjoy full imperial preference in trade matters;
Indian citizens will within one Commonwealth continue to have all the rights
they now enjoy. The precedent set by India may be followed by South Africa
where also there is a strong party in favour of a republican type of
government. There is a chance of Eire becoming associated with the Commonwealth
and Burma also may think on these lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is necessary however to understand why it is that India wants to maintain her
association with the Commonwealth and why the other members are also anxious to
keep her in such association. It is a matter of mutual advantage in the present
world context. Although India has become fully sovereign and independent she
does not as yet </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>possess all the resources necessary to protect
her against any possible </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>threat from outside. She is weak in
respect of naval and air forces. Even in regard to her armies she has to depend
on others for equipment and perhaps also for technical help. It would therefore
be of advantage to her to have some kind of assurance that she would get all
the help needed in these directions from the Commonwealth. To the other members
of the Commonwealth India’s association is of great advantage. It is due in the
main to the strategic position she occupies. Without her help it would be an
impossibility for Britain to maintain her connection with Australia and New
Zealand and a friendly India also strengthens Britain’s position in the Middle
East. There is also a second and a more immediate consideration. It is the
growing menace of international communism. Britain and the other members of the
Commonwealth are determined to fight it and in this they have already ranged
themselves on the side of the United States. India today is also interested in
fighting it. The spread of the communist dictatorship into a large part of
China, the disturbance which communism is causing in Indo-China, Burma and
Malaya and the danger of communist outbreaks within India itself–all these are
influencing the policy of the Indian leaders today. It is therefore a matter of
common interest to India and to the other members of the Commonwealth that they
should all unite and pool their resources so that they might protect themselves
against communist outbreaks. Although India’s long association with Britain and
her determination to adhere to the ideals of democracy and individual freedom
as opposed to totalitarianism have influenced her to a great extent in her
desire, to remain in the Commonwealth one should not lose sight of the fact
that more than these ideologies and historical factors it is the concrete need
for common defence against common danger that is at the basis of the
association.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Events in China have had their own influence in this
connection. The earlier idea that China would become a strong and stable
democracy has now lost much of its force. The United States, Britain and other
democratic powers have naturally turned to India. They wish to see her strong
and stable so that she might arrest the further growth of communism. A
steadying factor is necessary in Asia; and India they consider is the only
country that is best fitted to occupy such a place. There are indications to
show that the United States is now prepared to extend her economic aid to India
and that U.S. capital might be invested there in larger quantities. This is
also the real significance of the announcement recently made by Pandit Nehru
giving to the investors of Foreign Capital all the assurances they needed in
the matter of dividends, foreign exchange facilities, and adequate compensation
if at any time in future the Government of India embarks on a policy of
nationalisation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While membership of the Commonwealth brings a number
of advantages it should not be forgotten that it also creates new and
additional responsibilities. Although in theory India as a sovereign state will
be free to pursue an independent foreign policy she may not be able to pursue
such a course at all times having regard to the reaction which it will produce
on the other members of the Commonwealth. It may be necessary for her to be
less dogmatic in her opposition for instance to the “white” Australian policy.
There may be many other matters on which she may have to be more compromising.
But on the whole she stands to gain considerably by the continuance of
association with the Commonwealth and there will be no difficulty whatever in Pandit
Nehru’s policy being approved by the Constituent Assembly.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
decision arrived at in the conference of Dominion Prime Ministers is also
significant in its relation to the present day world-set up in which Soviet
Russia and the United States are ranged on opposite sides. The spiritual and
moral sympathies of the commonwealth of nations are on the whole towards the
United States. Two of the important members of the Commonwealth–Britain and
Canada–are also parties to the Atlantic Pact of which the United States is the
leading member. The continued unity of the Commonwealth is sure to bring
satisfaction to all the parties to the Pact and give them the hope that its
resources will be at their disposal when the need arises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
strengthening of the Atlantic Pact and the consolidation of the hold over
Western Europe are now the principal objectives of the United States foreign
policy so far as the European world is concerned. Two important steps were
taken in the furtherance of these objectives during the month of April. One is
the announcement that the United States would ship to the European continent
arms worth 1,130,000,000 dollars under the proposed military aid programme and
that the weapons so sent would prevent any successful Russian sweep over the continent.
This has given confidence to the leading military strategists that Western
Europe would now be in a position to withstand any invasion by Russia. The
second step is the practical completion of the process of consolidating Western
Germany into a single federal State. This was being worked upon for a number of
months. Various obstacles however stood in its way and they have been now
overcome. From the point of view of the parties to the Atlantic Pact the
situation is now bright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
has recognized that for the successful execution of the European Recovery
Programme and for the strengthening of the defences of Western Europe full use
should be made of the economic and industrial resources of Germany. But an
apprehension was entertamed mostly by the French who within a generation were
twice attacked by the Germans that the industrial revival of Germany would
ultimately result in her militarisation and her coming once more a threat to
French independence. Naturally the French have been opposing all plans first to
amalgamate the three zones of occupation into a single State and second to the
industrial development of such state and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the creation of a
central government for it. But all these steps were absolutely essential for
the recovery of Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fears of the French have been greatly allayed by recent happenings. The
Atlantic Pact and the United States Arms programme have given them the
assurance that in case of any attack in future America will immediately come to
their aid. They have therefore given up their misgivings and agreed to have the
three occupation zones united into a single State. The British and the
Americans have also felt that without the active and willing co-operation of
the Germans themselves an increase in the industrial output of Germany would be
an impossibility and that such co-operation would not be forthcoming unless
they were given a substantial share in the government of the country. It was
with this view that arrangements were made ten months ago for the meeting of a German
representative council at Bonn to draft a constitution for a self-governing
West German State. But there also certain difficulties arose as the French were
afraid that such a State would produce in course of time a second Hitler. These
fears also have now been dispelled and it is now believed that everything is
ready for the creation and working of a West German State within the next few
months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three allied powers have now enacted what is called the German Occupation
Statute. This gives to the new West German State maximum legislative, executive
and judicial powers consistent with the need to prevent any German military
aggression in future. For this purpose the occupation powers retain control
over nine functions including foreign affairs, disarmament, Ruhr
administration, allied security, foreign trade etc. They also reserve the right
to veto any German legislation which might be deemed as a “grave threat to the
basic purpose of occupation.” They further reserve the right to resume in whole
or in part the exercise of full authority if they consider that to do so is
essential to security or to preserve the democratic government in Germany or in
pursuance of the international obligations of their governments. They also
promise to review after one year and within eighteen months the provisions of
the statute “with a view to extending the jurisdiction of German authorities in
the legislative, executive, and judicial fields.” The occupation statute thus
introduces into Germany a system of dyarchy with which we in India are
familiar. Some powers are transferred to the Germans and some are reserved by
the occupation authorities. It is true that the Germans will not be reconciled
completely to such a state of affairs but political realism requires that it will
be sheer madness on their part to expect that complete sovereignty would be
restored to them so soon after the world war. The advantage of the statute is
that the period of suspense is over; the Germans know exactly where they are;
and the allies need no longer concern themselves with minute details of
administration but confine themselves to high questions of policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
important as this is the prospect of the Council at Bonn completing its task of
framing a constitution for the West German State. This work has not been
proceeding satisfactorily for more than one reason. There is an underlying
feeling among the representatives assembled at the Council that no purpose
would be served by their drafting a constitution for a divided Germany and that
no such task should </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be undertaken until the Russian Zone of
Eastern Germany together with the city of Berlin is incorporated with Western
Germany. They </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>are afraid that framing a constitution now would
perpetuate the division of the country. They have therefore not been very
enthusiastic in carrying out their work. In the second place acute differences
of opinion have arisen in regard to the distribution of powers between the
centre and the units in the proposed federal state of Western Germany. The
Christian democrats are for a weak centre and for large powers being conferred
on the units. The Social democrats however are for a strong centre. The
occupation powers have been interfering with the work of constitution making.
They have been issuing directions as to what the council should do and in many
matters they took up the side of the Christian democrats. This was resented and
it appeared at one time that the Germans might non-cooperate and refuse to
frame a constitution as dictated by the occupation powers. Fortunately all
these differences and misunderstandings have now come to an end. The occupation
powers have promised not to interfere. The Social democrats are having an
easier task and a federal constitution with real power granted to the centre is
being framed. The Constitution also is flexible in the sense that it makes it
easy for Berlin and Eastern Germany to become parties to it whenever the
situation becomes favourable to them. The establishment therefore of a West
German State has now become an unaccomplished fact. And forty-five million
Germans will have the satisfaction that in certain spheres of life they have
once more become their own masters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is events like these that are responsible for the anxiety now displayed by
Soviet Russia to lift the Berlin Blockade, to revive the foreign </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ministers
conference and resume talks on German peace settlement. This is no doubt a
climb-down for Russia but she has now realised that </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
cold war and the war of nerves have not been of much advantage to her and that
they have created unnecessary difficulties. The air-lift by which the British
and the Americans brought all essential supplies to Berlin has been a
phenomenal success. The counter-measures which they adopted to blockade the
Russian part of Berlin have also been a success and resulted in much
dislocation and loss to the Russians and to the Germans in the East. It is not
also to the liking of Russia that the Western powers should succeed in unifying
all West Germany and create a self-governing state there. Contrast is now being
drawn by the Germans between the fair conditions prevailing in the Western
section and the bad conditions in the Russian Zone and many are leaving the
latter and taking refuge in the former. All this has affected the position of
Soviet Russia and they are now trying to delay the formation of the West German
State by proposing to lift the Berlin blockade and resume discussions on the
future of Germany. It is not known what the outcome of the preliminary talks
now going on will be. One thing however is certain. The tactics pursued by
Russia for a year have failed and they will have to revise their tactics now.
The Atlantic Pact, the Occupation Statute and the drafting of the constitution
of West Germany are all of great significance in bringing about this change in
Soviet tactics. Whether they will modify their general international policy is
still uncertain. One should not forget the emphasis that the Soviet lays on the
difference between the ultimate aim and policy–which are unalterable–the
strategy required to pursue them and the everchanging tactics in executing the
strategy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a large amount of agreement on matters of foreign policy between the Labour
Government in England and the Conservative opposition. Mr. Bevin has been receiving
more praise from the conservatives than from the back-benchers in his own party
and any change in the party strength in the House of Commons that the general
elections due a year hence might bring about may not result in much of a change
in foreign policy–in the Atlantic Pact or in the policy towards Germany or
Russia or China. Moreover Britain has now become so intimately allied to the
United States that no party will be in a position to bring about fundamental
changes in her foreign policy independently of the United States. All the same,
people in Britain are now concerning themselves with the prospects of the next
general election. Interest in this has become greater owing to certain
happenings in April. One was the budget of Sir Stafford Cripps which appealed
more to the conservatives than to labour left-wing. The other is the huge loss
sustained by the labour party in the London County Council Elections where for
a number of years they were commanding a majority. The third is the publication
of the Labour Party Programme which will be executed if it comes again into
office. This programme was prepared by the executive of the labour party and it
would come up for discussion at the next party conference. It<i> </i>reveals
how after five years of socialistic experiment the executive is not for rushing
through it. A study of this programme will serve a highly useful purpose in
India where there are parties which on pure abstract and theoretical grounds
are bent on immediate nationalisation. In Britain all labour is not socialist
and is not keen on nationalisation. There are sections of voters who take an
independent view of these matters and any election programme will have to make
an effective appeal to them. This is what is prominent in the new programme of
the British Labour Party Executive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It proposes to extend nationalisation to Industrial
assurance, the cement industry, sugar refining and manufacturing, the wholesale
meat trade and slaughter houses, cold storage, water supply and all suitable
minerals. It undertakes in general to socialize monopoly industries. To promote
efficiency it advocates competitive public enterprise alongside of private
enterprise and not in substitution for it. In agriculture it seeks to encourage
producers’ co-operatives. It lays emphasis on increased production involving
planning and effective partnership between government and industry. These are
some of the features of its economic programme. It is another illustration of
the Britishers’ temperamental unwillingness to be carried away by slogans and
of their sense of realism.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While conditions in Europe show a tendency towards
stabilisation and the weakening of the disruptive forces conditions in China
and in South-Eastern Asia are moving in an opposite direction. The peace talks
in China have failed. The communists have crossed the Yangtse, occupied Nanking
and are approaching Shanghai. Chiang Kai Shek has come back from his retirement
and is once more in command of the forces opposed to communism. There is
however no guarantee that he will succeed. Factors that have contributed to his
failure in the past are still in operation. The Americans have now definitely
stated that they will not grant him any aid. There is therefore not much of a
chance of success for him. The civil war will be prolonged until the whole
country is occupied by the communists. There seems to be no escape from this.
The Dutch have not learnt reason in their dealings in Indonesia or the French
in Indo-China. The Government of Burma is still faced with serious opposition

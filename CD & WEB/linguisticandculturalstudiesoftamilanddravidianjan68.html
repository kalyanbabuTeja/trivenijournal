study of linguistics in Tamil is one of the oldest disciplines in the language,
and from the time of the <span class=SpellE><i>Tholkaappiyam</i></span><i> </i>onwards
(early centuries A. D.) Tamil scholars have taken a refreshingly realistic
attitude to the facts of the language, whether in phonetics and phonology or in
morphology. Although there has been the inevitable influence of the Sanskrit
grammatical system, the special facts or features of Tamil were all noted and
docketed. Fundamental works like the–<span class=SpellE><i>Tholkaappiyam</i></span><i>,
</i>the <span class=SpellE><i>Nhannuul</i></span><i>, </i>the <span
class=SpellE><i>Viiracoozhiyam</i></span><i> </i>are there, and then the long
range of commentaries, for elucidating the facts of Tamil. The study of Tamil
was taken up by foreign students of Tamil from the 17th century, by the <span
class=SpellE>Portugese</span> missionaries in <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Goa</span></st1:place> and Malabar. The first printed book using
Tamil characters came out from <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cochin</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1579. Foreign scholars of eminence were like the Italian Jesuit Roberto de <span
class=SpellE>Nobili</span> (early 17th century), the German <span class=SpellE>Barholomew</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ziegenbalg</span> (1663-1719), who wrote a grammar of Tamil
at <span class=SpellE>Tranquebar</span> after founding a mission there in 1706,
and above all, the <span class=GramE>Italian <span class=SpellE>Constantius</span>
<span class=SpellE>Beschi</span> (1680-1746), famous as a Tamil poet as the
author of the <span class=SpellE><i>Thembavani</i></span><i> </i>(1724) or “the
unfading <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Garland</st1:place></st1:City>”
(a sort of a Christian <span class=SpellE>Purana</span>), besides his grammar
of both old and modern Tamil in Latin and a comprehensive work on Tamil grammar
and poetics the <span class=SpellE><i>Thonnuul-vilhakkam</i></span><i>.</i></span><i>
</i>Then in the 19th century came other European scholars who wrote on Tamil
(and other Dravidian) grammar and linguistics, like <span class=SpellE>Groul</span>,
Caldwell, <span class=SpellE>Gundert</span>, <span class=SpellE>Kittel</span>,
Brown, Hahn, Denis Bray and <span class=SpellE>Sten</span> <span class=SpellE>Konow</span>,
Vinson, Pope and then Jules Bloch, <span class=SpellE>Kuiper</span>, M. B. <span
class=SpellE>Emeneau</span>, A. Master, T. Burrow, <span class=SpellE>Kamil</span>
<span class=SpellE>Zvelebil</span>, <span class=SpellE>Andronov</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Rudin</span> and others. The old historical and comparative method
which has been so fruitful and positive in its results has naturally been
followed by these investigators and we have also some eminent Indian scholars
who have made valuable contribution in elucidating the nature and history of
Tamil and other Dravidian languages, and also Dravidian linguistics in general,
like K. V. <span class=SpellE>Subbaiya</span>, K. Amrita Rao, L. V. Ramaswami <span
class=SpellE>Ayyar</span>, P. S. <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanya</span> Sastri,

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the present generation the science of linguistics has taken a new turn both in
its approach and its methodology in the West, particularly in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This
approach and methodology have been called the <i>Synchronistic </i>as opposed
to the earlier <span class=SpellE><i>Diachronistic</i></span><i> </i>(as it has
been named) <span class=SpellE>i</span>. e., the comparative and historical
one. With the <span class=SpellE><i>elan</i></span><i> </i>of something
aggressively modern and “progressive,” and with the power derived from
scientific gadgets, the new approach and method in the hands of some of its
more ardent protagonists were inclined to belittle and even at times to throw
overboard the current <span class=SpellE>Diachronistic</span> or Historical and
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Comparative</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Linguistics which deals with
human speech (speech is partly a mechanical and physical phenomenon and at the
same time is very largely a psychological, aesthetic and social one) is a
complex human science and not exclusively a simpler physical one. In their zeal
for the new approach, some exponents of it are inclined to look upon the
synchronistic method (which has not much use for the comparative and historical
values) as if linguistics were a branch of mathematics or physics, and they
forget the implications of the warning given by F. de <span class=SpellE>Saussure</span>
years ago that linguistics is not to be made “a caricature of some other
discipline.” Language is perpetually in a state of movement like every other
thing connected with man–it is never at stand-still; and the attempt to take
language as something static, permanent and abstract may have some value as a
theoretical and even as a fundamental enquiry in science, but the object of
language study as a human phenomenon for ever on the move, and not bound by any
set of meticulously framed rules (even the speech of the same individual at any
given time) is in this way rather obscured. After the initial glamour of the
new synchronistic method of descriptive and structural linguistics, with its
imposing array of mathematical tables and its display of complicated symbols
and figures, as well as is new terms (sometimes quite unnecessary, and
frequently confined to individual investigators who have not yet been able to
arrive at a generally accepted coherent and explicit terminology), many
linguistic workers are now feeling the need for crying halt to these
ultra-progressive methods and to test their validity and utility in both theory
and practice. A typical instance of this critical attitude will be fond in the
paper by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Takdir</span> S. <span class=SpellE>Alisjahbaa</span>,
Professor of Linguistics and of Malay in the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Kualaluropur</span></st1:PlaceName>
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
entitled “the failure of modern linguistics in solving the problems of emergent
nations.” Of course, no one will deny that the science of linguistics can only advance
with the modern application of both theoretical and practical science,
particularly in the physical aspect of language in connection with the speech,
sounds and the <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>, as well as the function of
the voice as much as that of gesture. Modern scientific phonetics with its new
discoveries and theories now forms one of the indispensable bases of
linguistics, thanks to the work of masters like <span class=SpellE>Jespersen</span>,
Daniel Jones, N. <span class=SpellE>Trubetzkoy</span> and others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

some 2,500 years ago, and the clarity and sanity as well as the
comprehensiveness of his approach in a combined morphophonemic study of the
facts of a living speech, which Sanskrit was with him in the 5th century B. C.
in the extreme north-west of India, are now being rediscovered and hailed with
admiration in both Europe and America and in India and Japan. The much-needed <span
class=SpellE>harmonisation</span> between the old <span class=SpellE>diachronism</span>,
in language study, the comparative and historical method and the new
synchronism, the descriptive and structural method, is now felt as something
absolutely necessary for a steady and well-balanced progress of the vessel of
Linguistic Science, the sail and the ballast both functioning properly to help
it forward. In 1962, at the ninth International Congress of Linguists which was
held at <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Harward</span></st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the matter was discussed, and I had a paper on the subject of a judicious
combination of both the methods. Then at the last (tenth) International
Congress of Linguists which was held at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bucharest</st1:place></st1:City>
in August-September 1967, this subject formed the most prominent matter for
discussion in five plenary sittings, and eminent <span class=SpellE>linguisticians</span>
like. B. <span class=SpellE>Malmberg</span> (Sweden–“Synchrony and <span
class=SpellE>Diachrony</span>”), E. <span class=SpellE>Petrovici</span>
(Rumania–“Interpretation of Linguistic Systems”), Roman <span class=SpellE>Jakobson</span>
(U. S. A.–“Linguistics and Adjacent Sciences”), G. <span class=SpellE>Devoto</span>
(Italy–“The Comparative Method and the Actual Linguistic Currents”) and Olga <span
class=SpellE>Akhmanova</span> (U. S. S. R.–linguistics and the Quantitative
Approach”) whose papers were printed and distributed, inaugurated various
aspects of this question, and there were lively discussions. Prof. G. Devoto in
a way put in the case for what he called ‘the co-existence” of the two methods,
and that alone would appear to be helpful in preventing a meaningless split up
of the science and give to either method its proper place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the <span class=SpellE>Syncoronistic</span> approach has come to stay, and the <span
class=SpellE>Diachronistic</span> cannot be ignored either. It is the
historical background which we cannot ignore. When <span class=SpellE>Panini</span>
sat down to describe the character of the Sanskrit language, he took it up as
it was known to him, and he could not have any sense of a historical
development of Sanskrit (both as a current speech–<span class=SpellE><i>Laukika</i></span><i>,
</i>and as language of the Vedic literature–<span class=SpellE><i>Chandasa</i></span>,
which he took to be one), and therefore his treatment was from the nature of
the case a rigidly descriptive and structural one. The grammarians of <span
class=SpellE>Prakrit</span> could not treat the <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span>
dialects as self-sufficient–the earlier bases of these could not be dissociated
from Sanskrit. The continuity–Sanskrit, <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Bhasha</span>, or Old, Middle and New Indo-Aryan–was an
overwhelming fact which could never be lost sight of. But in the case of
languages which had no records earlier than the recent two centuries, there
could not be any case for a historical survey, although comparison with
connected dialects or speeches would force themselves to our notice. Here the

prestige of a sacred language as the vehicle of a particular religion is
tremendous, and theology and a blind religious faith <span class=SpellE>colour</span>
or blur our linguistic sense. Thus in medieval times European Christians
piously believed that all the speeches of the world were derived from Hebrew,
the language of the Word of God. Roman Catholic missionaries and others
sometimes believed that Latin, the language of the liturgy of their Church, was
in a vague way the mother of all languages. So in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, too, <span class=SpellE>Hinayana</span>
Buddhists following the <span class=SpellE>Pali</span> canon thought that <span
class=SpellE>Pali</span>, miscalled <span class=SpellE>Magadhi</span>, was the
original and the source-language. The <span class=SpellE>Jains</span> similarly
held the <span class=SpellE>Ardha-Magadhi</span> <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span>
of their canonical books, supposedly the language of <span class=SpellE>Mahavira</span>
himself (just as Buddhists similarly erroneously thought that <span
class=SpellE>Pali</span> was Buddha’s own speech) in great respect as the <span
class=SpellE><i>Arsha</i></span><i> </i>speech, the primeval speech current
among the <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span> or sages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
among <span class=SpellE>Brahmanical</span> Hindus all over <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas and <span class=SpellE>Puranas</span> and
other <span class=SpellE>Sastras</span>, the language of the Gods and the
sages, was the original language, and the source of all languages. There was no
difficulty in accepting the position that Tamil and other Dravidian languages,
as much as the various medieval <span class=SpellE>Prakrits</span> and their
modern descendants, were all derived from <span class=SpellE>Prakrit</span>.
Medieval and modern Sanskrit scholars of Telugu and Kannada and Malayalam, and
almost equally of Tamil, thought that Sanskrit was the source-language. But it
must be said that this was not accepted universally. There were Tamil saints
and sages, who had profound love for their language, who like <span
class=SpellE>Thirumuular</span> declared that the <i>Supreme Sivan was both Aryan
and Tamil </i>(i.e., <span class=SpellE><i>Arya</i></span><i> and <span
class=SpellE>Dravida</span>), </i>and the <span class=SpellE><i>Kural</i></span><i>
</i>of <span class=SpellE>Thiruvalluvar</span> was as great as the Vedas. They
refused to accept the position that Sanskrit, the language of the Gods and the <span
class=SpellE>Rishis</span>, was the source of Tamil, and the South Indian <span
class=SpellE>Vaishnavas</span> gave to the Bhakti literature of the <span
class=SpellE>Azhvars</span> when placed besides the Veda and Vedanta texts an
equal or even a higher status. The tables are being turned now–an irrational
approach which is more patriotic than scientific now claims for <span
class=SpellE>Sangam</span> Tamil a more ancient age than the language of the
Vedas; and in a recent work like the <span class=SpellE><i>Muthal</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Thaaymozhi</span> </i>this view about Ancient Tamil being
the mother of all languages has been put forward in all seriousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Be
it as it may, we find that the study of Tamil (and other Dravidian) grammar and
linguistics among some ardently patriotic <span class=SpellE>Tamilians</span>
is inspired by easily understandable notions about the exalted position of Old
Tamil. What they say about the facts of the language, since their views based
on a meticulous study of the documents, have to be considered with due respect,
and their help is to be taken wherever there is something positive. But
Dravidian grammatical studies among present-day scholars have now taken up the
two-fold path which are but two aspects of the same investigation accepted all
over the world,–the old <span class=SpellE>Diachronistic</span>, and the new
Synchronistic. Some among the younger generation of investigators of Tamil and
Dravidian in <span class=SpellE><i>Tamizhakam</i></span><i>, </i>and of the
other Dravidian languages in Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra have got the
requisite training in Poona and in the American universities and their
intensive enquiries into specific aspects of a proper factual analysis of Tamil
and other Dravidian languages are being placed before the scholarly world. All
this will only enlarge the scope of our study and will make it all
comprehensive. In order to be more fruitful, I would only suggest that these </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>enquiries
need not be totally dissociated from the current line of <span class=SpellE>Diachronistic</span>
approach, particularly by going in for an unnecessary </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>neologism
in technical terms and by intricacies and complexities of too much <span
class=SpellE>symbolisation</span>. And the traditional method is also to take
all help from the new descriptive and structural one. Kalidasa said–<span
class=SpellE><i>Puranamityeva</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>na</span></span> <span class=SpellE>sadhu</span> <span
class=SpellE>sarvam</span> </i>“because it is old everything is not good”, and
this is quite true; and while admitting this, we should also be a little
circumspect for “everything that is new is not good, unless it is proved to be
so”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

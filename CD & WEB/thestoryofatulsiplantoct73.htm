wide bridge made of brick and cement looked bent like a bow. A hundred yards
beyond it stood the house. It was a two-storeyed house, big, standing up
straight, high from the road. Footpaths are unknown in this region; so the
house was not <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>called upon </span>to
leave any space in front. Yet there was much space behind it. Space even
excepting <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the open, </span>neat corner
between the bathroom, kitchen and privy, A nearly impenetrable jungle of mango,
black-berry and jack-fruit trees filled that space; the wet earth laden with
thick grass emitted a dour smell, and even while it was fierce sunlight around,
gloomy darkness of sunset appeared to hover over that space. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

being so much space what would have been the harm if some of it was left out
and made into a sort of garden? So thought they–the inhabitants of the house.
It wouldn’t have mattered that there was no garden, thought Matin: had there been
a little space in front they would have made a garden of it, would have with
due care planted therein season-flowers, Gandharaj, Bakul, Hasnubana and also a
few Roses. Then in the evenings on returning from office they could have sat
there. Matin would have procured for the occasion a light chair made of cane or
an easychair made <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>canvas.
Amjad had a habit <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>smoking on
the hookah. To preserve the dignity <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>the garden he might have purchased a suitable <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

with <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it. </span>There was also Kader,
a good <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>story-teller. </span>While
there was a soft mild breeze his voice <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>would
</span>have become full <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>a story
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>would </span>have grown sweet with the
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>smell of H</span>asnuhana. <span

them and just sat quiet? So they <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>all </span>pondered

days they chanced upon this house–this big house deserted and gaping at
desertion, as it were. Their first feelings were <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

in a crowd, broke the lock and, while <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>entering
</span>the house, raised an outcry like the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

that might <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>have possibly tried to creep

spread <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the town and other
people began <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to c</span>ome and were
not welcomed. They began to come in batches in hopes <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>a roof over their heads. But the first occupants resisted.
Did the newcomers intend to get room by force? Still<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>, </span>the first occupants kept their heads <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>cool </span>as far as possible and told the newcomers that there was <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>no s</span>pace–all the rooms had been
occupied. They pointed out, “Just see, Sahib, even this <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>small </span>dark room has had to accommodate four beds. Uptill now <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>only </span>the beds are here: if four bed-steads
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>six </span>feet long and three feet
wide <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or </span>chairs and tables about
six in number are brought in there <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will
</span>be <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>nothing </span>like ‘vacant
space’ <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>left </span>here.” With some they
even sympathized: “We can appreciate your difficulty. Have we not suffered
similar <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>difficulty </span>these days?
But then, my friend, you have bad luck. Had you come only four hours earlier some
space could have been managed. Not to speak <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>four <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>hours, </span>only
two hours ago a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>fattish </span>man
working at the Accounts Office came and occupied the corner room on the ground
floor. The room is just on the main road, yet not so bad. The public lamp-stand
is just near the window. In case of failure of light within, that street light
will do well for the room.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
then though the whole country had suffered the turmoil of a big change, it was
not that anarchic conditions had been established anywhere. That was why the
police came subsequently to enquire into these illegal proceedings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Not
that the owner <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the house who
had fled the country had moved the authorities for recovery of his house. It is
doubtful if he could have so moved even if he knew of the illegal occupation.
It would have been too much to expect that of a gentleman who had removed his
big family overnight for fear of his and their lives. The police had been
informed by those who, because they had been looking for opportunities of
similar occupation in other parts of the town, had not succeeded in reaching
here four–even two hours ago. It had been sheer bad luck. But they argued: Why
should not luck be equally bad for those who had come early and occupied the
house? But even meek people could grow militant in defence of dispensation of
luck. Those here whom luck had favoured had not to strike in favour or their
luck but were prepared to do so. And they explained the whole position to the
police in such manner that the sub-inspector raised no objection and went back
with his party. In the usual course however he had to submit a report. But he
framed the report in such confused terms that his superiors thought it fit to
file it up rather than try to find out what it meant to convey. There was no
hurry either. There was no question of sympathy for those who had left the
country and if the absentee-owner of the house did not come back and move about
it, there was no use bothering. Moreover the occupants <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>the house, though they were mere <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>clerks, were sons </span>of gentlemen and had not, though they were in
possession of the house, broken any of the doors or windows or sold any of the
ceiling beams in the black market. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
the house became lively overnight. Many of those who had found shelter here had
had to live in Calcutta either with the sailors at Blochman Street, with the
book-binders at Baithakkhana, the tobacco merchants of Syed Sally Lane or
amidst the unspeakable filth and dirt of Chamru Khansama Lane. They could not
describe how much, after that, they liked the big rooms of this house, the big
windows built in the fashion of the legendary Blue Palace, the open yard at the
back of the house and the jungle-like garden of mango, black-berry and
jack-fruit trees. Of course none of them had got a whole room for himself like
rich people had, but they were all the same mighty glad at the flow of open air
and light through the big rooms. They thought that they were saved at last: living
care-free like this and taking in light and air their blood-cells would now
amass fresh, virile blood; their faces would brighten up like those of thousand
or two thousand rupees-salaried people; their bodies would be rid of malarial
and black-fever parasites.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
example Yunus had lived in Calcutta at Macleod Street. That street bore a
European name, yet every part of it had the appearance of a dustbin in the
morning. In that street he used to live with hide merchants from Cutch on the
upper floor of a ramshackle wooden house. Somebody had told him the smell of
hide was good for health, it destroyed tubercular germs. Moreover even the
rotten, drab odour from the drain used to go under that smell. There was no
knowing of even a dead mouse or a cat that might have been rotting at the
corner for ten days or so. It was just as well, Yunus thought. At least there
was the promised destruction of tubercular germs–it had caught his imagination
most. For his health was none too good. He was lean and thin and weak. Now as
he lies by the window of the big room to the south and sees the golden rays of
the sun, he shudders to recollect his den at Macleod Street. For all he knew he
might have already come to harm. Had he the money he would have had his chest
examined by a doctor. It was always good to be careful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Within
the yard to the left of the kitchen stood a Tulsi plant on a brick-made
pedestal half a cubit high. One morning Modabber was brushing his teeth when
his eyes caught sight of the Tulsi plant. Modabber was a fuss, sort of fellow;
no sooner something happened than he raised an uproar and people got panicky.
All the others hurried out. Something must have happened though perhaps nothing
so serious as the uproar suggested. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You
see here this Tulsi plant,” said Modabber. “It has to be rooted out. Now that
we are here nothing smacking of Hinduism can be allowed to stay.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of them looked at the plant. Its thick green leaves looked yellowish and
appeared to have lost lustre. None had tended it those recent days and around
it grass had grown. Surprisingly it had evaded notice and seemed to have hidden
itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
suddenly they became silent. The house that had appeared so empty, had, despite
certain names written in a raw hand on the wall of the room over the staircase,
seemed to be without an owner, suddenly appeared in a new light. The Tulsi
plant seemed suddenly to speak volumes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

did not know much about Hindu customs. Still they had heard that in every Hindu
home at the day’s end the mistress of the household puts on a light at the base
of the Tulsi plant and with the edge of her cloth coiled round her neck does
her obeisance there. Somebody then had been used to put in a light every
evening, at the base of this Tulsi plant too, now overgrown with grass and
looking deserted. Just when the evening star glowed in the sky in its bold
solitude a mild, peaceful light used to be lit up there amidst the thickening
shadow with the silent blood-red touch of vermilion from the bowed-down
forehead. So perhaps the light had been lit every day, year after year. Stormy,
dark days had come into the house; perhaps some day the light of life of
somebody in the family had been extinguished. Yet never even for a day had the
ceremony of lighting up the Tulsi plant failed to be performed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was now the mistress of the household who had lit up a light at this Tulsi
plant year after year? Why had she gone away? Matin had at one time been
employed as a railway official. She had gone, Matin thought, to Calcutta,
Asansol, or to some relative’s place at Badyabati or Howrah. Or she might have
gone to Lilooah; there was no reason why she could not have gone there. There
from the roof of a black, two-storeyed house beside the big railway yard a
red-bordered saree was perhaps hanging <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>down.
Possibly it belonged to the mistress of this abandoned house. But </span>wherever
she might be perhaps her eyes became dim with tears as she remembered this
Tulsi corner under the shadows of the evening sky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had caught a little cold since yesterday. He was the first to speak and said, “Let
it rather stay. We are certainly not expected to worship it. The extract of its
leave is curative for cold and cough.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

looked this way and that. All seemed to be of the same opinion. Among them
Enayet was a sort of Moulvi. He had beard, said “namaz” five times a day and
was said to recite the Quoran in the morning. Even he did not demur. Could it
be that he too thought of the eyes of the mistress of the house dim with tears?
The Tulsi plant continued its existence intact. The atmosphere of the house was
good. It seemed the dozing gloom, atmosphere they had had in Calcutta had

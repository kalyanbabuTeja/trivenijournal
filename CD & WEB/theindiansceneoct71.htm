the quarter July–September the two outstanding events in the national scene
which attracted a large amount of public attention were the conclusion of the
Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace. <span class=GramE>Friendship and co-operation and
the passing of the 24th amendment to the Constitution and the introduction into
Parliament of the 25th amendment.</span> It is necessary for us to understand

attention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
significance of the Treaty consists in its making a departure from the policy
of non-alignment to which the country adhered since 1947. Although the
Government of India has been saying that the Treaty does not mean any such
departure and although Article IV of the Treaty declares: “The Union of Soviet
Socialist Republic respects India’s policy of non-alignment,” no one really
thinks that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
can in future swear by the old policy. The Treaty is in fact and essence a
military–and not a mere cultural–alliance between <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and U.S.S.R. It is this that
explains the almost universal welcome that was given to it by the public and
the political parties in the country. The public <span class=SpellE>recognise</span>
that there is nothing sacred about non-alignment which in truth lost all its
importance with the thaw in the cold war between the two world powers–the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> and the U.S.S.R.–and it became
meaningless after the Chinese aggression against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1962. There is no reason
why we should not welcome the Treaty even if it goes against non-alignment,
provided it serves a higher purpose like the guarantee of national security and
the promotion of national interests. Where there is a conflict between
non-alignment and the promotion of national security and interests, it is the
latter that we should prefer and this is what we have done in the present case.
Even our Prime Minister has told recently a big audience in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> (October 14) that we must be prepared
to abandon non-alignment if it stands in the way of our </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>national
interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

interests of our national security.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> As a result of the
policy of non-alignment we have become practically isolated in the
international world. There was no prospect of any important state coming to our
rescue in case of any attack against us either by <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
For the last three months and more <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place> has been threatening us
with such an attack. There was the danger that in such an attack <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> would
give her all the help she would require and that we would be compelled to fight
against both the countries at the same time. At the time of Chinese aggression
in 1962 the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
came to our help but today there is no such prospect. The <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
are coming closer together and President Nixon has given us a warning that in
case of any war with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
he would not come to our assistance. With a real threat from Pakistan because
of developments in <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>
and of our sympathy and support to the cause of the freedom of <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> and with the
certainty that both China and the United States would help Pakistan in carrying
out the threat, there was a genuine fear that single-handed we might not be
able to meet it and this fear that induced the Government to conclude the
Treaty with Soviet Russia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a result of the Treaty there is now a certainty that Soviet Russia will come to
our help in the event of an attack directed against any third country. Article
IX of the Treaty provides for this. It says: “Each high contracting party
undertakes to abstain from providing any assistance to any third party that
engages in armed conflict with the other party. In the event of either
subjected to an attack or a threat thereof, the high contracting parties shall
immediately enter into mutual consultations in order to remove such threat and
to take appropriate effective ensure peace and the security of their
countries.” Article X declares: “Each high contracting party solemnly declares
that it shall not enter into any obligation, secret or public, with one or more
states which is incompatible with this treaty. Each high contracting party
further declares that no obligation exists, nor shall any obligation be entered
into, between itself and any other state or states which cause military damage
to the other party.” What this Article means is that Soviet Russia will stop
giving any military aid to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
as such aid will certainly cause military damage to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Because
of these Articles the people in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
got a welcome psychological relief. They felt that they would not be alone in a
war with <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and that
a great power like Soviet Russia would come to their help. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Treaty was concluded on August 9, 1971. It was then universally welcomed.
Today, however, several sections of the people have begun to entertain
misgivings about it. Whether they are justified in entertaining such misgivings
is a different point. It is necessary to understand why they are doing so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Government
has told the public that negotiations for the Treaty have been going on for two
years and that it is only a chance coincidence with developments in <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> that it is concluded
now. But almost all sections of the public feel that the Treaty was really
necessitated by the developments in <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span
class=SpellE>Desh</span> and several of them judge its value by the extent to
which it helps <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in <span class=SpellE>realising</span> her policy towards the freedom movement
in <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Until
the conclusion of the Treaty it was quite clear that the Government of India
was unambiguously in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of an independent. <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>, a <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> outside the framework
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Whatever might have been the policy of <span class=SpellE>Awami</span> League
before March 25, 1971 the military crackdown which the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place> regime let loose from that
day resulted in the League and <span class=GramE>its</span> supporters</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>practically
the whole population–opting once for all for an independent <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span>
<span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. When our Parliament passed at the end of March
a resolution giving its full sympathy and support to the freedom fighters the
sympathy and support was for an independent <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span
class=SpellE>Desh</span> which meant the break up of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. When various parties in
the country and most sections of the public demanded that the Government should
<span class=SpellE>recognise</span> <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span
class=SpellE>Desh</span> it meant the recognition of an independent <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. Government did not
say that it would not <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> it but only stated
that it would do so when the time was appropriate. The Indian public welcomed
the Treaty as they felt that it would bring about a free <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span>
<span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there is now a change in the policy of the Government. At the <span
class=SpellE>Simla</span> session of the A. I. C. C. (October 8) Sri <span
class=SpellE>Swaran</span> Singh, the External Affairs Minister, stated that a
political solution of the <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>
issue, which India had been advocating, could take the form of a <i>settlement
within the frame-work of Pakistan </i>or an </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Independent <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> or greater autonomy
for the region. Now he put forward three alternatives in place of the only
alternative which was all along advocated by the Government. This came as a
shock and surprise not only to the spokesmen of the Government of <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> waging the war of
freedom against the military regime of <span class=SpellE>Yahya</span> Khan but
also to large sections of the public in the country. They have been asking
themselves <span class=GramE>Why</span> did the Government depart from its
original stand and what will be its effects? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far as the first question is concerned the answer is that the departure is the
outcome of the pressure of the Soviet Government on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a pressure inevitable after
the conclusion of the Treaty. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>It has all along been the view of Soviet Russia that the
integrity and unity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
should be maintained and any solution of the <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span
class=SpellE>Desh</span> issue should be subject to this essential requirement.
There is nothing to indicate that this policy was abandoned after the
conclusion of the Treaty, as is shown by the joint communique issued after the
conclusion of the Treaty and after the visit of our Prime Minister to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> at the end of
September. The policy was repeated quite frankly in the Soviet-Algerian
communique issued after Kosygin’s visit to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Algeria</st1:place></st1:country-region> early in October, a few
days before the statement of our External Affairs Minister. The communique
stated that Kosygin assured the Algerian Government that the Soviet would stand
by the territorial integrity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It is quite clear that either the Government of India was unable to bring about
a change in Soviet stand or did not make clear to the Soviet Government its own
stand at the time when the Treaty was con­cluded. Whatever it <span
class=GramE>be</span>, the Soviet Government has now succeeded in converting <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> to its point of view and the Government of
India is now committed to a political settlement of the <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span>
<span class=SpellE>Desh</span> issue within the framework of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place>. There is nothing
surprising in this change in the policy of the Government of India. As between
Soviet Russia and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which are the parties to the Treaty, the former is the stronger party and its
views are bound to prevail. <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
is more in need of Soviet help than Soviet is in need of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s help.
It is, therefore, no exaggeration to say that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s freedom of action in
respect of <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> has been
adversely affected by the Treaty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
have now to consider what the consequences are likely <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> issue is to be within
the framework of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The first consequence will be that the nine million refugees–and the number is

17th centuries, the Americans in the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>18th<i>

will now consider the significance of the 24th amendment to the Constitution.
The first point to be noticed in this connection is that a cardinal feature of
our Constitution is that Part III of it guarantees to the people of the country
and the minorities a certain number of fundamental rights relating to equality,
freedom, property, religion, culture and language. It lays down in Article 13
(2), “The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights
conferred by this Part, and any law made in contravention of this clause,
shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.” This is one safeguard
against the Parliament or any State legislature encroaching on fundamental
rights. The Constitution also provides another safeguard. In Article 32 it
guarantees to everyone the right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate
proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights and empowers the Court to
issue directions or orders or writs for the enforcement of the rights. As a
result of this Article the Court is empowered to declare any law made by
Parliament or a State legislature invalid if it infringes the fundamental
rights and it has done so on various occasions since 1950. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is in this the possibility of confrontation between the Court on one side and
Parliament on the other. But this provision has found a place not only in our
Constitution but also in several others like that of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The reason for this is the recognition that there should be some kind of
effective restraint against hasty and ill-considered legislation in
contravention of the rights of citizens. Even elected majorities are liable to
abuse their power and make mistakes. This tendency to abuse power is inherent
in all men in authority and all constitutional as distinct from arbitrary and
despotic governments are based on the provision of checks against abuse of
authority. History shows that it is not only monarchies and oligarchies that
abuse power. Democracies also do the same. They are, therefore, as much in need
of checks and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>restraints as other forms of government. Among
such checks the power given to the highest court in the land to review the
legislation it enacted by the legislature and to declare it invalid if it is in
conflict with the provisions of the Constitution has been considered to be a
highly effective one and this is the reason why it has been given a place in
many democratic constitutions of modern times. The fathers of our Constitution
also provided for it knowing that occasionally it may result in confrontation
between the judiciary and the legislature. There is a tendency among certain
political parties in our country to <span class=SpellE>criticise</span> the
Supreme Court for invalidating the Acts made by Parliament but they forget that
provision for judicial review is an integral part of our Constitution and it
was deliberately made a pan of it by statesmen like Nehru, <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>
Patel and Rajendra Prasad in the light of historical experience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
second preliminary point to be kept in mind before considering the importance
of the 24th amendment is that no constitution or no list of fundamental rights
is sacrosanct. A constitution should serve a social purpose and when the
concept of the social purpose undergoes a change the constitution also has to
undergo change. The same is the case with fundamental rights. They also need
modification from time to time. This is why there is an Article in the
Constitution–Article 368–which lays down a procedure for amending the
Constitution. The power is conferred on the Parliament, subject to certain
provisos, and in the exercise of this power it amended the Constitution 23
times so far. Among these amendments there are four relating to fundamental
rights of equality, freedom and <span class=GramE>property.</span> In their
original form and as interpreted by the Supreme Court these were found to stand
in the way of granting special concessions to backward classes so necessary in
the interests of social justice and also in the way of promoting public policies
aiming at a more equitable distribution of wealth and income through, for
example, fixing ceilings on land holdings, tenancy legislation and <span
class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>. As a result of the four amendments the
right to equality and freedom and much </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>more the right to
property were considerably modified. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Till
1967 the Supreme Court accepted the validity of these amendments relating to
fundamental rights. In some of the writ petitions the aggrieved parties raised
the plea that a constitutional amendment abridging fundamental rights should be
declared invalid on the ground that such an amendment was “law” and in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>accordance
with Article 13<i> </i>(2) to which a reference is made in <span class=SpellE>para</span>
1 of this section. But the Supreme Court did not accept the plea. It declared
that the word “law” in that Article referred only to an ordinary law made by a
simple majority of Parliament and not to a constitutional amendment made by a
special majority. It drew a distinction between ordinary law and constitutional
amendment and said that even if the latter abrogates or modifies a fundamental
right it must be accepted as valid. It thus conceded to Parliament the power
and authority to amend fundamental </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

1967, in what is called the <span class=SpellE>Golaknath</span> case, it
changed its earlier view and upheld the plea of <span class=SpellE>Golaknath</span>
that even a constitutional amendment was law in the ordinary sense of the term
and that Parliament had no power to pass amendments which affected the
fundamental rights of citizens. This judgment, therefore, deprived Parliament
of a power which it had all along been exercising since 1950. It was thus a
revolutionary judgment. The Court adduced a number of highly technical
legalistic arguments in support of its judgment (given by six judges as against
five who dissented from it). Apart from the legalistic arguments, it stood for
a kind of philosophy which made it think that if Parliament retained the Power
to amend the Articles relating to fundamental rights</span><span

Court, however, did not mean that fundamental rights should not undergo a
change under any circumstances. What it opined was that such changes should not
be brought about by the brute majorities in Parliament resulting from a general
election but by a Constituent Assembly elected for the purpose by the people of
the country or through some kind of referendum. Consequently the Court struck
down the Bank <span class=SpellE>Nationalisation</span> Act in its first form
and the President’s ordinance depriving the Princes of the rights and
privileges conferred on them by Article 362. Both of these dealt with the Right
of Property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

taken away unless adequate compensation was paid, socialism could never be
achieved. I t would be beyond the means of any government in a poor country
like ours to pay compensation at market rates and the payment of such
compensation even if practicable would perpetuate inequalities. In the view of
the Congress (R) Government it was only when the right to property is
considerably modified through constitutional amendment that the realisation of
socialism would be possible. If socialism is not <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
the extreme forces of revolution would gain ground and there would be an end to
democracy. If there is a conflict between the fundamental rights of individuals
and the requirements of social justice the latter should have priority over the
former. Such a modification of fundamental rights would be possible only if and
when Parliament gets the power to modify them. The impasse created by the

additional arguments have been put forward in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of Parliament getting back the power to amend the Articles relating to
fundamental rights. One is that the alternative of convening a Constituent
Assembly for the purpose is both undesirable and impracticable. Any Constituent
Assembly would have to be elected by the same people who elect the Parliament.
It cannot, therefore, have greater competence or legitimacy than the Parliament
to amend the Constitution. Moreover it will not be practically to convene a
separate Constituent Assembly whenever the need for an amendment arises. In a
big country like ours even a referendum for the purpose will be difficult. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

other argument is that our Constitution contains not only Part III on
Fundamental Rights but also Part IV on The Directive Principles of State
policy. <span class=GramE>Both.</span> <span class=GramE>parts</span> are
equally important. There ids is no justification for the view of the Supreme
Court that Part III is more important and it should not be touched by
Parliament even when the Articles it contains stand in the way of giving
reality to Directive Principles. One of these principles (Article 39) lays
down: “The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing (a)
that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means
of livelihood; (b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of
the community are so distributed as best to <span class=SpellE>subserve</span>

the 24th amendment does is to restore to Parliament the right to amend every
part of the Constitution including the part dealing with fundamental rights.
Under this amendment it is made clear that “Law” in<i> </i>Article 13 means
only ordinary law and not a constitutional amendment. It lays down that
Parliament has full and unfettered power to “amend by way of addition,
variation, or repeal any provision of the Constitution in accordance with the
procedure laid down in this Article” (Article 368). Any provision means a
provision relating to fundamental rights also. A third part of the amendment
says that the amendment passed in accordance with the procedure “shall be
presented to the President who shall give his assent to the bill.” This means
he cannot refuse his assent to a constitutional amendment. In the <st1:place

hastily amending fundamental rights. Some safeguards are necessary to overcome
such a danger. In most democratic states there is a powerful opposition and
without its co-operation no amendment is possible. We do not have such an
opposition and it does not look as if in the near future such an opposition can
be built. The only other safeguard we can think of and which does not exist now
is the inclusion of a new provision that no amendment to it should be enacted
unless it receives the assent of a majority of states. At present such assent
is required only in respect of certain Articles dealing with the federal
aspects. The new provision should make the assent applicable to all Articles

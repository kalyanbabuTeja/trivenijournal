recognition for Raja Rao (a British Professor once mentioned publicly that the

contemporary of Mulk Raj Anand and R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> and

plight. She cannot have light because oil is expensive and what she earns is
only a rupee a month. <span class=SpellE>Ramappa</span> feels the agony that

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

is also, like <span class=SpellE>Javni</span>, a part of most Indian homes. She
is service personified. She cooks for the family, discusses <i>Vedanta </i>with
the elders and brings up the children. But, alas, her service is un-<span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> and she dies like an <span class=SpellE>unhonoured</span>
soldier. In fact, the story is perhaps her only funeral ceremony. <span
class=SpellE><i>Narsiga</i></span><i> </i>is a powerful account of a pure and
simple shepherd boy, who gives his own version of the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
revolution and its impact on the rural world. <i>In <span class=SpellE>Khandesh</span>
</i>is a vivid picture of the village <span class=SpellE>Khandesh</span>, whose
elders are loyal and faithful to the Crown and know nothing of the ‘city
news’–riots and protests, arrests and shootings–that the younger generation
indulged in. They are elaborately exhorted and authoritatively herded by the
Patel, the local symbol of the Crown for them, to line up near the railway
track to have a glimpse, although imaginary, of the Maharaja, who would pass
along the route accompanied by the ‘Representative and Relation of Most High
Majesty across the sea’. When they gather at last, there is a terrific storm,
and a heavy downpour imprisons them, as it were. Sheets of rain like walls of
curtain tear them and the trees before them look like policemen. The story
depicts the transition between the era of unquestioning loyalty to the British
and the beginning of <span class=SpellE>organised</span> opposition to the
alien rule, and the picturesque concluding passage describing the climax has a
double suggestiveness–the havoc of the British rule and also the beginning of
the end of loyalty to it are alike suggested in terms of nature’s fury. The
pattern of broken and unconnected lines adds a visual dimension to the
description of the confusion of the storm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
title-story, <i>The</i> <i>Cow of the Barricades, </i>is a poetic recordation
of the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> phenomenon, with <span class=SpellE>Gauri</span>
the cow-mother as the central character. The Mahatma preaches the message of
non-violence and the Master transmits it to the people, because he is their
President. But the workmen maintain: “It is not with ‘I love you, I love you’
that you can change the grinding heart of<i> </i>this Government.” The people
know that the Master is right and that the workmen too are right in their own
way, and await the outbreak of violence with anguished hearts. <span
class=SpellE>Gauri</span>, the cow, is the divine ambassador of peace. The
workmen who find her proceeding towards the barricades want to shoot her but
soon throw down their arms and salute her. Even the red man’s army, which after
all consists of Indians, is transformed by her, because she appeared to them
like a drop of the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganges</st1:place>. They too join the
crowd. The red chief is angered by this and shoots down <span class=SpellE>Gauri</span>:
“But their chief, the red man, saw this and fired a shot. It went through <span
class=SpellE>Gauri’s</span> head, and she <span class=GramE>fell</span> a
vehicle of God among lowly men.” <span class=SpellE>Gauri</span> is <span
class=GramE>Soon</span> deified and the Master Says: “<span class=SpellE>Gauri</span>
is waiting in the Middle Heavens to be born. She will be reborn when India
sorrows again before she is free” All creatures –the mute and the <span
class=SpellE>speechful</span>–are alike capable of the fullness of love, and
perhaps the mute can sometimes inspire and even elevate the <span class=SpellE>speechful</span>.
The<i> </i>story thus combines myth and politics, which is often the case in
India, and while in some of the other stories there are cow-like women, full of
love and sacrifice, the cow is the central character of this story and, as a
symbol of peace and love, strikes a contrast with the petty men who try to
destroy one another, unmindful of their basic oneness as the children </span><span

mythological moorings–both seem to be effectively portrayed in these short
stories. Though structurally they seem to be rather loosely knit, they are
written in a style which has a piercing directness and poetic richness. Another
important aspect of the stories is that they are the matrix out of which the
themes, images and symbols of the later works are <span class=GramE>Woven</span>.
The cow image has already been referred to and this figures in some form or the
other in all the works. <span class=SpellE>Javni</span>, <span class=SpellE>Akkayya</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Lakshmamma</span> in <i>The Serpent and the Rope–</i>all<i> </i>seem
to be of one mould and have something of the ‘Cow’ in them, while <span

Indian village, is the scene of action and the narrator is an elderly woman of
the Village. She is herself a participant in the action and one sees things as
she saw them. The novel is a mixture of fact and fiction, myth and history, as
is seen in the short stories also. Raja Rao had already tried to impart
something of the Indian idiom to the English prose style, and in <span

the choice of his rather peculiar idiom which includes the rhythm and the
raciness, the <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> and the spontaneity of the

Persian was before–but not of our emotional make-up. We are all instinctively
bilingual, many of us writing in our own language and in English. We cannot
write like the English. We should not. We can write only as Indians. We have

<span class=SpellE><i>Kanthapura</i></span><i> </i>in 1938, the collection of
short stories, <i>The Cow of the Barricades, </i>came out in 1947, but after
that there was a spell of silence for nearly thirteen years. <i>The Serpent and
the Rope </i>come out in 1960 and justified the long incubation. The novel is
at once intriguing with its wide canvas and multiple vision of France, England
and India. The response was rather one of mingled feelings, and an American
reviewer, Charles W. Mann, says that “the reader must face a flood of learned
allusion and often annoying garrulity in this complex, yet poetic work.” He
further accuses Raja Rao of producing one of the most ‘difficult and
circuitous’ novels of recent years, although he recommends it for all libraries
concerned with serious modern fiction! The reviewer finally says that the try
of Raja Rao is worthy of respect and much more subtle than can adequately be
expressed in a review, and one would agree with Mr. Mann’s conclusion. The
reviewer of the TLS, however, calls it another ‘leisurely novel’ and sums up
the plot as a series of ‘difficulties attendant upon a marriage between a young
Indian, Rama, and a French intellectual, Madeline. Naturally considerable
adjustment of values and ideals must take place if such a union is to be
satisfactory.’ Professor K. R. Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> says
in his book that it is perhaps the most impressive novel yet written by an
Indian in English. It might even be said that it is the most <i>inclusive </i>novel
to be written in English by an Indian. One might turn to it for the ineluctable
‘<span class=SpellE>Englishing</span>’ of the Sanskrit verse, or one might
witness in it endless debates of teasing philosophical systems, or one might
gather from it pithy pronouncements and intriguing epigrams. The total comprehension
of the book certainly calls for a variety of insights and hence the despair of
the critic. The complexity in structure is the obvious result of Raja <span
class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> unique personality–his rich and versatile scholarship
and the highly metaphysical bent of his mind, which is amazingly mercurial in
its movement. He cannot for this reason, conform to any formal ceiling, and
this is true of all his work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

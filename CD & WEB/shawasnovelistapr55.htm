Shaw’s literary career chiefly consists of imaginative fiction though the form
varied from the novel and the short story eventually to the play. His narrative
fiction, which runs to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nearly two thousand pages in six volumes
in the Standard Edition of his works, has not received adequate attention till
now. Even his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>critical biographers were content with a few
sketchy chapters on the five novels, while historians of fiction hardly took
notice of them. A few critics found striking similarities between his novels
and his plays. Dr. Archibald Henderson very rightly stated: “Not the least
significant feature of the novels, to my mind, is their foreshadowing of the
future dramatist.” Shaw himself remarked, on reading the proofs of his first
novel (which was published fifty years after it was written) that, like Goethe,
he knew it all along, that his opinions had been the same all through. It is
therefore salutary to attempt a critical review or the five novels, in however
summary a fashion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
novels were written according to a definite plan–five pages a day and one novel
a year–in Shaw’s early London years when he was still struggling to stand on
his own feet. He began a sixth novel in 1888 but left it unfinished. He
received rejection slips from all the publishers to whom he sent the five
novels, one after the other. However, the Socialist revival of the 1880’s gave
birth to a number of propaganda magazines, and Shaw, who had<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>by then become an ardent Socialist, could
get his novels (except the first) serialised in them in the reverse order of
their composition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>(1879), the first novel, true to its title, betrays the
author’s own immaturity and inexperience. Robert Smith, the </span><span

of this novel, resembles the young Shaw in<i> </i>many respects. </span><span

is shy, self-conscious, ill at ease with the women he comes across. He has read
a great deal and is critical of people and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>events. As a clerk in
a carpet company, he lives in private lodgings, where he meets Harriet Russell,
the self-supporting milliner. He is rather enamoured of this New Woman. But in
course of time, she marries a painter, who is “altogether different from the
pale scholar”. Smith leaves the carpet company on a point of self-respect,
becomes the private secretary of an idle Member of Parliament, whose daughter,
an incorrigible flirt, enchants him for a while. At the end, he meets Harriet
to learn from her that he is only a boy–“just a bad case of immaturity”. The
plot of this novel is not coherent and the interest is not quite sustained. But
there are many amusing portraits of the Victorian types. Also there are many
purposive discussions on marriage, art, music, literature and education.
Discerning readers will observe that Shaw’s views on these subjects had been
the same from the beginning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
after finishing his first novel, Shaw joined the debating club called the
Zetetical Society where he learned to speak and argue, to be rational and
practical. These attempts of Shaw are clearly seen in his second novel, The<i>
Irrational Knot </i>(1880). This novel shows marked improvement in
plot-construction, characterisation and in maintaining a balance between
narrative and dialogue. The hero of this novel is an electrical engineer,
Edward Conolly, who is rational and critical to the bone. He comes into contact
with Marian Lind, an upper middle class girl, with all the inhibitions of her
class. But these were only latent. When Conolly stabilizes his position by the
invention of the Electro-Motor, he marries Marian, facing a great deal of
opposition from her father’s side. But soon he discovers that she is not quite
the sort of woman he took her to be and realises that an ordinary working girl
would share his tastes and interests much better than Marian. She also feels
unhappy with the intellectual machine she had married and so flirts with Sholto
Douglas, a conceited young poet of her own class. Though she rejected his
proposal on two occasions earlier, she elopes with him to New York when a
suitable opportunity arose. Now Conolly applauds her grit in running away and
wants to make things easy for her by seeking divorce. But Marian is not happy
with Sholto. He was jealous of her and suspects her too often even during their
voyage. On hearing that Conolly is seeking divorce, Sholto quarrels with Marian
and they part on bad terms in New York. She lives in poor lodgings and cables
the news to her cousin in London. Conolly guesses the hardships of a woman in a
new city, goes to New York and offers to take her back without any fuss. But
she would not return since she was already with child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this plain story is skilfully dovetailed the story of Conolly’s sister,
Susanna, and Marian’s cousin, Marmaduke</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Susanna
earns her livelihood independently by operas and ballets. She attracts
Marmaduke. They live together as man and wife, without any formal ceremony of
marriage, and they have a daughter also. But Susanna becomes an incurable
dipsomaniac. Consequently her reputation on the stage suffers. When a
reconciliation with Marmaduke was found impossible, she leaves for the States
to accept a longstanding theatrical engagement. She is a failure on the
American stage and sinks day by day and dies in the same lodgings where Marian
also lives, a few days after her (Marian’s) arrival. Later, Marmaduke consents
to marry according to the wishes of his parents. Shaw claimed that the morality
in this novel is original, which fact entitles it to be called ‘a fiction of
the first order’. He also clarified that he had anticipated the morality of
Ibsen’s <i>A Doll’s House </i>in this novel. The proximity of the last chapter
of the novel to Ibsen is cited as further evidence in favour of his contention.
It is not an exaggeration to say that this novel is an epitome of much of
Shaw’s later teaching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

third novel was interrupted by an attack of small-pox which made him grow his
famous beard. James Lecky had introduced him to phonetics, the knowledge of
which helped him in writing <i>Love Among the Artists </i>(1881). It is the
story of two </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>artists, a Welsh composer, Owen Jack, and an
actress, Magdalen Brailsford who has to struggle hard against a Philistine
public and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the tyranny of a family of prudes respectively,
to pursue their vocations independently. These two are contrasted with the
pseudo-painter, Adrian Herbert, and the commercial-souled, Polish pianist,
Aurelie. Love inevitably plays a prominent part and there are mutual
attractions and repulsions. At the end, however, the genuine artists, who are
either ‘complete’ in themselves already (Jack) or strive for perfection (Madge)
remain unmarried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

novel anticipates the <i>motifs </i>of <i>Candida, Man and Superman </i>and <i>Pygmalion,
</i>Mary Sutherland and Aurelie refuse to marry Jack and Charles respectively,
even as Candida subtly refuses Eugene Marchbanks, because they had to look
after Adrian who was ‘spoiled’ by doting women. Also, it shows that artists and
poets like Jack and Eugene do not need love. Madge is rightly identified by Dr.
Archibald Henderson as an early version of the Life Force, Ann Whitefield.
Madge hunts down Jack in almost the same cunning way as Ann did Tanner. But
Madge could not hold him in her grip. He was, after all, her teacher and she
adheres to his advice that she should master the Art which is inspired by a
passion for beauty, which would enable her to make true love. The theme of <i>Pygmalion,
</i>the teaching of phonetics and the successful transformation of a flower
girl into an aristocratic lady, is hinted at in the novel, where Madge takes
lessons in elocution from Jack and becomes a first-rate actress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Byron’s Profession </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(1882), the fourth novel, was the most
popular of Shaw’s novels. This is the story of an actress’s son who becomes a
famous pugilist. He gradually works his way to Lydia Carew, the orphan owner of
a large estate, with whom he falls in love. She is also in love with him. But
his status is believed to be inferior compared to hers. Besides he is engaged in
a questionable occupation. These two complications keep the lovers apart for
some time. They are got over by the dramatic appearance of Cashel’s mother who
announces that Cashel is the sole heir to a big fortune. Cashel marries Lydia
and forsakes pugilism for politics. But the most thrilling event in the novel
is the actual wrestling contest at the Agricultural Hall between Cashel Byron
and another champion, Paradise. This is described in detail and was thoroughly
enjoyed by the reading public. We have Frank Harris’s testimony that Shaw
practised boxing in his younger days and the knowledge he gained thus stood him
in good stead in writing this scene. Due to the great enthusiasm evinced in
this novel and also to protect his stage rights, he hastened to dramatise it in
blank verse and declared that it is much easier to write in blank verse than in
good prose. This play was performed a number of times drawing ‘huge applause’.
The success of this play shows that the natural medium for Shaw was the drama,
but not the novel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the last novel, <i>An Unsocial Socialist </i>(1883), Shaw pours out his new
faith, Socialism. He had been converted to it just then by Henry George and
Karl Marx. The hero of this novel, Sidney Trefusis, is the son of a capitalist.
Educated in Cambridge he presently understands that ‘property is theft’. He
preaches this with unabated passion and exposes the villainies of Capitalism.
He marries an intensely passionate girl of his own class, Hetty, but after a
short period refuses to live with her on the plea that, in her bewitching
presence, he cannot carry on his work of serving the cause of the workers. In
his wanderings, he comes across a few aristocratic College girls with whom he
flirts. His wife learns this and hazards a journey to him in biting cold. He
pacifies her and sends her back. But she contracts high fever of which she dies
shortly after her return home. The pompous funeral arranged </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
her wealthy and snobbish father, and his typically bourgeois reactions, were
nauseous and intolerable to Sidney. Hence he boycotts the funeral, but erects
an humble and cheap memorial which wounds the vanity of his father-in-law. But
in course of time they are reconciled. Sidney takes a lead in the labour
movements and dedicates his life to the amelioration of the condition of the
workers. He gains a variety of<i> </i>experiences. He marries a second time a
very clever and quick-witted girl and a cousin of his first wife, Agatha Wylie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every
interest in this novel–story, plot, characterization–is subordinated to the
preaching of Socialism. The hero goes on lecturing on the slightest
provocation, laying bare the grave injustices done under the system of
Capitalism and offering Socialist remedies. In this novel, we come across the
themes which were later developed in plays like <i>Misalliance </i>and The <i>Apple
Cart? </i>The title is appropriate because the hero is unsocial in his
behaviour even towards his closest relatives. In this novel, we have a clue to
Shaw’s change-over to play-writing. Speaking of the future of the arts in a
Socialist State, Sidney Trefusis says: “Works of fiction superseded by
interesting company and conversation, and made obsolete by the human mind
outgrowing the childishness that delights in the tales told by grown up
children, such as novelists and their like.” We have plenty of such
‘interesting company and conversation’ in his plays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
novels were written in the prime of his youth–between his twenty-second and
twenty-seventh years. The subjects which interested him most at the time,
marriage, the place of artists in society and the reorganisation of society,
found expression in them. Shaw found that there are as many types of marriage
as there are people and that marriage is essentially ‘irrational’ and unsound
in its basis. Most marriages are fraught with many incompatibilities of tastes
and temperaments. Hence happiness in marriage is a matter of chance. The place
of the artist in the self-complacent Victorian society was anything out
honourable. The Philistine public were insensible to good art and good music,
Artists, whether professional or amateur, had to struggle hard to earn their
livelihood and to uphold the traditions. Shaw visualised a bright future for
the artists in a Socialist State in his last novel where the hero declared:
“Art rises when men rise and grovels when men grovel.” With the raising of
living standards of people it is possible to improve the lot of the artists.
Finally, Shaw thought of a Socialist State as a remedy for all the ills of the
world. The co-existence of extreme poverty and fabulous wealth, the Victorian
prudery and conventional respectability, the self-deceptions of the clergy and
the lethargy of the politicians–these ar</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>e all the evil results
of Capitalism. They can be rooted out only in the Socialist order. The country
should be the property of all its inhabitants collectively. Such is Shaw’s
preaching in his last novel. Summing up the themes of Shaw’s novels St. John
Ervine said: “The hatred of hypocrisy and pretentious respectability and
irrational social cleavages and stupefying poverty and every kind of organised
priestcraft, whether of the law, or the church, or of medicine or of politics,
which he acquired in Dublin as a boy and as a youth, was poured into his novels
and distilled from them into his plays.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Coming
to the characters, we find traces of Shaw in almost all the heroes. In the
depiction of types the novelist excels. The Nobility, the clergymen, the
prudes, the pseudo-artists, the flirt and several others are portrayed with an
amazing faithfulness. These types are very amusing. Shaw also portrayed the New
Woman in Harriet Russell, Elinor McQuinch, and Agatha Wylie, who are the
companions of Nora Helmer. The pursuing woman is depicted in Magdalen
Brailsford and Henrietta Jansenius. Almost all the characters belong to the
urban areas, most of them to the upper middle class. One of the finest
creations is Lydia’s footman, Bashville. The children, though few, are
self-willed and brought up according to the Shavian formula. In spite of being
Shaw’s mouthpieces, quite a few of these characters are memorable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is in the novels a lot of ‘theatrical element which shows that they are ‘a
preparation for the plays’. Dialogue and discussion take the place of narrative
and description more and more as we proceed from the earlier to the later
novels. They are the chief ingredients of the New Drama which Bernard Shaw
initiated in England under the influence of Ibsen. The root of the long
speeches of characters like John Tanner is the speeches of Edward Conolly and
Sidney Trefusis. Some chapters in the novels can be adapted easily to the
stage, retaining much of the original dialogue. The descriptive part will be
helpful for settings and the narrative for stage directions. As Dr. Archibald
Henderson pointed out, Shaw always saw his characters in a situation. Besides,
in the first four novels, a number of actors, actresses, dancers, musicians or
composers appear. There are ballets, concerts and dramas in the course of the
novels. Finally, the <i>motifs </i>of some of the important plays of Shaw are
found in these novels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were written in conformity with the Victorian novel. But they were full of
biting satire and carping criticism of all the ugly aspects of Victorian life.
They were daring exposures of the villainies of Capitalism. That partly
explains why the novels were rejected by the publishers. It is rather difficult
to decide which of the five novels is the best. Mr. A. C. Ward thinks that the
first is ‘the best in most respects’. The late Dr. C. E. M. Joad was swept off
his feet by the last novel. R. L. Stevenson showered a lot of praise on the
fourth novel which was also the popular choice. But popularity cannot be a
reliable test of merit in the world of letters. Shaw remarked very pungently
that admiration for <i>Cashel Byron’s Profession </i>is the mark of a fool. The
second and third novels are very satisfactory from many points of view, though
a devoted Shavian would prefer <i>The Irrational Knot </i>to all the others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
the novels were rejected, they gave Shaw a good training in the art of writing,
in inventing stories, in constructing plots and in creating characters. This
training was responsible in not a small measure for Shaw’s extraordinary
output. The play-wright is not an isolated phenomenon or a sudden offshoot but
quite a logical and natural growth. Shaw’s novels are really plays which, as J.
P. Hackett shrewdly observed, took the wrong turning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

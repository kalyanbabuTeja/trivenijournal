<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Disturbing reports continue to pour in from the Mizo
Hills area and it seems that the administrative machinery in the area has
collapsed, as militant tribesmen are attacking police posts and looting treasuries
with impunity. It appears that another Nagaland is in the making. The trouble
in Nagaland itself was really an eye-opener but we have failed to learn any
lesson from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
glance at the map of India will show that both Nagaland and Mizo Hills are
strategically located on our eastern border. The Mizo Hills area is sandwiched
between Burma and East Pakistan and there are Mizo tribes in India, Burma and
East Pakistan. They are called Chin in Burma. But actually all these Mizos and
Nagas have the same culture, customs and language. The fact that they are armed
with hand grenades, sten-guns, rifles and machine-guns is very suggestive of
foreign aid and incitement, overt or covert. If we are not careful we shall
have more trouble in Kachar, Garo and Jaintia Hill areas as well.</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
has been unrest in all these areas since 1947. Certain foreign countries and
some so called missionaries are the main factors behind this. But this is not
all. We will have to go deep to inquire into the genesis of the trouble. Assam
is a peculiar province. The valley of Brahmaputra is the only settled area in
the state where life is more or less the same as in other parts of the country
but the rest of the State is made up of hilly areas, inhabited by tribal
people. The British had so organised their political machinery as to suit the
local conditions. They had, what they called settled areas” where normal
administrative machinery functioned as in other parts of the country but in the
tribal areas they followed a different system altogether. They appointed
political or tribal Commissioners who never interfered in their tribal
Government and so long as they attested their royalty to the British
Government, they were left to themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again
it is a fact that the Mizo area has the second place in literacy</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>in the whole of India, Kerala having the first. There are as
many as 45 per cent people literate. The tribes have a system of government of
their own which, in practice, is more efficient than the elaborate
administrative machinery of the settled areas. As a matter of fact, their
tribal system is more democratic than the eleborate socio-administrative
machinery in settled areas. In a Naga, Garo or Mizo village the land belongs to
the whole community. Children are separated from their parents and brought up
and trained in communal hostels, till they come of age and then join the
community as useful members. Justice is rough but prompt. They have a sense of
fair-play and their conventions hold their society together. These people lead
hard lives and private proprietorship is unknown among them. They clear a strip
of the forest, build a village nearby and practice agriculture. When the
fertility of the land diminishes, they just clear another strip and shift to
the new area, allowing the jungle to grow again in the previously occupied
area. They hunt their meat, brew their own liquor, and live in peace. Of
course, there are tribal feuds and it was only then that the Political Officer
stepped in to preserve peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
British were very particular in choosing the right type of person to hold the
post of the Political Officer or Commissioner. He had to be honest, truthful,
just, impartial and above corruption. He studied their language, history,
ritual, customs and taboos, but he never became over intimate with them. He
dispensed justice impartially. Consequently the tribals respected and trusted
him and his word was law to them. The British, as far as possible, never
changed the officers, and if at all they were transferred, they were sent to a
similar area. These officers usually recorded useful information for the
benefit of their successors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all this changed after 1947. The old British officers left the country and
their places were taken by Indian officers who looked upon their postings to
these remote areas as penal servitude. We tried to introduce modern methods of
administration with a horde of officials who had no understanding of the
delicate task entrusted to them. We tried to enforce laws and regulations which
were completely alien to the tribal people. We tried to civilise them. This
they resented. We tried to stop them from changing their abodes and advised
them to settle permanently at fixed places. This they could not understand, and
felt they were being robbed of their freedom of movement and means of
livelihood. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our Court and Court Procedure were too
complicated and cumbersome for the tribal people to follow. Till 1956, there
was no attempt at developing these areas. Only after the Naga trouble had
assumed serious proportions did we realise the need for the economic
development of these areas. The new administrative machinery brought in its
wake, peons, clerks, head-clerks and petty officials followed by petty
shopkeepers and ruthless businessmen. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bribery and corruption
on the part of officials destroyed the old image of the Government
representative, whose integrity was taken </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for granted. These
officials were looked upon as alien tyrants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nehru
felt the reality of the situation. In November 1963 he accepted the principle
of autonomy for these hill areas. But alas, it was not implemented at that time
and only in 1965 a Commission under the chairmanship of Shri Pataskar was
appointed to report in this matter. But now it is very late. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
these tribals were half Hindus–half Pagans. During the last 70 or 80 years
foreign Christian missions have been working in these areas. The missionaries
learned the languages of the people, started schools, hospitals, and small
technical institutions. They printed books in the Roman script for them and at
the same time they spread Christianity among them. Practically all Nagas and
Mizos under 45 are Christians. The percentage of literacy is high. But these
missionaries did not try to disrupt their way of life and consequently earned
the respect of the tribals. Hindu or Buddhist missionaries have done nothing to
counteract </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
granting of freedom to India was not liked by many countries. These tribals are
occupying areas which are strategically important. They are located in an area
where the boundaries of four nations meet–India, Pakistan, Burma and China.
Some pseudo-missionaries, who were really secret agents of foreign powers, now
began to operate in these areas and we simply played into their hands. During World
War II, both sides had recruited Mizos, Nagas and Kachins. Large dumps of arms
were left in the jungles and the tribals helped themselves and collected a
formidable arsenal of arms. These pseudo-missionaries incited these tribals
against the Indian government and put ideas of independence in their heads. The
Government had to admit the presence of these pseudo-missionaries and some of
them were deported. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Government of Burma is co-operating with India in curbing the activities of the
Nagas because Burma too has a Naga problem on her hands. But with Pakistan, the
case is different. Nagas and now Mizos are being trained in East Pakistan. But
Pakistan must realise that India too can play the same game. We too can arm and
train dissidents in East Pakistan and the N. W. Frontier Province and this must
be brought home to Pakistan with emphasis. Then only will she refrain from
aiding and abetting these tribes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Peace Mission has failed in its efforts. For eighteen months the so called
peace talks have led to nowhere. In spite of a ceasefire, Naga attacks
continue. Shri J. P. Narayan has resigned and we are allowing a foreign
missionary to move freely in and out of the tribal territory. We need no
foreign intermediary to settle our domestic problems. Strength must accompany
understanding of the basic grievances of the tribals. We should withdraw the
army of non-tribal officials and leave local matters in the hands of the
tribals. We should abstain from changing their age-old way of life. Urban
civilisation will be unsuitable for these children of the jungle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is needed is prompt action and promises must be implemented at once. A new
cadre of officials, well versed in tribal history, usage and ritual, must be
trained and raised. Above all, they must have character. Justice must be
dispensed quickly and red tape must have no place in tribal areas. We must
understand their problems and grievances and solve them with understanding,
sympathy and firmness. Side by side we must endeavour to improve their economy
through local effort. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>MAN has an endless capacity to talk. He attaches
little importance to his acts. There is a deathless desire in him to honour
culture and tradition. The growth of civilization is rooted in him. Modern
civilization is not the evolution of emotions in him. He has learnt to stifle
his emotions with that strength of intellect registering the facts of science.
Science wants him to analyse Nature. With tolerable and intolerable ambitions
he starts dissecting Nature to find his Creator’s face. As he looks at Nature
with a mind different from that of the scientist man betrays his ignorance of
life’s purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Life is culture normal and simple. We have not the
patience to conceive life in the right manner. We approach it in suspicion. We
take it as an evil necessity. We think we belong to the State and not to
ourselves or humanity. We become political beasts knowing no quiet abode or
solace in the soul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Our ancestors worshipped Nature. They too knew the
secrets of Nature which had a spiritual meaning for them. We are concerned with
adding and spending; with little love for work we labour for hours like
automobiles. Most of us pretend to possess a highly developed sensitive
mechanism which in fact is weak. Even with the growth of refined thoughts man
is seen still in possession of primitive instincts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Human mind is a store-house of vicious thoughts. It
needs purification at every hour of the day, at each stage of life. Culture
turns to ashes all the unwanted ideals. It has an ideal, the aim of pure
emotions, to reach the perfect self in man. His imperfect self, his ego
distorts and dims his otherwise good vision and he looks at the universe in a
suffocating smoke. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As a product of Nature, possessing the attributes
of Nature, the mind of man must be essentially a spotless mirror. But the
environments and circumstances in which it develops impart a very good deal of
non-essential ideas, which in turn develop the ego in him. This imbibing of a
number of meaningless words lead even the greatest of men to the stinking pit
of egoism, where he rots helpless devoid of integrity, sincerity, and faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The natural way of living is no more seen and the
simplicity of existence is dead. As he has disfigured the world around him, man
dwells in his own thoughts. He sees his own corpse but has not the strength for
contempt. He laments and shudders. If one ventures to show his moral courage he
is suspected as an anarchist, an enemy of Society, a traitor to the State, or a
devil against God. The morals of State and Society are preached while this
planet is crumbling to ruins. Still the fight for life is fought by the
crawling worm and the superman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The soul of humanity is culture which aims at
finding “the perfect expression of beauty” which we call Reality. Clean
thoughts arise in the hearts of those whose sympathy embraces humanity.
Enchanting beauty is moulded by the eminent personalities whose love expanded
beyond the limits of flesh and its urgencies. It is that beauty found in works
of arts and sciences which we call culture. It inspires us to calm the
agitation’s of the heart; it attempts to clean its own birth-spot, the human
mind. Man and the living world around him subsist in an unifying culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The world we live in has many masters to decide its
destiny. Destiny is decided not by man but by natural law. Man gasps in pain
for the masters of men are a prey to their vilest desires. They have insulted
Adam and disobeyed Eve; Have our minds no potency to struggle for the
establishment of justice, the language of the Gods? Have we lost identity with
our own companions on Earth? Faith of man in man is not seen. All know that
they do not see the quiet, pellucid eyes of culture; but no one has a wish to
profess it. Man speaks that he fights for peace, democracy, and civilization.
When he has stabbed at that divine personality in himself, the most intense and
glowing atom in him cannot but extinguish itself in calamity. Many sages
proclaim that they have known the meaning of culture. Have they comprehended
the purpose of life? Silent dreamers talking symbolic words and interpreting
the dust-ridden pages of ancient tomes can never save a decaying civilization.
We think we advance; really we have shattered the steps we trod to reach the
spot where no lamp is lit to guide us further. When we gaze on the world around
us with that emotional intensity essential to lift the veil of ignorance our
afflicted minds see the lands of mortals with blood-spots and bone-heaps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Innumerable philosophic, metaphysical and
scientific doctrines and conventional and customary practices and rituals have
broken the delicate walls of human consciousness. Out of chaos man emerged with
a conscience, the presence of which is to show him his own errors. He takes to
that way of life which is not the cultural way and so ignores his own sense of
values. He finds weight in the words of X and Y who appear to him favoured by
fate and sent by the angels. In the happiness he sought in his works he found a
bitter pill. That is the position an average man finds when left to himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In a moment of inexpressible tranquillity, the
seeker after truth, in blissful meditation done with utter detachment,
assimilates the meaning of culture. He becomes normal and simple. His
simplicity is not a pose and he finds a purpose for every struggle waged in
earnestness. He never speaks. He thinks to that moment when thoughts desert him
senses succumb to his will and Nature stands radiant and unadorned before him.
Profound is his silence and the brilliance of his eyes reveal that the law of
nature is the law of human conscience. That is culture,–life finding its own
fulfillment in its own beginnings. Learn to become innocent as the children in
the cradle with the wisdom of Einstein and Tolstoy. Then you understand the
value of emotions which severs your kinship with the Chimpanzee and the
Orang-utan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is now the day for man to think more of his
frustrations which cloud his naturally pure mind. True culture is not a lesson
to be learnt but a state to be experienced. To experience this state is not a
difficult task provided we decide to laugh at death and dictators. We need not
believe in supermen as they are only a few miles away from us, ahead of us to
reach the goal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Our destiny is not to convert the globe into a
purgatory, but to introspect. An introspection that makes us see the world not
as a ball of chaos, but as the source of our actions and happiness. If we do
not question the nature of things and swallow others’ views as they were or as
they are, how can we be certain that the sayings of the famous dead and living
personalities which we treasure in our memories could make us men of learning,
men of culture?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

moment when death completes life, when man separates himself from man and
dissolves into the elements which composed the corpse he carried is the most
cruel and the most painful. Though unaware of the purpose of culture, he
becomes conscious of the futility of existence. It is this last moment which
needs pure consciousness and satisfaction in him coupled with the truest
affection of others for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

peaks of snow and forests and cuts new tracks through the scattered turbulent
nations of the world. Nations become flooded by this swelling beauty of
culture. Their convulsive diseases are cured their distorted shapes change. Man
begins to think that he is a citizen of the world, the object of the earth
below his feet. He realises that he never more belongs to one particular state
or society or to one square plot of ground where his mother lay to deliver him
to his father whose responsibility it was to see to the proper growth of that
individual and his apprehension of Truth in himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

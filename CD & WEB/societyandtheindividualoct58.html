revaluation of the relationship of the individual and society, in the context
of present conditions and in the perspective of modern ideas, is called for in
our country. There have been here such radical and revolutionary changes in
political, economic and social conditions that hoary and established ideas and
institutions are tottering down, as buildings do in an earthquake. But some of
us continue to be under the dominion of the past, and are unable to discard
outmoded ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Man
has been described by one of the earliest of the Greek philosophers as a social
animal. He is a community-building individual, impelled by instinct to live
with his fellows. Most animals live in flocks or herds. Very few live alone.
The earliest unit of human society was the family. Then came the tribe, during
the period of man’s nomadic life; afterwards, the settled community of the
hamlet, the village, the town, the city and the nation. Side by side, although
much later, arose the religious groups, the trade guilds, the professional or
artistic societies, the social or sporting clubs, etc. While man shares the
gregarious instinct with animals, his craving and capacity for social life are
altogether different in quality. A man’s society is not limited to physical
contact; nor is it limited by time. He is capable in one sense of joining the
society of the past and that of the future. His gregarious instinct can operate
mentally and emotionally. While living in a village, he may feel himself a
member of a large religious group spread allover the country, or even a citizen
of the world. He can live alone, and never feel less alone than when alone. He
may, on the other hand, feel isolated in a crowd. This is because he is at once
an animal and a spiritual being. Further, he has the capacity to effect changes
in his social organization. The complicated modern society today, which has
evolved out of primitive communities, illustrates this truth. In the animal
world, however, there are no such changes to be seen. We are born into society.
We are parts of it. We eat the food it gives, play with it, are educated by it,
adopt its customs and tend mostly to think its thoughts and feel its emotions.
But we are at the same time individuals. As units of an organized society,
there are in us two struggling impulses: one prompting us to be with the herd,
and the other dragging away from it. There is the pull of solitude, and there
is the put of multitude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall begin by stressing the value of the individual. To use the words of D. H.
Lawrence, “Each human self is single, incommutable and unique. This is his <i>first
</i>reality. The fact that an actual man, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>present before us, is
an inscrutable and incarnate Mystery, untranslatable: this is the fact upon which
any great scheme of social life must be based. The living self has one purpose:
to come into its own fullness or being, as a tree comes into full blossom, or a
world into spring-beauty or a tiger into lustre.” But the individual, in order
that he may attain his highest ends and fulfil himself in all ways open to him,
must live in society: If not in physical contact with society, at least in
mental association. And, in order to live in society, he must live subject to
certain conditions imposed by society on him. Social life involves obligations.
If you have rights you have corresponding duties: that is where moral
obligation comes in. I cannot live with others unless I do or abstain from
doing a number of things. Otherwise, they know how to make me unhappy, and
prevent me from fulfilling myself. But, just as the individual may seek to
rebel against social obligations, society may tend to impose unnecessary
fetters. I shall refer to these matters again later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

shall now refer to the several modes of social organization. For convenience’s
sake, roughly speaking, human society can be said to be organized, according to
the purposes of organization, politically, economically, religiously and
socially. Society politically organized is called the State. In early times,
the State looked after the religions of the people who composed it. The State
was often identified with a particular religion, and was hostile to heresy. We
refer to such States as theocratic States. They are inconsistent with the
modern outlook. Now no civilised State thinks of identifying itself officially
with any particular religion, and we can, therefore, deal with social
organization for the purpose of religion as a separate type of organization.
Then, as regards economic organization, the State today is tending to cover
this kind of organization too to a considerable extent. Democratic institutions
inevitably are driven towards economic equality. As Laski says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
survival of political democracy is, all over the world, definitely impossible
unless it can conquer the central citadel of economic power.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Democracy
cannot survive without some kind of socialism. The Welfare State today,
therefore, is concerned with the economic organization of society. Time was
when the State was content to keep law and order. But today the State is
extending its activities into several fields of human welfare. Economic
planning may necessitate regimentation, and that may lead to too great an
interference with individual liberty. There is the danger of its trying to
order our lives in all directions. If the old governments did little for
ordinary men, the governments today perhaps incline to do too much. Under the
impact of democracy, the limits of political interference are being perhaps
unduly extended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
as regards unofficial economic organizations, we find them in the now obsolete
guilds, in partnerships, companies, cartels, trade-unions, etc. Professional
organizations to perhaps may be put under this category. Under the category of
organizations purely for social purposes, we might put organization for the
purpose of amusement, pleasure, culture, art and language. We must note,
however, that none of these categories is absolute. We may observe, too, that
each kind of organization tends to enlarge its area of activity and its hold on
the individual. In primitive society, the king was not only the ruler but also
the vice-regent of God. And religion was not only concerned with faith, rites
and morals but also with social and domestic behaviour. Our caste system, for
instance, treated by the rulers and the ruled as being of the highest sanctity,
may be described as a social organization not merely for religious but social
and economic purposes alike. The caste system regulated and determined our
education, our profession, our mode of life, our status in society and our
hopes and aspirations in regard to economic security, professional achievement
and social respect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
each one of us, we may notice, incidentally, lives in a number of
cross-sections of society at the same time. One is a member at once of so many
kinds of social groups. One consequence of this is the frequent clash and
conflict in one’s mind of competing loyalties. Every social unit from the
family upwards is guided by innumerable written or unwritten standards of
behaviour handed on to generation after generation by custom which may be
described as ‘the government of the living by the dead.’ The pressure of these
standards upon the individual is very heavy and often operates in opposite directions.
This pressure is independent, of course, of the pressure within the individual:
of his own impulses, passions and desires.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall begin with the family which, as I said, was one of the earliest, smallest
and strongest units of society. It arose not only out of the need for society
but because of the helplessness of the human infant and its need for assistance
over a long period. It was a sort of a political, social and economic
organization. Its head was the absolute ruler of the group. The religion he
professed was the religion of the family. He had the lives of every member at
his mercy. The wife–and, in some societies, the wives–and the children were his
chattels. The then current code of morality emphasised respect for the rights
of the father and reverence for the institution of the family. The relationship
of man and woman, of parent and child, was determined by the then social and
economic conditions. Obedience to the father was the highest duty. Loyalty and
fidelity were the greatest virtues. The individual member had no recognition
and few property rights. He had to depend for his resources generally upon the
good graces of the father or of the eldest male member. The Hindu joint family,
which is slowly dying out under the impact of modern ideas and conditions and
legislation, represents some of these features. The family was also a social
unit helping in the prevention of crime and disorder. The head of the family
was responsible to society or to the ruler for the behaviour of its members. If
its members injured other people, the head of the family or the whole family
was answerable. The family had to pay compensation to the injured from out<i> </i>of
its property, or suffer punishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
one stage of social development, it was inevitable that these conditions should
prevail. But conditions have gradually changed with the realisation, among
other things, of the importance of the individual and of the need for
self-expression. Naturally, the old restraints and conventions are losing their
hold, as the old notions are yielding place to new. One of the important
changes in recent times is what has been called the emancipation of women. With
the advance of civilisation, some of the forces which rendered the family a
necessary unit of society, for several purposes, are losing much of their
strength. When there was no organized public assistance to the poor or the
helpless, no old age pensions such as are provided in some countries today; no
form of social insurance, the family had to afford refuge in poverty, in old
age or in infirmity. Modern conditions, to a certain extent, have all rendered
or are rendering these aspects of family obligation unnecessary. There is also
the further fact that people lived in the old days, generation after
generation, in the same neighbourhood, and in close contact with each other.
Today the family of the old type is often only a notional unit. But even today,
the family is a necessary form of society to the individual. So far as the
child is concerned, this is obvious. No child can be happy except in domestic
environment. The community cannot replace the family in this regard. In
particular, the need of a child for affection and sympathy, its need to be
needed, can never be satisfied except in the home. As an eminent modern psychologist
has observed: “In the family situation are provided the setting, the
stimulation and guidance which determine, very largerly, whether the child
shall develop into a personally well-adjusted and socially useful individual.”
There is also the individual’s feeling for home, for a place where one is
limited to the company of persons who take a personal interest in one, where
one’s emotions can find full play, and where one can be one’s self.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the old days of unquestioned domestic authority are over. A father has long
ceased to have the power of life and death over the members of his family–as in
the days of Theseus. He cannot, and if he is wise does not, insist even upon
disposing of his daughter in marriage. His wife is not compellable to stay with
him as she had to, of old, even under intolerable conditions. Whatever the
Scriptures are supposed to say, just as a son need not obey his father
implicitly, a wife is not a perpetual bond-slave to her husband. Modern
attitude does not favour the undutiful or cruel husband, nor does it worship
the too submissive, the too yielding wife. The law of marital relations has
been changed at the instance of progressive minds, and with it the attitude to
marriage is changing surely, although, perhaps, slowly. In some of these
matters, we are making the laws first, depending upon the sentiment in favour
of the law to grow later. We realise today that sometimes even children need to
be protected from their parents. The </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>State, for instance,
enjoins, or is trying fast to enjoin, compulsory education, compulsory health
measures, immunity from premature employment, etc. These Legal measures
necessarily affect the foundations of domestic life. No sensible man, however,
ignores the necessity for recognising and encouraging family ties, but they
must not conflict with, but be consistent with, progressive ideas as to
individual rights and social consequences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall now very briefly refer to the village community. It is, in my opinion,
wrong to think that communal life in a village is just like communal life in a
city or a town, but only on a smaller scale. The fact is that there is a
difference in quality. The smaller the group to which a man belongs the greater
is the weight upon him of social pressure. In a village community, people tend
to be more conservative than people who live in a city or town. Every
inhabitant of a village is your neighbour, and a very close neighbour. His eyes
are on you. You cannot go out of step without being noticed. And the punishment
for unusual and unorthodox behaviour is swift and certain. When you feel that
the lives of you and those for whom you care could be made miserable by the
community in which you live, you are naturally careful to observe the customs
and conventions which the communal consensus of opinion dictates. In a city or
town, conditions are different. You may not even know your neighbour in a big
place. In a city or town, residents of even adjoining houses are miles away
from you, so far as neighbourly amenities or associations are concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:26.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
the fact that India has lived largely in village communities explains in part
how we in this country have resisted social change through centuries. Every
class or section of the community in a village has been observing from time immemorial
its own unwritten code of behaviour. One amazing thing is that a member of a
caste or a sub-caste has kept his own beliefs and modes of behaviour without
wondering why members of other groups or communities behave in a different way.
He does not seem to have paused to consider which is the better faith or
custom. On the other hand, there has been almost a fanatical loyalty (to the
extent to which the Hindu spirit of tolerance admits of fanaticism) to the
faith and standards of conduct of his own section of the community. Within the
limits of such a social organization there was little scope for individual
freedom and, therefore, for individual development. The rights of the
individual were always subordinated to those of the family, the community, the
caste or the sub-caste. Unusual behaviour was always objectionable behaviour.
Nobody could attempt to deviate from the rut. An innovator was an iconoclast, a
rebel, a revolutionary and a source of danger. The standards of moral judgment
in such communities are not necessarily the highest. When anything out of the
common is done by anybody, the simple exclamation that it never happened before
embodies the severest criticism. The appeal is not to standards laid down
either by the still small voice within or by the scriptures, but to convention.
The strength of this irrational hold of the group </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>upon
the individual must be weakened if our lives are to be in consonance with
modern conditions and ideas. All standards of individual conduct and all social
obligations of the individual must be constantly revised and brought
up-to-date. Historic continuity with the past may be, to a large extent,
inevitable. But it is not a duty. In this connection, we must remember the
lines of the poet:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I shall now deal with the political organization of
our country. Our country today is a Sovereign Democratic Republic–to adopt the
language of the preamble of the Constitution of India. But some people think
that in our heart of hearts we are, most of us, devoted to monarchy. They say
that it is echoed in our ideal of Ram Rajya. It cannot, perhaps, be disputed
that our loyalities are primarily to persons and not to policies. We have a
deep nostalgia for the past. And in out past there was never an occasion when
there was no king. It is true that our village communities were allowed to
manage their own affairs, and look after their own interests, so long as they
paid Caesar what was due to Caesar. But that was no real democracy at all. Then
people ruled not merely by office but by religion or caste, and their opinions
were governed by custom. Modern democracy does not believe in leaving the
people of small communities alone. A village cannot be left to keep itself tidy
or untidy as it likes, to educate its children or not, or to deal with its
criminals according to its own notions, as was done in the past. The whole of
the country is interested in every part, because every part must be sound in
order that the whole may be sound. Half a century ago, it might not have
mattered to us if there was cholera in a far-away province. But, with the
revolution in the means of communication brought about by modern science, it is
possible that a plague spot in one part of the country may bring plague to
another part a hundred or a thousand miles away. Local self-government is good
on principle. But in a poor country like ours, where taxes are still considered
odious and oppressive, there can be too much of it. It is not everybody who
realises that with taxes we buy civilisation, as was said by Justice Holmes.
The message of modern civilisation must be taken to every village. There are
people of course who hold up their hands in horror at such a prospect, because
they say people were happen in the golden age of the past than they are now.
Yes People were happier, if happiness consists only in living at a level of
sub-humanity, where there are no stirrings of intellectual life. Let us
remember what John Stuart Mill says:</p>

electorate is largely uneducated, is the tendency to overvalue the opinion of
the majority. Nothing is true or just or right because a majority of people

believed that the earth was flat. And a majority of people until a century
back, and perhaps even today, believed, and still believe, that wicked people

is very dangerous. The democratic principle has contributed to the collapse of
civilisation in opposing the development of an elite. It is obvious that, on
the contrary, individual inequalities must be respected. In modern society, the
great, the small, the average and the mediocre are needed. But we should not

must be vigilant to notice the dangers of regimentation. In a country where
economic organization tends to be mainly in the hands of the State, restraints
upon freedom are likely to be numerous. The safeguarding of liberty in a world
which is growing fast in the 20th century is far more difficult, as Bertrand
Russell observes, than it was in the 19th century when free competition was
still a reality. In his view, there are two simple principles which, if they
were adopted, would solve almost all social problems. The first is that
education should have for one of its aims to teach people only to believe
propositions when there is some reason to think that they are true. The second
is that jobs should be given solely for fitness to do the work. The first
principle, he says, would lead to tolerance; and the failure to observe the second
principle, he observes, is a modern form of persecution as efficient as the
Inquisition ever was. In this connection we must also remember that the content
of the word ‘freedom’ is wider today than it has ever been. It is not merely </span><span

shall not deal at length with other modes of social organization, for in our
country the caste system has embraced within itself religious, social and
economic organization; but I shall, before referring to it, touch very briefly
upon some forms of economic organization to which we are of late getting used
and with which we must reckon in the near future. Until the 20th century,
trade-unions were not legal in some countries. But trade-unions have grown up
during the twentieth century all over the civilised world, and the power which
they wield today is remarkable. They have invented a new right, the right to
strike. It is possible for some of these organizations to hold the whole community
at their mercy. This sort of organisation is apt to breed a narrowness of mind,
an insensitiveness to the general interest, which must be guarded against. Some
people still wonder whether such a type of organization, solely or even
primarily concerned with the material interests of its members is a desirable
form of special organization. Professional Institutions, such as the Medical
Councils and the Bar Councils, are primarily concerned with the etiquette of
the profession and the character of the individuals who practise it. They lay
down the qualifications for admission into the profession and the curricula for
professional studies. That kind of organization is unobjectionable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

will now refer to the caste system which has in our country tended to be at
once a social, religious and economic organization. Like an octopus it has
spread its tentacles far and wide. It is now no longer a necessary institution.
That is not to say that it was an evil institution when it began. Social,
economic and religious conditions in the past might have found it a necessary
and even a desirable institution. Every sensible man should realise that today
it has outgrown its usefulness as an institution. Unfortunately, it is tied up
with religious prejudices. To some minds it is bound up with religion. But
religion, we realise today, is a personal affair. That realisation is embodied
in the avowed secularity of our State. People, of course, may unite to promote
the purposes of religion; but people cannot be allowed, in the name of
religion, to defeat social aims or endanger social security. A lack of this
realisation accounts for the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>prevalence of the old loyalties to caste
and sub-caste. Those loyalties, we must realise, are not inborn, not
instinctive, not impelled by any religious feeling, but have only the powerful
drive of evil tradition behind them. Casteism and communalism are our greatest
social evils today. Even those who openly decry caste are governed by such
feelings and attitudes. The more’s the pity. It would seem that their objection
to caste is only an objection to a superior caste or a different caste.
Further, “so long as politicians find that they can make political capital out
of caste, they will whip up such feelings, especially among electorates, and in
constituencies, where the vote of a particular caste is likely to be decisive
of the issue of an election. We must realise that the days of this age-old
institution are, however, numbered. It is curious that some people justify its
existence because it has so long survived. But, in my opinion, it is not quite
correct to say that the caste system has survived. What there is is only its
carcass. Where four castes have become four thousand castes, it is not a case
of survival. It is like child breaking a mirror into a thousand pieces and
shouting, “Lo! One mirror has become a thousand mirrors now.” Casteism and
communalism, however, deep-rooted and undisturbed in their rustic isolation,
have remained. They are sources of grave danger to the solidarity of society,
and must be recognised for what they are. They are, no doubt, useful ladders on
which some politicians climb to power. But politicians must learn to depend
upon their capacity and character to reach high positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I conclude, I would like to reiterate what I have been stressing throughout.
Although man instinctively and necessarily tends to be one of a multitude, he
is often at his best in solitude. Even in solitude, he is not really alone. Of
course, the charms of solitude are not appreciated when they are enforced.
Alexander Selkirk failed to see the charms which sages saw in its face because
he was marooned in an island without desiring it. Man is spiritually at his
best and highest when he is voyaging alone on strange seas of thought. The greatest
inspirations of mankind come from the still small voice, the whispers that are
only heard in solitude. Unfortunately, modern life makes it difficult to enjoy
the seclusion and isolation necessary for great achievements in the world of
art or of science. The opportunities for communion with one’s own spirit, to
hold counsel with one’s self, are few and far between, in these days when man
goes the rounds of social and professional life continually and almost
mechanically. These observations are not intended to disparage or to deprecate
modern conditions of life or to contrast them unfavourably with conflictions of
the past. The evil is not primarily in modern conditions, but in our own
failure to adjust ourselves to them. We must ensure that an individual lives
the highest kind of mental life, that is, the highest kind of life of which a
human being is capable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
country has only recently won freedom. Political freedom is only the beginning
of things. A really free society is one capable of choosing goals for its own
group behaviour, and of devising and applying means of reaching the goals it
chooses. In order that a country may progress along right lines, there must be
a proper re-conciliation between the rights of the individual and the social
claims upon him. The individual must realise that he cannot ask anything for
himself that another cannot claim. If he is wise, he knows that his greatest
self-fulfilment lies in contributing to the life of the community the highest
good that he is capable of. He can fulfil himself only through the life of the
community, by extending his own life to the utmost bounds possible. He must
seek the enrichment of the common life if he wants to enrich his own life. The
individual aim must identify itself with the general, and this fusion can take
place only on the moral and the spiritual plane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other thing requires to be emphasised. Our traditions in this country do not
lay emphasis on the importance of the individual. The individual should not be
subject to irrational taboos or be compelled to conform to<i> </i>modes of
behaviour which are incompatible with modern standards of decency or
self-respect. The tendency must be resisted to reduce him to a term or a mere
unit of a whole. We must remember that humanity has advanced by the efforts of
individuals, and that the greatest benefactors of mankind have been rebels:
persons who fought against the established modes, who rose against the tyranny
of entrenched conservatism and orthodoxy, who were inspired by the love of
adventure, and who struck out new paths for the mind and the spirit of man. We
must recognize that individual liberty has been too much constrained by
collective entities whose artificial personality has stifled and smothered the
individual. Most of us are content to move with the crowd. We are afraid of
breaking the idols of the market place. We are haunted by the terror of
excommunication. What we call commonsense points in the direction of
conformity. But commonsense, it has been observed by a celebrated scientist,
has never been the tool of evolution. “It is a practical and safe notion, but
without value for human progress. If it were universal, it would mean the end
of the spiritual development of man, the end of evolution. It would indeed
prevent us from improving ourselves, from driving towards an ideal, from acting
in a way opposed to our immediate interests. It would forbid our ever taking a
chance. It is never back of a heroic deed. If it were carried to an extreme,
virtues would not have many occasions to shine.” The makers of art and of
literature, the promoters of knowledge, the builders of civilization are men
who departed from the norm, who in their own day were considered unreasonable
and perverse. We must, therefore, realise that only the fullest freedom of the
individual, compatible with the needs of organized society, is the best
instrument of progress and civilisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

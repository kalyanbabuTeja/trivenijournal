<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Triveni’ seeks to draw together cultured men and women in all lands and establish a fellowship of the elect. All movements that make for Idealism in India as well as elsewhere, receive particular attention in these columns. We count upon the willing and joyous co-operation of all lovers of the Beautiful and the True.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that, on account of the arrest of the Joint Editor Sjt. K. Ramakotiswara Rau, when he offered Satyagraha in the last week of November, 1940, in Guntur District, there has been some delay in the bringing out of this second number of The <B>Triveni Quarterly</B>. Sjt. Ramakotiswara Rau has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of twelve months, but this will not interfere with the publication during this period of the journal. The delay in the publication of this issue became inevitable in view of the fact that I, who have so long been attending only to the literary side of the journal, have had to attend to certain other matters as well pertaining to the publication of the journal. I shall, however, try to avoid delay in the next numbers of The Triveni Quarterly, and for the delay in the present instance I seek the kind indulgence of the readers of the journal.</P>

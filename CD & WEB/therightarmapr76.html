He put on the shirt and with the cap in hand ran to the fold and called “<span

Perhaps <span class=SpellE>Majid</span> did not understand what his son meant

raised his arm with the knife to striking height. <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span>
jumped over <span class=SpellE>Karim</span> in a flash to cover it. <span
class=SpellE>Majid’s</span> raised arm with the heavy knife came down on <span

not hold his descending arm. It came down with less striking force than it
would have come with on the sheep, but the force was enough to sever <span

cried out “<span class=SpellE>Rahim</span>, <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span>.”

village hospital. <span class=SpellE>Majid</span> took up the knife again and

on which <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span> had come to fix his birthday cap. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the whole day’s cries and wails <span class=SpellE>Majid</span> had lain down
on the field away from the house when none could take him. The night was dark
and cold and no breeze blew. “<span class=SpellE>Rahim</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Rahim</span>” he called and cried till in fatigue he closed his
eyes and drowsed and dreamt. He saw a strange, beautiful land with green
valleys and little streams, and so many sheep and deer and many animals freely
and fearlessly moving about, and so many birds and ducks on trees or by the
stream-side. But he saw no man there. He looked around and then saw in the
distance a lamb with a green cap on its head. It was <span class=SpellE>Karim</span>,
he <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>, and behind it he saw <span
class=SpellE>Rahim</span> running, but <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span> was
without his right arm. <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span> was so happy, and so was
<span class=SpellE>Karim</span>. Then <span class=SpellE>Majid</span> saw more
men coming and going, but they were all without the right arm. They moved about
near the birds and animals, but the birds and animals were unconcerned at their
approach and even exchanged happy glances with the men whom they feared in this
world but did not fear in that strange land. <span class=SpellE>Majid</span>
wondered what world was that which he saw before him. He wanted to ask, but
none came near him and he could not speak aloud. He gazed on in wonder. Every
creature here was happy and without fear. And so was man, but he was without
the right arm with which in this world he hit and struck and killed birds and
animals and his own specie too for fun, sport, food, power, money, land, and
what not. <span class=SpellE>Majid</span> tried to call <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span>
but his voice did not come out. He wanted to run to catch him but his legs did
not move. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all his grief, pain and agony returned as violently as before. He closed his
eyes again and wished to go to the world where he had seen <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span>
and other men all without the right arm, and where all were happy and none
feared the armless man. “O this arm, this arm, with this I cannot go to <span
class=SpellE>Rahim</span>”, he cried out fiercely, and lifting his right arm
straight and stiff he bit it hard to cut and fell unconscious on the ground,
the bleeding arm falling loose on the side. In pain and agony he groaned, but
his arm stuck on to his body and away and away <span class=GramE>receded</span>
<span class=SpellE>Rahim</span> in the fading vision of <span class=SpellE>Majid</span>.

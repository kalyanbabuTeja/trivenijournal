<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the comparatively short period of some nine years, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has made substantial and
creditable progress in many a field of activity. She framed her constitution,
successfully went through a general election, tackled the seemingly
insurmountable refugee problem, liquidated the Indian States in the interests
of solidarity and unity, fought the ravages and threats of famine, gave a
fillip to heavy industries, encouraged the development of art and culture,
raised her status in the comity of nations, and thereby, as also by her policy
of neutrality, peace and friendship, attracted the notice as also the attention
of the Big Powers abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
played host to numerous countries, their political and administrative heads, as
well as to writers and literary men, who, drawn by the desire to witness the
rebirth of this great country, came to her shores with eager eyes and
questioning minds. These saw <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
at first-hand, and left behind, their reaction in print. ‘Ambassador’s Report’
spoke of the impressions and activities of the author’s family during the
eighteen months spent here, <span class=GramE>during</span> which period it got
to know the country intimately, sympathetically. A <st1:City w:st="on">Minneapolis</st1:City>
<i>star and Tribune </i>reporter stayed four months, travelled 10,000 miles, <span
class=SpellE>criss</span>-crossed <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and ‘This is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’
was the outcome. A Scottish medical missionary, George N. Patterson, put his
experience on record in his ‘Journey with <span class=SpellE>Loshay</span>’.
And there are others of the same ilk. These go to show how <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> appealed to the West and how it made them
frame judgments, some of them erroneous may be, and how <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> emerged
from her shell of ages of silence and neglect. Among those that so turned to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> are
writers of fiction, both Indian and foreign, and it is gratifying to see how on
this front also there is much that demands attention and respect. Hitherto, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> had been mostly a mysterious, enigmatical,
voluptuous <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">land</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Maharajas</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and
elephants and snakes, with some inscrutable dark-skinned muscular Indian in the
near distance. But when <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
showed her mettle, things began to alter, though not completely, nor quickly.
Though the English language was considered secondary, the quota of fiction in
it did not show any remarkable decline, and served, on the contrary, to bridge
the gulf of ignorance and misunderstanding that had yawned for sometime past.
Both </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Indians and aliens turned to this medium of expression and
played upon it delicately, as on a fine instrument, to the general credit of
the land of their birth or their interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
closer understanding came greater awareness and hence a better sense of
realism. Subjects hardly touched on earlier became normal, and the attitude,
altered, for many. Formerly most Western novelists had looked at <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> from a
singular, incredible angle; now new horizons opened up, old horizons widened.
Even Indian writers proved somewhat more alive to the epical happenings and
reflected the scenes and sounds in their pages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>
struggle naturally became a <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> subject and
imagination was allowed to work around it, some times using facts of history in
the stride, to varying lengths. The older preoccupation with the possible
results of such a struggle, the emphasis on the need for freedom, the bitterness
engendered by a foreign domination, having ceased to operate, writers could now
“gather their material out of the new events that were shaping before their
eyes, from the way of life of the group of people with whose psychology and
background they are most familiar.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a wide sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> ‘The Financial Expert’, ‘Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sampaths</span>,
‘Waiting for the Mahatma’, ‘The English Teacher’ deal with the <span
class=SpellE>Malgudi</span> locale in the author’s gentle manner, observant,
pathetic, and sympathetic. <span class=SpellE>Margayya</span>, the Financial
Expert, is a money lender, a versatile self promoter. Beginning as an adviser
to local farmers he rises high and in the interim secures a pornographic tract
which leads him on to fortune, but only for a while. In the end, he finds
himself under the tree, wherefrom he had started life and as innocent of his
shady practices as a child unborn. This leaves <span class=SpellE>Margayya</span>,
if not his son <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>, so individual a character that
when ‘the crude forces of justice and reality enter, they seem a wholly
unwarranted, if inevitable, intrusion. The sad overtones, the smooth
plot-craft, the grave comedy, raises the story beyond the confines of <span
class=SpellE>Malgudi</span> and makes <span class=SpellE>Margayya</span> as
great a character as any of <span class=SpellE>Gogol’s</span> or of Chekhov’s.
The coincidences, as well as the Griselda-manner of <span class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Brinda</span>, <span class=SpellE>Margayya’s</span> wife
and daughter-in-Law, do not add to the haunting beauty of the novel to any
great extent. But Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sampath</span> is a character of a
different stamp. Like one of Dryden’s creations in ‘Absalom and <span
class=SpellE>Achitophel</span>’, he is many things by turns–a printer and
publisher of “The Banner”, edited by <span class=SpellE>Shrinivasa</span>, a
film producer at the Sunrise Pictures–as “there is no encouragement for the
arts in our country, I’ve always wanted to serve art and provide our people
with healthy and wholesome entertainment.’ This over, he is the lover for a
time and this brings him back to where he started from, the printing trade. The
fanciful creation never ceases to interest and the author’s acquaintance of the
twin poles of printing and filming, coupled with his unobtrusive <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> and irony in the treatment of social topics, make
the book come alive in no mean manner. ‘Waiting for the Mahatma’ on the other
hand lifts the novel out of this realm, for there, one is conscious, though
again in <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
naive way, of the undercurrents of history in the making. For, <span
class=SpellE>Sriram</span>, the young hero, falls in love with Bharati, and for
her sake apparently, joins the freedom movement; he is jailed, like Bharati,
for his acts; and their imprisonment over, they decide to get married at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>. Gandhiji has told
them, ‘I’ll be your priest’ and it is only the sad and dastardly assassination
that prevents him from being one. The Mahatma appears here more as a man with a
‘disconcerting common sense’ than a saint, and yet we hear the distant and
muffled, perhaps a little <span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>-ed, echoes of the
1942 movement, and of the Mahatma’s teachings, as of jail life, of those days
of rising tempo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
relation to these events finds expression in ‘Some Inner fury’ by Kamala <span
class=SpellE>Markandaya</span> wherein too is posed the same political struggle
with a live motif thrown in, for here is a dilemma, confronting the character,
between love for the country and for the heart’s choice. A more rigorous
treatment faces the reader of ‘<span class=SpellE>Inquilab</span>’ hailed as
‘the first great novel of the Indian Revolution’. Here, besides Gandhiji and <span
class=SpellE>Shri</span> Nehru, we meet other national leaders and through the
eyes of <span class=SpellE>Anwar</span>, a product of Hindu-Moslem fusion, a <span
class=SpellE><i>sangam</i></span><i> </i>of diverse streams of blood and
cultures, witness the tumultuous happenings from the days of the <span
class=SpellE>Jallianwalla</span> <span class=SpellE>Bagh</span> massacre, <span
class=SpellE>Khwaja</span> Ahmed <span class=SpellE>Abbas</span>, who once gave
us ‘Tomorrow is ours’ and thus held a sensitive </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>measuring rod to
the heart of the young, here turns to the communal problem and to history of
the recent times, breathing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>life into accidents which, for many, are
yet too near to be forgotten. Pearl Buck’s ‘Come, my Beloved’, though somewhat
dissatisfying as a novel, with its somewhat incomplete understanding of things
Indian, revitalizes the political scenes,–the Civil Disobedience movement, the
Prince of Wales’ visit, the Delhi <span class=SpellE>Darbar</span>. Even the
last <span class=SpellE>Macard</span>, Ted, ultimately cannot bear the idea of
his daughter marrying the Indian Dr. <span class=SpellE>Jatin</span> Das
however good in himself, and so <span class=SpellE>Livy</span> leaves <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> for all
time, ‘since nothing could be helped, and whatever had been was ended.’
Whatever this separatism might imply, we get some picture of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> through <span class=SpellE>Darya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sapru</span> and his friend David and we see how <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> became
gradually more self-conscious as generations of the <span class=SpellE>Macards</span>
succeeded one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Private
Life of an Indian Prince’ by Dr. Mulk Raj Anand is again a wonderfully good
addition to his other novels wherein too, a picture of the changing face of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
clearly made visible. ‘The Big Heart’, ‘The Sword and the Sickle’ had brought <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
pre-Independence-struggle days, but that which succeeded it, we get from these
pages. How the reluctant dragon of an Indian <span class=SpellE>princeling</span>
fought hard till the very end to evade accession to the Indian Union, and to
maintain his power, prestige, position, and non-moral, irresponsible life, is
appealingly brought out within its 340 pages. The meeting between <span
class=SpellE>Sardar</span> Patel and Victor Edward George, Ashok Kumar, Maharaja
of <span class=SpellE>Shampur</span>, attached to <span class=SpellE>Ganga</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dasi</span> to distraction in preference to his true-to-<span
class=SpellE>lndian-culture-tikyali</span> Maharani, <span class=SpellE>Indira</span>
<span class=SpellE>Devi</span>, is one of the remarkable sections of this ‘<span
class=SpellE>tragi</span>-comedy’. A clear picture of the intrigue, oppression
and maladministration in some feudal Indian States coupled with the oddities of
their rulers, the growth of <span class=SpellE>Praja</span> <span class=SpellE>Mandals</span>,
is well portrayed, and yet, such is the author’s artistry that we feel a little
sad when the former ruler of <span class=SpellE>Shampur</span> ends his days in
an asylum, watched by his noble wife, whose children he had got killed or
rendered unhappy and abandoned by those to whom he had given his all. Here we
have history and romance, fused inseparably, yet beautifully. Christian Weston
deals with a somewhat similar situation in her ‘The World is a Bridge’. It is
1947 and in some Indian States the rulers are clinging desperately to the dying
glimmerings of authority. The <span class=SpellE>Westernised</span> Maharaja, <span
class=SpellE>Vikram</span> of <span class=SpellE>Katakhpur</span>, is one such
and we see how the land lay in those days. Again, the communal tension which
was a constant source of anxiety receives her attention. <span class=SpellE>Feroze</span>
<span class=SpellE>Hammidullah</span>, the painter Anand, <span class=SpellE>Kiran</span>,
the shepherd girl <span class=SpellE>Javni</span> provide her with this theme
as also with the love interest that keeps the book on the emotional keel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
these novels we see how old themes are now touched by a new grace. The
Maharajas and their States, as Kincaid described them in his books or as John
Buchan in his ‘Three Hostages’, are now no longer so unreal and distant. They
may not all be like <span class=SpellE>Bromfield’s</span> Maharaja of <span
class=SpellE>Ranchipur</span> and his royal, efficient consort of ‘The Rains
Came’, but they are not the show pieces of a diseased mind; ‘similarly, the
Indians are no longer always the mysterious or unscrupulous or ignorant people
of former times or of Miss <span class=SpellE>Agatha</span> Christie’s ‘Hickory
<span class=SpellE>Dickory</span> Dock’ but living, intellectual, feeling
specimens of the <i>homo sapiens.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
consequence of <st1:City w:st="on">Independence</st1:City> was the partition of
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the uprooting of countless homes and families. John Masters who is
reportedly intending to ‘do’ India in 35 novels and who has already given us ‘<span
class=SpellE>Nightrunners</span> of Bengal’, ‘The Deceiver’s’, ‘Lotus and the
Wind’, ‘<span class=SpellE>Coromandal</span>’, speaks in ‘<span class=SpellE>Bhowani</span>
Junction’ of this disturbed phase in the life of our nation. This locality is
the focal point, happening to be the centre of rail movements. The novel tries
to deal with three problems, at once: the position of Anglo-Indians in
‘Congressmen’s India’, the love-interest when different races feel attracted,
and the transfer of authority to the new governments, which was marked by
terrible blood baths where Col. Rodney Stone tries to preserve order. His
latest publication ‘<span class=SpellE>Coromandal</span>’ traces the early
history of the ancestors of Savages under Charles I. Thanks to old <span
class=SpellE>Voy</span>, the poacher, Jason Savage is fired with dreams of the
East–of <span class=SpellE>Coromandal</span>–and the inestimable treasure trove
on Mount <span class=SpellE>Meru</span> and reaches India and gets entangled in
intrigues of numerous kinds. There is not much here that could enliven a
reader’s interest in the India of Master’s imagination. The social novels have
also dealt with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in a big way. ‘Nectar in a Sieve’ the first from Kamala <span class=SpellE>Markandaya’s</span>
pen, gives us a moving picture of life of farmers in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place> and their courage, suffering, optimism and poverty. How the
growth of a tannery decoys the sons of the soil from the land to far and near
distances, how hunger and starvation and poverty dog the lives of peasants and
of <span class=SpellE>Nathem</span>, Rukmini and their children, how they have
learnt to submit to the inevitable Fate, also is sensitively brought out. <span
class=SpellE>Shakuntala</span> <span class=SpellE>Shrinagesh’s</span> ‘The
Little Black Box’ turns the mind to a hospital ward and the expectations of
relatives from the bedridden sick patient. The small-mindedness and
covetousness of people is neatly exposed as also the state of some of our impoverished
hospitals. This novel deals with the plot in a new way by <span class=SpellE>adoptting</span>
the diary form, while <span class=SpellE>Sudhir</span> N. <span class=SpellE>Ghose</span>
speaks of a fascinating folk-tale in his ‘The flame of the forest’. Mrs. Hilda <span
class=SpellE>Saligman</span> and Herman Hess deal with <span class=SpellE>Gautama</span>
Buddha in ‘When Peacocks Danced’ and ‘Siddhartha’; Maugham’s ‘The Razor’s Edge’
deals with the peace that is found in the East and of the spiritual solace that
Larry Darrel sought in vain elsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Catch fire’ takes the reader to a Kashmiri setting and to the theme of Indo-<span

some years ago. This time the rift is between the friendly and simple peasants
and the English <span class=SpellE>Sophile</span> and her children. The author
of “The River” does not seem to know her Indians as well as the land of their
habitation and could this be the barrier that prevents a fusion of lives? If
she deals with the rapprochement problem from the Kashmiri and bucolic angle,
Ira Morris in “The Bombay Meeting” deals with it from the metropolitan,
literary, inter-national standpoint. Authors and critics from far and near
foregather at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>

wife of a <span class=SpellE>Parsi</span> member, <span class=SpellE>Shakuntala</span>
<span class=SpellE>Clubwalla</span> and to fall in love with her. This
ultimately leads to the narration of her sad experiences on the partition of
the country when she lost her father, in pitiable circumstances. The presence
of the Maharaja of <span class=SpellE>Purjai</span>, of the radical <span

the last few years of post-Independence in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>five-year plan, renascent, revitalized,
strong–these are some of the themes that are crying for the deft, thorough
touch of the novelist’s hand. The English language is yet not so neglected as
it would possibly be in course of time. Will not our Indo-<span class=SpellE>anglian</span>
novelists listen to the call of the land and in this rich and expressive medium
put across to the western audience the deep seated desires, aspirations, and
hopes of our people, their desire for international harmony and brotherhood,
and thus through this avenue interpret ‘the Mystic’ East to the West and bring
about the concord and harmony so necessary, so vital, so urgent? Let us hope
fervently that the novels that come from the West also would be more true to
life and not to a jaundiced vision of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
which has erroneously or deliberately been taken to be the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> of to-day
by some<i> </i>writers, with little justification. ‘Nurtured from childhood in
the widespread belief that the East is a mysterious place, and in its bazaars
and narrow lanes, secret conspiracies are being continually hatched, the
Englishman can seldom think straight on matters relating to these lands of
supposed mystery. He never makes an attempt to understand that somewhat obvious
and very <span class=SpellE>unmysterious</span> person, the Easterner. He keeps
well away from him, gets his ideas about him from tales abounding in spies and
secret societies, and then allows his imagination to run riot’–let us hope that
this state of affairs will no longer exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

original story. He often used to say that his Ramayana is a sort of commentary
on the original Ramayana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Viswanatha is an expert in the art of narrating the story. In<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>the Balakanda, sage Viswamitra, while
taking Rama and Lakshmana with him for protecting his sacrifice from the demons
narrated some beautiful stories to them to remove their fatigue. The art
exhibited by Viswanatha in narrating those stories is indeed praiseworthy and
here and there he makes Rama and others to comment upon the beauties of his
narration. These comments indirectly bring home to the readers the exquisite
dexterity displayed by the poet in narrating those stories. After successfully
completing the sacrifice with the help of the young princes, Viswamitra started
to Mithila along with the two brothers and some other sages. On the way they
stopped on the banks of the river Sona. Rama sat before Viswamitra and
requested him to tell them about the place where they stayed and said, “There
may be great penance, rare greatness and extraordinary kindness in the other
sages. But none of them possesses like you, the skill of narrating the stories
bringing with various sentiments.” This remark clearly tells the readers how
Viswamitra narrated the stories. Afterwards Viswamitra told them the story of
the birth of Gaadhi, his father. Here the narration is indeed superb. Rama then
requested him to tell them the descent of the Ganges to the earth. Viswamitra,
instead of telling that story, narrated the story of Kumaraswami and told the
hearers, “Do not tell immediately what is asked but begin to narrate the
background in detail. The hearers will be attentively hearing it with the hope
that the story desired by them will follow soon. Is this not a clever way of
narrating a story?” Here the poet tells the readers the skilful way of
narrating a story in an interesting manner. The story of the descent of the
Ganges in Viswanatha’s Ramayana is very interesting. After hearing the story
Lakshmana praised the enthusiasm and the perseverance of the grandsons of Saagara.
The sages that woke up then remarked “White streaks of light are seen in the
East like the white filaments of the Guava (Jami) flower. How great the
Sagaras! How wonderful is the story narrated! What wonderful Lords are they!”
and then went again to sleep. The story of the Sagaras narrated by Viswanatha
was extremely interesting as the sages remarked. When God Indra cut off the
belly of Diti, she was much incensed, but afterwards became calm and excused
him. After hearing this story Rama looked at Viswamitra and remarked “Oh! sage,
which is greater among the two, viz., the gift of the missiles you obtained
from the sage Bhrisaswa on the way of narrating the stories to us?” Rama was
more overwhelmed with joy when he heard the stories being narrated by
Viswamitra than when the use of the Divine missiles was taught to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

narrated to Rama how Viswamitra could become a great Brahmarshi. Then Rama told
his brother, “The art of narrating the story seems to be the same whoever of
these sages narrate. These are bestowed with great insight and exhibit the
minutest details of the story. Brother, have you observed another thing? Does
not the way of telling the story of Menaka differ from that of all other stories?”
Then Lakshmana observed, “Yes, indeed it is so.” Here the poet informs the
readers that the sages narrate the stories in a wonderful way and that there is
vast difference in the manner of narrating the stories by Viswamitra and by
Satananda. Though Viswanatha told the stories that are already there in the
original Ramayana, he displayed the beauty of the art of his narration by the
casual remarks and comments made by the characters like Rama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Valmiki’s Ramayana Gautama cursed Ahalya that she should live in the same
hermitage for one thousand years, doing penance, living upon air, lying in the
dust without being seen by anybody. He also indicated the end of the curse
saying that she would obtain her original form when she would be sanctified by
offering reception to Rama, when he would come there. After saying this he left
the hermitage and went away to the top of the mountain Himavan for doing
penance. The fact that Ahalya was transformed into a stone on account of the
curse given by her husband is very popular in the country. But Valmiki did not
mention about this transformation. It is stated in that way in other Ramayanas.
Sri Viswanatha also wrote in his Ramayana that Ahalya was lying in the hermitage
in the form of a stone till Rama went there along with Viswamitra. No sooner
did Viswamitra and the royal princes reach the hermitage, they heard a sweet
sound extending welcome to them. The description of the arrival of Rama at the
hermitage made by Ahalya is unparalleled and speaks much of the internal
devotion of Sri Viswanatha. Even when Rama was at a distance, Ahalya who was
lying in the form of a stone began gradually to get the five sense organs.
Viswanatha describes that gradual change in an inimitable way. “As soon as the
breeze from the body of the Lord blew over it, the stone got the sense of
touch, as soon as the sound of the feet of the Lord was heard at a distance the
stone obtained ears, as soon as the fragrance of the body of the Lord was
smelt, the stone got the nose, the organ of smell, as soon as the body of the
Lord beautiful as the gate made of black diamonds was seen, the stone obtained
the eyes and no sooner had the Lord come and accepted the reception, the group
of the Upanishads emerged from the heart of the stone and it appeared in the
form of a beautiful lady.” Then Rama fell prostrate on her feet and the sages
that were there chanted Vedic hymns indicating auspiciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Valmiki’s Ramayana, when Dasaradha was returning to Ayodhya along with sages,
his sons, daughters-in-law and his retinue after the marriage of Sita and Rama,
Parasurama appeared on the scene. Vasishtha and others welcomed him and offered
him Arghya and Padya. Afterwards there was exchange of hot words between
Parasurama and Rama, which ended with the defeat of the former. This is
generally called “Parasurama Garvabhangam.” As Rama’s arrow cut off all the
worlds earned by Parasurama by dint of his penance, Parasurama went away to
Mahendra mountain to perform penance. In Viswanatha’s Ramayana this scene of
the defeat of Parasurama is described before the marriage. When Rama broke the
bow of Siva as stipulated by Janaka, messengers were sent to Ayodhya for
inviting Dasaradha. Dasaradha came with his queens and other attendants. When
he was talking to Vasishtha and Viswamitra about the marriage to be performed,
some omens both good and bad appeared Dasaradha was frightened. Vasishtha and
Viswamitra consoled him saying that though there would be some bad in the beginning,
it would end and result in extreme good. In the meanwhile Parasurama came there
frightening everybody with his words. Dasaradha fainted. The Vaishnava bow of
Parasurama was successfully handled by Rama and Parasurama went away accepting
his defeat and announcing the divinity of Rama. Lakshmana went and informed
Dasaradha that the angry Bhargava departed with his arrogance. Dasaradha’s joy
knew no bounds and he came and embraced his victorious son. All the relatives
showered praises on Rama. Rama humbly said “Did I conquer the great sage, who
is an expert in the use of all the Divine missiles? He only pretended defeat as
he had something in his mind” and bowed to the direction in which Parasurama
departed. Afterwards was performed with great pomp the marriage of Rama and
Sita. The sound produced at the time of the breaking of the bow of Siva was
heard in the three worlds. As soon as Parasurama heard it, he was incensed as
the bow of his preceptor was broken and came to Mithila, challenging Rama, who
broke it; That is why perhaps Viswanatha described the Parasurama scene before
the marriage of Rama and Sita. Parasurama’s arrival immediately after the
marriage would have certainly impaired the great delight of the relatives that
came there to witness the marriage. Rama did not only break the bow of Siva but
also could handle the Vaishnava bow. This redoubled the valour of Rama and also
the delightful mirth of the marriage party. More over, this is a situation
where two incarnations of Vishnu appeared simultaneously. As soon as Rama took
the bow from the hand of Parasurama an indescribable effulgence also entered
Rama along with it. It made Rama’s incarnation complete and made him deserve
the hand of Sita, the incarnation of Lakshmi. Viewed in this way, the change
made by Viswanatha appears to be quite appropriate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the innovations introduced by Viswanatha in his Ramayana, the Hamsa Dowtya (the
swan’s message) in the beginning of the Yuddhakanda stands foremost. Rama
crossed the ocean and encamped on the seashore in the city of Lanka. Ravana at
that time was sitting on the upper storey of his palace enjoying the morning
breeze. Sugreeva saw him, and not being able to contain his anger jumped on
Ravana, fought with him for sometime and returned to Rama. Rama warned him not
to be hasty, though he was pleased with his devotion towards him. Afterwards
Rama sat on a stone after worshipping Sandhya and witnessed a swan which
attracted him very much. He called the swan near and telling it that it was
more than one month since Hanuman brought him the good news of Sita’s welfare,
that he was much worried about what happened to her afterwards and requested it
to go and inform her that he crossed the ocean along with the army of monkeys
to fight with Ravana and take her back. He also informed it that it appears to
him that he had once seen it along with his beloved and asked it whether it
stopped at Ayodhya at any time while going from the Himalaya mountains. He also
entreated it to excuse him as he was putting on its shoulders the burdensome
responsibility of carrying the message to his wife. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
swan heard the message of Rama and flew away in the sky creating rings of
beauty while flapping its wings. At that moment, Ravana was walking at the top
of the palace for soothing the pain of the wounds created by the tooth-bites of
Sugreeva. The swan appeared to him as if it was a path of nectar created by the
fruition of the penance of Rama. At once he became very angry. He called a lady
moving nearby and asked her whence that swan was flying. She replied that it
was coming from the direction of the encampment of the enemy’s army. Ravana
descended from the top of the palace and went to his worship room. There he
could not see the idol of Lord Siva whom he was worshipping daily. He could not
stay there. He went to the court and saw Vidyunmali who was an expert in Maya. He
told him, “I am going to see Sita. Rama and Lakshmana are both killed. Bring
their heads, bows and arrows to the Asoka Garden.” So saying he went to the
garden, saw Sita and told her, “Your husband has crossed the ocean with the
monkeys and come to besiege my fort. It seems very strange to me. I pity him as
I am sure that my son, the valorous Indrajit, will certainly kill him and his
brother along with the whole army.” Then he looked at Vidyunmali and ordered
him to show the heads and bows of Rama and Lakshmana to Sita. He placed before
Sita, the heads, the bows, and the arrows of Rama and Lakshmana which he
created with the help of Maya. When Sita saw them, she fell into a swoon and
recovering after sometime discovered that it was all delusion manipulated by
the demons. At that moment she felt that some of her close relatives came there
and looked upwards. The swan sat on the branch of the tree exactly where
Hanuman previously sat. Sita was overjoyed at the sight of the swan and felt
that it might have come from her husband with some good tidings. The swan
greeted Sita and conveyed to her the following words that Rama asked her to
convey, “I have crossed the ocean along with the army of the monkeys. They are
not mere monkeys, but the messengers of the God of Death sent to take off the
lives of demons. Hanuman gave the crest jewel given by you and informed me your
piteous plight. I have come and hope that our sorrowful days have come to an
end. You have to, somehow, get on in the same condition for only a few days
till I kill Ravana in the battle.” Just at that moment the manipulated heads,
bows and arrows of Rama and his brother disappeared from the place where they
were put by Vidyunmali while Sita and Ravana were looking at them. Ravana
laughed and told Sita, “I thought that you would abandon your life after seeing
the head of Rama. But you are still alive. It is an indication that even now
you have the desire of enjoying worldly happiness. It is a foregone conclusion
that Rama will be killed by me in the battle. Then you can happily live with
me.” Sita was ashamed at hearing those words and looked at the swan once again.
For a moment she was in a trance and felt that she was the goddess of the
goddesses and the everlasting reality. There appeared a sweet smile on her
lips. When Ravana saw her in that state it seemed as if his heart stopped. He
became very furious. It appeared to him that the whole cause for all that
happened was the swan and uttered the following words: “There is nobody in the three
worlds since the beginning of the creation who has offered his heads to Lord
Siva like me and that God has deceived me and selected a beggar like himself.
Is Rama a greater devotee than myself? It seems strange to me that Lord Siva
stooped to become a love-messenger between this couple. Rama who has till now
seemed to me an external enemy has now become an internal enemy.” So saying he
went away and spent a sleepless night. Early in the morning he took his bath,
worshipped Lord Siva as usual, and was brooding over the things that had
happened on the previous day. Just at that time his daughter-in-law, the wife
of Aksha who had been killed by Hanuman, came there along with her
five-year-old son and told Ravana, “This boy went yesterday to the place of
your worship and brought the silver swan. When I told him that you would be
angry he has now brought it to give it to you.” As Ravana saw that silver swan,
he felt extraordinary relief in his heart and kissed his grandson and gave the
swan to him as a plaything. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

silver swan is God Siva himself. Ravana’s grandson took it away from the place
of worship. Ravana could not find it in its place on the previous day. The same
swan acted as the messenger. The Maya manipulated by Vidyunmali could not
continue before it. The false heads, bows and arrows brought by Vidyunmali
disappeared. As soon as Sita saw the swan and heard the message of Rama she
could attain her real divine form. That is why she smiled. Her smile incensed
Ravana. Ravana was indeed a great devotee of Siva and it is a fact that he was
pleased with his devotion; but the Adharma committed by him could not be
tolerated by him. He became a messenger and carried the news of Rama’s arrival
to Sita. This episode of swan’s message is a wonderful creation of Viswanatha
that is not found in Valmiki’s Ramayana. In this context are seen here and
there the beauties of Kalidasa’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meghasandesa.

Ravana was killed in the battle, Sita and Rama stopped at the hermitage of Atri
while flying to Ayodhya on the plane Pushpaka. Rama and Lakshmana went inside the
hermitage and were talking to the sage. Sita bowed to Anasuya and took her to a
bower of creepers and told her, “Mother! the boon you granted me previously had
turned to be a tragic story. The very divine appearance that you granted me
created suspicion to my husband.” Anasuya was astonished to hear those words.
Sita then informed her all the facts that happened from the time Ravana carried
her off and lastly told her the heart-rending words that Rama spoke to her at
the time of entering the fire. Anasuya became furious and went where Rama was
talking to her husband with her shrivelled body shaking with anger. Rama was frightened
when he saw her in that angry mood. In the meanwhile Anasuya controlled her
anger and went back without saying anything. Then Atri told Rama, “See how old
age makes people behave peculiarly. Can women know the feeling of self-respect
as Kshatriyas like you? When the heart is perturbed with the burden of insult,
can anybody think of what is proper and what is not?” Several people criticise
Rama for having spoken harsh words to Sita at the time of asking her to enter
fire. Rama knew quite well the chastity of Sita but, on account of the
self-respect natural to a Kshatriya, could not but utter such words to her. A
wounded heart makes anybody lose patience and prompts him to say harsh words.
This is the explanation given by Viswanatha for the harsh words spoken by Rama,
through Atri. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rama saw Anasuya walking towards it. Anasuya came to the plane, got up the
steps with difficulty, placed two fruits in the hands of Sita and was trying to
get down. Sita handed over those fruits to Rama and giving support to Anasuya
got down the plane along with her. Then Sita took leave of her and got up the
plane, which started immediately. The two fruits given by Anasuya indicate the
birth of Kusa and Lava in future. This is another beautiful innovation made by

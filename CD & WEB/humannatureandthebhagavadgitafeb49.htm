<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
Gita conception of human nature is very sympathetic and scientific. Man is
described as the combination of Spirit and Prakriti. Prakriti constitutes his physical
body and psychological dispositions. The Lord says “that Nature and Spirit are
both eternal and without beginning. All evolution and dispositions proceed from
Prakriti. It gives rise to the body and the senses. The delusive identification
of the self with it is the cause of the experience of pleasure and pain.” <sup>l</sup>
It is these Gunas that determine the nature of one’s belief and faith. “The
faith of each individual corresponds to his temperament and character. A man
consists of the faith that is in him. Whatever his faith is he is.<sup>2</sup>
The Upanishad declares that the spirit of man consists simply of his desires.
As is his desire so is his resolve. So is the deed that he does, as is the deed
that he does, so is that which he attains unto.”<sup>3</sup> Nature is the physical
and the biological capital of man. The author of the Gita does not shun it. He
never idealises the actual. He knows that human nature in the raw is wild and
ruinous. He too well knows that the ordinary pleasures of the unregenerate
souls are those of the pig and their thoughts imbecile. He also further knows
that the general behaviour of men is silly, at times insane and criminal too.<sup>
4</sup> So the author of the Gita does not believe in the unrestrained free
expression of the biological and the psychological in man. He lays down rules
of conduct and training. Spiritual life does not grow like grass; nor does it
grow in a vacuum. The Gita knows that we are not born with the discipline nor
can it spring from anywhere. The Gita analysis of human beings and the
classification of the modes of spiritual realisation appropriate to different
temperaments is unique. In the words of Aldous Huxley the Gita analysis
outlines a more complete and adequate classification of the modes of God-union
than many others.<sup>5</sup> We have in the history of human thought different
types and modes of classification. For example we have the ancient Hindu method
of classifying according to caste based on birth and talents. There is the
time-honoured medical classification of the four humours: blood, phlegm, black
bile and yellow bile, and the four qualities: hot, cold, moist, and dry. We
have the famous analysis of men, according to the psychologist, into two
classes: the introvert and the extrovert. In Christian and Upanishadic thought
we have the analysis of the spiritual aspirants into two: the man of
contemplation and the man of works, i.e. the way of Mary and the way of Martha.
This analysis, Huxley argues, is all too simple and inadequate. He asserts “in
Hindu thought the outlines of a completer and more adequate classification are
clearly indicated.” The ways leading to God-union are not two but three–the way
of works, the way of knowledge, and the way of devotion, In the Bhagavad Gita
Sri Krishna instructs Arjuna in all the three paths–liberation through action
without attachment; liberation through knowledge of the self and the Absoute
ground of all being with which it is identical; liberation through intense
devotion to the Personal God or the divine incarnation.”<sup>6</sup> The author
of the Gita believes in self-effort and also grace. At times the emphasis is on
grace, but never does he belittle human effort for the transformation of the
nature of man. The Gita holds the hope of salvation on terms which are not out
of the reach of the mass of mankind.<sup> 7</sup> Its message is not a counsel
of perfection. It admits of no rupture with normal life. It is against our
flying into <i>Ashramas </i>or erect ivory towers. It conceives the possibility
of attaining the best in this very life. It teaches us in the words of Sri
Aurobindo “to know to possess and be the divine being in an animal and
egotistic consciousness, to convert our twilight or obscure physical mentality
into the plenary supramental illumination, to build peace and a self-existent
bliss where there is only a stress of transitory satisfaction besieged by
physical pain and emotional suffering, to establish an infinite freedom in a
world which presents itself as a group of mechanical necessities, to discover
and realise the immortal life in a body subjected to death and constant
mutation.”<sup>8</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
attainment of the spiritual realisation is not automatic nor inevitable
process. Evolution at the human level becomes conscious and is not blind or
mechanical. Man has to take his life on to a higher stage with his intelligence
and reason. Evolution is self-consciousness at the human level. In the words of
Pascal when man and cosmos are crushed, the cosmos does not know it but man
knows it. The automatic and mechanical nature of evolution stops with man.
Julian Huxley observes that man has reached his bio-mechanical limit. Hereafter
development can only take place on the side of values, not physical power. “The
quest for truth and knowledge, virtue and beauty and aesthetic expression and
its satisfaction through the channels of science and philosophy, mysticism and
morality, literature and arts, becomes one of the modes or avenues of
evolutionary progress. On the whole biological progress in its later stages had
been more concerned with independence of the environment than with control over
it...we may anticipate in the future that the human control over environment
will become increasingly devoted to securing greater independence–in other
words greater freedom from material exigencies–and both of them together for
securing greater degree of self-realisation and of the satisfaction of the
human values.” <sup>9</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
verdict of science agrees with religion in the assertion that evolution at the
level of man is free and not bound. Man has to choose the direction. It is no
longer automatic and unconscious. In seeking to evolve, the Gita says man
cannot fly away from the modes of thought and dispositions natural to his self.
The devils that infest him are no red little imps but his own passions and
prejudices. There is no hell except the conflict in his own person and the
consequent disintegration. He has to pull himself up and integrate his
personality. In this supreme spiritual art the Gita asks men not to deny modes
of thought and ways of life natural to one’s station in life. The doctrine is
described as <i>Swadharma. </i>The Lord declares: “Men attain to perfection by
devotion to duties respective to their station in life. Perfection is attained
by men when they follow their <i>Swadharma. </i>A man’s own natural duty even
if it seems imperfectly done is better than work not naturally his own, even if
this is well performed. When a man acts according to the Law of his nature he
cannot be sinning. Therefore no one should give up his natural work even though
he does it imperfectly.<sup>l0</sup> In another place the Lord declares: “It is
better to do one’s own duty, however imperfectly, than to assume the duties of
another person, however successful. Prefer to die doing one’s own duty, the
duty of another imperils us.<sup>l1</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<i>Swadharma </i>of an individual is determined by his <i>Swabhava. </i>The
Gita itself interprets the term <i>Swadharma </i>as <i>Swabhava. </i>Psychologically
speaking the doctrine of <i>Swadharma </i>implies “ease, spontaneity,
efficiency; grace, and beauty.”<sup>l2</sup> While we see the Gita advocating
the doctrine of “my station and my duty” it does not ask men to get stuck up at
a particular level. It inveighs against spiritual stagnation and upbraids the
men who are ignorant, slothful and doubting all the time. They never come to
any good.<sup>l3</sup> The author of the Gita asks men to lift themselves up
from the unregenerate state to that of perfection by wisdom, self-effort, and
the grace of the Lord. Self-effort is raised to a very great state. The Lord
says: “Let a man raise himself by his own self, let him not debase himself. For
he himself is his friend and he himself is his foe.<sup>l4</sup> Mr. Huxley
describes that by the disciplined self the Gita gives us a method of
transforming our unregenerate selves into perfection. The average extrovert
externalises all his emotions and lives a life of impulses. He is soft and
pliable in his ways of life, indiscriminately amiable to all. He loves good
food and enjoys eating in company. He always lives in society. If these
impulses are not diverted the individual tends to be merely an entertaining
person the prototype of Dicken’s Pickwick. Such an extrovert is asked by the
author of the Gita to turn his animal gregariousness and soft human kindness
into charity, devotion to a personal God, universal goodwill and compassion
towards all sentient beings.<sup>l5</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a second type of extrovert whom Huxley describes. He is always agitated, his
emotions furious, his muscles forever excited and he itches for action. He
wants to work his lust for power on things. He is the soldier hero, the
successful gangster or unthinking conqueror. If the man of action is allowed to
go as he likes he becomes the prototype of Hitler or Hotspur of Shakespeare’s
King Henry IV. If this man of action is to be vivified by religion the Gita
asks him to give up those fatal accompaniments to the love of action, namely,
lust for power, self-assertion and regard for the fruit of the action. The man
of action with the above discipline becomes a Karma Yogin, not the mere
busy-body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is another intellectual introvert. He is by nature interested in complexities
of thought and constructions of systems. He loves solitude. He erects an ivory
tower for his retreat. He hates the “boarding house and the barrack.” He
believes that thinking is living and never gets over his self. He forgets that
a strong psychological technique is necessary for transforming all his thought
and religious experience. He is a victim of his own thought, constructs
fantasies and visions. He forgets that art, literature, and poetry are not ends
in themselves. Such intellectuals are the protoypes of Hamlet and Ivan Karmazov
of Dostoevsky. They are satisfied with a shallow humanism and a sensuous
pleasure arising from their intellect. The author of the Gita does not mistake
it for <i>Jnana. </i>He differentiates between <i>Jnana </i>and <i>Vijnana. </i>He
exhorts the intellectual introvert to overcome the delusion of identifying
analytical thought and discursive reason as ends in themselves. He must
transcend all these fantasies in the timeless act of intellect-intuition. He
must be able to distinguish between the activities of the phenomenal ego and
the principles of the transcendental self. Thus by a process of self-discipline
and God’s grace the raw material of human nature can grow into spiritual
fruition. The Gita does not force all men into one Procrustean bed or way. It
has a toleration, which is not compromise, nor indifference nor a stroke of
policy but a deep article of its own faith based on the psychological
disposition of man. While allowing each to grow to his best it does not rest satisfied
with non-activity. It wants each of us not to sit satisfied with our arms
folded. It wants each to reach the best and not sleep short of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ethics of the Gita and its mortality is not ascetic and difficult for man. Lord
Krishna knows well that it is not goods, but men who have to be enlisted on the
side of right living. So he makes allowance for human pleasure. He is no enemy
of human happiness. He advocates a wise plan for life and does not sanction the
doctrine Go-as-you-please. Men are not to erect their appetites and impulses
into little guides of life. They must submit it to social standards (Varna
Dharma) and spiritual aims (Shastras). The Lord says: “He who flouts the
commandments of the scriptures and sound tradition and acts on the impulse of
his desires cannot reach perfection or happiness of<i> </i>the highest goal.<sup>
l6 </sup></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>is here that the Lord asserts that the average sensuous
hedonist is mistaken when he identifies it with excitement resulting from round
of pleasures, health and long life, worldly wealth and irresponsible power.
Happiness is not mere propitious circumstance. The author of the Gita believes
that the things of the world are not in themselves very satisfactory. He
describes the world as “the abode of sorrow and impermanence”.<sup> l7</sup>
and in another context asks us to pray to the Lord to escape from the transient
and the unhappy world. Thus the author of the Gita believes in religion as the
transforming agency. Further Krishna advocates that we must put the goods of
the soul above the goods of the body and fortune. He believes that a life of
virtue is true happiness. He knows full well that the physique of a Hercules or
the wealth of Croesus or Kubera will not by themselves give us pleasure. The
one brings with it gross lusts and intellectual dullness and the other pride
and wantonness. Krishna argues that even by the rules of the calculus of
pleasure and pain (if you formulate the rules correctly and work the sum right)
the man who puts the things of the soul first over others will prove to be the
most truly agreeable as well as the most noble. The ethics of the Gita has some
merits and special aspects not common to European thought. The Gita has a great
wholeness of outlook and it keeps consistently together points of view which
have always been separated but with disastrous effects. Human activity seeks
happiness, but happiness is not “maximum agreeable feeling” or excitement. It
is integral and not decimal in its structure. The great philosopher Kant held
that the truly virtuous act is that which is done against our grain. He
suspected pleasure. The Gita is free from the perverted psychology which led
Kant to think it wrong to do the most harmless act for the sake of human
pleasure, and almost to hold that the virtuous act is only truly virtuous when
it is done against one’s grain. The ethics of the Gita is not formal. It is not
“duty for duty’s sake”. It is duty for the spiritual through the social
service. It is not empty of content. It is not a mere stoical virtue or
austerity for its own-sake. Like Spinoza and Aristotle, the mortality of the
Gita is not purely intellectualistic and based on reason. Mere knowledge is not
virtue. We want a powerful psychological technique to translate our knowledge
into action and will. The problem of will is central to morality. Sin is not
mere ignorance, it is weak will also. We need the grace of the Lord and a
disciplined will besides knowledge to become virtuous. This element is absent
in rationalistic ethics. The theism of the Gita does not absolve men from duty
and the need for self-effort. It does not run down self-effort to glorify the
grace as Pascal does. Like all the true mystics the author of the Gita is alive
to the distinction between temporal good and eternal good, but he never forgets
that its detachment is necessary to noble living: the true detachment is that
of the man who uses temporal goods without losing his heart to it. The Gita
idea of morality is a synthesis of all. “It is the richest synthesis of India
culture.” George Russell (popularly known as <i>AE</i>)<i> </i>the great Irish
poet speaking about the vital compassion for humanity observes: “Goethe,
Wordsworth, Emerson, Thoreau among moderns have something of this vitality and
wisdom, but we can find all they have said and much more in the grand sacred
books of the East. The Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads contain such God-like
fullness of wisdom on all things, that I feel the authors must have looked with
calm remembrance back through a thousand passionate lives full of feverish
strife ere they could have written with such certainty of things which the soul
feels to be sure.<sup>l8</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bahadur Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu who hailed from Rajahmundry was a
pioneer in social reform, as well as a great writer in Telugu. Along with a
band of devoted workers, he performed the first widow marriage. The following
article gives a very interesting account of the social conditions in Andhra

advocating the urgency of widow marriages from the platform, in the press and
publishing literature we resolved that we should perform some marriages and
lead the way. For achieving this purpose myself, Sri N. Subba Rao Pantulu, K.
Ramalinga Sastry, B. Gavarraju and A. Lakshminarasimham constituted ourselves
into a Society. We took solemn oaths not to divulge anything even to our
closest friends and formulated plans in strict secrecy. We held two meetings in
the house of Sri A. Lakshminarasimham to know for certain who would attend the marriage
ceremony and support us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

efforts roused our opponents, who fearing that we were bent upon action and
were not content with mere words, held meetings to think of ways and means to
sabotage our endeavours. One day some orthodoxically inclined lay men and
religious people held a meeting in the Markandeya temple. They decided
beforehand to excommunicate me and threaten with social boycott all those who
support widow marriages. They sent a gentleman to invite me to defend my views
and contradict theirs. I learnt later that they plotted to beat me up when the
meeting was over. Some students somehow got wind of this evil design and within
half an hour the temple premises were filled with two hundred students. Many of
them had lathis in their hands. Some of them pushed themselves forward, removed
some gentlemen and surrounding me formed a cordon (protecting circle) around my
person. As I had no knowledge of the evil designs of my opponents, then I thought
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>that </span>the <span

girl was neither remarried nor her hair shaved off; she adamantly refused to
submit herself to the indignity of making herself ugly. So her relations and
the orthodoxy thought of a middle course to save their prestige. Our people
accept even living in sin but reject the slightest deviation from tradition!
Her people told her that she could enjoy sex stealthily but should not think of
marriage! Caring only for sexual gratification, this girl took to the world’s
most ancient profession and thus saved herself from ex-communication which
would have been her fate if she married again! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

our opponents were busy with shaving off the hair of widows, we were no less
active in seeking out ways of rescuing them. Widows who had a little education
wrote to me requesting me to save them from their miserable plight. We thought
that if we made a beginning with the marriage of widows who had not reached the
age of puberty soon widow marriages would become popular. People were ready for
the marriage of such girls but none came forward to be the first. Every one
said that he would follow suit if somebody took the plunge. It is natural to
give up the idea if people involved in the first marriage faced difficulties;
or to follow suit if everything went on well with the first marriage. We tried
our best by holding confidential talks with them, arranging for the advice by
their friends and writing very persuasive and convincing letters, of course in
great secrecy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

people to escort the girl there. They should keep the thing as a profound
secrecy. If they are hypocrites they are sure to frustrate our object. Please
see that they really uphold our cause. Nobody here should know the purpose for
which they come here <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>till </span>the
marriage actually takes place. Sitamma (the girl’s mother) wants you to send
not more than two people for the purpose. She also thinks that our efforts may
in the end again prove a total failure. She has also agreed to give you her
written permission for the marriage. Let your people come here as travellers
with a note from you and meet me without giving the least smell of the matter
to anybody here. They can go to Repudi, the girl’s village, even from this
place. I told Sitamma not to leave her village till your men come and take her
daughter away. Please send your people at your earliest convenience.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I received this letter my men left Rajahmundry and were on their way. The
village they had to go was a hundred and fifty miles from Rajahmundry. We
cannot send any telegrams to that place nor was it connected by the railway. So
I consulted my friends and wrote to my man a sealed letter giving in detail the
names of the girl, her mother and the village and instructing him what to do.
We sent this letter, by a reliable peon, whose services were placed at our
disposal again by Sri A. Lakshminarasimham Pantulu. Before this letter arrived
at its destination our friend went to Tiruvur and learnt that Sri Brahmanandam
left the place on transfer. My man did not know the girl whom it was their
mission to fetch and even the name of the village. They should not reveal the
nature of their mission. They should not even tell anyone who they were, but
they were intelligent and could manage things. So he waited for my letter without
returning to Rajahmundry. The peon I sent went there on twenty-second and gave
my letter to Sri Bhimasankaram. They immediately left for the girl’s village.
Her parents were very wealthy and belong to a family which had been holding a
leading position in the village for many generations. Except her mother no one
else in their circle of relations was in favour of the marriage of this girl.
They had many relatives in the neighbouring villages. My men were utterly
friendless in those parts. One can imagine their fate if the nature of their mission
leaked out. Under such bleak and dangerous circumstances my friend
Bhimasankaram with great discretion did not tell even the cartman the name of
the village they were going to. He arrived near the village at two in the night
and with great difficulty located their house, contacted the mother and told
her why he had gone there. She told him that she would not send her girl unless
Sri Brahmanandam himself would go there. My friend pleaded with her for a long
time and in the end persuaded her to send her daughter. Afraid of being caught
on the way, he took every precaution and fetched the girl to Rajahmundry on
twenty-second November. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

set about to secure a suitable young man for this girl. As I have already
stated, parents started marrying off their sons in a hurry fearing that
otherwise under my evil influence they might marry widows. Thus some students
who wanted to marry widows were already married; some are not suitable as they
belonged to another sub-sect. While I was looking for a suitable young man, the
wife of one whom I brought up and educated died. He did his Matriculation and
was in the Police department at Visakhapatnam on a salary of twenty rupees. As
he was brought up by me, he had interest in and enthusiasm for widow marriages
and other social reforms. As he was young, educated and had good prospects in
Government service, he had many offers, but rejecting all these he accepted to
marry the girl I proposed. He willingly accepted to face all the difficulties
involved in marrying a widow, an unheard of thing in those days, with
commendable courage and spirit of service. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

day of marriage was fixed. Under instructions from Sri P. Ramakrishnaiah, I was
paid one thousand rupees by Sri N. Kama Raju. I secured all the necessary
requirements for the marriage, but as the bridegroom was not granted leave by
the Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam, I was afraid that the marriage
would not take place. I wrote to Colonel PO1.tuguese, the I. G., of Police, who
while he was the D. S. P. of our district had a very high opinion of me. He
sent a telegram to the District Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam,
instructing him to grant leave to the bridegroom. He even wrote a personal
letter to the District Superintendent of Police, Kakinada, to help me in every
possible way in performing the marriage. Sri A. Venkatasastry, the Police
Headquarters Inspector at Visakhapatnam, came to Rajahmundry in time along with
the bridegroom. This gentleman is the brother of Brahmanandam, the Tahsildar of
Tiruvur. Besides, he is a close friend of mine and responsible for persuading
the bridegroom to marry this girl. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

then the People of Rajahmundry were wondering who the bridegroom was. When they
learnt that he was no other than Sri G. Sriramulu, his relatives came and tried
to dissuade him from this ‘Foolish Venture’. But he remained firm in his
resolve and they went away disappointed. When it was known that the marriage
will surely take place, a great commotion gripped our town. My opponents and
champions of the old order held public meetings denouncing the forthcoming
marriage. People gathered in groups by the road-side and talked about it, the
most sensational event. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this commotion those who were nobodys became famous over-night. Those who were
begging for a few chips at marriage functions became the guardians of caste and
tradition. Those who beg for alms in the streets were considered fit to gather
information on my doings. Disheartened by these activities of my opponents,
some of my friends hesitated even to talk to me. Those who boasted that they
would lay down their lives for the cause of widow marriages and wrote letters
to others asking them to do likewise and some members of my inner circle also were
afraid to pass through my street and went by roundabout routes, while going to
their places of work in their anxiety to demonstrate that they had dissociated
themselves from me! My Brahmin cook left my service afraid of my opponents. The
‘Purohit’ refused to perform ceremonial rites at my house. All my relations
abused me and treated me as though I lost my caste. On the day of marriage not
only at my house but throughout my street the Police were posted. Amidst such
circumstances the first widow marriage took place in my house at Rajahmundry on
December 11, 1881.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

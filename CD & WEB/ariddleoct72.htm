fact it is a headache giving job for Professor <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span>
to teach Chemistry in that small college. He has dislike as well as repulsion
on the <span class=SpellE>colourless</span> and tasteless teaching profession.
His students and colleagues too would call him Professor, though he never liked
<span class=GramE>to</span> be called so. The word ‘Professor’ reminds him of
the black stone statue in the college compound. In his view that statue, with
marked lines absolutely devoid of humanity, stood as a symbol of the solid
wisdom of library. <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span> is highly active and
enthusiastic. His activity appears quite visible at times. At other times it
appears to be fictitious. Such change from <span class=SpellE>naturality</span>
to pretension comes in unexpectedly and automatically. Therefore his pretension
too is considered natural among known </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>circles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has no leaps and bounds when among men of his status. He would behave with
dashing spirits. He would take away from the <span class=SpellE>neighbour’s</span>
plate any desirable foodstuffs. He would behave in all familiarity with
strangers. He would crack jokes at himself and feels highly delighted within
himself. He would behave in a highly sophisticated way if he scents the
presence of ladies. Right from the gestures of the hands and feet to the art of
talking with the throat, everything works as if tightened. He would begin every
word with apologies. He would begin to smile even when it does not stir out. He
affects enthusiasm to conceal his perplexity. He would make a gentle rebuke
that he has not much confidence on women’s intelligence. However, he is a
source of delight in general for all women. His highly daring views, however
dreadful, make others feel that they are not his personal views and that he is
rather uttering in a jocular vein. The college authorities did not much mind
when they came to know of his eccentric views. Perhaps they too might have
disregarded them under the impression that a barking dog does not generally
bite. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
was one main reason for <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal’s</span> influence. He was
aged twenty-five years. He was not yet married. Any <span class=GramE>number of
attempts were</span> made by the brides’ fathers to become his fathers-in-­law.
<span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span> challenged the general principle that a
youth of twenty years in those parts could not keep up bachelordom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the incidents that led to the sudden dismissal of <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span>

day as he was lecturing on chemical compounds, “those eyes” troubled him for
the first time. He was very enthusiastically lecturing about the aspect of the
natural and powerful attraction in between two opposing forces. He had taken up
various examples from nature. Suddenly he stopped his lecture. For a moment he
even forgot as to what he was lecturing about. “Those darting eyes” were
looking into his eyes attentively. They appeared as if concentrating on his
back far off. He felt irritated. He put a question to “those eyes.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

but natural for her to shed tears for thus being insulted in the entire class. <span
class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span> felt repentant for having put that question. Some­how
he continued the lesson for that hour. But he could not get his original mood
for that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

after the expiry of the hour, those eyes were haunting him for a long time.
Though he knows the faces of his students, he does not generally remember their
names. Hence he specially remembered her name while taking attendance in the
practical class. Her name was <span class=SpellE>Radha</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span> was gazing at her with wistful looks, all
throughout the class for the entire two hours. He admired her in his mind when
she did the experiment quite <span class=SpellE>skilfully</span> and neatly.
When she approached him with her note-book, he made a casual remark,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as <span class=SpellE>Radha</span> shouted “Ah!” their conversation stopped. <span

fold of his new pant. The broken pen of <span class=SpellE>Radha</span> lay
near his foot. <span class=SpellE>Radha</span> felt very much for the same. She
expressed regrets for her ignorance. <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span> however
simply said that it did not matter much. Only one doubt <span class=GramE>stick</span>
to his mind–that the pen had not fallen down from her hands, by itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=GramE>Various minute incidents that latter happened, intensified <span
class=SpellE>Ramgopal’s</span> doubt further.</span> But he could not get
sufficient evidence to testify the truth of the doubts in his mind. Everything
appears trivial and innocent if carefully observed. But something strange
strikes his mind a bout her gestures, eyes, cheeks and the peculiar tunes
ringing in her throat when she was speaking with him. Even though he would bend
down while going, her body would touch him unawares in between the small spaces
of the laboratory tables. At times she used to approach him to allay her
meaningless and silly doubts. While taking the record-book from his hand, her
hands would touch his hands even­ though there was no necessity. However much
confident <span class=SpellE>Ram­gopal</span> was with the firmness of his
heart, these small incidents did not but trouble him. Whether she was in his
presence or not, thoughts about her encompassed him day by day. He used to
explain to himself as if he was <span class=GramE>perceiving</span> and
enjoying all the show she was putting forth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Dasara</span> Vacation, he went on an excursion to <span
class=SpellE>Papi</span> Hills taking along with him some students. <span
class=SpellE>Radha</span> was also among them. The fact that his doubts were
not mere doubts was proved by an incident that happened there. He was bathing
in the river along with boy students. All the ladies sat on the jag of a
mountain leaning over the water and were looking at them. <span class=GramE>Suddenly</span>
he heard a cry and a sound. He looked back. A lady was floating in the water,
tossing up and down the waves at a distance of four or five yards. He caught
hold of her in two fathoms and lifted her head up. She was <span class=SpellE>Radha</span>.
She lay unconscious. He bore her on his shoulders and brought her to the shore.
As he was ascending the bank, her left hand encircled his neck. It did not at
all appear as if it was done in an unconscious state. Though he could by no
means prove it, he perfectly knew that she was quite in her senses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

latest incident happened on one night in the dark. There was some function in
the college that day. At the end of the meeting, when all the ladies and the
guests had gone, he assigned the respective duties to the peons and started
home. There was a short-cut route to reach the road from the college, through a
big mango grove. Even though it was pitch dark, as it was quite a </span><span

route, <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span> walked along the footpath. Suddenly

after all the ladies and guests departed (moreover, that was not the way to her
house) why was she there! For what purpose! <span class=SpellE>Ramgopal</span>
did not know for himself what he was doing in that instant. In his blind
excitement he closely pressed <span class=SpellE>Radha</span> to his heart. <span
class=SpellE>Radha</span> gave a big shout which echoed through the entire
grove. A battery tight was <span class=SpellE>focussed</span> on both of
them–from some where. He was shocked. He withdrew his hands from <span

light. Sweat-drops formed on his forehead. He knew nothing of the confusion

decided to conquer this world–especially the world of women–by doing some­thing

himself from marriage. He got several scientific books about the mental make-up
of women and started reading them. Later on he began writing essays and stories

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[This poem of eleven lines is from the <I>Purananooru. </I>an ancient anthology of Tamil verse.]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The garnered harvest of a tiny field can keep an elephant for many a day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But let the brute step into the field and trampling eat, even a hundred acres will not suffice–for, the feet do spoil more than the mouth doth eat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, if a king, being wise, gathers his taxes justly, his kingdom will yield him millions and still greatly prosper.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, if a weak and thoughtless king, day after day, gathers round him a crowd of foolish, flattering courtiers, and avidly wrings his uttermost, losing his people's love,– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, like the elephant-trampled field, his kingdom is ruined, and he too will starve.</P>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
some exceptions modern States have tended towards secularism or dissociation
from religion. Our Constitution follows the fashion and respects this
principle, both negatively and also by specific provisions. Thus it prohibits
discrimination against individuals on religious grounds, and prohibits
religious instruction in State-financed schools. The ban on discrimination
illustrates the good side of the secular State. The prohibition of religious
instruction is of doubtful wisdom. A truly secular Indian State certainly seems
an anomaly, and cannot expect to continue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ceremony at Somnath has shown how difficult it will be to maintain the attempt,
or pretence. The event has provoked the controversy again, this time on a
typical issue which aids discussion. Perhaps it will not be considered improper
if a non-Hindu, who attempts to take a rational view, states a case on one
side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unless
it is content to maintain itself by sheer force, a State must identify itself
with an idea. It might appear that ideas can be dispensed with if the regime
could give its people a high degree of satisfaction of their material needs. It
is noticeable however that those States which, truly or falsely, claim the
greatest suceess in promoting material progress, viz., America and Russia, are
both very much concerned to spread among their people a quasi-religious
devotion to the national ideals. They do not consider that material progress is
enough to keep their subjects’ loyalty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
any event, India cannot rely on material progress to keep the people loyal. For
she cannot expect material progress. This is not because of any defect in the
Congress administration or the capital economy. It may be stated with
confidence that no party or policy now before the public could prevent a
continued fall in the standard of living. Aside from some technological miracle
which might intervene to save us, there are two measures which are essential if
our economic decline is to be arrested. These are a drastic lowering of the
birthrate, and the import of capital from abroad on the scale of thousands of
crores. No party can achieve either of these. Whichever party rules, therefore,
we must expect a continued decline in standard of life.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
State must, then, rely on the power of ideas. There are some who advocate the
adoption of purely secular ideals. This policy appears to have the merit of
honesty. If these secular ideals do not materialise, the public will know it,
and will proceed to change its rulers; whereas religious ideals cannot be
realised in this world, and the public may be expected to possess its soul in
patience for a longer period. Though apparently honest, however, the secular
programme has the disadvantages that it is unrealisable, and that even if it
were in some measure realised it would probably not achieve its object of
social stability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
secular programme, if it is to attract public support, must be an ideal one. It
is of no use to approach the public in the mood of political realism. An honest
man, a Socrates, would tell the people: “I advocate democracy, not because it
is likely to be satisfactory, but because on the whole it is less bad than the
other systems. I advocate honesty in public life, but I know only one way in
which it can be achieved that all citizens fear God more than they love their
families. I advocate justice, and I believe that if we act wisely we may hope,
in time, to render it somewhat less precarious and even, perhaps less
inaccessible to the poor. I advocate liberty, but I warn you that it is
attainable only under a government which is willing to let you die of
starvation: if you want to prosper, you must submit to the necessity of work
and if you want the State to secure your prosperity you must become its slaves.
I do not advocate equality: I should like it, I believe, but I suspect that it
will always be unattainable. I do not advocate fraternity: I should like it
above all things on earth, but I fear that we can attain it among ourselves
only in proportion to our hatred of other nations.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is unnecessary to mention what happened to Socrates. Our Constituent Assembly
adopted a more prudent line of talk and committed itself to a Preamble in which
Democracy, Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are promised without
qualification. That is why the secular ideal is described above as only
apparently honest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
secular ideal has never been realised. A few nations have brief periods, made
some progress towards the realisation of some never all, of its constituent
elements. One essential pre-condition of even this limited success is material
prosperity. It requires no further argument to show that the secular ideal is
inapplicable to India. We are becoming steadily poorer, and there is no early
hope of revealing this trend. According to the official estimate of the
national income, equality would give us all a fraction under Rs. 20 per head
per month. It is difficult to practise the civic virtues on Rs. 20 per month.
And as that figure falls, the struggle for life will become more intense,
honesty more difficult to practise, justice more unattainable, equality more
remote, liberty and democracy in more imminent peril.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a different version of the secular ideal. It sacrifices liberty and
democracy entirely for equality, security and prosperity. But those who follow
this seductive argument are disappointed. They lose their liberty and
democracy, but they do not get the promised equality; their economic security
is dearly bought at the price of civic insecurity, and their prosperity never
comes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
secular ideal, in short, is a fraud. Its ends are good, so far as they go, but
they can never be completely realised. Certainly there is no prospect of
realising them in India. But even when, by some good fortune, a community makes
progress in the direction of the secular ideal, the peop1e are not satisfied.
Secular wants are illimitable. Social solidarity is strong only in adversity,
if then. Men are rootedly opposed to equality: as the satirist puts it, “when
everybody’s somebody then no-one’s anybody.” It is unnecessary to elaborate a
familiar theme. The profound unrest during the past century in the West, where
physical well-being, civil liberty, education, and the rest have reached levels
never before attained, is strong evidence that these secular achievements do
not satisfy. There is an impressive range of opinion, among historians,
sociologists, psychologists, many of whom are not religious believers, that the
root of the trouble is the decay of religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
State then cannot rely solely upon secular ideas. To maintain itself it must
strengthen traditional loyalties and pieties. It promotes nationalism, but in
India nationalism is weak. There is no alternative to a deliberate cultivation
of religion. Religious belief is still strong and almost universal, and, apart
from the Muslim minority can probably be used to bind society together and
strengthen the political structure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is a policy which has, in recent generations, come to be regarded as dishonest
and reactionary. But it is not more dishonest than proclaiming a secular ideal
which cannot be realised. As to reaction, it must be judged in comparison with
the alternatives. The situation in India is desperate: no party can honestly
promise what the people want. Not very distant, if we pursue our present
descent towards the abyss, is anarchy. There is no earthly evil greater than
anarchy; and next to it is the terroristic dictatorship to which is usually
gives rise. Society must be held together, and order, maintained. If there are
only two alternative means to that end, namely force and fraud, then there can
be no hesitation. Incomparably the more humane, civilised, libertarian and
progressive method is fraud,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
that is to state the case in the cynical language of nineteenth century
rationalism, which dismissed all religion as fraud. It was prompted to do so by
the circumstances of the decay of Christianity, a religion tied to a set of
historical events, and an unchanging philosophy founded on those events. In the
nineteenth century it was found that most of this history was mythical; and the
philosophy at once lost all plausibility. The Christian religion has never
recovered from the blow. But other religions, not tied to alleged historical events,
or to rigid philosophies, need not perish from the encroachments of scientific
curiosity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the commemoration volume on the Somnath Temple ceremony, Mr. Munshi remarks
that Saivism is the original religion of India. Bhandarkar says that Rudra-Siva
has always been and continues to be the ordinary God of the Hindus. Saivism
remains very widespread in our time, and appeals to saintly and intellectual
persons as well as the uneducated. This suggests that it represents principles
important to the psychic life. It is hoped that a discussion of these from a
purely secular point of view will not be without value. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
main features of Saivism seem to be explicable as a natural development from
its earliest known form. Leaving aside the other cults which may have merged
with it, it began as a worship of the organs of procreation–a common cult in
ancient times. This may be supposed to have developed into or fused with the
worship of a god, conceived as a father, and of a goddess, conceived as a
mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
worship of a mother goddess seems to have been associated with Saivism since
the earliest times, and it may be guessed–though here we are on uncertain
ground–to have been responsible for one of the most striking features of
Saivism, its introversion, The mother goddess cult does not seem to have led to
any similar development elsewhere: yoga may have to be regarded as a unique and
inexplicable contribution of India. Nevertheless, once started, it seems
natural that yoga should take this course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yoga
is a development of the universal fantasy of the return to the womb, and is
therefore naturally associated with yoni worship and mother worship. In the
Tantric yoga this is scarcely disguised. The goddess is pictured as within the
subject’s body: he indentifies himself with her, and then enters into a
hitherto closed channel, the sushumna. In other versions of yoga the detail is
different, but it seems evident that the urge to return to the womb and thus
achieve identification with the mother is at the back of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
father god develops in two ways. One emphasises its benevolent aspect, and the
other its stern, fear-inspiring side. As Buddhism and Vaishnavism are religions
of love, perhaps it may be said premture love, and Christianity in the days of
its vigour was a religion of guilt, so Saivism is a religion of fear. Siva is
powerful and irascible, and kills with a glance of his third eye. He is
associated with wild scenery, mountains, forests, graveyards. In the
cosmological myth he is identified with destruction. Certainly he represents
the stern rather than the loving aspect of the father, though this is not
absent. There is little in the stories to provoke remorse, but the swallowing
of the ‘halahala’ may show him as the bearer of the burdens of humanity. Manikavasagar
says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the mother is a regression: at the deepest level a regression to the
inter-uterine stage, i.e., to identification with the mother. This relation
utilises all the libido, leaving none for other love objects. The social
horizon is narrowed to the extreme, and relations with others tend to be cut
off. Evidently this trend will favour loyalty to narrow groups, and a weakening
of national solidarity. Devotion to the father, on the other hand, does not at
any psychic level tend strongly to identification with him. The relation will
normally be one of love, companionship, co-operation, but disturbed by the
ambivalence of the father-son tie, so that there is room for attachment to
others, and the possibility of change and a widening of horizons. This relation
is at least more favourable to the rise of a broader loyalty; and historically
the emergence of nations from the tribal stage is associated with loyalty to
great kings, and the fusion of tribal gods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the Saiva authors claim that their religion is indifferent to caste. They
may have been thinking only of their bhakti doctrine and forgetting the
ceremonial and other features which have reinforced the fissiparous trends in
Hinduism. But their contention that devotion to a god, of fear as well as of
love, should be a unifying factor, seems to be justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ignore them, or to try recklessly to destroy them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

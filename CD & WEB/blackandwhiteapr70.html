was raining outside. We were in a <span class=SpellE>moffusil</span> town. So
we heard frogs croaking in some nearby pool, hole or pit. It was early at
night. Yet people had almost ceased going about the roads. There was very
little chance of patients turning up at such an hour. <span class=SpellE>Haralal</span>
lit another cigarette and somewhat spread himself out on the chair. He then
returned to the old topic on which our evening <span class=SpellE>tete-a-tete</span>
had started–whither we were going after independence, what we had got and not
got. We had spoken a few words when we heard an umbrella being shut up outside
the door and closely following, saw somebody enter the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

my gaze turned to the gentleman, it fell on his head. It had a mass of silver-white
hair which was hanging on all sides making up something like a hat. He was
rather of short stature but of tight appearance, the face being strong and
rigid and the body showing no sign of looseness. So there was a total disparity
between the body and the head. The gentleman sat on a chair just beside mine
and said. “Do I understand this is the literary friend you spoke of?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

long time ago when I was at school I saw a performance of “<span class=SpellE>Mewar</span>
<span class=SpellE>Patan</span>” or Fall of <span class=SpellE>Mewar</span> at
our village. Uncle <span class=SpellE>Bidhu</span> as we called <span
class=GramE>him,</span> played the role of <span class=SpellE>Govinda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sinha</span>. He looked much like this gentleman. He wore hair of
cotton and a beard of jute <span class=SpellE>fibre</span> and in a shivering
voice declaimed, “Well, <span class=SpellE>Rana</span>, it’s not in <span
class=SpellE>Govinda</span> <span class=SpellE>Sinha</span> to condescend to
make a treaty with anyone.” That scene now reappeared before my eyes. It seemed
to me that it was the same Uncle <span class=SpellE>Bidhu</span> who had put
off the beard somewhere and come to <span class=SpellE>Haralal’s</span> chamber
with only his hair on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

returned the <span class=SpellE>Namaskar</span> and said, “Please don’t mind. But

gentleman burst into a guffaw and then said, “But no one else has suspected
that of me. Rather I have, while journeying by bus, found that should there be
a ladies’ seat half vacant and the occupant of the other half–in most cases, a
young woman happen to look at my head, she immediately asked me to be seated by
her. Once I thankfully said, ‘Let it be, you would be inconvenienced if I sit
there’. The reply was a sweet smile: ‘Not at all. Where’s the inconvenience?
You being an old <span class=GramE>man,</span> must be feeling ill at ease.’ I
looked about and found that at least half a dozen among those who were
standing, were considerably older than me. But they had not this hair that I
had.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

saying, he pointed at his head. Then he added, “Truly <span class=GramE>this my</span>

forged no notes, did not defalcate: nor was I a dacoit in the <span

had to hold charge of persons who indulged in such activities. The apprehension
that somebody among them would break my door and <span class=GramE>disappear,</span>
did not permit me to keep much track of sleep at night. This hair, I suppose,
is a consequence of that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wardens–meaning those who kept watch in the wards. These were called European
Warders–and in colloquial language, sergeants. Their duties lay in the white
ward. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

performance of duty or in discipline. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

jailor, it said, was committing unspeakable atrocities on the luckless
prisoners. Their quota of food had been reduced, the food supplied was
inedible. The little concessions they had been enjoying so long, had mostly
been withdrawn. There was no way to complain to the Super. The jailor had
threatened that in case they complained, none would ever be in a position to
return home. In former days there had been no question of anybody being beaten.
Now the baton was used off and on. The jail was full of corruption. Those who
could spend money knew no end of happiness. They had not to bother about doing <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>. They ate, relaxed and roamed about. All they had to
do was to give the jailor some money in the beginning of the month. The jailor
had a number of henchmen among the <span class=SpellE>sepoys</span>. They
obtained letters from the rich prisoners, visited their homes and procured
money. The sergeants had by searching the <span class=SpellE>sepoy</span> at
the gate got hold of two or three such letters from within their uniforms. They
had reported the matter to the jailor but it had all been hushed up, never reached

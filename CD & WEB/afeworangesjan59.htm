whatsoever. To ask would anger them. They would scold him for lack of
consideration as to how the family were getting on. He could of course have
saved something from the money for paint and brush, had he known of his present

table and ransacked it impatiently. There were in it a used pencil, rubber,
pastel, torn paper and such other things but not even one pice hidden anywhere.
Where else would he look? Ah! There was the bed. It was his habit, if he could
save anything from his monthly allowance, to turn the bed and keep it down
there. There were periods of long duration when the money wholly escaped his
attention. Then suddenly some day he came by it. He chanced to get it at a time
when one rupee seemed equal in value a lakh. At such times he was pleased with
himself for his own carelessness regarding money. But what was the matter
today? It was wholly empty under the bed. It seemed his need of money had
become known and that commodity had made itself deliberately scarce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

serious. Yet it was often impossible to keep out misunderstandings. It so
happened as a result that they did not speak with each other for four or five
days together. It did not help that Murtaza was in the final year of his
school; he still remained a child. Particularly so to his younger brothers and
sisters. They gave him no quarter on account of his age. Last year in the

town. But she by no means deserved all the praise that was showered on her.
That morning she had been rehearsing a song on the harmonium. She would have to
sing it on New Year’s Day at the Prantik Parishad. Murtaza had begun a
composition; after he had begun work on it new ideas had been coming to him so
that he was now in a craze over it. But there was the harmonium bleating forth
in the neighbouring room. He had walked up to the room and said at the pitch of

could not manage anything out of that money. But what about tiffin allowance?

had to depart from this world, and wisdom lay in blowing off this life in
cigarette smoke. But, he added, one must not on that account neglect one’s
duty; for there was joy in doing work after one’s own heart and joy was life.

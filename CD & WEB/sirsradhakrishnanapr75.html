following is a very interesting sketch on Dr Radhakrishnan published in <i>Triveni
</i>for September 1936, under the pen name “S. P.”–EDITOR] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this sketch of Radhakrishnan, I have not attempted to represent him as anything
more than what he is–one of Nature’s great gentlemen. The eloquence and the
earnestness of his speeches and writings are apt to tempt one to regard him as
a messiah. I have, however, avoided regarding him as one, for the obvious
reason that he does not promise the <span class=SpellE>striken</span> world a
shortcut to the millennium; and also because Radhakrishnan has never professed
to be a messiah. Besides, we have at present more messiahs than gentlemen. It
is his great human qualities that fascinate me–his serenity of mind, his
freedom from the sin of self-righteousness, his deep humanity, his engaging
modesty. Even if he were not endowed with the brilliant intellectual gifts that
he possesses, the innate delicacy of his mind and character is enough to rank
him amongst the chosen spirits of mankind. It is to this aspect of his life
that I seek to draw attention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One of the ways in which the world tolerates men of
superior intellect is by making fun of them; and so we have our jokes about the
poet, the artist and the scientist. We have our jokes about the philosopher
too. We look upon him either as an extremely talkative individual rattling away
at some “Great argument–about it–and about,” or an exceptionally absent-minded
person who can never be trusted to cross a road without the risk of being run
over; in either view a queer fellow, not by any means to be taken seriously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
with these ideas at the back of our minds, we see Radhakrishnan, our first
impression will be one of terrible surprise, for, <span class=GramE>he</span>
is so much unlike the traditional philosopher. He is neither a chatterbox nor a
star-gazer. He is a man of the world, steeped from the crown of his head to the
toe or his foot in its wisdom and its ways. His manner is alert, attentive and
affable. It is neither superior nor sententious. He never talks of anything
high or dry. He talks with you as if he had known you<i> </i>all his life.
There is not in him even the slightest trace of pomposity. Once I happened to
ask him what made him choose philosophy, expecting, of course, to be told that
his natural disposition of soul lay that way or some such recondite reason that
celebrated men are fond of telling themselves and others. But he told me in the
most light-hearted and casual manner that he chanced to take philosophy because
he had a relation who was good enough to pass on to him a few text-books on
psychology and ethics. That was the reason of his taking philosophy! This is
expressive of his attitude to his work. He believes in it, of course: otherwise
work is impossible. But he has an engaging, self-deprecatory modesty that
rescues him from taking himself and his work far too seriously. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Neither
is there anything of the snob in his composition. High and low, rich and poor,
the learned and the lay, can mix and mingle with him on terms of ease and
equality. I can imagine him talking to an actress with the same courtesy as he
would show to an Archbishop. Also one can talk to him what one likes without
the least fear of losing caste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only disconcerting element in intercourse with him is his uncanny gift of
breaking into your thoughts. His reading of your mind is so quick and correct
that he seems to reply not to the words that you utter but to four unspoken
thoughts. If, in spite of his anticipation, and determined to have your say,
you begin a sentence, he will finish it for you much better than you could have
done. This is not, however, due to any want of respect or good manners. Few men
are more considerate to other’s feelings and few men better mannered than he;
but his mind, like a racing engine, cannot brook delay and so it does the work
for you because it does it quicker. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
amazing quickness of mind and speed in doing things have given rise to two
interesting legends about him; one, that he is a hustler in debate, and
secondly, that for a philosopher, he hurries too much; but like all legends
they are only half-truths. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
me take the first thing first. It is said that he is impatient in council, that
he stifles discussion and hustles his colleagues to his opinions. That
Radhakrishnan, of all men, should have given rise to this impression is
unfortunate. But the truth of it is that, as the executive head of an
institution, he has always conceived it as his duty to lead, and he leads
because he knows how to do it. It is true he is not one of those comfortable
leaders who lead by following. He has knowledge. He has dialectical power and
diplomatic ability. He can see his ideas through not because they are his ideas
(he is not an egocentric individual prone to conjugate his verbs with the
personal pronoun I) but because most often his ideas are good. “I dominate the
Cabinet,” said the late Mr. Chamberlain, “because, of all the men there, I was
the only one that knew his mind.” Such men always lead. They always dominate;
and perhaps it is just as well that they do; otherwise, modern democracy would </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>degenerate
into a madhouse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other legend, that he hurries everything though is seemingly not without point.
He has a genius for rushing things through. He can finish a large volume
between breakfast and dinner and yet can manage neither to skip over a page nor
miss a phrase. He can finish a hundred-topic agenda of the Senate or the
Syndicate of a University in even less than as many minutes. He can rush from
one end of the country to another as <span class=GramE>quick</span> as the
steam could carry him, doing business of importance at either end. In 1926 when
he toured through <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
he used to make long journey during the nights and lecture at new places every
evening of<i> </i>the few days that he spent there. What others would like to
do in a fortnight, he has it in him to do in a day; and where in that thin,
spare, lanky frame of his there is all that energy necessary for such strain,
no one knows. In a sense, his whole life has been one huge rush. He was a
graduate before he was 18, a father before he was 21 and a great leader of
philosophy before he was exactly 33. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
this rushing is not by any means a real part of his nature. Few men are at
heart fonder of quiet. In fact, his rushing is due to his eagerness to get back
to his quiet. For<i> </i>days on end, he can enjoy being left alone at home to
spend his days in reading and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>writing, finding the necessary relaxation
in the intimacies of his family circle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
one sees him confined to his home, one wonders whether he has any real interest
in or zest for life. The common <span class=GramE>thing that conduce</span> to
pleasure and comfort seem to be of no significance to him. The manner of his
life is simple to the point of austerity. His wants are few and he is content
with the most frugal fare. He is not a man to bother about artistic settings
for his life. He always describes his house, in a mood of playful sarcasm, as a
sort of ‘caravanserai,’ <span class=GramE>In</span> the large and ultimate
sense, perhaps, all houses are caravanserais: man is after all on a brief
sojourn on this planet. But how many are conscious of this? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
a view to induce him to take a long walk, I once reminded him of a passage in
one of his books, where he poetized over simple pleasures like the ‘silent
walks through the country.’ He smiled with an almost a child’s caught out
feeling and said he reserved those pleasures for his books. Allied to this is
his indifference to places of natural beauty or historical Interest. He would
have passed <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cairo</st1:place></st1:City>
up and down at least fifteen times by<i> </i>now and never once did it cross
him to run up and see the Pyramids. For all his love of Plato and Aristotle,
his love of the Greek philosophy and art, it never struck him to see the
Acropolis. Neither did he see <st1:City w:st="on">Venice</st1:City>, at least
to be able to talk at garden parties about the gondolas and the <st1:place
w:st="on">Grand <span class=GramE>canal</span></st1:place>. He has never felt <span
class=GramE>either the necessity for holidays, for week-ends and all the
pleasant lotus-eating and</span> fooling that they mean; none-the-less, he is
not, in the jargon of the smart set, a kill-sport. He can be pleasant even at
parties where over-dressed aesthetes and under-dressed ladies, vie with each
other in prattling nonsense by the hour. He can also, when the mood is on him,
rattle and rag a painted beauty and make her sob and smile in turn. With equal
nonchalance he can play with a priggish man and pull his leg. These moods show
that years and philosophy have not aged his innate youthful spirit. But
essentially he is serious in disposition and puritanical in his tastes and mode
of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
does not, however, mean he is insensible to beauty or unappreciative of art. He
is not like the Oxford Professor in the <i>Dark Flower </i>who had lost the
power of admiring anything except a few passages of the classics. Radhakrishnan
is extremely susceptible to beauty and, the quieter and subtler it is, the more
enchanting it is to him. He can admire pictures, plays and music, and latterly
even cricket. But he never fusses over these things. Admiration of beauty or
the seeking of pleasure <span class=GramE>are</span> not by<i> </i>any means
the major passions of his life. This, to my mind, is due to the fact that his
reactions to beauty and pleasure are merely intellectual. He has much of the
Greek in him, but not the Greek’s whole-hearted worship of the form and worship
of the body. Also he lacks the physical energy and the <span class=SpellE>naivete</span>
for complete enjoyment of sensuous delights. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
all his easy and pleasant conversational accomplishments, I am afraid he is not
a great talker. His talk is seldom winged with fancy or sharpened with wit. He
does not excel in the arts that lend spice to conversation–the sparkling
phrase, the banter and the satire. I am afraid Radhakrishnan looks upon such
talkers with some suspicion. He sees in them a bit of posing that is offensive
to his sense of naturalness–a <span class=SpellE>meritriciousness</span> that
jars on his sense of delicacy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
quite apart from these decorative artifices, one could have <span class=SpellE>humour</span>,
which also he does not seem to possess in a large measure. <span class=GramE>While
fully being capable of seeing a joke and enjoying it, he rarely comes off with
a gay, light-hearted utterance.</span> Not to speak of his set speeches, even
in social functions, he cannot help getting into his usual high tone; and when,
to relieve the seriousness of his speech, he resort to something light he
always relies on a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>quotation. While there are scores of
sentences of rare wisdom and beauty that he has written and spoken, scores of
epigrams that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>almost bite one with their brilliance, there are
not many phrases <span class=GramE>of his own</span> making to which you could
return and smile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
am not making a complaint of this. His make-up is far too serious for <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> and pleasantries. How many of the great men filled
with a serious conception of man’s progress through this world could afford to
cultivate <span class=SpellE>humour</span>? <span class=SpellE>Humour</span> is
one of the asides of life and it does not take away anything from the
distinction of Radhakrishnan’s achievements, because in addition to making
people think, he has not also made them laugh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Radhakrishnan is a prodigious reader, one of the
greatest readers that one can find. “I hate the man”, <span class=GramE>laid</span>
Dr Johnson, “who has written more than he has read.” Though for a writer of
philosophy his output has been considerable, he has never once slackened his
reading. He seems to read almost everything except, of course, technical
treatises on topics like Electrical Engineering and Soap manufacture and

authors. His tastes are varied and catholic. He reads all that comes his way,

most dominant thing in his life is his intellectual sanity which strings
together all his qualities and graces and gives his personality an indefinable
power and sweetness. The modern intellectual is caught up in a world of
dissolving faiths and values. Being driven from pillar to post, he is becoming
spiritually neurotic, running after one stunt or another. He has lost his
moorings, and, like a ship without a rudder he is drifting. He is losing his
balance and losing faith in his vocation. He is fast becoming a hater of reason
and a believer in blind chance. But this subversive claptrap hat never affected
Radhakrishnan. Through all this crashing of creeds and all this social and
moral confusion, he feels there is only one thing that can pull man

concern about a friend of his, a most distinguished scholar himself, of how he
started hit life with a glow of promise and how, in the middle, he branched off
from the high road of speculation to some esoteric occultism. Radhakrishnan
said, “Philosophy is a dangerous thing. If you are not careful, it will lead
you into strange alleys.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Radhakrishnan, at any rate, it could never be said that he has not been
careful. A robust commonsense and an almost uncanny circumspection rule his
attitude to men and affairs and even ideas. He is never expansive and is an
adept at keeping his own counsel. While many people confide in him, he confides
in none. Into the central chamber of his being admissions are barred, and even
his most cherished intimates do not know the lie of the land there. Recently a
friend of his said almost in sorrow and judgment: “I do not know really what he
thinks of me.” Radhakrishnan shares with his race the quality of
inscrutability. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

for rebellion against the dull, drab conformity of our lives. This element
invests his spirit with an amount of volatility that is exceptionally rare
amongst men, devoted merely to learning and philosophy. There are moments when
the vision of a suffering humanity impinges on his mind so much that he feels
almost the passion of a revolutionary.<sup>1</sup> <span class=GramE>In</span>
those moods he wants to strike out for himself, escape the tutelage of his
intellectual sanity and dare and do so many things. But this element is controlled
by his essential sense of equipoise which all but annihilates the <span

futility. There is no use crying for the moon. The millenniums cannot be talked
into existence. History is strewn with the wreckages of <span class=GramE>idealisms,
that</span> died in merely letting off the steam, of enthusiasms whose career
was all too brief. Even if it were given to man to change a man, in his
humility, he thinks he is not that man. He feels he is cast for a much quieter

in oneself–believe it to the verge of morbidity. A sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>,

I am afraid that this prospect is blocked for two reasons. For one thing,
democracy–and Indian democracy is no exception–has a fatal habit of ignoring
the right sort of men. Two thousand years ago, the crowds voted for the rogue

resounding through the ages. The untaught democracy led by men who are
positively <span class=SpellE>unteachable</span>, what chance has it of setting

another, Radhakrishnan is not the man to cultivate democracy. He does not have
the temper for it. He is far too refined and perhaps also far too sensitive and
proud for the job. Again and again, whenever his several friends press him to
enter politics, he says that he won’t be happy there and confesses that his
heart really lies in his work and in the deep personal attachments that he has
established with some chosen spirits of his liking. Denied by his own choice of
the destiny which could well have been his, he has chosen to accept the counsel
given by Plate of “standing under the wall in a storm of dust and
hurricane…...and living his own life clear of injustice and impiety.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and the philosopher, though the frail poet is held in bond by the burly
philosopher. But they are not at war with one another tugging his personality
in two opposite directions. They blend and coalesce; with the result that he
has a head that is rational without being rigid, and a heart that is kind
without being sentimental. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

happiness. Whether they succeeded in their malignant designs or not, they have

bitterness, of looking upon anyone in a spirit of implacable hostility. He
reels that the root of malevolence is foolishness, the lack of understanding of

must lie on it”, is a saying that one hears often, especially from complacent
men and women who excel in laying down the moral law for other people. He once
wrote to a friend of his–who is now no more–chastising him for taking the high
moral tone, and he wound up that exquisite piece of writing with this sentence:

he has the same compunction as one would have in treading upon a child in the

of all by a sympathetic understanding which is so restful and soothing. But he

school like Eton and to a University like <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>,
where boys are expected to acquire form and become gentlemen. He was born in a small
place, one of the small pilgrim centres of this part of the country. He chummed
with boys of his age, played marbles with them in the back streets and perhaps
also robbed the orchards. He attended the village school where the shrill
monotony of a score of young voices crying together would send both the teacher
and the pupils to sleep. He picked up things as he went along, and until he
passed his Matriculation, nobody including himself ever fancied he would become

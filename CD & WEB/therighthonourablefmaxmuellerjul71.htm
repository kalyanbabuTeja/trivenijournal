the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that
nature can bestow–in some parts a very paradise on earth–I should point to
India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most deeply pondered
on the greatest problems of life and has found solutions of some of them which
well-deserved the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant–I
should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we,
here in Europe, we, who have been nurtured almost exclusively in the thoughts
of Greeks and Romans and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that
corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect,
more comprehensive, more universal, in fact, more human, a life not for this
life only but a transfigured and eternal life–again I should point to India.” </p>

Right Hon. F. Max Mueller made this statement in London in 1842 in the first of
his seven lectures on the subject: <i>“India: What can it teach us?” </i>to the
British candidates for the Indian Civil Service. While mentioning that India
has also<i> </i>many things to learn from Europe, he said that young
Britishers, who had to spend about twenty-five years in India, would feel at
home in India if, before they left England, they learnt about the life and
literature of India. He was however careful to point out that the India he had
in view was not the India of the modern cities like Calcutta, Madras and Bombay
but the India of a few thousands of years ago and the contemporary India of the
village communities, the true India of Indians. Max Mueller was not indulging
in a panageric of ancient and rural India but describing what he learnt of them
from Sanskrit literature, which he studied with remarkable zeal and
perseverance for several decades, and of contemporary events in India from his
place in the University of Oxford, without visiting </span><span

proceeding to India respect for Indians and also of engendering self-respect
and self-confidence in Indians, and particularly the Hindus, who were
dispirited as the result of the Indian defeat in the Indian Mutiny of 1857, and
were looked down upon by the victorious British rulers. Even earlier, in 1829,
Lord William Bentinck, then Governor-General, had, in his bold and famous
Minute outlawing <i>Sati, </i>regretted that the Hindus had become the slaves
of a succession of foreign invaders and resolved to help them to join the ranks
of the independent nations of the world, which they deserved. The need to put
heart in them was greater after the Mutiny, and Max Mueller’s lectures served
that purpose to some extent, even as in India Mrs. Annie Besant helped to build
up the morale of Hindus. To restore self-confidence among those who felt that
they were down and out was the greatest service that any friends of India could
have rendered. Gopal Krishna Gokhale admitted that the Indian National Congress
could not have been initiated by Indians in 1885, but only by a Britisher like
Allan Octavian Home. Max Muller, like Hume, was one of the greatest foreign friends
of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mueller was born in Germany on December 6, 1823. He got interested in India by
his study of Sanskrit in Germany and France. He secured his Doctorate at the
early age of twenty. He published his translation of Sanskrit classic, <i>Hitopadesa,
</i>in 1844, when he was twenty-one. In Paris he attended lectures by Eugene
Burnouf on the <i>Hymns of the Rig Veda. </i>When the great German philosopher,
Arthur Schopenhauer, who appreciated the <i>Upanishads but dismissed the Rig
Veda </i>as mere “priestly rubbish”, Max Muller decided to study the <i>Rig
Veda, </i>with Sayana’s commentary. He migrated to England in 1846 and became
Professor of European Languages in the Oxford University, but his main
interest, Sanskrit. Though he was the most competent candidate for the Boden
Professorship of Sanskrit, the University did not select him because his views
on Christianity were more rational than orthodox, and his politics were more
liberal than that of Oxford. The University, however, created a new chair of
Comparative Philology for him. He retired from it in 1875, and devoted himself
to his gigantic project of the publication of the <i>Sacred Books of the East </i>in
several volumes! Apart from this monumental publication, Max Mueller published <i>Science
of Language, Science of Mythology Science of Religion </i>and several other
books and, among them, on </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

did not wish to present an ideal picture of Indians but protested against
indiscriminate abuse heaped on them as a whole. He condemned the <i>History of
British India </i>by James Mill, which was prescribed to the I. C. S.
candidates and which, he said, was most mischievous and was responsible for the
greatest misfortunes that had happened in India and which traduced the
character of Indians as a body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To repudiate Mill’s
allegations, Max Mueller quoted extensively the testimonies of several British
authorities who had long experience of Indians. Sir Thomas Munroe said: “I have
had ample opportunity of observing the Hindus in every situation, and I can
affirm that they are not litigious.” Col. Sleeman, who suppressed </span><i><span

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

village communities, had said: “I have had before me hundreds of cases in which
a man’s property, liberty and life depended upon his telling a lie, but he has
refused to tell it.” Max Mueller asked how many English Judges could have said the
same! He however made reservation that Hindus were truthful when left to
themselves before the Muslim invasions. He could quote several authorities to
testify that love of truth was the national character of Indians and asserted
that there must be some good ground for the view. He contrasted how the French
accused by English travellers as wanting in truthfulness, while the French
described the British as untru</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

that villagers were honest and sincere, and including Thugs and dacoits, the
mass </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>of crime was less in India than in England. If, under
British rule, some Indians were not truthful, it was because they were obliged
to resist force by fraud. Sir Thomas Munroe had said that the Hindus were not
inferior to the nations of Europe, and if civilization was an article of trade
between England and India, he was convinced that England would gain by the
import cargo. Max Mueller added that he had been repeatedly told by English
merchants that commercial honour stood higher in India than in any other
country, and that a dishonoured bill was hardly known in India. After quoting
several other authorities to the same effect, Max Mueller cautioned that he did
not pretend that all Indians were angels, but what struck him was that, after
nearly a thousand years of foreign rule, so much of Hindu truthfulness
survived. In his final adjuration, he said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Max Mueller supported British rule in India, he pleaded for a more liberal
policy towards Indians. He rejected all ideas that India should be ruled with a
strong hand. In a letter to the <i>Times,</i> London, in 1883, he gave his
support to the Ilbert Bill which sought to eliminate racial discrimination
against Indian judges in criminal trials of Europeans, and condemned the
“brutal logic which maintained that India was conquered by ‘blood and iron’ and
must be ruled by ‘blood and iron!” He maintained that modern India had not had
full justice done to it, and said so to Prime Minister, E. W. Gladstone. He
presented a copy of his book, <i>The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy, </i>to
Lord Curzon with a view to impressing his plea that the English should not look
down on Indians but should regard them as equals. He appealed to the English
not to treat Indians as ‘born enemies or conspirators to be kept under </span><span

force, but as loyal subjects to be trusted.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mueller welcomed the Indian Council Bill of 1892 as at least a step in the
right direction, and advised the Indian National Congress to accept it. In a
letter published in the <i>Times, </i>he described the critics of the Bill as
insects which were not worth powder and shot, and which could be more
effectively killed by ignoring them than by learned arguments. He was happy
that the of elections had been introduced in some responsible non-official
bodies. He however regretted that he would not live to see a Parliament in
Calcutta. He preferred Indians being represented in the British Parliament to
Home Rule and fully supported, along with John Bright, the effort of Lal Mohan

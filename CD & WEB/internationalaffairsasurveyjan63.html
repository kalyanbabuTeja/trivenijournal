It was about four years ago that a revolution took place in the island of Cuba,
which is only ninety miles away from the southern coast of the United States.
It is this geographical proximity that explains to a great extent the concern
of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in anything that may happen in that island. The revolution was aimed at
overthrowing the dictatorship of <span class=SpellE>Batista</span> and it was
welcomed by the United States; There were, however, two sections among the
revolutionaries, one a democratic section believing in free elections and
fundamental human rights and the other a Communistic one under Dr Castro’s
leadership wedded to the doctrine of totalitarianism. The latter triumphed and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> came under
the control of a Communistic government. This was the beginning of the trouble.
It was the first Communistic State in the American continent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the end of 1959 all other political parties were banned. Many industries in
which American capital was invested were <span class=SpellE>nationalised</span>
and no compensation was paid to the former owners. By early 1960 the Castro
regime entered into close economic and political relations with the <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>. From that time on, the process of <span
class=SpellE>communisation</span> proceeded at a rapid pace and most of the
leading democratic citizens were driven to exile and to take refuge in the <st1:country-region

conversion of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> into a
satellite of the Soviet Union naturally irritated the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Ever since the promulgation in 1823 of the Monroe doctrine by the then
President, it has been an integral part of the policy of the United States not
to permit the establishment in the Western Hemisphere of the political control
of any European State. The reduction of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> to the position of a Soviet satellite
undermined the strength of this policy. More-over Cuba became a <span
class=SpellE>centre</span> for spreading Communism into the other States of
central and South America where there was and is a great deal of social and
economic unrest. This had in it the possibility, of creating more Soviet
satellites in that part of the world. Above all, there was the attempt to upset
the balance of power in the American continent through the importation into <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> of a large
quantity of ballistic missiles, jet bombers and other up-to-date offensive
weapons of a highly destructive character. Several missile sites were set up
from which it would be easy for the U. S. S. R. to launch a surprise nuclear
attack on the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
and destroy cities up to a distance of 2000 miles and more–cities like <st1:State
w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
long as the Soviet supplied only defensive weapons to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the
American Government kept quiet. But when by October last it became quite clear
that offensive weapons highly destructive in their nature came to be stocked in
large quantities, President Kennedy was determined to take firm action. He
announced <span class=GramE>a quarantine</span> on all offensive military
equipment under shipment to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and demanded through the Security Council the immediate dismantling and
withdrawal of all missiles and other offensive weapons. This was a sort of
ultimatum that he issued to Premier Khrushchev, and he was resolved on even
risking a nuclear war in case his ultimatum was not accepted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

point of view of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
was best expressed in the speech on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> which her representative,
Adlai Stevenson, made at the Security Council. He said: “For one hundred and
fifty years the nations of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Americas</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have painfully <span class=SpellE>laboured</span> to construct a hemisphere of
independent and co-operating nations–free from foreign threats. An
international system far older than this one (the U. N. O.) the Inter-American
system–has been erected on this principle. The principle of the territorial
integrity of the Western Hemisphere has been woven into the history, the life
and the thought of all the peoples of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Americas</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In striking at that
principle the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> is striking at the
strongest and most enduring strain in the policy of this hemisphere. It is
disrupting </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the<b> </b>convictions and aspirations of a
century and a half. It is intruding on the firm policies of twenty nations. To
allow this challenge to go unanswered </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would be to undermine a
basic and historic to go unanswered would be to undermine a basic and historic
pillar of the security of this hemisphere.” It was against this ba</span><span

that President Kennedy issued his ultimatum. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was in the action which he took in answer to this ultimatum, that Premier
Khrushchev showed the qualities of the highest statesmanship. A lesser man
would have gone to war with the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The prestige of Soviet Russia, as a
great power, was involved. But being a man of practical wisdom, he agreed
immediately to dismantle the missile sites in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> and withdraw the offensive
weapons, the jet bombers and the seventeen thousand Soviet forces stationed
there. The only return he wanted was an assurance from President Kennedy that
there would be no invasion of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
by the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>

to maintain the Soviet prestige. It was in this way </span><span

a nuclear war </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

was averted. The Soviet Union <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that the

were not worth the cost </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
peaceful settlement of the Cuban issue had other consequences. It meant that
the Western Hemisphere should not be an area of conflict between the U.S.S.R.
and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It should be left to itself, and no attempt should be made by the U.S.S.R. to
establish Communism there by her direct or indirect military effort. This was a
great gain to the easing of world tension and to the cause of peace. It also
created the hope that the U.S.S.R. would not embark in future on a policy of
adventurism, a policy on the pursuit of which Communist China is so keen. There
was also the further hope that other international issues–<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Berlin</st1:place></st1:State>, the <span class=GramE>Nuclear</span>
test ban and general disarmament–which have divided the two great powers might
also be peacefully settled. That there is some ground for such a hope, is
brought out by the private talks that are now going on between the
representatives of the two States on the subject of the nuclear test ban, on
which no agreement was possible in the Eighteen Nation Geneva Conference, even
though it had been debating on it since March last. There are many indications
to show that the two great powers are coming closer together, and this creates
the prospect of a reduction in the tempo of the cold war between them. It is in
this sense that the Cuban </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>settlement may become the starting point
of a new stage in the history of international affairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the whole, Premier <span class=SpellE>Khruschchev</span> appears to be in a
more chastened mood. Not that he has abandoned the ideal of World Communism. No
Marxist-Leninist would do so, and least of all Premier Khrushchev. He continues
to be a staunch believer in Marxism-Leninism which says that, in the
predetermined historical process, Capitalism is bound to collapse and die and
Communism is bound to triumph. He, however, does not believe in war, or even in
a threat of war, being an effective instrument in achieving the objective of
World Communism in this nuclear age. As <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>
has shown, the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is prepared to answer the threat of a nuclear war by an equally strong
counter-threat. Such threats and counter-threats result only in armament race,
which-is proving prohibitively costly even to a rich country like the <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>. Even economic aid to non-aligned countries
may not lead to the spread of World Communism. No recipient of Soviet aid has
so far taken to Communism. A balance-sheet of the gains and losses of
Communism, after the close of the Second World War, shows that no new country
has become Communistic through the efforts of Soviet Russia. From all this,
Premier Khrushchev seems to have come to the conclusion that no great purpose
is served by adhering to a policy of keeping up world tensions in the name of
World Communism and that it would be best to ease them, so that he may
concentrate his efforts on increasing the production of consumers’ goods in his
country and raise the standard of living of his people. War and threat of war
necessitate the concentration of the nation’s effort and capital on heavy
industries and on industries producing defensive and offensive weapons. What the
soviet citizens are now asking <span class=GramE>for,</span> is more and better
food, clothing, house-room, boots and shoes and other ordinary comforts of
life. It is in the direction of providing these things that Premier <span
class=SpellE>Krushchev’s</span> mind has been working for some years, and if this
objective is to be achieved, the principle of peaceful co-existence should be
given a practical shape. This is the key to an understanding of the
conciliatory policy which he has adopted in respect of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Communism
can, according to his present view, be made more attractive to the world if
Soviet Russia shows by her example that under her system the people’s standard
of living can be raised. At the last meeting of the Soviet Parliament he went
to the extreme of saying that there is much which Soviet Russia can learn from
capitalist countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This peaceful settlement of the Cuban issue is also
responsible for widening the ideological rift between <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
and <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
has accused Premier <span class=SpellE>Krushchev</span> of abandoning Marxist
orthodoxy and following a policy of what it calls modern revisionism. It has
ridiculed him for becoming frightened by the American paper-tiger though he has
<span class=SpellE>rewinded</span> it that the paper-tiger possesses nuclear
teeth and taunted it for not having the courage to direct its war-effort against
<st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Hongkong</span></st1:City>, <st1:State
w:st="on">Macao</st1:State> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Formosa</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In the Communist Party Congresses, held in recent weeks in <st1:City w:st="on">Bucharest</st1:City>
and <st1:City w:st="on">Rome</st1:City>, <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
was hotly denounced by almost all the European Communist parties for her
war-mongering. Since then, the ideological battle is being fought with greater
ferocity on either side. <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
is against Soviet Russia extending any aid to non-aligned countries like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. She
wants that whatever aid the U. S. S. R. and the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">East</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">European</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Communist</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">States</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
are in a position to render, should be rendered only to her. The rift has now
become so wide that Soviet Russia has withdrawn all her technicians from <st1:country-region

<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has been stopped. Trade between Communist Europe and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> has dwindled. All this goes
to show that the ideological conflict has invaded the economic and the
political field. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is, however, difficult to foresee the
consequences of this growing rift. If <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> becomes completely separated
from the European Communist fold, there is a possibility of her pursuing her
policy of adventurism without any kind of restraint and endanger the cause of
world peace to a far greater extent than she is able to do at present. There is
also the possibility that, in such a situation, there may be a sort of <span
class=SpellE>reapproachment</span> between the Soviet bloc and the Western
alliance against Chinese expansionism. But all this is a distant possibility.
If, on the other hand, the European Communists succeed in bringing round <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> to their
point of view, the less rigid and the more liberal outlook which now <span
class=SpellE>characterises</span> the policy of Premier <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Krushehev</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> may come to
prevail in the whole Communistic world, and this may help the easing of world
tension. But even this seems to be a remote possibility. What we can now say is
that the rift between <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> and <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> which has become widened as a result of the Cuban
crisis is bound to have considerable amount of influence, in one way or
another, on the course of international affairs in the coming years.<span

less rigid policies that are being pursued by Premier <span class=SpellE>Krushchev</span>
have also produced some effect on the Western alliance and the NATO, though
this effect may not be solely due to those policies. There is now less
willingness to accept the leadership of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United

 w:st="on">Europe–especially</st1:City> <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
There is also a large amount of resentment in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
on the ground that in the <span class=SpellE>skybolt</span> affair she has been
completely let down by the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. At the same time, President Kennedy
is determined to more effectively assert his own country’s leadership in the
Western alliance. In the Cuban affair, and on several other matters, he has not
cared to consult his European allies. In <st1:country-region w:st="on">Congo</st1:country-region>
he has been pursuing a policy to which there is a large amount of opposition in
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But the
Western allies are too weak to do anything against him and the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
They may be able to make their influence felt to a greater extent if the
question of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
entry into the Common Market is settled amicably and rapidly; but, owing to the
opposition of President De Gaulle and, to some extent, of Chancellor Adenauer,
all sorts of <span class=GramE>obstacles,</span> are being placed in the way of
this settlement. What these leaders are anxious about is to come closer
together and to create a sort of federal union in Western Europe into which
they are not anxious to admit <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>

is too soon to say what will be the likely effects of the Chinese invasion of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> on the
course of international affairs. The unilateral cease fire and the subsequent
withdrawal of the Chinese forces from NEFA have created a puzzle. It has become
difficult to guess what could have been their original objective in undertaking
the massive attack on NEFA unless it <span class=GramE>be</span> to inflict a
humiliation on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Of course there is the interpretation that its purpose was to bring heavy
pressure on the Government of India to agree to come to the conference table
and arrive at a final settlement of the border issue so far as <span
class=SpellE>Ladakh</span> is concerned. But they have not so far succeeded in
this. The Government of India has made it clear that it is not prepared to
enter into any parleys with the Peking Government unless the Chinese withdraw
to the line as it was before Sept. 7, 1962<i> </i>when the massive attack
began. In this situation, what is it that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is going to do? Will she
resume her attack for which she seems to be preparing? Reports from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tibet</st1:place></st1:country-region> indicate
that she is concentrating a large part of her troops there. Is all this a
prelude to a second massive invasion? Will she stop this time–whether it <span
class=GramE>be</span> in the middle sector or the eastern sector–at the foot of
the hills or enter the plains and start a major war? If she does so, <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> will have
to enter into a closer alliance with the West. She cannot fight a major war
with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
single-handed. She cannot also look for much help to Soviet Russia. In spite of
the growing ideological rift between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the former will not go to the extent of aiding militarily a non-communist
country in a war with a communist country. This is the reason why, in a major
war or a long </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>war with <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>

next question is, <span class=GramE>What</span> is the extent of the help that
the West–especially the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>–is
prepared to render to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in such a war, and what conditions will it impose before granting such aid?
Will the United States insist on India making a free gift of Kashmir to
Pakistan on the ground that, from the point of view of military strategy, the
sub-continent of India and Pakistan forms a single unit? Will Pakistan be
satisfied with this or demand other territorial and other concessions as a
condition of American aid to India? These are all questions which have to be answered
before one can say how the international situation is likely to be affected by
the Chinese aggression on India. There is no space here to answer them. We must
take another occasion to do it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
point, however, may be made clear even at this stage. The United States will be
making a great mistake if she, in any way, links up her aid to<i> </i>India
with India granting concessions to Pakistan. Pakistan does not regard China as
the common enemy of India and herself. Moreover, in recent months she has been
coming closer to China, which makes it doubtful whether she will, at any time,
undertake a War against that country in <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of
India. She has also been threatening to leave the CENTO and the SEATO military
pacts. She has sent missions to all the countries of the West to persuade them
not to extend any military aid to India. Under these circumstances, no purpose
will be served by the United States bringing pressure or India to accede to the
demands of Pakistan. She cannot be relied upon to fight with China. Moreover,
it has all along been the policy of the United States to contain Chinese
Communism. India is now prepared to fight China whole-heartedly. There is thus
a larger amount of common interest between India and the United States than
between Pakistan and the United States. It will be the path of wisdom for the
United States to extend to India all the aid that she needs in her war with
China. Her foreign policy, as well as the foreign policy of India, should be
reoriented to achieve this objective. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

unique nature of the civil war must be appreciated. Never before in recent
times have a majority of the population of a country taken up arms demanding
secession after the<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>ir </span>constitutional
efforts to wrest home rule have been ruthlessly crushed and their leaders
humiliated, arrested and slaughtered. The people of East Pakistan constitute
54% of the country’s <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>population </span>and
the spontaneity of the uprising can no longer be questioned. The President
Yahya Khan is not able to rope in even a handful of Awami League
representatives to join a puppet civil administration in the eastern wing

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Besides
this moral aspect of the claim, the movement has behind it the legitimising
force of the general election conducted by the military regime itself. The
Awami League under Sheik Mujibur Rehman’s leadership and with a Six point
Programme as its manifesto fought the elections winning an unprecedented
victory in which it gained 160 of the 162 seats that the eastern region was
allotted in the 300 member National Constituent Assembly. It will be recalled
that it was Yahya Khan’s refusal to summon the Constituent Assembly to session
that led to the succession of events starting with Mujibur Rehman’s call for
non-violent civil disobedience and culminating in the ghastly tragedy of civil
war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Six point Programme of the Awami League is as follows: (1) The Constitution
should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in the true sense and for a
parliamentary form of government. (2) The Federal Government should deal with
only two subjects–defence and foreign affairs, with all residuary subjects
vested in the federating states. (3) There should be either two separate freely
convertible currencies for the two wings or one currency with two separate
reserve banks to prevent inter-wing flights of capital. (4) The power of
taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the states. The Federal
Government will receive a share to meet its financial obligations. (5) Economic
disparities between the two wings shall disappear through a series of economic,
fiscal and legal reforms. (6) A militia or para-military force must be created
in East Pakistan. These are indeed extreme demands and the concept of a strong
and united Pakistan will certainly be jeopardised if these are accepted. Hence
one can understand President Yahya Khan’s misgivings in acceding to them. Obviously
even Sheik Mujibur Rehman must have regarded these as negotiable, formally
insisting on all points to gain better bargaining position. But it must be
stated that this programme of the Awami League was not new and it was actually
formulated as early as February 12, 1966. For five years this party rallied the
people round this programme and finally obtained an overwhelming mandate from the
people of East Bengal. Never during these five years did the military regime
condemn the programme as seditious. Even more important is the point that Sheik
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Mujibur<i> </i></span>Rehman did not
at any time–not even during his civil disobedience campaign or during his <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>talks with </span>Yahya Khan–demand
secession. This demand, on the contrary, was the effect of unprovoked military
crack down on <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the Awami </span>League
and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>its </span>supporters and the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>merciless punitive </span>action taken
against them to avenge <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the </span>massive
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>political </span>defeat suffered by <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>General </span>Yahya Khan. The civil war was
thus the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>result </span>of the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>blood </span>bath perpetrated by the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>West </span>Pakistani <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>leadership </span>upon the <span

</span>perfidy of the President <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>refusing

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>constructively </span>endorsed the <span

any one <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in this co</span>untry, <span

more <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>culpable </span>because of its
direct bearing on Pakistan’s military <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>potential.
</span>The State Department has without a moment’s hesitation and compunction <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>held it to </span>be an internal affair of
Pakistan. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>It </span>took an <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>unconscionably long time </span>for Washington
even <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>realise what that was going
on in the eastern region was not a mere rebellion incited by a few irresponsible
separatists but a national uprising, the suppression of which is entailing the
physical occupation of the region by a substantial section of the Pak army. The
brutality with which the ill-armed partisans and the unarmed civilians are
dealt with seemed to have only slightly moved Pakistan’s arms suppliers. Thus
came out the statement from the State Department, that since the start of the
civil war all the arms shipments are cancelled. But then shipments are in fact
reaching Pakistan. The State Department’s explanation was that these must have
been weapons and spare parts already in the ‘pipeline’ i.e., those whose supply
was cleared before the start of the civil war though actual release of stock
might have occurred after that date. Strangely enough, the State Department
pleads its inability to assure that further supplies of arms would not be
released by the Defence Department. As recently as on July 9th, a State
Department spokesman admitted “that more U. S. military equipment worth
millions of dollars may be shipped to Pakistan despite a ban ordered by the U.
S. Government” (Reuter report, “The Statesman,” July 10, 1971). And it is not
uncommon in the U. S. for the Pentagon to pursue its own ‘foreign policies’
unconcerned with the commitments entered into by the State Department. A close
look at the explanation reveals that far from trying to close loop-holes for
the trickling of military hardware to Pakistan, the State Department was trying
to keep them open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is more than confirmed from yet another enigmatic revelation that it is not as
though the State Department was incapable of preventing the Defence Department
from delivering further materials. Witness this statement of an American official
as reported by Associated Press: “A single State Department telephone call to
the customs authorities could stop further U.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>S.
military shipments to Pakistan. There was no such stop order now.” Now, this
statement meant that it was deliberate U. S. policy at this time to go on
trickling military aid to General Yahya Khan’s autocratic regime. And why? The
specific answer is contained in the State Department’s letter of May 8, to
Senator Fulbright Chairman of the Senate’s Foreign Relations committee: “The
continuing military supply programme...continues to be an important element in
our overall bilateral relationship with Pakistan.” And: “It would, therefore,
appear desirable for the U. S. to be able to continue to supply limited
quantities of military items to Pakistan to enable us both to maintain a
constructive bilateral political<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>dialogue
and to help insure that Pakistan is not compelled to rely increasingly on other
sources of supply.” <i>(International Herald Tribune, </i>June 24, 1971) While
the candour is praiseworthy, the priority accorded to the goal of keeping Pindi
out of others’ embraces over the humanitarian consideration of keeping arms out
of Pindi’s reach is worse than cynical. Or perhaps Washington is just opposed
to an independent Bangla Desh. Known for their penchant for perspective
planning, the policy makers in Washington might have concluded that a free Bangla
Desh would be a sitting duck for the Chinese to bag. American commitment to the
containment of communism has at most times been stronger than its commitment to
democracy, notwithstanding the implications of the projected Nixon visit to
Peking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Russians have shown a little more of concern. At the start, Kosygin strongly
urged Yahya Khan to seek a political settlement. However, subsequently even the
Kremlin’s concern got quite muted in its expression. There have been reports
that the Russians are also continuing their supplies to Pakistan though these
have been vigorously denied. It should be realised that the Russians too have a
vested interest in not alienating Pindi because they are also eager not to
drive Pakistan into Peking’s fold. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
brings us to the Chinese attitude. It is a notorious example of cynical
disregard of all ‘revolutionary’ norms that they should support Pakistan
wholeheartedly dismissing the whole human tragedy as an internal affair. For
this various explanations can be suggested. Firstly, there is the anti-Indian
dimension. A free Bangla Desh under the Awami League would mean a pro-Indian
development. But, this perspective alone does not sufficiently explain Peking’s
stand. Secondly, there is the view that Peking’s policy aims at profiting under
either of the circumstances resulting out of the situation. If, because of
great power silence and international indifference, the civil war goes in Pindi’s
favour then, obviously, Peking by its support will have earned Pakistan’s
eternal gratitude. On the contrary, in the event of Bangla Desh emerging successful,
Peking might be banking upon the eventual drift of new unit into the Chinese
ideological fold. The Chinese in their supreme confidence in their own analysis
might have reckoned that the extremist-radical forces under Maulana Bhashani
would over the present bourgeoise Bangla Desh leadership. China may be
calculating on having the best of both bargains–that of retaining Pindi’s
gratitude while being fairly sure of grabbing Bangla Desh. Now, if this
interpretation of the Chinese motive is correct then certainly Peking made a gross
miscalculation in reckoning without Maulana Bhashani’s patriotism. For, as it turned
out the Maulana not only identified himself with the Bangla Desh struggle but
revealed his disenchantment with the Heavenly Beings in Peking. Not only has
the Maulana identified himself with the struggle for Bangla Desh but parties
far more pro-Chinese than himself have formed into a liberation group pledged
to work in coordination with the Mukti Fauz which is dominated by the Awami
League. So much for the so-called contradictions between the supporters of
Bangla Desh and the extreme radicals. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>A
</span>third explanation can also be suggested. In all probability China looks
at the future of Asia in terms of a power equation between herself and Russia
and is keen on relying on Pakistan’s support. The prospect of an American
withdrawal from South East Asia makes the Sino-Soviet rivalry more intense. In
this, having concluded that India would play the role of a Soviet client state,
the Chinese are determined to retain Pakistan as their own client. But there
are also analysts who hold that the prospect of active Chinese support for
Pakistan was exaggerated. One scholar; for example, analysed Premier Chou En
Lai’s letter to President Yahya Khan and found that while Chou assured Pakistan
that in the event of Indian ‘aggression’ China will “as always fully support”
Pakistan in its “struggle to safeguard state sovereignty and national

Deshingkar in <i>Sunday Statesman, </i>July 11, 1971.) The author also stresses
the point that the Chou letter nowhere assured China’s support for the ‘territorial
integrity’ of Pakistan. While the last point seems to be rather far-fetched in
view of Chou’s assurances to Pakistan’s sovereignty and national independence,”
yet it seems probable that China never contemplated active involvement in the
sub-continent. Perhaps Indian calculations were based on an obsession about the
Chinese intentions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

responses of the Middle Eastern countries are even more callous to the plight
of the East Pakistanis. Countries like Turkey and Iran have always been
notoriously partisan towards Pakistan. That the Arab countries, particularly
the radical ones, should remain unmoved is indeed tragic though, many would
say, not unexpected. Their radicalism invariably vanished before considerations
of Islamic blood-ties. Not only have they failed to administer caution to Pakistan,
but even a token word of sympathy for the plight of the refugees, is not
forthcoming, Coming from countries who beat their breasts and vail about the
tragedy of a million and a half of Palestinian refugees, this behaviour
represents the height of political self-seeking. Egypt’s behaviour is most

For the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>law </span>relating to recognition
is vague affording only general guidelines for recognition of secessionist

Desh does not make the grade. State practices, however, vary and in many

as sufficient to gain recognition. In effect, thus, it very depends whether ‘important’
states recognise a new state. In fact there are cases where new states got
recognised, even when the secessionist movements were very weak simply because
big powers chose to detach a part of a country to confer oh it statehood. <span

can India’s role stop at mere recognition. The emotional involvement of West
Bengal and the indignation felt all over the country at the carnage in Bangla
Desh raise the moral issue of intervention. After all, the talk of recognition
has relevance only as means to legitimise material support for Bangla Desh. But
the frustrating fact is that we are not in a position to extend such material
support. For one thing, overt aid to the Mukti Fauz is bound to be
counter-productive. In the absence of a lead from others. India’s action while
being insufficient to tilt the military balance in the area, would only help
convert the moral issue of Bangla Desh into an Indo-Pakistani issue. The
projection of the ghastly event as an Indo-Pakistani conflict would bring in
its train the familiar nuances of greater power stances with Pakistan getting
the benefit of doubt. Pakistan would most certainly welcome any such opportunity
to down the role of a victim of Indian collusion and aggression. Viewed thus
India could not concede to Pindi a better diplomatic victory than by
recognising and intervening in Bangla Desh. It is thinking more or less on
these lines that is probably inhibiting Indian policy. But, of course, there is
criticism that India’s inhibitions were borne out of pusillanimity. Some point
out that at the start of the civil war, Pakistan had barely two divisions in

<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>tie down h</span>er troops i<span

the economic implications augur even worse. The housing and feeding of

staggering commitments. Our commitment comes to 70 lakhs a day counting at the
rate of a rupee a day per person! If one realises that this estimate does not
include overheads like expenditure on housing facilities and administrative and
medical services, the gross Indian commitment would easily reach the figure of
a crore of rupees every day! This figure can be cross-checked with the
estimates of the U. N. High Commissioner for refugees according to whom 400
million dollars are needed for the next six months. This would mean a monthly
bill of 50 crores of rupees. Even on the assumption that this estimate includes
aid for sufferers within Bangla Desh areas, it is still safe to conclude that
the cost of maintaining the refugees on Indian soil alone is not less than a
crore a day. It is sad irony that India is obliged to spend almost as much on
maintaining the six million victims of Pakistani aggression as the latter is spending
in maintaining the instruments of aggression in Bangla Desh. For, the
Associated Press Correspondent, Mort Rosenbaum, estimated that Pakistan is
spending 1.5 crores of rupees a day to keep its armed forces in the eastern

is this situation that provides the occasion for current speculation about a
review of Indian policy. Leaving aside question of rallying round to the cause
of Bangla Desh, we cannot allow the situation to drift along as at present. We
cannot simply take any more of refugees nor feed for much longer the present ones.
In this situation what other effective alternative is open to the Government
but to ‘intervene’ and bring about the emergence of a political situation that
would stop refugee influx and even lead to the early return of the existing
refugees. Perhaps, these four months of Pakistani repression served to expose
the real nature of the Pakistani regime even to the blinkered eyes of her ‘friends.’
A new Indian initiative in recognising Bangla Desh might set the trend for others
to follow. This is the considered view of people like Jayaprakash Narayan.
Judging from the impact of the events on the public opinions of many of the
countries a recognition by India is not likely to be construed as motivated by
anti-Pakistani considerations. State practice recognised intervention for
self-defence, in the interests of humanitarian grounds and in stray instances
for removal of international nuisance. In 1898, the U. S. itself intervened in
neighbouring Cuba on the plea that Spain’s inability to control its rebelling
colony and its adopting repressive measures of particularly arduous nature
constituted a nuisance. Though this instance is no longer held to be good law,
the Bangla Desh events represent a combination of almost all the ‘grounds’ for
intervention. The ramifications of the refugee problem impinge upon India’s
internal security, the mass killings constitute a mass burial of human rights
and an indefinite extension in time of the carnage is worse than an
international nuisance. There is enough justification for intervention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

did recognise the enormity of the burden India is bearing single-handed. He
announced to the Economic and Social Council meeting in Geneva that world aid
now totaled less than 200 million dollars, whereas for the coming six months at
least 400 millions are needed to feed and house the refugees. Thus leaving
alone the prospect of reimbursing India for the sums it spent so far, the

ruled out. Though people like Arthur Bottomley suggest that Yahya Khan can have
no option but to release the Sheik and negotiate with him–it would seem that
this is un realistic. Equally impossible is the solution of genocide now being
implemented by Yahya Khan. The installation of a civil government, representing
the people–and this should naturally include such of the Awami League leaders
as could be persuaded to join–with full powers of home rule (at least as a
temporary measure) to make its role of reconciliation credible, should be the
first step. The question of the convening of a new Constituent Assembly and the
finalisation of the political system can be considered only after the
reconciliation regime had time to do its job. The situation has become so
bitter that it is doubtful whether even a few Awami League members can be found
at all to join any other civilian government but that of a free Bangla Desh. If
some one is found, it is doubtful whether he would retain the confidence of the
people. It is inevitable that Pakistan should negotiate with as many of the
Awami League leaders as are prepared to try reconciliation, though they may
till now have been supporters of Bangla Desh. To them must be entrusted the
task of rehabilitating other leaders. Of course, it is doubtful, if the
front-rank leadership will ever join the scheme. But till some way is found to
bring in, at least, a respectable number of Awami Leaguers and they on their
part giving up their free Bangla Desh stand–there could be no political
solution. This would mean such a terrible sacrifice and a supreme act of
forgiveness on the part of much of the Bangla Desh leadership–that normally
cannot be expected. Still that remains the only hope. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the final analysis a substantial part of the demands of Sheik Mujibur Rehman
will have to be conceded and in return the concept of Bangla Desh will have to
be given up. Short of either of the extremes this seems to be the only way out.
In short an autonomous though not free Bangla Desh of Sheik’s dreams will have to
materialise. That this would be the case without the Sheik participating in it
is a great pity. But such is the fate that history often times decrees to its
heroes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

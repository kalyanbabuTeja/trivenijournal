the working of parliamentary democracy in India during the first twenty-five
years no serious departures were made from the New Constitution. However,
during the past three or four years it has been subjected to constitutional
convulsions. The recent 42nd Amendment<sup>1</sup> has brought about
significant changes both in the letter and spirit of our parliamentary
democracy. It contains 59 clauses covering the entire Constitution, from the preamble
to the Seventh Schedule. Even the Constitution of the U. S. A. contains only 84
clauses. It must be said that the 42nd Amendment is not a mere amendment to the
Constitution; it has practically given a new Constitution to India. This becomes
all the more significant for two reasons. In the first place, all the
opposition parties boycotted and did not participate in the Lok Sabha on the
discussion over the Amendment Bill. The amendments proposed by the Pro-Congress
opposition parties like the C. P. I. and ADMK were summarily rejected. The C.
P. I. (M) questioned the competence of the parliament to pass the 42nd
Amendment bill and suggested that it may be referred to a new Constituent
Assembly formed by direct election under proportional representation. The other
opposition parties like the Congress (O), Socialists and Jan Sangh expressed
the view that parliament which had completed its five-year tenure should not
bring about far-reaching changes in the Constitution; the subject should be
referred to the newly-elected parliament. Eminent jurists like Sri Palkhivala
asserted that the parliament has no right to change the basic principles of the
Constitution. The 42nd Amendment is purely the work of the Congress party. The
second noteworthy point is that a major amendment to the Constitution was brought
about when two emergencies were under operation. The Prime Minister no doubt
called for a national debate on the Amendment Bill. But in view of the
restrictions imposed on the freedom of the press and suspension of Fundamental
Rights the climate for a free and fearless debate was not at all favourable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Fifth General Elections to the Lok Sabha marked a turn in the tide in the
history of our parliamentary democracy. The first twenty-three amendments made
during 1951 to 1971 were largely in the nature of general amendments which did
not violate the spirit of the Constitution; but those made during the last six
years (1971-1977) were something more than mere amendments. They have changed
the basic features of the Constitution and turned our parliamentary democracy
into a shell without substance. Erosion of fundamental rights, subordination of
the judiciary to parliament and growth of executive power are the guiding
principles in bringing about changes in the Constitution. The 42nd Amendment is
the culmination of the new trend started by the 24th Amendment. The judgement
of the Allahabad High Court invalidating the election of Mrs. Indira Gandhi and
the violent and massive demonstrations held under the leadership of the
opposition leaders like Sri Jayaprakash Narayan against Mrs. Indira Gandhi
Government, served as the last straw on the camel’s back. But for these
occurrences the 42nd Amendment would not have been passed during the Emergency.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
objectives of the Amendment are viewed differently by the Congress and by the
opposition parties. Mr. H. R. Gokhale, the then Union Law Minister, said that “the
Constitution has to be revamped to expressly spell out the high ideals of
socialism, secularism and democracy.” Stating that the 42nd Amendment is “the
biggest of all Amendments” the Law Minister explained that it is “aimed at
removing obstacles to a socio-economic revolution that would end poverty and
ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity.” Further, the Amendment aims
at giving priority to the Directive Principles over the Fundamental Rights. The
opponents of the Amendment contended that it “aims at altering or destroying
the basic structure of the Constitution.” The Amendment is intended (1) to
overthrow the supremacy of the Constitution and instal parliament as the
supreme authority, (2) to enact that the Fundamental Rights will no longer be
justiciable, (3) and to enforce laws which are held unconstitutional by a
majority of the judges in the Supreme Court or High Court. Mr. H. V. Kamath
observed that this is “neither amending nor mending but ending the
Constitution.” While the passing of the Amending Act was hailed as the “finest
hour” by Mr. H. R. Gokhale, it was described by Mr. Shibban Lal Saxena as the “darkest
hour.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

clauses in the 42nd Amendment Act can be broadly divided into two parts–the
socio-economic part and the political part. The first twelve clauses dealing
with the Preamble, Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental
Duties are concerned with the socio-economic changes and the rest of the
clauses dealing with the President, Council of Ministers, Parliament, the
Supreme Court, State Executive, State Legislature, High Court, relations
between the Union and the States, the Civil Service and transfer of subjects
are concerned with political changes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
study of the clauses in the Amendment shows that certain changes like creation
of special tribunals, proclamation of emergency in a part of India, and transfer
of education from the State List into the Concurrent List are quite
commendable. But there are certain clauses which have undoubtedly brought about
basic changes in the Constitution of our parliamentary democracy. These changes
make India more a socialist than a democratic republic. In the Preamble which
forms an integral part of the Constitution, significant additions are made by
adding the words “socialist” and “secular.” India is described as a “Sovereign
Socialist Secular Democratic Republic.” According to the noted constitutional
lawyer, Mr. Nani A. Palkhivala, “Preamble is a part of the Constitution but not
the statute and Article 368 deals only with an Amendment of the Constitution
but not the constitution statute.” Apart from the constitutional validity or
otherwise of the change, while the inclusion of the word “secular” is quite
redundant, the term “socialist” may prove dangerous to parliamentary democracy.
In the Constituent Assembly the term “socialist” was rejected after lengthy
discussion for two reasons. Firstly, the basic principles of socialism like
equality and social welfare are implicit in the term democracy. Democracy today
means socialist democracy, for rugged individualism does not exist in any country.
So the word “socialist” is quite redundant, Secondly, it is a “dangerously
ambiguous” word. “Socialism,” in the words of Edmund Kelly, “is too vast a
subject to be brought within the four corners of anyone definition.” This led
Ramsay Muir to remark that “Socialism is a chameleon-like creed. It changes its
colour according to its environment.” The units in the Soviet Union are
described as Socialist Republics. Now India is described as a Socialist
Republic and no wonder if in future India becomes less democratic and more
socialist in nature. Another much publicised word in the post-independence era
is “integrity.” Communalism and regionalism which caused serious riots in the
country, led to the formation of National Integration Council. For the words “unity
of the nation,” the words “unity and integrity of the nation” are substituted.
After all, the meaning of the word “integrity” is implied in the word “unity.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Fundamental
Rights, especially those stated in Articles 14, 19 and 31, form the footnotes
to the nature of our parliamentary democracy. They were already scissored by
the earlier Amendments to the Constitution and now the 42nd Amendment reduces
the rights of Equality, Freedom and Property to a shadow without substance.
Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 13 of the Constitution, no law
providing for the prevention or prohibition of anti-national associations or
preventing the formation of or the prohibition of anti-national associations,
shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with Articles
14, 9 and 31. “Anti-national activity” is described to signify not only as one
intended at secession of any part of the territory in India from the Union or
intended to disrupt harmony between different religions, racial language or
regional groups but also overthrowing the Government by force or creating
internal disturbance. The above description indicates that in the name of
anti-national activities a party having no faith in the philosophy of
Fundamental Rights may after coming into power, take any unfair action on any
individual or association. Clause 5 in the Amendment Act reminds us of Section
12 in the Government of India Act, 1935, dealing with the Special
Responsibilities of the Governor-General. As “internal disturbance” is not
clearly defined in our Constitution, emergency could be continued even at the
time of conducting general elections to Lok Sabha. No doubt the authors of the
Constitution used the words “internal disturbance” along with the words “external
aggression” in Article 352, in the sense that the former should be as grave as
the later. But this has been ignored. Mr. C. K. Daphtary, former Attorney-General
remarked, “he feared that measures to be taken against anti-national activities
might ultimately boil down to preventive detention”.<sup>2</sup> In fact an
amendment to the Constitution is not warranted to prevent anti-national
activities. Under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, as amended in
1972, the Government can effectively check dangerous activities. So abridgement
of Fundamental Rights which are of crucial importance for the functioning of
our democratic institutions amounts to cutting at the very root of the
democratic structure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

significant clauses are added to the Directive Principles of State Policy. With
a view to provide equal opportunities in securing justice a new clause is
inserted after Article 39 in the Constitution according to which the statute
shall “provide free legal aid...to ensure that opportunities for securing
justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other
disabilities. “This arrangement attains value only if rule of law is upheld in
the country. Clause 9 in the Amendment Act provides for workers’ participation
in the management of industry. Democracy in industry is not a new concept
though it is found more in precept than in practice in most of the modern
democracies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
working of parliamentary democracy in India during the last quarter of a
century has revealed that by and large people have grown more rights-minded
than duty-minded. It is a political truism that there can be no rights empty of
duties. In accordance with this principle at the end of Part IV of the
Constitution, Fundamental Duties are incorporated (Part IV-A). Clause 11 in the
Amendment Act deals with ten duties, viz., (1) to show respect for the ideals
of the Constitution and National Flag and National Anthem, (2) to cherish and
follow the noble ideals which inspired Our national struggle for freedom, (3)
to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India, (4) to
defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so, (5)
to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people
of India, (6) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture,
(7) to protect and improve the natural environment, (8) to develop the
scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform, (9) to
safeguard public property and to abjure violence and (10) to strive towards
excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity. Through this
charter of Fundamental Duties the Congress Government proposed to change the attitude
and thinking of the people and bring about a peaceful revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
incorporation of duties in our Constitution is of doubtful value for three
reasons. Firstly, there is really no need for separately mentioning duties, for
they are already present in the various restrictions imposed on each Fundamental
Right. “In Part III the Constitution guarantees rights to people in words as
generous as those in the American Constitution in an opening clause, only to
take away all security for these rights by exceptions and saving clauses which
leave precious little residue of the right, whether it is of personal liberty,
of free association or any other right”.<sup>3</sup> As A. G. Noorani pointed
out, “our Constitution already provides for the citizen’s duties by spelling
out precisely the restrictions to which each of the Fundamental Rights is
subject”.<sup>4</sup> For a second reason also the insertion of duties is quite
redundant. Duties like national and military service, payment of taxes or
protection of public property are already covered by the statute. As far as
respect for the national flag and national anthem is concerned there are
already the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, on the statute
under which a person who insults the flag or prevents singing the national
anthem can be punished with imprisonment for three years or with fine or with
both. All Municipal Acts in the country have provisions to prevent pollution of
water. Parliament also has enacted the Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution
Act, 1974. For the protection of wild life, The Wild Life (Protection) Act,
1972, has been passed.<sup> 5</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thirdly,
most of the duties that are enumerated are vaguely worded. They need more
precise definition. For example, “showing respect to the ideals of our
Constitution” is a very loose expression, for even those who are dictatorial in
their behaviour swear by democracy and secularism. It is still more difficult
to prove communal bias. “In certain localities of metropolitan cities landlords
fight shy of letting out their premises to a Muslim or a Harijan. How does one
make out a case against such communalists”? <sup>6</sup> Development of
scientific temper is mentioned as one of the duties, for people in India are
obsessed by superstition, blind faith in certain religious Customs and beliefs.
But can this outlook of the people be changed by a constitutional amendment
especially when more than 70 per cent of the people are illiterate? “Striving
for excellence” is defined as a duty. But what does it mean? For example, for
an M. L. A. excellence means becoming an M. P., or a minister and for a
minister to become a Chief Minister. Thus the duties incorporated in the
Constitution by the 42nd Amendment are redundant and vague. Nor is it necessary
to separately enumerate duties, for rights imply duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

political aspect of the 42nd Amendment lies in upsetting the balance between
the legislative, executive and judicial powers. Our Constitution strikes a
healthy compromise between the British theory of legislative supremacy and the
American theory of judicial Supremacy. The 24th and 25th Amendments eroded the
authority, prestige and position of the Supreme Court and made the parliament supreme.
The 42nd Amendment completed this process of upsetting the balance between the
legislative, executive and judicial powers. Under the party system supremacy of
parliament means supremacy of the cabinet which in its turn means supremacy of
the Prime Minister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
regard to the executive the 42nd Amendment introduced two significant changes
in the Constitution: (1) Article 74 in the Constitution is amended by stating
that the President in discharging his functions shall act on the advice of the Council
of Ministers. What has been done in practice is now put in writing. A
convention is made a law. With this the controversy over the nature of the
Indian Presidency has ended and the President is made a nominal executive. (2)
It is stated that no court can have power to question the rules laid down by
the President for the transaction of Government business. This has nullified
judicial control over the executive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
of the noteworthy changes made in the Constitution of legislatures is that the
tenure of the Lok Sabha and of the State Assemblies is raised to six years. Mr.
Swaran Singh, Chairman of the Constitution Reforms Committee, observed “considering
the size of the country and the continuous process of elections to Parliament,
State Assemblies and Corporations, Municipalities and Panchayats, these things
kept our people preoccupied and exercised over elections all the while. The
Amendment raising the tenure to six years sought to prolong this process”.<sup>
7</sup> In the absence of the system of Recall, extension of tenure to six
years may make the legislators corrupt and autocratic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
most outstanding change brought about by the Amendment is that it has clipped
the wings of the judiciary. It is stated that the question of disqualification
of members of legislature due to corrupt practices in elections shall be
decided by the President and his decision shall be final. In view of clause 13
in the Amendment Act, this would mean that in practice the Prime Minister
arrogates to himself or herself the powers of the Election Commission and of
the judiciary in such matters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With
a view to establish the supremacy of parliament over the judiciary the
following changes are brought about in the functioning and powers of the
Supreme Court and High Courts: (1) The Supreme Court only, and not the High
Courts, shall have the power to determine the constitutional validity of
central laws. Cases relating to the constitutional validity of any central
laws, pending before the High Court shall be referred to the Supreme Court for
its disposal. Or the Supreme Court itself may require the High Court to refer
such questions to it for its disposal. (2) A bench of a minimum of seven judges
of the Supreme Court with 2/3 majority can decide such cases. In the case of a
High Court the minimum is five judges. (3) The High Court’s jurisdiction
conferred by the expression “for any other purpose” in Article 226 of the
Constitution is now deleted. (4) Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and of the
High Courts on certain specified matters including revenue matters is excluded
by the creation of administrative tribunals for that purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

changes in the jurisdiction and functioning of the Supreme Court and High
Courts will not only affect a massive devaluation of the High Court in a State”
but they will also create certain difficulties. By the limitation imposed on the
jurisdiction of the High Courts the load on the Supreme Court will undoubtedly
increase. Moreover, appeals from the administrative tribunals also will lie to
the Supreme Court and this will further add to its load. There is already a
general complaint that undue delay is caused in giving justice and it is
reported that early in 1976 about 10, 357 appeals to the Supreme Court remained
pending. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Justice may also become costly.
For example, if a teacher in Trivandrum is to file an appeal against the order
passed under a Central Act or its Rules at New Delhi, can he afford that?
Moreover, the special majority that is required in both the Supreme Court and
High Court, Mr. Palkhivala remarked, “violates the rudiments of arithmetic.
Neither 2/3 of 7 is a whole number nor 2/3 of 5 is a whole number and a
fraction of a judge cannot vote for or against the validity of a law”.<sup> 8</sup>

of power in the Union Government is the key-note of the 42nd Amendment.
According to clause 43 in the Amendment Act the Union Government is empowered
to send armed forces into any State when there is danger to law and order and
the State Government will not have any control over such armed force. This
clause was strongly opposed in the Lok Sabha by the opposition parties. Replying
to a question who would decide whether a situation was grave or not, Mr.
Gokhale said, “that obviously the Central Government would have to do it.” A
member of the R. S. P. moved an Amendment proposing that the Central Government
should deploy the armed forces only after securing parliament’s approval
through a resolution passed in both Houses by a 2/3 majority. The C. P. I.
members proposed an Amendment seeking to vest in the State Government the
superintendence or Control of the Union forces deployed. Sri Indrajit Gupta
expressed the fear that the Amendment might “vitiate” the principle of State
autonomy. Members of ADMK also demanded that the Central Government should
deploy armed forces only after “due consultation with the State Government.”
The Amendments of the opposition were ruthlessly negatived. State autonomy was
further affected by clause 57 which transferred from the State List to the
Concurrent List subjects like constitution and organisation of all courts
except the Supreme Court and the High Courts, education, weights and measures,
forests and protection of wild animals and birds. A subject like education is
becoming not only costly but, also highly important and as such its transfer to
the Concurrent List is quite welcome. As Mr. Swaran Singh rightly remarked, “there
is an All-India aspect of education to ensure the unity and integrity of the country
and from this point of view this provision is salutary”.<sup> 9</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

political commentators and constitutional pundits observed that the emergency
provisions in our Constitution may undermine our democracy and give rise to
authoritarianism. Their worst fears came true during the last two years of Mrs.
Indira Gandhi’s tenure as Prime Minister. Significantly the indiscreet use of
emergency powers by the Government resulted in the reeling blow given by the
electorate to Mrs. Indira Gandhi in particular and to the Congress party in
general in the VI General Elections to Lok Sabha. The 42nd Amendment further
widened the emergency powers of the Union Government. According to it the
period after which the proclamation of emergency ceases is extended from six months
to one year. Further, any law made by parliament in exercise of the powers of
the State Legislature shall continue idefinitely till altered by the competent
legislature or other authority instead of ceasing to operate one year after the
expiration of emergency. One salutary addition made by the Amendment to the
emergency provisions in our Constitution is that the President is empowered to
proclaim emergency applicable not only for the whole country but also to a part
of the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indira Gandhi proclaimed that the 42nd Amendment was enacted not to weaken the
parliamentary system but to strengthen it. But the provisions in the Amendment
Act belie this conclusion. Devaluation of the judiciary and dominance of the
Union executive which are the prominent features of the Amendment strike at the
very roots of parliamentary democracy. As Earnest Barker remarked “maladies of
maladjustment arise because each institution indulges in institutionalism.
There is no sovereignty of parliament. There is no sovereignty of cabinet or
electorate. No part is sovereign. The one thing sovereign is the whole system
of representation”.<sup> 10</sup> However, justifying the Amendment Act Mr. H.
R. Gokhale remarked: “There is something more Supreme than the Supreme Court
and that is parliament”.<sup> 11</sup> Supremacy of parliament in practice
means cabinet supremacy. As Herold Wilson observed, “in a parliamentary
democracy the checks and balances operate not only as long-term safeguards but
also in one way or another (often unpredictable) almost everyday”.<sup>12</sup>
The great damage caused to our parliamentary democracy by the 42nd Amendment is
that the balance of powers is upset. In view of the devastating defeat faced by
the Congress party in the recent general elections to the Lok Sabha, the damage
that has been done to our democracy by the Amendment Act has to be undone. The
President in his address to the joint session of the two<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>Houses of parliament struck the right note when he stated that a
comprehensive measure will be shortly placed before parliament “to restore the
balance between the people and parliament, parliament and the judiciary, the
judiciary and the executive, the States and the Centre, the citizen and the
Government”.<sup> 13</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is wrong to suggest a clear division between the earlier ‘bad’ <span
class=SpellE>Yeats</span> and the later ‘good’ <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>;
he himself perceived no such division: “I do not remember any development with
that precision”.<sup>1</sup> If divisions are to be made, the whole of <span
class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> career would be filled with <span class=SpellE>criss</span>-cross
lines; he was perpetually learning and renewing himself. The grand fact is the
self-consistency both in ‘error’ and ‘choice.’ The whole of <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span>
earlier achievement needs a reassessment, although Eliot’s compliment, ‘by no
means the least of the pre-Raphaelites’ has done much to encourage a respectful
attitude. But both the compliment and the attitude have not done sufficient
justice to the world-view that motivated <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span>
poetry. Eliot’s compliment on <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> success in the
Poetic Drama has a topical literary context whereas <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span>
motives were derived from a wider life-context. To recreate that unified sensibility
in which arts and professions become one, feeling and thought become one, and
literature becomes at once distinguished and ‘popular’–such was his aim. He
believed that to recreate that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in which <span class=SpellE>Raftery’s</span> song could provoke a young man to
die in the bog of <span class=SpellE>Cloone</span> <span class=GramE>was</span>
his artistic aim. The word ‘Art’ today suffers from a heuristic limitation,–art
as the exclusive creation of the artist, and therefore that wider situation,
which fascinated <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>, in which the aristocracy is <span
class=SpellE>Magian</span> and peasantry imaginative, and both partake a set of
beliefs out of which the artist, the craftsman, and the play-<span
class=SpellE>wright</span>, shape the mighty anonymous <span class=SpellE>artefacts</span>
which do not belong to them alone; which become religion and fairy-tale under
their very nose, strengthened by the collective imagination thus, as poetry
there would be nothing original but everything passionate; this was a new
approach both to art and nationhood. In order to get rid of narrow grooves of
present day critical jargon we will have to indicate <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span>
position, with reservations, thus: <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> stood for
arts’ autonomy, but not individualist art; he believed in a human purpose of
art, but not a socialist purpose. He believed in popular art which did not mean
‘common man’s art’; he believed in obscurity which both peasants and learned
men could understand. This becomes necessary because at the bottom <span
class=SpellE>Yeats</span> demanded a milieu which popular education and
newspapers have destroyed. He condemned the semi-educated; among them he
included professors. These apparent contradictions should be <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> against the background of the yearning for a new
milieu. Scholars knew that in ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> it was so. </span><span
class=GramE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>So much the worse for them that they never thought that any </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>one
could ever have made an attempt to revive this view of life in the modern
context.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Even such a perceptive critic as Peter <span
class=SpellE>Ure</span> tries to create an invidious distinction between <span
class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> ideals by suggesting that <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>
was not averse to popular objective drama, but for <span class=GramE>himself</span>,
he wanted drama to be unpopular, a secret society, the Theatre’s <span
class=SpellE>antiself</span>.<sup> 2</sup> In <span class=SpellE>Yeatsian</span>
parlance both “popular” and “unpopular” are words of the same semantic content,
the first word used in the days of his optimism, the second word in his
“tragic” days. <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> artistic practice was an
attempt on life–and if we have to use two words ‘art’ and ‘life’ in this
sentence, that is because we live in a climate in which the word ‘art’ has a
cooked-up abstractionist meaning about it. Unless we transcend this heuristic
limitation, we will not succeed in assessing the world context of <span
class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> effort. It is interesting to note that according to
<span class=SpellE>Yeatsian</span> statistics the number of people who
understand poetry in illiterate Ireland is about ten thousand; in all the other
English-speaking nations of the world put together, there could just be about
the same number of people who read poetry! And dare anyone refute this? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
literary critic, strictly speaking the historian, stops, short at the
assessment of the situation without engagement. Thanks to the ‘Critic as judge’
theory, a barren period of a fertile period gets an equally disinterested
praise or blame from him, since that is the utmost he can do. So too does, a
mediocre ‘good’ poet. But a poet who would create a new way of life, thought
and art, needs respectful attention beyond the scholarly caution and moderation
when he makes an assessment of his time. It is likely that he knows it better
because he has seen it as a personal problem affecting his creativity in a
day-to-day experience. <span class=GramE>Especially so when he writes in an
alien tongue, which though he has spoken since his birth, has a certain
normative pressure emanating from an alien society, which leads a different
kind of life.</span> In such a case, the engagement becomes two-fold; he has to
assert his loyalty to his national culture,–since his mainspring of inspiration
is from that,–and yet has a hypercritical audience outside the nation; and
within the nation too, because the scholarly readership with its traditions of
conservatism usually has accepted the normative pressure from outside and
thereby strait-jacketed its criteria of judgment. This slavish readership is
the most vocal and unless the poet has set convictions,–‘fanaticism’ as <span
class=SpellE>Yeats</span> himself described it, he is likely to succumb to
these alien norms. If he does, possibly he may succeed as a poet, but he is
doomed as a <i>national </i>poet. With alien norms the nation can not voice
itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a great problem. It is significant that so few English-speaking countries
(with the exception of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>,
for many reasons, and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
thanks to <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>) have contributed authors to English
literature important enough to be part of its central tradition. It is absurd
to suggest lack of talent in these countries. On the contrary, normative
pressure in the form of Good English texts and British Councils have done
enough harm by imposing ever-shifting contemporary norms on people for whom
English is only an acquired tongue, result of which fact has been dismemberment
of talent, wrong evaluation (India is known outside by some of its worst
writers only because of their ‘Good English’) and inferiority complex. The
strange spectacle of Indian writers studying British slang (for whose
edification no one knows) and making a career by it; Stephen <span
class=SpellE>Deduaulus</span> (James Joyce) feeling inferior for having used a
word like ‘<span class=SpellE>Tundish</span>’ used by his own forefathers, only
because an Englishman smiles at it; and a perceptive stylist like Conrad being
branded a foreigner for ever. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
it could be said that English as a respectability is subjected to normative
pressure even inside Britain;–witness the Good English classes there!–It is
also possible to say that some kind of normative pressure becomes necessary to
hold a language together from disintegration, and a chaos of dialects. But even
admitting this, one must insist, as <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> did, that
when the norms themselves are wrong, or incapable of voicing a national culture
and varied sensibility, or incapable of withholding the flowering of genius, or
exercising an inhibitive influence over certain valuable emotional <span
class=SpellE>receptivities</span>, or more, curtailing the possibilities of the
language as a whole by alienating it from its previous cultivation, etc., the
only way out is to protest and to recreate. <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>
fought the battle of the whole English-speaking world (including <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>): but
won a victory for his own nation. The other victories,–(in the form, for
instance, of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> saying
that <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> is its best English poet; of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
admitting it); are yet to be won. Some time ago, a British professor wrote an
article in a magazine meant for teachers in English-teaching countries like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the
title of which was “English as a <span class=SpellE>Behaviour</span> Pattern.”
God forbid that English language–whose destiny, it seems, is to become a medium
of International communication–should dig its own grave by the parochial
advocacy of such Legislators of the Oxford Hump! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> estimate was that
these norms were wrong; these norms were the illegitimate children of the
Renaissance and the Reformation. The Renaissance, although it threw up a Merry
England at its best, reached a <span class=SpellE>gyrative</span> extreme of
subjectivism only to vanish in the dust and smoke of a Puritanical sensibility.
Renaissance had its own murderer accompanying it,–the alien Italianate
influence. Even before that, Chaucer’s mediaeval architectural design had no
mediaeval imagination about it,–being under the Neo-French influence; because
his pilgrims to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canterbury</st1:place></st1:City>
remain pilgrims to the end, not mythical figures. The day of Roland was over.
First came a mixing of cultures. Then <span class=GramE>came</span> Puritanism
which created the Middle Classes. Their cautious, obsequious, polite business
ways brought in a new timid, ‘correct’ impassive style. The dying Merry England
sang its swansong of exuberant wealth, delight in language, delight in <span
class=SpellE>similis</span> and metaphors, for their own sake, a language that
could receive the rant of exuberant personalities like Lear and Richard the
Second; it could receive the extravagant fancy of <span class=SpellE>Donne</span>,
the aristocratic laziness of Spenser’s verse. No such rant or exuberance could
stand without ridicule in the new generation. (<span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span>
estimate is correct because, though he does not mention Dryden, it is clear
that for the same reason, all<i> </i>Dryden’s rant persistently suffers from
anticlimax). In other words, the Dissociation of Sensibility had been complete.
Locke and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Newton</st1:place></st1:City>
set the final seal on this divergence of Emotion and Intellect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
remarkable agreement of <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> estimate with that of
Eliot is evidenced in the following passage: “Here and there, in Blake, in Keats,
in Blunt, in Browning<span class=GramE>,…</span>there is a deep masculine
resonance that comes, I think, from a perfect accord between intellect and
blood lacking elsewhere since the death of <span class=SpellE>Cowley</span>”.
And Eliot accepts </span><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
as the last metaphysical. <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> traces it to Chaucer
himself, interested as he was in Mind, and engaged in the pain of the defeat of
<span class=SpellE>Celticism</span>. Cromwell appears to him not as a tyrant
invader, but much worse, the Puritan Demagogue. The second generation of
puritanical middle classes embraced Locke and Hobbes and bred the generation
that embraced Mill’s Utilitarianism. As this dry <span class=SpellE>unmythical</span>
timid <span class=SpellE>religio</span>-rational mind grew, things began to
exist less for themselves, than for their uses; and commercial competence, <span

eloquence, lack of music, these began to become the ideals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

exactly the same reason. In some of his letters, he denounces some modern poets
as clever journalists. In his public pronouncements, not only is he tolerant
but complimentary. This can not be dismissed as hypocrisy. The praise of Ezra
Pound in his prefatory remarks to his “A Vision” is remarkable. It is a
challenge to Pound’s subconscious mind which dictated to him a poem like “The
Return”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>7</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> which clearly is the
announcement of the return of sages in God’s holy fire!–Could there be anything
more obstinate than that?–So too, after praising poets like T. S. Eliot,–for
whose suffering he showed full sympathy, and after praising them for their
return to philosophy, <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> declares his preference
for Oliver <span class=SpellE>Gogarty</span>.</span><sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
8</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> And there is a meaning in this preference. It
is perfectly legitimate to appreciate the excellence of poets within a certain
genre yet decry the whole genre. In the genre of one’s own preference, it is
possible, there are at present not very able practitioners. Nevertheless they
deserve praise,–not for being as meritorious as poets of the other genre, but
for representing a rare species. <span class=SpellE>Gogarty</span> certainly is
a good poet. Yet the special place he has in <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span>
preferential scheme is because while trying to escape the assassins he jumped
into a river and promised the river two swans if he could escape! “That story
shows the man,–scholar, wit, poet, gay adventurer”. </span><sup><span

To separate the man from the poetry, to separate his voice, his gesture, his
person from his poetry, has been the very basis of morphological objective
ideals in criticism. <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> questions those ideals
themselves. For all we know, he may be right and the practice of four centuries
may be wrong. If this is not wrong, it certainly is wrong to believe that the
poetic practice in Great Britain for three centuries of history has laid down
principles to judge poetry of all kinds in all climes, merely because it is
written in English. Far from that; it has yet to set its<i> </i>own house in
order; it has alienated itself from sensibilities created in its own
cultivation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
the language of prose used by <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> is English
certainly, but with a different emphasis. It is not the tight competent stiff
formal impersonal English of Good English classes. It is an English that
derives from the whole cultivation to which English was subjected. It is
interesting to see what <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> felt he saw in English
spoken by Irish peasants. He says, <span class=SpellE>Synge</span> heard in the
<span class=SpellE>Aran</span> island, “the beautiful English which has grown
up in Irish-speaking districts, and takes its vocabulary from the time of <span
class=SpellE>Malory</span>, and of the translators of the Bible, but its idioms
and its vivid metaphor from Irish”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
The English linguists, till now, have posed the phenomenon of the wearing-out
of words (which become <span class=SpellE>cliches</span> and die out) as a sign
of health; it is possible that such easy wearing-out is a sign of <span
class=SpellE>Anaemia</span>, of both language and life. George Eliot, in her <i>Silas
<span class=SpellE>Marner</span>, </i>refers to the habit of preferring the
word ‘handle’ to ‘haft’, a much more poetic word. Mary Ann in <span
class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span> <i>Mayor of <span class=SpellE>Casterbridge</span> </i>learns
to prefer the phrase “to have indigestion” to the one she knew earlier “to be
hag-ridden”. Words do not always die because of their wearing-out. They die
because attitudes change. Since <span class=SpellE>Yeats’s</span> attitudes
were different, he preferred a vocabulary known to the translators of the
Bible; more than that, as a result of what <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>
called the growth of Abstraction and what T. S. Eliot called the Dissociation
of Sensibility, that wealth of simile, metaphor, gesture, rhyme, pun,
alliteration, which used to delight the Elizabethan audience died out,–because they
could not evoke any response. They appeared superfluous to the earnest Puritan,
the <span class=SpellE>moneyminded</span> merchant, the thrifty middle-class.
Even life was utilitarian, and <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> laughs at the
besetting utilitarianism that made men fall in love so that they may get
children. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the language <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> used was not any special English.
It is futile to search for his Irishisms. It is worse to question whether they
truly represent the English spoken by Irish people. English, though in
contemporaneous use, tends to dismember itself and to impose a partial
cultivation, has immense latent possibilities. It needs only a courageous
genius to use the language or vocabulary of the Bible or Burton or Shakespeare,
and to withstand the normative pressure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

establishment of a secular state in this country is the purpose to which we are
all directing our efforts. It is the vision which has led us on these fifty
years at least and it is what was striven for by Gandhiji, one of the greatest
men of religion of all time, and it is what he died for. But in this corner of
the country the principle is being negatived by those who claim to be

Government of the Madras Province is engaged in pushing through the legislature
an enactment enabling the state to take over the administration of Hindu
Temples and Mathas and the endowments attached to them. The incongruity,–the
irony,–of the secular state guaranteeing private property and securing it
against public control and yet controlling the properties of religious
institutions which, so far as the secular state is concerned, are
private,–pertaining as they do, not to the generality of the citizens of the
state, but to different religious groups of its citizens,–is evidently lost on
the Government. For any but a theocratic state to administer religious
institutions is an endeavour that is not only opposed to principle but is also
fraught with grave mischief to both people and state. This is all the more so
when the control is sought to be confined to the institutions of only one of
the religions of the land,–the Hindu. The danger of the state becoming
Hinduised through the inevitable intimacy of the new relationship between the
state and Hindu institutions is one that cannot but raise anxious forebodings
in the minds of Muslims and Christians. Nor can the converse </span><span

the administration of Hindu religious institutions and their foundations is
sadly in need of complete overhaul is not in dispute. Indeed, the situation is
worse than is even supected. The maladministration has grown in dimensions and
in degree, especially in recent years. Not only are the endowments to temples
now in the unrestrained control of persons whose outlook is purely
secular,–even antipathetic to the spirit of the institutions which the
endowments were intended to support,–but they are also administered with little
regard to economy. The endowments to Mathas are in most cases applied to
purposes which would have shocked the pious founders. If the magnitude of the
mismanagement of the temples is only sensed vaguely by the public and if none
of it is known to the public in detail it is because nothing about any of them
is, under the aegis of the Hindu Religious Endowments Board, now controlling
these institutions, allowed to be published and because all avenues to
information are closed. The Soviet ‘iron curtain’ is child’s play beside this
curtain of bureaucratic secrecy. The grossness of the maladministration of the
endowments to temples goes veiled under devices such as accounts and vouchers
and audit and supervision, but the results of none of them are allowed to reach
the public. No one of the public knows whether all the rituals are performed or
are per</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;

interested or as proceeding from sectional motives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

proposals put forward by the Government will organise ecclesiastical

other country in which the state has the least pretence to be secular. The
authors of the proposals have yet to tell us how when the people of this
Province are fit enough to govern not only themselves but also Dravidastan and
even to do better than the rest of India, the great majority of them, the
Hindus, are yet unfit to manage even petty religious institutions. Not the
least reason is offered for not attempting to enable the Hindus to administer
these institutions nor for obstinately insisting on the secular state taking up
a task which not only is foreign to it but must also be obnoxious to it. Nor
even does this Government pause and consider the significance of the phenomenon
of support for its proposals coming mostly from those who scoff at these
institutions or who seek to divert their funds from religions uses. This
Government has only to thank itself if a puzzled public suspects its <i>bonafides

strange a solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Mathas cannot flourish unless they have the fullest support of those people
who have faith in them. Control by a secular state may secure the vouchering of
the expenses out of the present endowments, but it can secure little more: the
images will be graced with voucher-malas instead of ‘Vada-malas’ and all else
may cease. The temples will be preserved as ancient monuments and the temples
and mathas will be run as shows from the dead past. In the heyday of their
prosperity and influence they were administered by the people and not by the
state in which they were organised. The great temples of Tirumalai,
Chidambaram, Srirangam, Madurai and Rameswaram, for instance, with endowments
and incomes much more ample than they now enjoy, were not administered by the
state,–not even by the kings. It is no credit to this age which claims great
advances in the people’s enlightenment, public spirit, probity and efficiency
that it should despair of administration by the people proving honest and
efficient and should hasten to transfer the burden to the state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

administrative machinery of the past has broken down through the weakening of
the forces which have animated Hindu social and religious life. The state then,
whether represented by a petty chieftain or by a powerful emperor, was, in
effect, the embodiment of a homogeneous society animated by a common spirit and
fully expressive of the purposes of that society. Even that state did not take
up the management of these institutions. Our Government, however, representing
a state which is the political expression of heterogeneous and multi-willed
sections which are being egged on by political adventurers to antagonise each
other is desperately anxious to take up not only the administration but also
the direction of the purposes of these institutions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
may not hope to re-introduce the old system of administration. It was so
fashioned that it functioned without external stimulus or control,
notwithstanding that it concerned itself with all the affairs of the
institutions,–ritual, religion and social relations. It depended on a cleverly
linked system of rights and duties. The activity of each institution was carved
out into a number of spheres and the responsibility for each sphere was vested
in a special authority which had also rights adequate enough to compensate it
for the duties it undertook. The rights and the duties were so cleverly
balanced and interlocked and the several </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>spheres were so
ingeniously made to overlap that those who ran the machine never allowed it to
break down, at least because a failure in the duties spelt disaster to the
rights. Every member of the administration </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>felt passionately that
any remissness on his part was a sin and every member of the public took it to
be his personal duty to prevent hitches arising. The king or the chieftain was
not slow to intervene if a breakdown was expected, but that intervention was
only through men devoutly religious. The problems of administration raised now
by these institutions are, however, ultimately the same as in the ages long
past, for their fundamental purposes have undergone no change. But the temper
of Hindu society has changed. The spirit of the age has to be </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>reckoned
with and machinery has to be devised which will do the same work as before but
in a new atmosphere and to a new step and to a new tune.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are they, however, who read these pages who will have courage enough to believe
that this is a season when it is wise to transfer these institutions to the
mercies of popular control. The attitude of Hindu society to its age-old
institutions has undergone a marked change in this part of the country: it is
fashionable with many to hold up Hindu social organisation to opprobrium. But
this is so, not because the value of Hinduism is not recognised but because its
institutions are believed to stand in the way of social justice as understood
in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

on certain features of the Hindu social order. There is no such fundamental departure
in the spirit as to warrant an apprehension that the change in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>public
opinion will wreck or pervert these institutions. A failure to allow Hindu
public opinion to revivify these institutions, adapting them to modern needs,
may result in driving the public from them. Once we resuscitate faith and
interest in the religious activities of the institutions the social frictions
will cease to matter. The problem is not that of adjusting social differences
but that of setting up and running machinery through which social and religious
distempers will be healed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

morality. All other changes that may be needed in them to bring them in accord
with such modern Hindu opinion as attaches importance to them and owes them
allegiance must be left to be effected by the temple-and matha-minded section
of Hindu society. The duty of the secular state is not to usurp the functions
of these sections of Hindu society which are incorporated in it: on the other
hand, the secular state must endeavour to enable these sections to order their
institutions their own way. It must confine itself to its primary purpose of

be regulated without reference to the religious affairs: the religious affairs
are being subordinated tacitly to the secular ones: the administration and

bodies. There is no realisation of the supreme needs of these institutions.
They and their adherents have to be brought together and their funds must be
made to subserve their purposes. Machinery has to be designed for looking after
the temporalities and the spiritualities of these institutions and for ensuring

administration is a theme which in effect was outside the scope of the Agamas,
for, assuming both an understanding and a continuance of the social life and
the political organization in which they were framed, they left unsaid many
things on which, owing to changes in conditions and circumstances, we are now
in need of light. For instance, the basic principle that most of the
formalities of religious worship are all parallel to the formalities of a royal
court is not found stated in any of the Agamas. The division of the divine
services according to the watches of day and night, the differences in the
music played at different hours and on different occasions, the waking the
images at morn with music, the bathing them with eclat, the investing them with
weapons and crowns, the decking them with ornaments, the making of offerings to
them of food and the like, the burning of incense, the waving of lights, the
wearing the <i>uttariya </i>by the worshipper round his waist, the ranging the
worshippers in the order of precedence, the chanting of praises by accredited
chanters, the announcing of the great presence, the receiving of offerings and
the returning of presents, the distributing the oil of consecration and the water
of the sacred bath, the distributing the <i>prasadas </i>of different kinds,
the placing the lord’s feet on the crown of the devotee, the granting of
audience in the great courtyard, the singing and the dancing by the corps of <i>dasis</i>,
the progress through the great streets on ceremonial occasions on coursers or
in <i>rathas</i>, the retiring to the bed-chamber,–these are but a few of the
usages of temples similar to those of the royal court. Other usages also are

observances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

important group and their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

donations or of petty offerings of money or of offerings for <i>archanas </i>or
of the performance of festivals or <i>Ubhayams </i>or other services. In this
class must be included the descendants of those whose ancestors have endowed
foundations for the services in the temple. These should be put into a second
group in regard to that temple. The contributors of services in that temple form
a group including those who officiate as priests, as chanters of hymns,–the
Prabandha, the Veda and the Tirup-Padiyam, or instance–as Pauranikas, and as
volunteers offering their services in any of the religious activities of the
temple. These are generally ill-paid for their services,–where they are paid at
all,–and it is mainly their devotion that keeps them at their posts. It is
principally on this group that the burden of the ritual and the religious
services in temples falls and it is they who can ensure that they are
competently and regularly rendered. That in the smaller temples they are
usually too few in numbers to serve as checks on one another is no reason for
placing the responsibility for the due discharge of the services on others who
could, in the circumstances, be none other than lay authorities ignorant of
ritual or observances. We cannot but trust to these and they have generally
devotion enough to justify the trust. Usually there are enough laymen in each
local area who know enough to detect infractions and if only their cooperation
is secured,–as will be secured if re-organization proceeds on the lines
sketched here,–there will be adequate checks on the possible vagaries of the
actual officiants. The representatives of the group of worshippers and of the
group of contributors of funds should together have the control of the secular
administration of the temple. Representatives of the group of contributors of
service should have the control of the rituals and observances in the temple. All
these representatives together should have the administration of the mixed
matters of the temple. These representatives will be elected for a term of,

the sections to which their institutions belong. The local areas may vary in
extent depending on the number of institutions which may conveniently be
grouped together. The several classes of representatives in a local area, or of

turn, elect the Provincial Committees,–one for secular purposes and another for
religious purposes, at every stage. These two, at every stage, should together

higher Committees should not be confined to members of the lower Committees and
it should always be possible to provide places for distinguished persons who

Hindu community. This should not be difficult to get over. Every non-Matha
preceptor,– Acharya-Purusha or Desika,–who has a certain number of disciples
can be allowed to be represented in the committees for religious purposes by
nominees of his own and of his disciples, by an adaptation of the method suggested

Those ecclesiastical tribunals that exercise original jurisdiction should be

issues raising pure matters of civil law, in regard to which an appeal should
lie to the High Court of the Province. The judges of the ecclesiastical courts

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>These are mere outlines, which are roughly sketched
for consideration by all those interested in these institutions. The picture
that emerges may not be as clear as a draftsman of a statute requires but it is
clear enough to enable the reader to appreciate what is aimed at. The
controlling bodies will be as varied as the institutions themselves,–with
variations of every grade in the worshipping groups, the rituals, the
observances, the festivals, the resources, the zones of appeal,–and yet they
will stand knit together in an attempt to evoke what is best in these
institutions and to utilise them for the rejuvenation of Hinduism. The scheme
is indeed something which, while creating a body that will effectively serve
its immediate purpose, will at the same time help to evolve the new Hinduism
that many are hoping for.</p>

In March 1940 I had occasion, in conversation, to mention a few of these ideas
to Sir T. G. Rutherford, C.S.I., C.I.E., who, as ‘Adviser’ to the Governor of
Madras, had then before him a Bill on the subject which, during the tenure of
office of the ‘Congress Ministry’ of 1938-39, had been prepared by Dr. T. S. S.
Rajan, Minister for the subject, and was considering the advisability of
publishing it so as to prepare the ground for the ‘Popular Ministry’ inevitable
on the war coming to a close. On his desire that I would set my ideas down in a
Memorandum for him I drafted two </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

dealing with only the major problems and a full one marking a radical
departure, but both of them based on the principles urged here. He pre</span><span

the simpler scheme, as was but natural in one not a Hindu. The ‘Adviser’s
advertisement’ abandoned ultimately the idea of seeking public opinion on Dr.
Rajan’s Bill. It is this Bill which, in substance is the measure now before the

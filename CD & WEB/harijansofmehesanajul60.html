<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Untouchability
has been described as a curse to Hindu society and, as such, Harijans occupy a
special position in Hindu social organisation. There <span class=GramE>is</span>
a large number of castes, about 49 in all, which have been enlisted as the
Scheduled Castes or the Harijans. Some of these are found only in some places,
while some others exist at more than one place but are known by different names
in different places. In Mehesana District, in <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>,
this very wide term has a limited connotation and is restricted to six castes
only, viz., <span class=SpellE>Garoda</span>, <span class=SpellE>Vankar</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Chamar</span>, <span class=SpellE>Turi</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Shenma</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Bhangi</span>. To the
outsider they are Harijans, but, to the surprise of a student of sociology,
there is hierarchy amongst these Harijans to the extent that some of the
Harijans consider other Harijans as untouchables. Out of those mentioned above,
the first four, viz., <span class=SpellE>Garoda</span>, <span class=SpellE>Vankar</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Chamar</span>, <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Turi</span></span>
are considered as the higher classes, similar to <span class=SpellE>Savarnas</span>
in Hindu society. The <span class=SpellE>Shenma</span> and <span class=SpellE>Bhangi</span>
castes are untouchables according to the higher classes. The <span
class=SpellE>Shenmas</span> in their turn do not even touch the <span
class=SpellE>Bhangis</span>. Drinking water from their hands or taking food at
their places is quite forbidden. The marriages are settled in the respective
castes only, and <span class=SpellE>innter</span>-caste marriages do not take
place amongst the Harijans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
amongst these castes of Harijans, <span class=SpellE>Garodas</span> are the
Brahmins or the priest-class who perform all the religious and other social
rites of the rest of the higher classes, and earn their bread by the fees received
from the performance of the acts of their office. The <span class=SpellE>Vankars</span>,
who are next in rank, are the weavers, and maintain themselves by weaving the
cloth on handlooms (hath-<span class=SpellE>sal</span>). The <span
class=SpellE>Chamars</span> mostly live by the cobbler’s profession. The main
occupation of the <span class=SpellE>Turis</span> is presentation of some
drama-like performances and participating in the <span class=SpellE>Bhavais</span>
and such other programmes. It is the Actor Caste. The <span class=SpellE>Shenmas</span>
act as barbers in some villages while in some other places they live by the
cottage industries, such as broom-making and basket-weaving. They alone amongst
the Harijans possess arms such as the sword, spear, <span class=SpellE>dhariyu</span>,
etc., like the <span class=SpellE>Thakard</span> caste of <st1:place w:st="on">North
 Gujarat</st1:place>. This can very well be designated as a martial class. The <span
class=SpellE>Bhangis</span> (<span class=SpellE>Mehtar</span> or <span
class=SpellE>Olgana</span>) mostly do the scavenger’s work in the cities and
towns, or otherwise they live by small cottage industries or by manual <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>. They are treated as untouchables among the
untouchables. It is evident from this that there is what may be termed as a
regular <span class=SpellE>Varna-samstha</span> or caste-system among the
Harijans: each caste having a definite and decisively specified duty to perform
in society, and being prohibited from following any other vocation. The <span
class=SpellE>Garodas</span> are the Brahmins or priest-class, the <span
class=SpellE>Shenmas</span> are the <span class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> or warrior-class,
the <span class=SpellE>Vankars</span>, <span class=SpellE>Chamars</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Turis</span> represent the <span class=SpellE>Vaishya</span> or
business-class, and the <span class=SpellE>Bhangis</span> are the <span
class=SpellE>Shudras</span> or untouchables. This very systematically outlined
social hierarchy leads a student to think seriously about it. It cannot
definitely be a mere chance that the Harijan society is divided in such
well-arranged groups, doing things distinct from, and excluding, each other.
Perhaps, theories about the origin of untouchability or of the <span
class=SpellE>Shudra</span> caste will have to be revised so far as the Harijans
of Mehesana District are concerned. The probable explanation, which needs much
elucidation and support of evidence, might be like this. There might have
existed, long back, in this part of the country, the solitary clans of
uncultured and un-<span class=SpellE>civilised</span> people, some of whom were
clever artisans. Some Aryans, perhaps Brahmins, who were out-<span
class=SpellE>casted</span> from their original group, might have joined them,
and might have inculcated the spirit of hierarchy which they imported with them
from the mother-society. They had brought with them the art of the priestly
class, which they preserved for themselves, and became the <span class=SpellE>Garodas</span>,
the priests of the Harijans, well-versed in the science and the technique of
rituals. This inference is supported by the fact that these <span class=SpellE>Garodas</span>
are generally literate; they know how to find out auspicious moments or <span
class=SpellE>muhurtas</span>, for christening, marriage, etc., how to settle
marriages with the help of the almanac or <span class=SpellE>panchanga</span>,
and also to recite the mantras which have a mixture of Sanskrit and Gujarati in
its <span class=SpellE>Apabhramsha</span> form. These mantras are very similar
to the Sanskrit mantras recited by the priests among <span class=SpellE>Savarna</span>
Hindus. The <span class=SpellE>Garodas</span> possess certain hand-written
books in manuscript form, the language of which is known only to a few who are
learned in the lore. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
of the social problems of the caste are decided by the social organisations of
different castes. A group of some villages, the number of which may vary from
11 to 15 or more, is called <span class=SpellE>Godh</span>; certain rules of a
social nature for the <span class=SpellE>Godh</span> (<span class=SpellE>Gol</span>)
are formulated. These rules decide the <span class=SpellE>Takka</span> to be
charged for the settlement of the marriage, the <span class=SpellE>Dapu</span>
or the dowry to be paid by the bride-groom’s side to the bride’s father, the
meals to be served to the bride-groom’s marriage party, the number of persons
to accompany a marriage party, and such other important problems. As could seen
be from this list of matters, these are the most elementary and essential
problems touching each individual and his family. A rational consideration is
given in fixing rules for the smooth working of the social order by attempts to
remove the economic disparity so far as the more important events of social
life are concerned, and by attempts to conform to the convenience of every one.
These rules are confirmed or changed and decided otherwise by a larger body of
the caste, called Nat or the Caste-Conference. The rules once accepted are to
be obeyed by all, and the breach of these rules results in fines imposed by the
Nat, and sometimes persons or families are declared as out-caste for not
carrying out the orders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the <span class=SpellE>Vankar</span> caste, each <span class=SpellE>Godh</span>
having a certain fixed number of villages. For instance, the one in <span

birth of the child, especially of a son, and more so of the first one, is

metal dish (<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>thali</span></span><span
class=GramE>),</span> and that of a daughter by beating a winnowing basket.
There are different traditions in different castes in different parts. The <span
class=SpellE>Patasa</span>, coconut <span class=SpellE>dhana</span>, and
sweet-meats are distributed by some. Some celebrate the same by distributing <span
class=SpellE>churmu</span> in the <span class=SpellE>Mehlla</span> only. The
delivery generally takes place at the woman’s father’s house, and is in the
charge of illiterate elderly women. Medical aid was hardly available in former
days. The birth of a son is reported to the woman’s husband’s household through
a special messenger, while that of a daughter is conveyed by a mere message. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a message to the father-in-law of his daughter to take away the child with the
mother. The husband of the woman, her father-in-law and some other people come
to the woman’s father’s house. The son-in-law is presented with a golden ring
on this occasion; the father-in-law gets a turban. The new mother wears all her
ornaments, and the young one is entitled to the lion’s share of attention. It
receives a golden necklace, silver anklets (<span class=SpellE>sanzar</span>),

recites some mantras and performs solemn religious rites. The womenfolk enjoy

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Social barriers and religious impediments have been
the main causes of a remarkable practice among the Harijans. In spite of the
unfailing promise of Lord Shri Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that, “even women, <span
class=SpellE>vaishyas</span> and <span class=SpellE>shudras</span>, they also
reach the <span class=SpellE>summum</span> <span class=SpellE>bonum</span>,” (<span
class=SpellE>Glta</span>: IX, 32) the upper classes debarred the Harijans from
following the usual course of religious practice. But the thirst for spiritual
attainments <span class=SpellE>recognises</span> neither untouchability nor any
other type of limitation. It cannot be suppressed by external restrictions
banished by imperial orders. Having been prohibited from all sides, the
Harijans took to the choice of a spiritual preceptor or Guru to satisfy their
spiritual needs. In fact, to remain without a Guru is not allowed among the
Harijans. Every child is initiated sometime between the age of five and eleven.
On a day fixed for the ceremony, the child takes a bath and wears new clothes.
It is made to sit on a wooden seat, and the <span class=SpellE>Gor</span>
(family priest) or <span class=SpellE>Waiwancho</span> (reader of records)
performs certain religious rites. He reads the genealogical table to the child,
informing him about his fore-fathers, family, caste, lineage and such other
details, and also enters in his records the name of the child. The
record-keeper generally visits the villages, makes new entries and collects his
annual fees. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is still another custom prevalent in some
areas. Over and above this religious teacher, there is a family preceptor,
different from the <span class=SpellE>Gor</span> or the <span class=SpellE>Waiwancho</span>.
He may not belong to the same caste, or even be a <span class=SpellE>Garoda</span>.
He is a <span class=SpellE>Bawa</span> or some other person <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
as an authority in spiritual training. Whenever he <span class=SpellE>arives</span>
in the family, the new child or children are initiated. There is no age-limit
for this. In <span class=SpellE>honour</span> of the arrival of the Guru, the
Pat or the <span class=SpellE>Satyanarayana</span> Katha is performed. The Guru
makes the child sit on the <span class=SpellE>Patla</span> and performs certain
religious rites, and the child is initiated into the sect. The members of the
family, the relatives and the <span class=SpellE>Garodas</span> are given a
feast, and an offering of gifts is made to the Guru. The Guru is supposed to be
the incarnation of Brahma, the Creator. But, of late, these Gurus are losing
their prestige and position, due to their exorbitant demands by way of the <span
class=SpellE>preceptorial</span> fees. </p>

BANDHAWAWI or Group Initiation is still another practice in some areas. There
is a spiritual preceptor of the whole locality in a village (Was or <span
class=SpellE>Mehlla</span>) as distinguished from the Guru of the individual.
He comes after about twenty-five years to each village. It is a very big festival
in the Harijan society. The women given in marriage to other villages, and the
men serving in other places, are specially invited for the occasion. All the
daughters-in-law in the locality must remain present. Funds are raised by
contributions from all the houses in the Was; and the expenses of gifts,
dinners, etc., are met from this fund. The individual who offers half a <span
class=SpellE>maund</span> of ghee and other necessary things, and can make
other arrangements satisfactorily, becomes the host of the Guru It is his duty
to offer to the Guru whatever he demands by way of fees (<span class=SpellE>Dakshina</span>).
After the arrival of the Guru, a day is fixed by the leader for the initiation.
All the leading members, accompanied by the Guru go to fetch the essentials for
the ceremony. The whole procession returns, singing songs and reciting the
Bhajans. A big <span class=SpellE>pandal</span> is erected at the host’s house.
All the members of the locality take their meals here only. Cooking in
individual houses is prohibited on this day. After the meals, the <span
class=SpellE>Guruji</span> tells various stories, and delivers sermons on
different topics. New members of the locality, including young children, sons
and daughters-in-law, are introduced to him. In the evening; all get ready with
new gorgeous clothes, and a procession starts, with the males in front, the <span
class=SpellE>Guruji</span> in the middle and the females in the rear. Males
recite Bhajans, and females sing the songs meant for the arrival and the
reception of the <span class=SpellE>Guruji</span>. The procession goes round
the locality, and then halts at a place where a small reception ceremony takes
place. The host and the hostess worship the <span class=SpellE>Guruji</span>,
present him with new clothes and gifts, and fall at his feet, to win his
blessings. The procession returns to the host’s place where the <span
class=SpellE>Bhajan-Kirtana</span> continues throughout night. At about three
o’clock in the morning, all persons to be initiated return home to take their
bath, and return wearing new clothes, with fresh minds to receive the new
sacrament. They bring with them money to be paid to the <span class=SpellE>Guruji</span>
as <span class=SpellE>Dakshina</span>. The <span class=SpellE>Guruji</span>
makes each one sit on a <span class=SpellE>Patla</span>, himself recites, and
makes them recite, certain mantras, performs rites, and recites very slowly a
certain secret mantra in the ear of each one so that others do not hear the
same. He gives the Prasad. They pay the fees. He offers the sacred water of his
feet (<span class=SpellE>charanamrita</span>). They fall at his feet. He ties
the sacred thread (<span class=SpellE>Kanthi</span>) to all. The daughters of
the Was who are married outside it, and the visitors not belonging to the Was
do not participate in the sacred ceremony, as they belong to the other Was, and
hence to the other <span class=SpellE>Guruji</span>. All the same, at the
farewell function, these ‘outsiders’ pay their homage to the <span
class=SpellE>Guruji</span>, together with <span class=SpellE>Dakshina</span>,
and he in return gives them <span class=SpellE>Kanthi</span>. The <span
class=SpellE>Guruji</span> gets his fees from the fund, and also gifts from
others. At the farewell function, all go in procession to a certain distance,
singing songs and reciting Bhajans, and, after the departure of the <span
class=SpellE>Guruji</span>, the festival and the great rejoicing and enthusiasm
come to an end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

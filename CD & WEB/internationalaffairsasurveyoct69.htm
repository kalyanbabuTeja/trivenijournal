<h1>The Kosygin-Chou Meeting </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The meeting of Kosygin and Chou En <span
class=SpellE>lai</span> in <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> on September
<span class=GramE>11,</span> is regarded as the most significant event in
recent times. Not <span class=GramE>that significant results</span> are sure to
come out of it. That it was held at all is most surprising. The news took
diplomats at the United Nations by surprise and many even disbelieved it for a
while. One Western diplomat called it ‘astounding’ while Eastern European
officials called it ‘inconceivable.’ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dramatic nature of the events only heightened the element of surprise. As is
well known, it was in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>,
where all the Communist top-brass assembled to pay homage to the late Dr. Ho
Chi Minh, that the decision to hold the talks was taken. Yet the last moment
everything indicated that a meeting was not in the offing. Kosygin, to begin
with, avoided the route to <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> via Peking,
choosing the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
route instead. As if returning the compliment the Chinese leader left <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City> in a hurry just on
the eve of Kosygin’s arrival there. Then, after a five day stay, the Russian
leader left <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> for <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
via <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>.
And then, after stopping as <span class=SpellE>Dushanabe</span> he seems to
have decided to take a detour to <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> for
the talks. Thus till the last moment, not only was there no hint of an
impending meeting, but the parties seemed to have deliberately <span
class=SpellE>manoeuvred</span> to avoid even a chance meeting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
course the real cause for surprise is that in the context of the brinkmanship
exhibited by <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> and <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
the leaders should now suddenly turn to talks. In this sense, the surprise
expressed by the outside world is a measure of the extent to which Sino-Soviet
relations have degenerated almost to the point of no return. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
over a decade the Sino-Soviet schism has escalated into bitter animosity
manifesting of late in military engagements. What is even more ominous is the
fact that the itch to fight seems to have got the better of the urge to
negotiate. For example, after the clashes of last March on the <span
class=SpellE>Ussuri</span> <span class=GramE>river</span> in the <st1:place
w:st="on">Far East</st1:place>, the Russians and the Chinese arrived at an
agreement over the navigational rights in the river at <span class=SpellE>Khabarousk</span>
on August 8, and on the 13th of the same month a major armed clash occurred on
the <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span> border. The rhetoric on either side confirms
how psychologically prepared both sides are for a major conflagration. Of all
persons, a Soviet nuclear physicist was said to have told an American colleague
that the Soviet people are fed up with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and added: “When we go to war
we will not fight with our little finger like you Americans. We will be
fighting to death.” To this the Chinese response had been that “neither a small
war, nor a big war, nor a nuclear war can ever intimidate the Chinese people.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is, then, the widely held view that the Russians had actually decided upon a
pre-emptive strike at <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,
aimed, in particular, at the elimination of Chinese nuclear installations
situated in the provinces of <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Kansu</span> and <st1:place w:st="on">Inner Mongolia</st1:place>.
As a matter of fact almost all of these are very close to the Russian and outer
Mongolian borders. And there is enough evidence to support the pre-emptive
strike theory. Ever since the Communist Meet in last June, <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
has been dropping hints of a possible action against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Even more significant has
been the increasing Russian military build up in <st1:place w:st="on">Outer
 Mongolia</st1:place>. Mr. Harrison Salisbury of the “New York Times” in a
series of articles written after a visit to Outer Mongolia described it thus:
“There are other physical changes, quantitative and qualitative, measurable by
one </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>who has been coming to Mongolia and Siberia over the past
decade: the emplacement of missiles and high-fidelity communication lines, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
dispersal over the Mongol steppe of fighter aircraft in field shelters and the
installation of radar detection networks.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Other
corroborative evidence is also forthcoming. A second secretary in the Russian
Embassy in <st1:State w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> is reported to have
given <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region> officials a
flip-chart briefing on prospective Russian military moves against <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. More
important is the instance of a letter written by <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> to the Australian Communist Party in
which the Russians raised the <span class=GramE>possibility</span> of a
pre-emptive attack. Add to all <span class=GramE>this the</span> weighty
consideration that the Chinese are about to come out with their own
intercontinental <span class=SpellE>ballastic</span> missile in a couple of
years time. It is thus credible that the Russians may be considering a strike
at the nuclear installations before <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
develops its own delivery system. The Chinese reaction also supports the thesis.
An order has been issued under the imprimatur of Chairman Mao to the <span
class=GramE>cadres which has</span> been described as a ‘virtual <span
class=SpellE>mobilisation</span> order.’ Special indoctrination briefings for
Chinese military, state and party personnel are being held currently and the participants
are told that the gaseous diffusion plant at <span class=SpellE>Lanchow</span>
in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Kansu</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Province</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and the atomic
test site at Lop Nor in <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span>, are probable
targets of Soviet attack. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
view of this very grave deterioration of the situation, it should really surprise
no one that ideological allies, interested in averting a shameful war among the
senior members of the communist brotherhood, should try to persuade <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> and <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> to talk
over things and thus first de-fuse the explosive situation. Even the parties concerned,
one should expect, might have been waiting for an opportunity to make a last
minute effort to avert an Armageddon. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sanzo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nosaka</span> of the Japanese Communist Party and Mr. Ion George
Maurer, Premier of Rumania, are being credited with having successfully goaded
Kosygin and Chou to meet face to face. The latter, in particular, had met Chou
in Peking even before he arrived in <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> and
later worked up things with Kosygin in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>.
The solemn and grave occasion of the death of Ho Chi Minh (who so successfully
managed to keep off the Sino- Soviet schism) must have offered the most
appropriate opportunity mediators to these mediators to press their point home.
The last will and testament of Ho contained an exhortation for communist unity
and not even communist leaders can escape its sentimental impact. These facts
should explain why the Russian and Chinese leaders met. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
certain facts call for further examination of the event. It is agreed generally
that it was first the Russian leader who expressed willingness to meet his
Chinese counterpart. Reports say that he left <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
for <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> with a mandate from his Politburo for
talks with <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. On the other hand the
hurried and unusual departure of Chou from <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City>
(barely within twenty-four hours of his arrival) is indicative of his
reluctance to meet <span class=SpellE>Kosygm</span> who arrived in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City> the next day.
Further, while the Russians had stopped their anti-Chinese <span class=GramE>tirades</span>
over the radio, <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> resumed its
vituperations immediately after the meeting. These facts raise important
doubts. If the Russians had decided upon a pre-emptive strike, why should they
be eager to talk at all? Again, if the Russian pre-emptive strike theory is
true one should have expected the Chinese to show, at least, equal eagerness to
confer with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
course it is possible that the Chinese have not got rid of their braggadocio. <span
class=GramE>The graver the threat the more adamant their postures.</span> Did
not Mao say, in the context of a possible war with <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>,
that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has no fear of even a nuclear war and that she has at least a few millions to
spare as cannon fodder? One can witness an echo of the same in the following
statement made by <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>peking</span></span> in
the context of the present Russian threat. It says that <span class=GramE>the</span>
struggle against <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place>
will not be halted, “not for a day, not for a month, not for a year, not for
100 years, not for 1000 years, not for 10,000 years.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the alternative, it is also possible that the Chinese are putting on a show of
being cavalier and taciturn while really getting anxious within themselves.
There are some indications that at least Chou and his group are not averse to
resume a dialogue with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
Eminent <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
experts like Victor <span class=SpellE>Zorza</span> of the Guardian clearly see
a struggle for succession already going on in <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>peking</span></span> between the extremist faction led by Lin <span
class=SpellE>pao</span> and the moderates led by Chou En <span class=SpellE>lai</span>.
Though not even Chou can dare to advocate an unconditional reconciliation with <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>, it could not be
that Chou met Kosygin most reluctantly and for nothing. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It
is not without significance that even before the Rumanian prime Minister, Mr.
Maurer, met Kosygin in <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City>, he, (Mr. Maurer)
had </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>talked to Chou in <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
proposing that he should meet Kosygin. Mr. Maurer continued his efforts with
Chou again in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>.
And ev</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>en when Chou hurriedly left for home his Vice
Premier Li, was left behind to keep Chou informed of the progress of the
mediators’ efforts with Kosygin in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>.
Further, when at almost Kosygin consented to the meeting he asked <st1:country-region
w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region> to contact Peking and <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>peking’s</span></span> green signal was conveyed
to him while his plane touched <st1:City w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:City> on its
way to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
Then the Russian leader went to <span class=SpellE>Dushanabe</span> in Soviet <span
class=SpellE>Tadzakisthan</span> where he received further instructions from <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> to proceed to <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
for the talks. Thus it could not be that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most reasonable explanation of the affair seems to that neither <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> nor <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> really
intends to set itself on a collision course and that the recent clashes, the
discreet hints even the troop movements were in the nature of deliberate probes
in sensitive areas. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
might have dropped hints about a pre-emptive strike just in order to nettle the
Chinese. As the “London Economist” said “these Russian trial balloons may of
course be just nerve-testing ruses.” And the Chinese in spite of their brave
words could not have remained entirely unaffected by the Russian hints. Thus it
is most probable that the Russians themselves decided to take the first step in
consenting to the talks knowing full well that these are not unwelcome to the
Chinese either. In all this the fear that the deliberate probes might generate
unforeseen situation must have worried the parties and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> in particular. For it cannot be ruled
out that the Russians are taken aback at the hardening of the Chinese attitudes
over the border disputes, as the recurrence of clashes in <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span>
last August showed. Obviously there is the imminent danger of these probing
border areas being retaliated with more than commensurate Chinese <span
class=SpellE>repraisals</span>, thus leading to an unforeseen escalation of the
clashes. It should be borne in mind that the Chinese are extremely sensitive
about the <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span>, <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Kansu</span></st1:place> and Inner Mongolian areas not merely
because their nuclear plants are located in these regions. Historically too,
these Inner Asian regions have been the <span class=SpellE>centres</span> of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s attention and in fact of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s expansionist
designs. <span class=GramE>Professor John K. <span class=SpellE>Fairbank</span>,
that very eminent authority on modern <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,
has shown in a recent article on ‘<st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s
foreign policy,’ in <i>Foreign Affairs </i>(April 1969) how Inner Asia is of
‘Strategic Primacy’ to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</span>
Thus the fear that these very regions have now become most vulnerable to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Russian<i> </i>and<i> </i>Outer Mongol</span>ian
threats might <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>only drive <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> </span>to a desperate action. Given<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> the extremist faction </span>in Peking, <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> could not have missed <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

policy. And as a more responsible power <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
might have decided to initiate talks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to be held at Junior Ministers level is an index to the persistence of
misgivings on both sides. Again the tone of the Chinese assertions about the
justness of their case apparently suggests that <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
is not going to show any sudden conversion of heart. In a document released the
day after the announcement of the proposed talks, the Chinese have accused the
Russians of unjustly holding on to 1.5 million square kilometers of Chinese
territory that the hated Tsars had appropriated. <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
ridiculed the Russian contention that the Chinese Emperors had also been
imperialistic as “a forgery of history in <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of
the old Tsars’ aggression.” Yet a slight change in <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>’s
stand is discernible. While demanding ‘equal’ treaties with Russia, it is
significant that the Chinese now say that they </span><span style='font-size:

let the Russians keep these areas provided the </span><span style='font-size:

are confirmed as ‘unequal’. Thus Peking wants <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
to admit tacitly the past wrongs in return for its (<st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>’s)
future acquiescence of the territorial arrangements. <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
has <span class=SpellE>realised</span> the impossibility of changing the territorial
status quo and wants to make a virtue out of necessity. Is this not proof of
Chinese fears of border clashes escalating into full scale wars which might
give <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> the
pretext for a larger pre-emptive strike? On the Soviet side also there is a
slight mellowing in attitudes. They are now anxious that the Brezhnev proposal
of last June should not be interpreted as one designed to encircle <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> with an
Asian security alliance. While they still talk of an Asian security system, the
Russians now deny that they have a <span class=SpellE>defence</span> pact in
their minds. It is significant that they should make this clarification to the
Indian External Affairs Minister, who had talks in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

Mr. M. C. <span class=SpellE>Chagla</span>, as the then Foreign Minister, took
particular pains in this regard. There was even talk of our gaining a
diplomatic break through in this area. Obviously we can never hope to gain the
sympathy of <st1:City w:st="on">Tehran</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

Yet the immensity of the rebuff coupled with the magnitude of reaction in the

decide upon some action to assert our national pride. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on">Morocco</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region> have been recalled. The
recall of Ambassadors <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>a very
serious act in diplomatic practice. But as observed the role of these two countries
at <st1:City w:st="on">Rabat</st1:City> had been particularly nasty and the
severity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
response is warranted. But then how are we to deal with <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span>
which engineered the whole show? <st1:City w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City>
explained a way with a mere shrug <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>saying
</span>that “we cannot expect <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>anything
better from </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.”
But is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this </span>profound discovery
justification enough to suffer gratuitous <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the main offenders go and catching the abettors? There is a more important <span

India-baiting is the constant factor in <span class=SpellE><span

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Pakistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> gives </span>up such obnoxious tactics
before it expects us to talk on anything. Of course there is a possibility that
General <span class=SpellE>Yahya</span> Khan <span class=GramE>is just wanting</span>
us to take a hard line in order to launch an adventure across the borders. For,
has he not been replenishing his armaments, thanks to the generosity of both <st1:City

  class=GramE>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span class=GramE>.</span>
But this eventuality should not deter us from reacting to the incident the way
it deserves. We owe it to our <span class=SpellE>honour</span> to express our
condemnation of <span class=SpellE>Pindi’s</span> action in a firm fashion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Apart from these formal expressions
of displeasure the prospect of a re-appraisal of our policies towards some of
these Muslim states is also being mooted. It is significant that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Fakhruddin</span> Ali Ahmed himself demanded this. Yet in what
manner should we go about in this regard deserves very careful consideration.
One thing should on all counts be avoided. Any reaction in the shape of a
sudden change in our basic policies, <span class=GramE>effecting</span> these
powers like our policy towards the West Asian problem might after all be
interpreted as juvenile. For, much of our West Asian policy is <span
class=SpellE>basad</span> on the inherent justice of the Arab cause, based, in
particular, on the fundamental inequity of the West’s attempt at expiating its
guilt towards the Jews at the expense of the Arabs. Hence a temptation for a
change in this regard out of our pique should be resisted. Such temptation, it
should be admitted, is bound to be greater in view of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Jordan</st1:country-region>’s role at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Rabat</st1:place></st1:City>. There are certain areas in which we
can make changes. At present, quite apart from supporting the Arab claims for
the return of their territories and for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s discharge of
responsibility towards Palestinian refugees, we are <span class=SpellE>moulding</span>
our Israeli policy on lines identical to those of the Arab countries. Now this
can change. For example, why should we not start having a little more of
intercourse with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>?
It does not necessarily mean any lessening of our commitment to the Arab cause.
Further, not even President Nasser now seriously demands the liquidation of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and why
should we not take steps that normally follow <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>when we recognize </span>the existence of a State? In this connection
it is to be hoped that the recent meeting of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dinesh</span>
Singh with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Eban</span> of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> has some significance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

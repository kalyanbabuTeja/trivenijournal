style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to my conception, the true spirit of Art comes not from a knowledge of Art
alone but from a knowledge of Truth and f</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rom possessing the
true religious spirit. I say this because the source all knowledge and
inspiration is one. It does not matter whether by Religion we mean a faith, a
philosophy, a, system of ethics, as long as we agree that the religious spirit
is primarily a spirit of dedication. The true spirit of Art is something which
can be contacted only by those who have this dedicated spirit. So is Art a
sense of aspiration, a reaching out. Some may think that Art is Beauty and,
being concerned with the expression of Beauty in a material world, is a matter
of Form before anything else. According to me, Beauty is Form as well as
inspiration, because the spirit of the Beautiful which comes down to expression
is the spirit of inspiration. Many have said that Art is Religion. This should
not be taken to mean that Art is another kind of a Religion but it certainly is
the essence of Religion,–the same inspiration is behind it. So it is that, in
the case of the artist, the sense of dedication, the sense of tremendous
aspiration towards spiritual life becomes Beauty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the world today, people talk much about understanding the value of Beauty and
Art without knowing fully what it means. Most people really do not know what
Art is. They have, of course, a theoretical idea about the place of Art in
national life. They give it a high plane in the national consciousness. Our
present Government, for example, has the avowed intention of encouraging all
kinds of folk Art, folk dancing, etc. But the conception most people have of
Art is very superficial because it is mostly based on book knowledge. At the
same time, while calling something very superficial by the name of Art, they
are prepared to do anything for it. In reality, such an attitude is similar to
that of a man who says, “I am a learned man because I have read many books and
know them all by heart”. But it is the identification with the spirit of
knowledge that is contained in books that makes a man learned, not the mere
committing of words to memory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is the same with Art. Many say they are artists but only a few are. It is
aspiration, it is that inner conception of the true spirit of Art which is the
real heart and the most important force in the human individual, that makes the
artist. Take a great musician like Tiger Varadachariar. Those who have listened
to him periodically will say, “He could sing a magnificent number of Ragas”.
Others will acknowledge and admire his marvellous repertoire of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kshetraya Padams and of Thyagaraja Kritis.
All this is quite true; but suppose Tiger had forgotten them all or had never
known them; then the general opinion would have been that he was quite a nice
man but that he did not know much. The usual conception or judgment on such
matters is founded on the extent of an artist’s knowledge and not on the
feeling one gets of his contact with reality. As a matter of fact, it is this
feeling of contact that is important. A very great individual, a great
personality, gives one the feeling that he is in touch with something real.
Such a person can even make mistakes which lesser personalities can ill afford
to make. Tiger could make mistakes in <i>Tala, </i>which in his disciples would
mean only insufficient training. A very great poet may sometimes write verse
which sounds appallingly like nonsense. In a lesser writer, such a poem would
really mean nonsense because he depends for effect upon form,–words,
correctness, etc. In a great poet, whatever be the mistakes in form, he still
gives the impression of a contact with reality. This is because he has touched
the Truth, he has contacted light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ordinary
people do not know how to judge artists. With all the present day craze for
dance and music, we see how judgments and criticism are superficial. If a
dancer is fair, the dance is good. If, in addition, she wears many jewels, the
dance is still better. The same levels of judgment obtain also in the case of
music and musicians. In the West, on the whole, the general level of Art
appreciation is better. Because of this, over there, they have a certain
understanding of genius and know how to forgive a genius his peculiarities.
They will say, “Well, anyhow, he has something in him”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
a singer ordinarily, mostly so in the West, the voice is a most important
factor. Of course, the voice is an important factor in India too. But such a
pre-occupation with the voice of the singer can, in some cases, lead to a
position where the voice becomes more important than the music. It is very hard
to put up with a harsh voice. But there may be a musical element in a singer
who has a harsh voice which may be beautiful and well worth while to contact.
The music is in the soul of the singer and it expresses itself in beauty,
whether or not the voice does it full credit. This is because the spirit of
Art–the creative spirit–is a very remarkable thing. This spirit is independent
of Form in one sense; in the sense that, often, it expresses itself even in
imperfect Form, as in the case of the poet who may write good poetry which,
from a formal point of view, may contain many mistakes. Art as we know it is at
the same time dependent on, as well as independent of, Form. In one sense, if
Art is invisible, there is no Art at all. It has to be visible and so is bound
to Form. How can human beings know music without sound? If a great musician
were to say, “I have taken a vow of silence for the rest of my life. In future,
silence will express my music”, it would be strange, even amusing, yet it is
possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless,
expressed Art depends on Form whether in sculpture, architecture or painting.
Beautiful words are necessary in poetry to express noble ideas. Art, while it
expresses itself in Form, transcends Form. The method of expressing oneself in
the chosen Form of a particular Art is called its technique. The rules have to
be learnt, but when they are learnt thoroughly they can be broken. Younger
artists often like to break the rules, but really to be able to do so one must
be a genius. What is a genius? Of course, from the Hindu point of view, genius
is something that develops through a number of incarnations. Genius is
creativeness of the soul. What is creative person, what is creative Art?
Creative Art is something that eternally new, eternally different. A
recognition that it is something ever fresh and new, leads to the misconception
that it means variety. Mere variety does not mean creative Art, though many
will say where there is variety there is creativeness. A creative artist can go
on doing the same thing and yet it will never be the same. Each time, the
creative impulse gives to the same form a fresh, newly born atmosphere.
Creative Art has variety but it does not need to have it. It can be something
that is repeated over and over again and is yet ever fresh. It would sound like
a paradox to say that, even in repeating, the one thing a creative artist
cannot do is to repeat himself. A person who believes in variety, consciously
promotes variety while an artist is concerned only with his creative spirit. In
the creation of variety as such, there may be inventiveness, there may be
talent. But talent is not genius.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In these days we are prone to mix up words and the
facts behind the words. We think that talent is genius when it is not. A person
can be very talented and still not be a genius. When artists have genius it
becomes clear that all creative Arts belong to one spirit. That spirit becomes
evident and expressed when an individual is able to contact the reality of an
experience through a mind which is under the stress of a deep emotion. To be an
artist, mind and emotion have both to be developed. The intellect, as
ordinarily understood, is not necessarily needed for Art. I have myself seen
this in the case of children who do not like books but are interested in, and
can express themselves in, Art. Our ideas are very limited. We do not really
know what intelligence is. Often we think that when we do not understand a person,
she or he must be intelligent. When I was very young, sometimes I used to
attend lectures delivered in English and I thought these lectures were
marvelous because I did not understand one word. Now, the same thing happens to
most of us in mature life. We are apt to be impressed by a thing just because
we do not understand it. Intelligence really means a capacity for the
perception of truth, of reality. In genius this very clear perception of the
mind combines with a deep emotion which stirs the soul of him who contacts it.
This emotion is not confined to one particular stimulus but is something which
makes one sensitive to all experience, which makes one feel for everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
society, people often make a special effort to appear cultural in conversation.
This is mostly so in the West where, in society people have to have something
to talk about. “What a lovely scene!” they say; “Have you read the latest book
of such and such an author?” “Oh! you are from India. It must be a very
interesting country”, and so on. When I go to New Delhi I hear men women talk
in the same way. This is a reflection in India of the superficial side of
Western civilisation. But this has nothing to do with real culture which
primarily is a keen perception in which there is deep emotion,–a deep emotion
tremendously responsive and making one expand. Beauty and Art make one feel as
if a comb is drawn through the mehes of our being and fresh air is let in. This
happens when one sees a beautiful thing, when one feels very much for a child
or an animal. We are breathing deep, spiritually, when we feel a great emotion.
This stirring up is tremendously important and this is one of the reasons why
Art is important. Unless we know how to comb out our being so that we are ever
fresh and revivified, we cannot respond and we cannot help people. The
intellect by itself is cold and unresponsive like steel. But when beautiful
emotion is mixed with intellect we are able to contact something which is deep.
The actual emotion of contact is something one cannot convey to others. Ask a
great musician wherein lies the secret of his inspiration and he will reply he
does not know. At the same time there has to be something within us to respond.
We cannot really hear the Kalyani Raga and all its subtleties unless there is a
deeply responsive element within us. That part of us which hears, sees and
responds has to be prepared for the reception of Art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A very important thing in life is the stimulus of
being with someone who knows a great deal about these subjects. Slowly one
begins to feel and know also. This has been apart of my own experience. I have
often been in contact with remarkable people who were specialists along lines
which were not mine–Sir C. V. Raman, for example. It is so marvellous, when he
speaks about the diamond, and his inspiration has made me feel that the diamond
is indeed something wonderful. I have felt the beauty of the diamond all the
more. When one hears him, one wants to go in for scientific research also. One
wants to be a great scientist like him, His ability to contact such an
inspiration in the subject of his research makes one feel that he is also an
artist. The stimulus of greatness is tremendously important. Many say they will
and can study for themselves. This is a mistake. The presence of greatness in
the Guru, the teacher, makes one contact the reality in the subject of study.
When someone has made a deep study of certain books, those who come into
contact with him also begin to feel the greatness of knowledge. Sometimes I
have heard recitations from Shakespeare which have laid open to me the soul of
poet and made me wish I could recite as beautifully as some of these artists.
When one has such contacts, one is inspired. Therefore, we should be with those
who can give us such inspiration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
real difficulty with genius, the creative spirit, the Truth, is that you cannot
really explain what it is or teach another person to acquire it. You have to
learn to contact it by imperceptible means. Art has to be contacted thus and it
has a very special message. Art means Beauty although today anything passes for
Art. Dancers think that if they do anything with their bodies it is beautiful.
In the Art galleries of today we see many horrors labelled as modern Art.
Certainly, in the future, such Art will be looked down upon. In India at
present, there is a craze to copy this foolish phase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art
means expressing beauty but we must remember that the unexpressed is also
beautiful. Complete negation of movement is beautiful. Beauty is a very
marvellous and cosmic thing. Human consciousness is on many planes. There is
one part of it which is material and one which is divine. That part which is
material belongs to the world of limitations. It is slow, <i>tamasic, </i>purely
physical. So the mind is often physical, very concrete and narrow; but one
sometimes comes across a mind that can fly to heaven. There are ordinary minds
and spiritual minds. The spiritual is a God-like force. From my point of view,
the Gods cannot speak too easily to humanity because humanity is very slow to
understand. The Rishis and teachers have made great efforts to provide this
contact through the Vedas, through poetry, through Religion, through beautiful
and forceful language. They have tried to show us something of the other world.
Does Art teach us something else? If it does, what is it that it attempts to
teach? It teaches us the same thing that the Rishis have taught. It shows us a
suggestion of the Heaven world and puts it at our feet. Would you like to know
what the Devas are like? Look at a beautiful dance; it comes from the Devas. Do
you want to see something that comes from the Highest and yet belongs to the
ordinary world, something marvelous that God has created? There is a flower
right before your eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art
is something that, so to speak, is placed right at your feet. Here before your
very eyes is your divine self. You think the artist is someone outside
yourself. You yourself are the artist and a creation of Art is your own
creation. You have it in you to create. You can make beautiful poetry, you can
write a wonderful book, you can sing this song. You will say, “I<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>cannot do any of these things. I am afraid
even to attempt them”. How is it then that another human being like you can do
them? This means you can do it also. Art is a direct message from the Higher to
the lower. Beauty is the most perfect language there is. You want the divine to
speak. But we are hearing the divine speaking always. If we know how to hear
music, we are hearing the divine speak. All of us have heard, only we do not
know. We have seen the Art of the divine–though we do not realise it when we
have seen a great dancer. But then we may say, “she is after all a human
being”. However, when she dances it is the divine spirit in her that dances and
not the mere human body. If we learn to think this way, we will understand Art
and its marvellous message. This divinity is a marvellous message to humanity–a
direct gift. When we hear great music we feel so thrilled and stimulated that
we feel we ourselves can create. If we really understand Art as a message of
the Gods, then we will find that God Himself is Beauty. And the world should be
filled with it. We must become God-like. We can do this. But we have to become
filled with the spirit of pure Beauty, filled with a spirit of dedication. This
means we have to expand emotionally and mentally so that we can enter into the
spirit of Beauty, the spirit of Art, and be thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
often consider themselves ‘hardboiled,’ using that term in a complimentary
sense. Actually it is an unfortunate confession, a very sad thing. If there is
nothing on earth that thrills them, what a sad position they are in! Every
person should be sensitive enough to be moved deeply by something. It is better
even to be moved to tears than not to be moved at all. The capacity to respond
to emotion means something more than being merely emotional. Every time you are
really thrilled by something, I am quite sure it makes you grow and you will
never again be quite so small as you were before. The difference before and
after may not be very great, but if we go through such experience constantly
and are constantly inspired, one day we will transcend the ordinary. Every
individual has, at least to a small extent, the power to be inspired. If one is
cold and hard, then inspiration means nothing. But if we are capable of being
inspired, it means two things. Firstly, that there is someone who has the
capacity to inspire and, secondly, that we have the capacity to respond. It
means that we can respond to Beauty. To some extent, it is because there are
people who can respond to Beauty that there expressed Art, not entirely because
there are artists alone. If nobody responds to music the singers will always
have to sing to themselves. Therefore, the spirit that can respond to the
revelation of a very great artist can also show you the way magnificently. When
you contact such art, when you hear the sound of music or see the colours in a
beautiful picture, you not only hear the music or see the picture; you see into
the very soul of the artist and, even more, you see the soul</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art
is a threefold message from the Highest, through the Spirit, technique and
form. When an artist pours forth his inspiration, what is it we have? That
which is inspiring in it is not the Form but the spirit. The spirit, of course,
needs the form for its expression. Form is necessary for the expression of
Beauty–that Beauty which is Cosmic and which is the true spirit of Art. This
Cosmic Beauty is like a very great river that comes down like a waterfall from
the high mountains. This is Art. If we want to contact it we have to enter into
that greatness. We have to enter into the heart and the essence of Beauty. How
are we to do it? Not merely by thinking of Form. Technique will come, will
develop. Form will appear and shape itself even without effort. A person who is
inspired is touched by the spirit which is eternal, a form which has no end. A
picture can have a frame but the spirit goes beyond the frame. The form has
limitations but in that limitation the spirit is seen and we begin to see
everlasting Beauty. This is the work of Genius and is the essence of Art. Art
goes together with the right kind of Religion. I have said this many times.
There must be purity of action, purity of thought, purity of life, a true
attitude to life, clear perception, sensitiveness to all things, a tenderness
of feeling–above all, deep tenderness. Such tenderness of emotion is delicate
emotion. Then Art becomes spiritual and not the Art that is portrayed today.
The dance I speak of is the dance of Sri Nataraja Himself. If we would
understand His Art, we must learn to spell the word not only ART but also
HEART. This is our way. We must put all our hearts and minds into it and a penetrating
and keen intelligence, so that we are no more on the physical plane but on the
plane of the Gods where the True Spirit of Art lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

India today, we have a great work to do for the revival of the spirit of
Beauty. There is a consciousness of the place of Art–but there is a lack of
understanding of Art itself. As we travel in India today and visit famous
places we see monuments and temples in ruins. No traveller or educated Indian
visits any place for sight seeing except to see relics of the old civilization
which are of either religious or historical interest. In India, with very rare
exceptions, the, religious and the historical are combined. There is no history
without Religion, nor monuments nor cities. This is a unique feature of India’s
life. We have made our genius unique because Form is an embodiment of spirit,
and we use no form that is not spiritual, nor is there any true life for us
ordinary human beings without beauty of form. This is why Indian Art is
primarily a spiritual Art. Our conception of Art has come from the plane of
Intuition and therefore our creative expressions are the result of a spiritual
experience. The fundamental difference between East and West seems to be that
the East has emphasised the fact that a body is taken by the soul and therefore
the soul has a body, while the Western conception is that the body has a soul.
The Indian knows of the Himalayan heights and traces the Ganges from the source
to the ocean, while a Westerner discovers the Ganges, and after travelling along
the plains and climbing mountains, he finds the source.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dhanvantari himself and so on without end. Indians accepted the knowledge and
worked with it to discover the truth of it. In the West, a few great poets,
musicians and philosophers gave to the world their knowledge and their
experience. But it remains as their own individual expression. The nation as a
whole accepts no knowledge but develops through experience. So we find that
Western Art gradually developed through different phases of civilisation and
has yet to understand the deep significance of Art. They have yet to know the
philosophy of Art, and the spiritual meaning. But whichever of the two methods
is used, they will meet. Either Truth must be experienced, or, experience must
teach Truth. It is with the approach of opposite ends that East and West will
meet. Either way it is Truth that is Art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Speech alone does not portray Truth or knowledge.
Knowledge or wisdom is expressed through colour, sound, rhythm and movement. It
is because of this conception that we see in the symbology of the great Being,
Nataraja, an expression of every form of Art. As the rainbow is many-coloured,
Art is many-formed. You see in Nataraja the great Yogi. for Art is primarily
not only spiritual on the spiritual plane but spiritual on every plane of
consciousness coming down to the physical level. So He is the Yogi, the Seer.
He is the Teacher, for in Him is born knowledge. He is movement, and every limb
even as portrayed in the still form of an image is movement and grace. He is
the all powerful–but his power is hidden by grace and beauty. This again is the
expression of true Art, for it is power that has transcended brute force and
crudity. He is sound, for in Him is symbolized the first sound, the sound of
the Damaru. He is last, but not least, rhythm, a dancer, for the dance is the
united expression of Art–poetry of motion, music, line, grace and, most
important of an expression of spirit triumphing over matter. In the statue of
Nataraja we see that all Art is one and the essential spirit of Art is the
cosmic conception that touches the heavens and the human conception that
touches the heart of man.</p>

we, as Indians, cannot understand this spirit, we can never really revive Art.
What we need in India is a revival of spirit, not a revival of Art Forms. If we
revive Art Forms, we revive a dead body; if we revive the spirit, we not only
revive the Art Forms but become the source of new Forms which will be as
beautiful as any that man has created. So many people speak of creating a new
Art. In every field of Art in India efforts are being made in this direction. I
am sorry to say that this effort is only producing ugliness instead of beauty
because we are creating with the mind alone and not with the spirit. There are
many modern-minded Indians today who decry what they call revivalism or
tradition in Art. Usually these are people who neither understand Art nor
India. For centuries and for thousands of years, India has not only preserved
her religious spirit and tradition but has proved that creative consciousness
was an important feature of Indian Art. One of the greatest dangers for the
artistic future of India is the fact that people of little knowledge are taking
such an active part in it. The Christ said “do not cast your pearls”, meaning.
“do not give a precious jewel to the ignorant.” In the same way when the
ignorant direct the way of Art which is a message of the Devas, it can produce
nothing but sacrilege.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Take
the Dance for instance. First it came from the Rishis, it had a great place in
national life; so much so that it had a place of<i> </i>honour in the temples.
Then it decayed owing to the degradation of the lives of those who danced. Why
did it decay? Was it because the art had no more beauty in it or was it because
of the lowering moral values? It is a pity that the Art had to die because the
artist did not lead a pure life, yet one important point emerges, that the life
of the artist is as important as the Art itself. Though morality seemed to concern
itself only with one aspect, yet the fact is as true as ever, that the life of
an artist has to be dedicated and pure. This applies to every class of
individual. Yet how many of us think of keeping our bodies pure and our minds
and hearts filled with Beauty? The dance has become a craze and a fashion
today. How many think of its spiritual meaning? How many realise that it
expresses human emotion, rendered transcendent and beautiful by the stories of
the Avataras, of the Mahabharata, of the Ramayana and the Puranas When we think
of this Art decaying, do we not think of it entirely on the basis of morality?
If so, what is morality? From my point of view, <i>ugliness is immorality </i>and
today a greater immorality has taken the place of what obtained in those whose
lives were called ‘impure’. In the hands of the professionals, the Art retained
its standards of technique, purity of movement and a sincere devotion to the
Deity. Today the Art has lost its beauty of Form. It is strange to see that
India has accepted Bharata Natya which is a temple Art but that the temple has
no more of this Art and that, in fact, it is prohibited in temples. Still more,
we believe in Bharata Natya without believing in Bharata. If a Natya which is
given by the Rishis is divorced from them, from Religion and from the temples,
how then does this dance represent the genius of India? To me, it now
represents more the spirit of the modern world. To the modern Indian, the
ruined temple is more interesting than the living temple itself. Yet, even in
the ruins, the glories of India shine with more lustre than in all the Art
forms of the present day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all the Arts, the easiest to revive will be music; yet it is only musical
ability that can be revived, not musical genius, because musical genius is so
inextricable a part of spiritual knowledge. Musical revival is possible, though
difficult, because the appreciation of it is still living to a certain extent.
Even this is almost extinct in the north of India, but for a few deep students.
It is unfortunate, the number of crimes that are committed in the name of Art.
As I have said before, Art in the hands of the ignorant can become a sacrilege.
One sees it everywhere, in the theatre, in dancing, in the temples, and
monuments. But the dance, one need not see; one can avoid it. Yet how can one
avoid seeing sacrileges like one sees in the Dilwara temples, in Chidambaram,
in Mylapore and other places. As one travels, this brings greater sorrow than
almost any other form of ugliness except cruelty. One sees constantly the
hideous colours that are painted over Gopurams and the walls of shrines. Great
kings built shrines out of their devotion, kings who worshipped not only in
their hearts but kings who worshipped through Art, kings who inspired,
encouraged and helped craftsmen whose work cannot even be imitated today. Such
masterpieces that have inspired thousands of people, that are valued in every
country and every museum in the world today, are neglected and forgotten. The
other day I saw masterpieces of bronze which had once been buried underground
during a Muhammadan invasion. Now they are unearthed and privately sold to
connoisseurs and others. The possession of bronzes has become as important a
craze as dancing. Shops are selling bronzes, real or unreal, to satisfy this
craze. One of the amazing things of the present day is that ignorance can be
satisfied by tricks. In the concert, tricks of the voice and glamorous noises
of different instruments can please the audience and can pass off as music. In
the dance, a dancer who has worked years to perfect the Art, who presents Art
through simplicity is far less appreciated than one who studies for a short
time, who can present glamourous clothes, jewels, etc. In the same way the
bronze that is copied and made to look dull and old is as satisfying as the old
image full of the atmosphere of centuries of worship. This is indeed Kaliyuga,
for we may have ears but we do not hear, we have eyes but do not see. The old
prayer, “From the unreal lead me to the real, from darkness lead me to light,
from death lead me to immortality” is applicable equally to Art, for what is
Art but that which leads to reality, to light and to immortality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It may be entertaining, for we must learn through joy, but at the same time Art
is neither for the superficial nor can it be expressed by the superficial. All
Art is for the highest and for one’s own heart. It being the true education of
life, its mission is to teach without appearing to teach because the best way
to learn is to learn without the pain of learning. When songs are written about
Nataraja, His dance is spoken of as Ananda Natana. The meaning of this is
obvious, but how wonderful the conception is! It has many meanings, the most
important of which is that joy destroys all misery. Through His joy, He
destroys ignorance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>To the ordinary human, the learning of the dance is
as strenuous as the practice of Yoga because it means the control of the body,
the discipline of the body and finally the forgetting of the body through the
joy that comes of its transcendence. By the conquering of the body, by the
expression of the spirit through the physical, we are as Shiva Himself,
destroying ugliness, destroying matter and flesh itself into the ashes of divine
rhythm and joy. Tamil poets speak of Shiva as One shining with brilliant and
pure white ashes. This is the dance in which intelligent emotion transcends
all. It is creative and new and when one’s mind is filled with this spirit how
can the artist be conscious of pleasing the audience, or think of headlines? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As dance is the conquering of the body, so is music
the conquering of the emotion. True music is transcendence of lower emotion. As
Natya is the dance of the physical body, so is music the dance of the emotional
body. To transcend emotion is again a Yoga, the sound that is physical calling
to the eternal self in all. In India, the cultural centre was truly the temple,
and because Art was understood it was offered as flowers and incense to the
Deity. </p>

is because beauty is such a universal spirit that it can know no differences of
nation, language or<i> </i>caste. All speak today about a national language. To
me, the real national language is culture and any Form that expresses culture
is the language of the land. It is interesting to note how Art is the one thing
which all nations recognise as a bridge. Even during the last war, many people
and many countries gave up speaking German, would have nothing to do with
Germany. But the only German born thing that was allowed in any country was the
Music of German composers such as Bach or Beethoven. In the love of Art, the
nationality of the composer was forgotten. For a great artist the world is his
nation. In the division of India the greatest loss has been the cultural loss.
In the North craftsmen who make beautiful things, and wonderful musicians are
Muslims, for music there is no barrier of Religion; almost all Ustads sing of
Krishna and Radha. If real artists had been the politicians there would have
been no division of India. Art seems to be exempted from all barriers of birth.
The Christian will enjoy a dance performance or even learn to dance, though it
is known that every song is praise of Krishna, Rama, Sita or Parvati. This
interesting fact gives us an idea that perhaps in the new India, Religion
cannot return in the same way. But if the religious spirit is to return it may
be through beauty, through the presentation of drama, of music, of dance and of
poetry. Only if India regains the spiritual outlook will India regain her place
as the Centre of Culture, of Beauty of living, a land to be worshipped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

When visitors are shown our dances, they are filled with surprise; surprise at
the lack of organisation, lack of colour sense, the loudness of the microphone
and the lack of respect for the Art on the part of the audience. Of course, it
is natural that audiences lack reverence for Art, because the artist himself or
herself is unaware of the need for such a quality. Reverence and humility can
come only with knowledge. The same is true of the Art galleries today. Our

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is no doubt that in the Western world there is
a far better understanding of Art. The vulgar exists, as in the night clubs,
but the vulgar is known to be vulgar, as the classical is known to be classical.
The West is full of a sense of good taste, of polish and a capacity to do well
whether in good or evil. The forms of dancing in the cabarets exact as much
hard work and untiring effort as the classical ballet. The West is a land of
contrasts. Last year when I was in Paris, a U.N.O. representative gave a
lecture with lantern slides. He showed the glory of Notre Dame, the beautiful
Cathedral dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and in the next picture was a slide
representing the Folies Bergeres, a famous place of light entertainment. Yet,
in spite of all this, there is no mixing up of the crude with the classical.
There will not be one note of the cheap music-hall at a concert of a classical
musician, and what is more, the audience will know the difference. They will
not tolerate the sacrilege of the classical artist descending to the cheap
tunes. The cinema songs in India, with their imitations of foreign films and
their music, has made this type of music so popular that the greatest danger
has come to the very life of India, so that an average Indian (except to a
certain extent in the South) does not even know the difference between the good
and bad. Those who work for Art and Education have this great mission, to
educate children and the public to true knowledge.</p>

Centre of Beauty. We still speak of a home as one where Lakshmi resides. What
does this mean? It means Beauty in the home. The home of a villager, of a poor
man, was as beautiful as that of any rich man. In fact India’s genius for
simplicity in life, simplicity in the home, beauty in everything that was used

The name of Arundhati, before whom even her husband Sage <span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>
looks small, is an <span class=SpellE>honoured</span> and household name
throughout the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">land</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bharata</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
Tradition traces her birth and parentage to a family of outcastes, but, by her <span
class=SpellE><i>paativratya</i></span><i> </i>(devotion to husband), she carne
to be respected as the greatest woman that Vedic India ever produced.
Transformed into a star after her pious life on the earth, she became the
object of worship for countless brides and bridegrooms all over our holy land.
We have no details of the life story of so illustrious a personality, but it is
our good fortune that it was left to the powerful pen of a genius like
Bhavabhuti to portray her great character in life-like reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> role in <i>Uttararamacharitam
</i>is that of a peacemaker. In a triangular <span class=GramE>conflict</span>
between Rama, <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> father <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>,
and <span class=SpellE>Rama’s</span> subjects, she brought about a happy
concord among the conflicting parties, through her tact, sympathy and
determination. The new king Rama who was greatly attached to his subjects
abandoned his wife Sita, because the people cast reflections on her, and this
greatly infuriated <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> against Rama and his
subjects. In such a critical situation there were only two persons, namely <span
class=SpellE>Vasishta</span> and his wife, Arundhati, who could act as
peacemakers. But, unfortunately, the great <span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>
was disqualified for the task, because it was on his behest to propitiate the
people at any cost that Rama banished Sita. Finding that his ill-timed message
sent to Rama through <span class=SpellE>Ashtavakra</span> produced a disastrous
rift in the family of the <span class=SpellE>Raghus</span>, of which he was the
<span class=SpellE><i>Kulaguru</i></span><i> </i>(family priest), <span
class=SpellE>Vasishta</span> felt embarrassed and helpless. The only thing he
could do to ease the tension was to send a message of hope to the old queen <span
class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>, mother of Rama, that all would end well in course
of time. For this reason, Bhavabhuti did not bring <span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>
on to the stage for conciliating the conflicting elements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bhavabhuti,
therefore, employed <span class=SpellE>Vasishta’s</span> wife Arundhati in the
task of peacemaking–a task to which she was eminently fitted in virtue of her
exalted status. <span class=SpellE>Bhahavabuti</span> declares, in the words of
<span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>, that Arundhati was held so sacred that even <span
class=SpellE>Vasishta</span> used to consider himself purified by his
matrimonial alliance with her. The philosopher-king hails her as <span
class=SpellE><i>triloki</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>maangalya</span> </i>(auspicious
to the three worlds) and makes to her a most reverential bow, touching the
ground near her feet with his forehead. He also compares Arundhati with the
Goddess of Dawn and addresses her as <span class=SpellE><i>Jagadvandya</i></span><i>
</i>(respected by the whole Universe) and even the goddesses <span
class=SpellE>Vasundhara</span> and <span class=SpellE>Jahnavi</span> later on
refer to her by the same respectful honorific. It<b> </b>is, therefore, no
wonder that in a situation which made so many hearts to break, no less a person
than Arundhati could have intervened, and intervened with success, culminating
in the happy reunion of Rama and Sita amidst scenes of universal rejoicing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Arundhati heard in the hermitage of <span class=SpellE>Rishyasringa</span> the
startling news of <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> banishment, she became so
angry and grieved that she flatly refused to go back to <span class=SpellE>Ayodhya</span>,
bereft of <span class=SpellE>Janaki</span>. She, therefore, proceeded
straightaway to the hermitage of Sage <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>,
together with the grief-stricken <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>. Arundhati
consoled <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span> with the message of hope sent by <span
class=SpellE>Vasista</span> that all would be well in the end. But the <span
class=SpellE>sceptical</span> <span class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> lady, in her
despair, put no belief in <span class=SpellE>Vasishta’s</span> words conveyed
to her and openly expressed her misgivings about it. This provoked a spirited
retort from Arundhati who sternly warned <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>
never to doubt the great <span class=SpellE>Rishi’s</span> words. <span
class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>, taken aback at this outburst from the holy
Arundhati, kept quiet hoping against hope that after all a miracle might happen
as predicted by <span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Arundhati’s</span></span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> handling of <span
class=SpellE>Kausalya</span> was a light affair but the difficult part of her
work lay ahead. She knew full well that <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> was
burning with rage at <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> banishment and a
life-long rupture between <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> and Rama seemed
imminent. A single false step on either side would for ever mar the cordial
relationship that so long existed between the <span class=SpellE>Raghus</span>
and the <span class=SpellE>Janakas</span>, and it was to prevent such a
development that Arundhati was specially deputed by <span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>.
She, therefore, softly persuaded <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span> to approach
<span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> and speak to him first, on his arrival. But,
on seeing <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>, <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>
taunts her as the mother of <span class=SpellE><i>prajapalaka</i></span><i> </i>(beloved
ruler of his subjects) and by enquiring after her health. At this, Arundhati
was stung to the quick, but discreetly refrains from speaking a word in <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> of <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>, lest, in
doing so, she (Arundhati) should unwittingly offend <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>
who was already sore at heart. But when, incidentally, <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>
angrily poses the question as to how <span class=SpellE>Agni</span> was
competent to test his daughter Sita, Arundhati immediately joins him and proclaims
in emphatic tones that Sita is more sacred than <span class=SpellE>Agni</span>
himself, and this pacifies the irate father. Then Arundhati slowly brings to
the notice of <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> the pitiable state of the
grief-stricken <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>, who swoons at the mention of
<span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> plight, and the noble-minded <span
class=SpellE>Janaka</span>, repentant for his rude <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>
towards the wife of his late revered friend <span class=SpellE>Dasaratha</span>,
busies himself in bringing her back to consciousness, and sadly recounts, in a
reminiscent mood, the happy times spent by them in bygone days. Thus <span
class=SpellE>Arundhiiti</span> succeeds in bringing together <span
class=SpellE>Kausalya</span> and <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> as desired by
<span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
soon afterwards, <span class=SpellE>Kusa</span> and Lava, the twin sons of
Sita, make their appearance on the scene, and their handsome features which
bear a striking resemblance to the features of Sita, open fresh wounds in the
mind of <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>. He gradually becomes so enraged at
the monstrous perversity of the people and the outrageous haste of Rama that he
stands up with grim resolve to destroy both Rama and his subjects outright, either
with a bow and arrow or with a curse. <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>,
terror-stricken at this revengeful mood of <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>,
implores Arundhati to pacify <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> and avert the
impending peril. Arundhati, seeing how explosive the situation is, immediately
intervenes and submits to <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>, in an appealing
manner, that Rama is <span class=SpellE>Janaka’s</span> own child and that the
people are an ignorant lot and entreats the angry <span class=SpellE>Rajarshi</span>
to show mercy on them. At this, <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> cools down,
admitting that Rama is like a son unto him and that the people comprising
mostly of Brahmans, old men, women, children and cripples, deserve clemency at
his hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Arundhati,
by now, has completed half of her work, but the remaining half, which is more
complicated, has yet to be begun and completed. <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> were reconciled in their common misfortune
and <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span> had no trace of ill-will or anger against
Rama, whose action he began to see in its proper perspective. Only the people
had to be told, and told convincingly, that Sita is flawless, and until this
fact was accepted by the people, there was no question of <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span>
acceptance by Rama. Arundhati, therefore, sets herself the task of convincing
the people about <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> purity with the help of Sage <span
class=SpellE>Valmiki</span> who, by his supernatural powers, arranges a huge
conclave of people near his hermitage, to witness a short play of <span
class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> banishment composed, by himself and staged by
celestial nymphs. When, at the end of the play, <span class=SpellE>Vasundhara</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Jahnavi</span> jointly deliver Sita into the hands of
Arundhati, that venerable lady raises her powerful voice and addresses the
mammoth gathering in a short speech, which breathes the spirit of our own
democratic times. Pointing out that Sita has been praised for her purity by
goddesses <span class=SpellE>Vasundhara</span> and <span class=SpellE>Jahnavi</span>,
Arundhati herself presents Sita to the people as their queen. Re-calling that <span
class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> purity was tried and tested by <span class=SpellE>Agni</span>
and applauded by the gods, headed by Brahma, in the past, Arundhati exhorts the
people to accept Sita unhesitatingly from her (<span class=SpellE>Arundhati’s</span>)
hands and, in conclusion, requests the people to express their view in the
matter. <span class=SpellE>Arundhati’s</span> speech, which was virtually a
proclamation of <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> purity to the whole universe,
had an electric effect upon the assembled people, who silently bowed their
heads to Sita in great reverence and thereby indicated their acceptance of her.
Arundhati, then, quietly calls upon Rama, standing stupefied at the turn of
events, to accept Sita as his wife, and employ her as his companion in the <span
class=SpellE><i>Aswamedha</i></span><i> </i>sacrifice, which was only half
completed by then with the gold idol of Sita by his side. And Rama meekly
agrees to do according to <span class=SpellE>Arundhati’s</span> bidding, to the
immense relief of <span class=SpellE>Lakshmana</span> and Sita who were
anxiously watching to see how Rama would act upon <span class=SpellE>Arundhati’s</span>
advice. After that, Arundhati who had no more work to do, leaves the place,
making a formal request to <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span> to perform the, <span
class=SpellE><i>Upanayana</i></span><i> </i>ceremony of <span class=SpellE>Kusa</span>
and Lava, the sons of Rama and Sita. Thus Arundhati ably fulfils the delicate
mission of peacemaking entrusted to her by her husband <span class=SpellE>Vasishta</span>,
who was precluded by force of circumstances from undertaking the mission
himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> art is a triumph of ironic
transcendence. His irony is a rich compound of broad <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
and sympathy, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>gentle mockery and genial ridicule. The method
is ‘to mock at the thing dearest to one’s heart,’ and, of course, irony is
always compatible with the most intense feelings. In irony there is no scope
either for the arid realms of dreary non-sentimental thinking or for a
hysterical and lavish sentimentality. Delicate irony is a measure of detached
observation and it illumines the character of a person while exposing his
weaknesses. It arouses love in us for the person whom the author intends to be
loved and here R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> succeeds <span
class=SpellE>marvellously</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

outstanding gift of R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> as a writer is his
capacity to affect, as it were, a comedic catharsis, the cathartic happiness so
urgently needed in these days of arid cackle of dry-bones of <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> either bitter or disillusioned or cynical. In R. K. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> we have <span class=GramE>a laughter</span>
intensely happy, not in the least tainted by cynicism and never by bitterness.
There is pure sentiment and good <span class=SpellE>humour</span> corrected
from cheap sentimentality by detached and loving irony. The final result is
pure aesthetic delight, happiness and peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It has the un-mistakable stamp of the individuality and genius of R. K. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> as a writer. There are the same delightfully vivid
and picturesque evocations of a South Indian middle-class life and there is the
same inimitable, incomparable and irrepressible <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
tempered with humanity and <span class=SpellE>flavoured</span> with irony.
There are again his wonderfully keen powers of observation, masterly strokes of
satire which softy bite, <span class=SpellE>humour</span> which tickles and
pinches irresistibly and yet leaves the mark. Instances may be taken from
almost any page of the novel. To take a sample: ‘A street dog lay Snoring on a
heap of stones on the road side, kept there since the first municipal body was
elected for Free India in 1947 and meant for paving the road.’ In the same way
the description of the vagrant waiting to eat the remains on the dining leaves
to be cast out of houses after dinner and <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span>
throbbing for a moment with several national and international problems and
their ramifications is both humorous and deeply touching. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
character of <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span>, the 55-year-old vendor of sweets,
is broad and firm in outline, convincing and natural in full personality and
essentially true to nature. <span class=SpellE>Jagan’s</span> character is a
curious mixture of innocence and shrewdness, humble simplicity and delightful
eccentricity and he has a heart full of tenderness for his late wife and his
‘poor boy.’ He is a strict follower of Gandhi in all matters, in Truth,
Satyagraha, <span class=SpellE>Charkha</span>-spinning, in dress, not the
least, in non-violent footwear. His never-to-be-published <i>magnum opus </i>is
on Nature Cure and Natural Diet with his immense faith in the properties of <span
class=SpellE>margosa</span>, for brushing the teeth or for relief from
headache, incorporating his ideas on ‘the whole secret or human energy’ and
dietetic prevention or cure for premature white hair. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

yet we ask, as the ‘cousin’ (to the whole town) in the story asks and never
bothers to know, why this man who has apparently perfected the art of living on
nothing should go on working and earning, taking all the trouble? The author
himself with an uncanny stroke of irony strips him bare by saying that as long
as he bears the frying and sizzling noise in the kitchen his gaze is fixed on
the lines of the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavad</span> Gita and once it stops he
cries out ‘What is happening?’ Another stroke of the author is that <span
class=SpellE>Jagan</span> keeps two categories of cash–one that can be
inspected by anyone, the other to be viewed as ‘free cash’ perhaps
self-generated and entitled to survive without reference to any tax. And why,
again we ask, is all this for this devout <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
follower, a simple man with harmless eccentricities? Well, perhaps, there is
always a fascinating touch of mystery and inexplicability in the humble heroes
of R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
<span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> <i>The Guide </i>was a novel of intricate
story, <span class=SpellE>zig-zag</span> narration, complicated technical
flourishes, a picture of hectic activity and straining tempo, with a young,
romantic, irresponsible type of man as a hero, <i>The Vendor of Sweets </i>is a
somewhat straight-forward, conventional but not unexciting novel with a humble,
responsible, tender-hearted middle-class parent as a hero. From one point view
it is a perfect picture of the ever-growing tension in–son relationships
nowadays; a picture of a humble, tender-father, <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span>,
facing an irresponsible, ultra-modern, rebellious son, Mali, and at its level
of universality, it presents a sharp and disturbing clash of generations. As an
old widower fondly in love with his son <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span> suffers
the utmost when his son shocks him as a foreign-returned, ostentatiously
business-minded would-be celebrity with nothing but mocks and insults and
sneers for him, his ideas, his humble profession of the vending of sweets. It
is after all with his money and love that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Mali</st1:place></st1:country-region> is enabled to fly foreign and
return ‘<span class=SpellE>foriegn</span>’, as it were, with a charmer from <span
class=GramE>outer</span> Mongolia to be a wife. It is as though the branch
tries to cut itself off the roots from which it derived sustenance and breath.
As for the story of <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span>, only an R. K. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> could depict the pathos and poetry of such a parent
and save the tale from degenerating into the lachrymose sentimentality of a
fumbling, fatuous, old fool of bygone days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

suffers the gall and sorrow, confusion and bewilderment of the traditional,
uncontaminated old Indian generation when sneered at and jettisoned by the
artificial civilisation with its machine-produced literature and strange
values. <i>The Vendor of Sweets </i>is thus from one point of view a vivid
picture of traditional India set against modern India that is being rapidly <span
class=SpellE>westernised</span> and uprooted to be planted in unhealthy alien
soil. Perhaps a synthesis is to be awaited but at present there is only the
widening, deepening gulf of generations, the old rapidly receding into the
background, the new not yet attaining even material prosperity. A stage has to
come, of course, of achieved material prosperity and retained spirituality in <st1:country-region

convincingly the life of the common man in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, with average intelligence,
average practicality and average goodness and average spirituality. When one is
born one should do one’s duty as a man in the world, as a youth, man, father,
and when one becomes old, finally, affect a complete renunciation–it would be
the most accredited procedure according to the scriptures. Thus though there
are many surprises and twists in the story <span class=SpellE>Jagan’s</span> final
act of renunciation from all business, shaking off the painful fetters of
attachments and affections, is entirely in keeping with the general trend of
the novel, and in fact, it has all the sure inevitability of a well-built, and
calculated climax. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

business-mindedness and his adherence to the Gita are apparently incompatible
traits of this simple good man but these contradictory traits are only
superficial because as long as one is in the world, with necessary chains of
love and affection one must “do” something for them, to answer the claims of
the world. He becomes apparently a man of the world with a conscience that
seems to be at once nodding and nagging, with an understanding that is neither
too analytical nor outstandingly spiritual and he remains as one essentially
true to nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

too-loved children, or from pure philosophical <span class=SpellE>searchings</span>.
When that point comes, from whom the inspiration comes and from which
conviction is achieved, we don’t know. And in the story of <i>The Vendor of
Sweets </i>it comes through the strange and mysterious sculptor-disciple, now
turned hair-blackener. He communicates to <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span> his
master’s blissful vision of the supreme five-faced goddess, <span class=SpellE>Gayatri</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Gayatri</span>-mantra being the most universal in its
meaning and significance and the most accredited and indisputable in the whole
world as the supreme mantra for the highest meditation, in order to know and <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> the Supreme, the Ultimate, whose meditation is
incorporated (indeed, it occupies the central part) in the Hindu <span
class=SpellE>Sandhyavandanam</span>, the daily three-time prayer-meditation of
every true Hindu. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

again and again, we see that beneath an apparent puckish lightheartedness,
frivolity and flippancy, a mere no-meaning light entertainment there is in R.
K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> a true sincerity, an intense preoccupation
with the great traditions and values of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He has a loving admiration
for the common man and shows that the average fumbling, blundering, frail
humanity is capable of sterner decisions and solid values and act with
swiftness and alacrity and decision of purpose, and, with the necessary
‘will-power,’ aim at a transcendence, triumph over the petty weaknesses of the
flesh and the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Regarding the technical aspect of the novel, it must
be said that it is most satisfying in simplicity of plan and wonderful symmetry
and arrangement of parts each with exciting twists and sustaining narration.
The central crisis or turning point is well-placed and well-worked out and is,
in the end, merged with the last climax. The last yet greater climax, the act
of renunciation, arises, as it were, out of the earlier climax which is the
sudden baffling decision to give up the preoccupation with the profits and
which gives rise to the symbolic act of reducing the price of the
sweet-packets. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brooding,
melancholy or happy, sad or sapient, musings and half-musings over the past,
the present or the future–these make up the best technique adopted by <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> to recreate in flesh and blood the full personality
of lagan, to lay bare his innermost thoughts and feelings before us. And in the
vague, hazy, foggy reflecting and brooding mind of <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span>
there is something sweet and irresistibly attractive. And in the last long
brooding over the past just before his renunciation we have a most charming,
delicious, nostalgic, reminiscent picture of <span class=SpellE>Jagan’s</span>
past life of youth and marriage. There is a special appeal to the heart as the
author describes the sweet sentiments, the delicate feelings and noble
traditions in Hindu marriages and morals. The description, the recreated
picture, of the married life of <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span> covering a
pretty span of life, from the exact point of his shedding his bachelorhood to
the point of Mali’s estrangement, is very vivid, subtle, delicate yet insinuating
and intoxicating. His present life as the vendor of sweets concerned with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mali</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
education <span class=GramE>etc,</span> is already given in the beginning.
Finally there are the last exciting glimpses of <span class=SpellE>Jagan’s</span>
future life as a completely retired person, retiring from the galling chains of
<span class=SpellE>samsara</span>. Thus, here, we have at one point, somewhat
midway as we proceed with the novel, a triumph of art and symmetry, the meeting
of the three points of climax, a confluence of exciting and charming narratives
and we get at this point a thrilling vision of the past, the present and the
future of the entire novel. And as a work<i> </i>of art, <i>The Vendor of
Sweets </i>has sweetness and sadness, charm and chagrin, ‘old’ morality and the
‘new’ bumper business and <span class=SpellE>Bhagavad</span> Gita, the strings
of <span class=SpellE>samsara</span> and struggle for salvation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>R.
K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> in a way is a distracting though
unobtrusive puzzle to many. Where lies the merit of <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Narayan</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> and what<i> </i>is
his actual achievement that brings him<i> </i>such a stupendous popularity and
higher recognition? Perhaps the answer is<i> </i>that there is <span
class=GramE>a transcendence</span> in R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
which conceals itself. There is a <span class=SpellE>Tennysonian</span>
deceptive simplicity and lightness concealing the depths and complexities of
his art. Here is a good example in Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span>
fiction of art concealing art. Every one is irresistibly attracted to the work
of R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>. A sense of overpowering intimacy is
established and the characters become intimate personalities after our heart.
Perhaps there is simple magic, the magic of delicious and divine <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> that tickles and tantalizes, thrills and illumines,
combining humanity, sympathy and love. He affects this comedic catharsis in the
most compelling and in the most natural way in us. And if one is not to be
driven to distraction and cynicism and depression by the bewildering couple of
modern mechanical and insipid existence, the artificial life of the straining,
confusing, drying modernity one is to take a dip in, nay, a full infusion of,
the healthy, sweet, invigorating life-springs of R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
<span class=SpellE>honour</span> which combines in a unique way life’s comedy
and pathos, sweetness and sadness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

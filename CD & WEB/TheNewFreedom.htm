<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Man has conquered nature and pressed her secrets for his own benefit. Science, physical science, that long-legged giant, has walked from peak to peak as from discovery to discovery and has traversed much of the visible universe. The knowledge of chemistry has made it possible for man to make many things in his laboratory while nature builds them up laboriously in hers on a limited scale. Physics has brought within his reach the tremendous energy that still lies coiled in the atom. This energy when freed and harnessed would turn the great Sahara into an Eden and the frozen poles would become a fair habitat for man. Botany, like her sister science zoology, has yielded her secrets and many new nourishing vegetables and fruits and cereals, proof against bacteria and blight, are growing under man's observant eyes. Psychology and its attendant psycho-analysis are laying bare human repressions to the scorching rays of self-analysis. Mathematics and astronomy are scanning the skies to discover our earth's affinity in other stars. Of daily occurrence are inventions and discoveries which could fain make human life happier and inject more leisure into our feverish activities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the above, we see that the long sought of millennia is almost on us. It would indeed be with us if only we would give it a chance. Man has conquered nature and has established his empire over her by wresting her innermost thoughts from her unwilling bosom. She cannot resist his importunities and has delivered herself for good and all into his trustful hands.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inspite of all this, why is it that there is so much misery and distrust among men? For the simple reason, while being busy in bending nature to his needs man has failed to surpass himself. He looks at himself with complacent insouciance and glories in his victories over his environment and little he thinks of himself, as one destined to become a superman. Man, looked at from this slant, is a glorious failure. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realising this lapse in him, one or two of his own kind have risen in every clime and among every people to point him his real destiny. They say that just as you have conquered turbulent, unruly, disobedient nature, by understanding her secrets, you can with equal success be a master of your desires, passions and achievements. Impugn yourself before the bar where you are the judge, jury, the accused as well the accuser, and pass the verdict of guilty or not on yourself. Man has let himself be valued by others; he has for long ages been arraigned and adjudged. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy for things to be so: as who of us wants to think? A very difficult process indeed. Let others do it for us. But, no! says the thundering voice of those of our kind who have surpassed themselves: &quot;There is freedom, the greatest heritage of man.&quot; This is a new freedom to which mankind is not accustomed and feels there is something unholy in it and it says in effect: &quot;It is unholy that man should be his own master. He has created a God, the monitor, whose perpetual slave he wishes to be.&quot;</P><P ALIGN="center"><A HREF="CONTENTSjuly1929.htm"><IMG SRC="Image245.jpg" BORDER=0 WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=48></A></P></BODY>

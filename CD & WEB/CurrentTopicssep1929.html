<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE MADRAS SEVA SADAN</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Madras Seva Sadan has grown out of the pre-existing institution known as ‘The Women's Home of Service,’ which was the result of the tireless activities of a small group of women in Madras like Mrs. Cousins, Lady Sadasiva Iyer, Mrs. Lakshman Rau and Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi. When Mrs. Cousins left for England, it was thought that ‘The Women's</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Home of Service’ would serve a useful and better purpose, if its working was entrusted to an institution like the Seva Sadan of Poona, and a permanent fund started for its working. Mr. G. K Devadhar, M. A,, C. I. E. of Poona and the President of the Seva Sadan undertook the working of the local institution on a certain basis, with the result that ‘The Women's Home of Service’ changed into the Madras Seva Sadan. We are told that &quot;later on it was felt that in the interests of both the Madras and Poona organisations, the former was to be entirely independent not only in respect to finance but in every respect&quot;; so that the Madras Seva Sadan has officially nothing to do with the greater Poona Seva Sadan Society with its network of branches and affiliated institutions all over Western India. The report of the Madras Seva Sadan gives a glimpse into the working of a really good and efficient institution and incidentally shows how if only some of our influential and prominent women care, they could run such institutions with the greatest credit to themselves and to the community at large. What the community is today concerned is not so much with the University education as it is with the question of a real, proper scheme of adult education for the masses; and in what manner such a scheme of adult education for women of the province could be worked out is really a speculation. The starting of an institution like the Seva Sadan has, we feel sure, gone a long way towards the realisation of such an ideal. We gather from the report we have the pleasure of reviewing, that the Madras Seva Sadan does satisfy a crying need; that it affords occupation to poor and otherwise helpless women to earn a livelihood. Mrs. Venkata Subba Rao, the energetic Honorary Secretary, is throwing herself heart and soul into the work and we are grateful to her for the really splendid work she and her husband are doing. As the Rt. Hon. Mr. Sastri has said, &quot;To dare to narrow one's range, to define one's aim precisely and to labour persistently till results are achieved, are the virtues of public life.&quot; We are glad Mrs. Venkata Subba Rao possesses an uncommon share of this virtue, and we hope too she will be a real servant of the community with a record of useful activity. We wish the institution all success.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HONOURING ANDHRA JOURNALISTS </P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We join most heartily in the chorus of congratulations to the <I>Andhra Patrika </I>and the <I>Krishna Patrika </I>on the celebration of their jubilee. In point of prosperity, influence and wide circulation, the Andhra journals, whether they are dailies, weeklies or monthlies, compare very unfavourably with similar ventures in Bengal, Gujerat and Maharashtra. Not even the foremost of the Telugu papers has attained the enormous circulation of the <I>Kesari </I>of Poona, the <I>Navajivan </I>of Ahmedabad, or the <I>Basumati </I>and <I>Prabasi </I>of Calcutta. Nearer home, the <I>Swadesamitran </I>has a daily circulation of at least three times that of the <I>Andhra Patrika, </I>and the Tamils have four daily papers as against a single Telugu daily. But this is no indication of the number of readers. We remember, several years ago, Mr. Ramananda Chatterjee of <I>The Modern Review, </I>complaining bitterly that whereas ten men do not wear the same coat or use the same pair of shoes, they nevertheless read the same copy of a paper, Conditions in Bengal have probably changed but the statement continues to be pre-eminently true of Andhra.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For patriotic fervour and that touch of idealism that makes men suffer for the things considered really worth doing, the journalists of Andhra are truly remarkable. Who has not heard of the noble sacrifices made by our greatest living journalist, Sri M. Krishna Rao of the <I>Krishna Patrika </I>and by younger men like Annapurnaiah of the <I>Congress </I>and Govindachari of <I>Satyagrahi? </I>These papers, despite their limited subscribers’ roll have rendered splendid service to the cause of progress and culture. Mr. Krishna Rao's brilliant editorials have shaped the thought and expression of a whole generation of Andhras. Among the papers that have closed down for want of public support, mention must be made of Mr. Srirama Sastri's <I>Sarada. </I>During the two or three years of its life it was indeed a thing of supreme beauty, worthy of ranking with the finest journals in India. <I>Sahiti, Sakhi </I>and <I>Jayanti </I>were admirable productions but, like many similar efforts in Andhra, they have suffered an undeserved eclipse. But are there not always some who serve even by their failures?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Nageswara Rao's advent into the field of Andhra journalism was an event of great importance. Started as a bright little weekly in far-off Bombay in 1908, the <I>Andhra Patrika </I>was transplanted to Madras in 1914 and almost immediately converted into a Daily. The historian of Andhra progress during these two decades is bound to acknowledge with gratefulness the achievements of the <I>Andhra Patrika. </I>In the forming and directing of public opinion on momentous issues like Non-co-operation, and in the collection and dissemination of news from all quarters of the globe, the <I>Andhra Patrika </I>is second to no vernacular daily in India. It has an efficient editorial and reporting staff at Headquarters and capable correspondents in all important places. Illustrious patriots like G. Harisarvothama Rao and Challa Seshagiri Rao have given to it of their best and made it a power in the land. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Andhra, it is not more papers that we want but a greater variety of them. We should like, for instance, to have papers like <I>The Nation and Athenaeum </I>and <I>The London Mercury </I>devoted to literary topics, or <I>The Round Table </I>dealing with political questions from the scholar's point of view. Ladies’ magazines and magazines for children are badly needed. The financial resources of the Telugu journals must be ample enough to permit of constant and liberal payment to writers. This, in turn, depends on a wider circulation and the growth of the habit of <I>purchasing </I>papers. If the organisers of the celebrations in honour of our journalists can prevail upon their countrymen to enlist as subscribers in much larger numbers, they will have rendered a greater service to the cause of Andhra journalism than by the presentation of caskets and addresses, though even these last are valuable as evidences of public recognition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE LATE PROF. S. M. PARANJPYE.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The passing of the late Prof. Shivram Mahadev Paranjpye at Poona, removes from the field of politics and literature of Maharashtra the figure of a truly great man. Having sat at the feet of venerable men like Vishnusastri Chiplonkar and Dr. Bhandarkar, Shivarampant left the Fergusson College after a somewhat stormy career. Later on, he graduated from the Deccan College and took the M.A. in Sanskrit, winning at the same time the Zhala Prize and Bhagavandas scholarships. The stormy career at the college was followed by an equally stormy career of ceaseless public activity. Almost following upon his graduation, he started the <I>Kal </I>paper. <I>Kal </I>in less than three months after its inception became a terror to the bureaucracy. The <I>Kesari </I>of Lokamanya and the <I>Kal </I>of Paranjpye stood shoulder to shoulder, like Bheema and Arjuna of old, fighting freedom's battle and exposing the utter bankruptcy of British statesmanship in the early years of the 20th century. As a result of this, in less than ten years, a wonderful of national consciousness swept over the great Maratha country, and there was not one Maharashtreeya who did not feel ennobled to a great duty and sense of civic responsibility, after he came to know the <I>Kal </I>and its great Editor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then came the Government crushing agitators, stilling the speech of all men and women who loved freedom. The Press Act followed and Mr. Paranjpye fell a victim. He was sentenced to hard labour for 19 months. Even today few men could read his wonderful article on the <I>Well of Cawnpore </I>without getting thrilled, and how many Indians are aware that even today, in spite of many things, the well at Cawnpore is closed to Indians? But the flame was not to be quenched, which had first illumined the little dark corner of Maharashtra. Others followed and poured out their lives and energy like water on a thirsty soil. Out of the prison again, the Non-co-operation movement found in him a staunch supporter; afterwards came the Mulshi Satyagraha, and then the inevitable breakdown–physical and mental.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the name of Prof. Paranjpye will be cherished more as a Sanskrit scholar and an exquisite writer of Marathi prose, and as an outpost in Marathi literature than as a politician. He represented the typical Marathi temperament, rugged as the hills that surrounded him, plain and great to the end; giving shelter when it could and yet maintaining itself, and watching the spirit of the time passing it by. That is how one remembers the aged powerful professor. No one can ever forget that ornate speech he made last year as the President of the <I>Sammelan </I>at Belgaum, and to what heights he rose as he spoke of the glorious past of a unique race and the future that lay before it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some men who vulgarise, like Disraeli, whatever they touch–poetry, art and literature, whilst there are others who ennoble whatever they touch like Mr. Gandhi or Mr. J<I>. </I>Krishnamurti. Mr. Paranjpye did neither of the above, nor did he do colossal things. But he did one beautiful thing. He showed by his personal example what a dignified thing was life and how each man, provided he had the desire, could rise to great heights, and yet be simple, sweet and pure all through. It is difficult to estimate the result of such a loss. Maharashtra is the poorer by his loss, but it is richer by his sacrifice, by the message he left.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STUDENTS AND RURAL RECONSTRUCTION</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. C. R. Reddy never speaks without saying something which arrests our attention and stimulates our interest. The clear applications of knowledge to the practical concerns of life is one of the predominant traits of Mr. Reddy's mental composition. Hypothetical dogmas are at a discount with him. In his latest address as the President of the All-Orissa Students’ Conference, he has suggested certain lines of activity for the students, directly calculated not only to develop their powers of organisation but also to rescue the inarticulate masses of people in the rural areas from the slough of ignorance. The scheme adumbrated by Mr. Reddy is one to which no party can take exception. In fact, all parties have advocated it but none of them has laid so much emphasis, as Mr. Reddy has done, on the contribution of students to this aspect of nation-building. Young in years, emotional by nature, and energetic in action, the students can do lasting good to this impoverished land by devoting their leisure on week-end holidays and especially during summer vacation by carrying the torch of enlightenment into the villages where live the bulk of our population. We hope that Mr. Reddy's clarion call will rouse young India to patriotic action in working the scheme of Rural Reconstruction successfully and advancing the cause of the nation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE RICKETY AFGHAN THRONE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unique circumstance in the Mghan imbroglio is the passing of the country under the regime of four sovereigns in the course of an year. When the Revolution was at its highest pitch, Amanullah abdicated. Inayatullah immediately stepped into his shoes but soon found too many stones in them and he had also to abdicate. It appeared as if Bacha-i-Sakko, the water-carrier's son and adventurer who captured the Afghan throne, would have a long lease of regal life but Fate was not kinder to him. Only a few days ago, General Nadir Khan, the Generalissimo of the victorious forces in the Civil war, was acclaimed by the Afghan National Assembly as the present ruler. The furious welter through which Afghanistan has been passing since the commencement of the internecine strife, the fierce turmoil especially created by the tribal communities living in the impregnable mountain frontiers, and the religious fanaticism of the Mullahs which is always a dangerous and an unreliable factor, point out that in, establishing order out of chaos, General Nadir Khan has manifested a statesmanship, a martial prowess, and an undaunted courage of the highest order. There is amongst certain sections of the people a feeling that Nadir Khan is not entitled to their support in view of his supposed leanings towards Amanullah. Bacha's spirit continues to be restless. He made a desperate effort against Amir Nadir Khan with the aid of Said Hussain but could not overcome the opposition offered by Shah Mahomed. A short fight resulted in heavy loss to both sides, a truce was declared, negotiations were commenced, and Bacha's emissaries were even enjoying the Amir's hospitality. But that phase too soon passed. The latest messages state that the rebel was captured at Jabul Siraj on the 23rd of October and that he sent his allegiance to Nadir Khan. It is interesting to note that the personnel of the Amir's Government includes several persons who served Amanullah, though they are now to handle different portfolios. It may be expected that the war-clouds hanging thick over Afghanistan will now disappear and Nadir Khan will restore order under a clear and bright sky. But will he be so selfless as to invite Amanullah back to his country and his throne.? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. In this connection, Amanullah's message from Rome to the new Afghan Ruler is of especial significance:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My dear brother, in the name of the progress of the country and the joint mission of our party&quot;, says Amanullah, &quot;I will always be with you in the capacity of a devotee to Afghanistan, so that my country may be stabilised in progress and civilisation. So far as my person is concerned, I will always help you from the core of my heart. I will always remain with the devoted party, and wish your welfare. In my sacred mission, it is equal to sit on a throne or a plank or to wear the crown or put a feather on the hat. It does not mean that I have to regain the lost crown and throne. When I had them I did not care much for them. I had rather annulled them. The chief term and condition is that there should be no departure from the programme set by me for education in Afghanistan.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is quite characteristic of the great man who created a new Afghanistan, though it unfortunately created unlimited trouble for him. What ultimately happens none can tell with any degree of accuracy. He is bold, indeed, who predicts about the rickety Afghan throne.</P><P ALIGN="center"><A HREF="CONTENTSsep1929.htm"><IMG SRC="Image245.jpg" BORDER=0 WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=48></A></P></BODY>

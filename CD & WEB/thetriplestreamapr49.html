<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>THE inauguration of the United
States of Rajastan by Sardar Patel is an event of historic significance,
Compared with the great medieval kingdoms of Udaipur and Jaipur, the other
Indian States which have formed themselves into Unions are of but yesterday.
The Maratha chieftains battled with the later Mughals and achieved the partial
emancipation of India before her submission to British rule. But the fight of
the Rajputs against foreign invaders covers a thousand years of our history.
Enshrined in the bardic tales of the <i>charans </i>and retold by the good Colonel
Tod, the saga of Rajput heroism has nourished generations of Indians and
brought them hope in the recent struggles for freedom, Samarsi and Pratap
continue to light the nation’s path, and it was splendid of Sardar Patel to
have recalled the dream of Rana Pratap <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt'>and
announced the fulfilment of that dream under the aegis of his descendant, the
present Maharana of Udaipur who becomes Maharajpramukh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a democratic age, the rulers of the Rajput States, as indeed of all Indian
States, must adapt themselves to the conditions arising out of the new freedom,
and function as the servants of the people and as the custodians of an age-long
culture. Along with other talented citizens, the members of the ancient ruling
houses can hold positions in the Defence and Diplomatic services or become
constitutional Heads of Provinces. In these spheres, they start with an initial
advantage in the shape of intellectual equipment and administrative experience.
Whatever gifts the scions of these families may possess must be placed at the
service of the nation, even as the wealth and resources of the States are being
utilised for the benefit of All-India, The States’ people who were obliged to
lead an isolated existence are rapidly taking their place in great stream of
Indian humanity. And Jaipur, which held the first session of the National
Congress after the achievement of independence, will play a notable part as the
capital of a new and glorious Rajastan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the Prime Ministers of the Dominions meet in
London, the relationship of the independent Republic of India to the
Commonwealth have to be decided. There is no longer any doubt about the nature
of the declaration by the Indian Constituent Assembly regarding India’s
Constitutional position. A sovereign democratic republic, free from all outside
interference, has been the dream of Indian patriots. But association for
certain limited purposes is different from interference, and independent
nations have always found it an advantage to establish friendly relations with
each other. Such relations are usually economic, but they might also be
political. With the attainment of freedom, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan have
taken their places alongside of Canada or Australia as autonomous units of a
political organisation, in which the only visible link between the units is the
King of England. Since owing allegiance to a monarch is inconsistent with the
conception of a Republic, the sponsors of the London Conference are, from all
accounts, devising formula by which even Republics like India and Eire might
continue to be members of the Commonwealth, occupying a position different from
that of the older member whose loyalty to the Crown is based on genuine
sentiment and whose ties with England are in the nature of cousinhood. Certain
details like the acceptance of the King of England as the first citizen of the
Commonwealth and the notion of ‘mutual citizenship’ as between one Commonwealth
country and another, do not seem to have commended themselves to the Indian leaders.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is difficult, but not altogether impossible, to evolve a formula on the basis
of “association, but no entanglement”. The Western Union, the Atlantic Pact,
and the Commonwealth seem to be steps towards </span><span style='font-size:

forces on the side of Democracy as against the onrush of Communist
totalitarianism. The anxiety of Pandit Nehru not to plunge </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
into the vortex of Big power politics is evident. He has repeatedly assured his

groups. But in a world fast align</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

maintenance of formal neutrality may be con</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ditioned by the
provision of military bases within our borders. When Gandhiji wanted the
British to ‘quit India’, he was prepared, for the period of the war, to give
all facilities to the Anglo-American forces to combat Japan. It would then have
been, according to him, a free India voluntarily conceding a privilege to a
friendly power. But Gandhiji was thinking of conditions already in existence:
the Allied troops in were in India, utilising Indian resources for war
purposes. He would not turn them out and make their task of winning the war
more difficult. But can India, in a different context, submit to the occupation
of her soil, by powers, however friendly, and the utilisation of her resources
for the purposes of a war in which she is a neutral?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and other implications of association with the Commonwealth must be examined in
detail before India can commit herself to such association. It is clear that
England and Canada are anxious to India within the Commonwealth on the least
onerous terms. Even as a factor in favour of peace, India’s position is unique.
She has no previous record of exploitation of other peoples, no ambition to
spread herself beyond her borders, no desire to play the role of a dictator.
Her </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The three-man committee appointed by the Jaipur
Congress has reported to the Working Committee, and the latter has endorsed the
recommendations. There is an air of finality about the report: obviously, there
can be no appeal against the unanimous decision of three exalted individuals
like the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the President of the
Congress. In their approach to the problem of linguistic Provinces, these
leaders are in general agreement with the Dhar Committee. They seem to feel that
the claim to linguistic Provinces is a disintegrating factor, running counter
to the movement for integration in the shape of the merger and union of the
States. They desire to postpone the issue for a few years, until more pressing
problems are tackled. Karnataka and Kerala can become separate units if the
States of Mysore, Travancore, and Cochin agree to merge with the Provinces. On
no account, says the Report, will areas of Indian Union territory be handed
over to the States. The men of Poona, and the men of Nagpur and Amraoti must
settle between themselves whether they will come together in a united
Maharashtra or remain separate. The Andhras can have their Province earlier
than others, provided they ‘abandon’ their claims to the city of Madras. Whereas
the Dhar Committee wanted both the cities of Bombay and Madras to be distinct
political <i>entities, </i>the present Committee take a different line with
regard to Madras which, according to them, must go exclusively to Tamil Nad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Congress has all along held the view that the re-distribution of Provinces on
the basis of language is a step towards a proper re-integration of India into
fairly homogeneous units of a federation. Whenever informed critics classed the
demand for linguistic Provinces with that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pakistan, top-ranking
Congressmen repudiated the suggestion. The vehemence with which the advocates
of linguistic Provinces have pressed their case after the advent of freedom,
and the frequent wrangles between them over unessential details, have led the
Committee</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> to plead for a little breathing time in which
controversies may subside and every problem viewed in a correct perspective.
One important concession they make is that a democratic government cannot
oppose a claim strongly supported by public opinion in a particular area. It is
clear that no new Provinces will be formed till after the new Constitution
begins to function. But since the case for an Andhra Province is comparatively
simple and can be investigated with the least disturbance of existing conditions,
steps may be taken even under the present Government of India Act to carve out
the Telugu-speaking areas of the Madras Presidency into an administrative unit.
But this depend on the readiness of the Andhra leaders to give up finally their
claims to the city of Madras. In this particular matter, the Committee is more
retrograde than the Dhar Commission. The case of Madras is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>very
similar to that of Bombay, and both of them ought to be treated as cosmopolitan
cities under the control of the Central Government, without being tacked on to
a particular linguistic Province. The attitude of the Committee in making the
present offer to the Andhras is very much like the offer made in 1947 to the
Indian leaders through Lord Mountbatten,–the offer of independence conditioned
by the partition of the country. But since the offer comes from our own
national leaders, it can be accepted without loss of dignity. The early
formation of an Andhra Province is eminently desirable. As regards Madras City,
it is not unlikely that public opinion will soon crystallise in favour of its
being ultimately constituted into an independent unit like Bombay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
demand for the formation of the Provinces of Kerala, Karnataka, and Maharashtra
is as insistent as the demand for Andhra. The Committee have virtually invited
widespread agitation in these areas, and in response to such agitation the
Constituent Assembly will be obliged to mention these Provinces in the
Schedule. The Union of Travancore and Cochin has been welcomed in many parts of
Kerala as the prelude to an Aikya Kerala. The Kannadigas have been the worst
sufferers under the present maladjustment of administrative boundaries. There
is a large section among them which would prefer to have a Karnataka Province
out of the Kannada areas of Bombay and Madras, instead of waiting indefinitely
for the merger of Mysore. The citizens of Mysore are opposed to the practical
extinction of their State. “A few years” is a vague term, and the Government of
India would be acting in conformity with public opinion, so often expressed, by
moving for the inclusion of these Provinces in the Schedule. That will lead to
contentment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

most Provinces of India, the leader of the Congress Legislative Party is
elected annually. But while in other Provinces the same leader, is unanimously
re-elected, Madras has the unenviable distinction of changing its Premier
almost every year. This leads to an annual political earthquake in the Southern
Presidency. The four linguistic units involved in this process have a chance to
exhibit their differences periodically. The rumbling of the earthquake is heard
months in advance, and its reverberations continue for months afterwards. For
long stretches of time every year, the provincial administration is almost
paralysed because the Party chiefs who occupy seats in the Cabinets are
pre-occupied with the coming election. No one is sure of his own continuance in
office: the election is like a lucky dip, and the most unexpected names turn up
at the last moment. Personal and group loyalties are dominant and the process
of bargaining between group leaders is without end. The Province is tired of
the wrangles between the contesting claimants to office. And yet,–more is the
pity–they are all Congressmen who played a part in the freedom struggle and
built up public life in their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

by a narrow majority instead of by the unanimous vote of the Party, deprives
them of the initiative and the prestige associated with real leadership. The
experience of the past few years has proved that Sri Kamaraj Nadar is the power

Sri Kamaraj, his exit from office is certain. What the late Sir P. T.

after his election as leader, Sri Kumaraswami Raja made a graceful speech and
invited co-operation from the groups which voted for Dr. Subbaroyan, But the
confabulations before and after his visit to Delhi led to nothing.And so, while
the Premier is new, the old team of Ministers continues with a few minor
alterations. Why a Minister of the calibre of Sri T. S. Avinashilingam is
dropped in favour of comparatively obscure individuals passes one’s
comprehension. Men of outstanding ability and experience who could have lent
ditinction to the Cabinet are not in it. The Province of Madras, intellectually
in the front rank among the Provinces and States of India, has been badly let
down by the Congress Legislators. Neither the Rashtrapati nor the other members
of the Congress High Command have made a determined effort to end the squabbles
within the Party and instal a more efficient Ministry. The stock of the
Congress is very low in this Province, and the average Congressman is
bewildered by the rapid decline in the influence wielded by that great
organisation. And for the moment, he is a helpless spectator; the general
election is so far away in the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the point of view of ultimate values, the honour done to Sri Dwaram
Venkataswami Naidu by the art-lovers of Madras is vastly more important than
the change-over from one Premier to another. In presiding over the function at
Rajaji Hall on the 26th of March, His Excellency the Maharaja of Bhavnagar was
acting not only as the first citizen of the Province but also as a cultivated
Indian nobleman to whom Art is of vital significance in a nation’s life.
Vizianagaram, the city from which Sri Venkataswami Naidu hails, has for
centuries been associated with the patronage of learning and the fine arts. The
tradition of Ananda Gajapati persists, and Sri Naidu is a living symbol of that
tradition. He is an artist of a type that is being rare. To him, as to
Thyagaraja, music is a means of reaching out to the Infinite. In technical
skill and in perfect mastery over the violin, Sri Naidu is equal to the most
eminent exponents of the art. His repertoire is more varied, for he is equally
at home in the Karnatic and Hindustani styles, and is familiar with Indian
folk-tunes and western airs. But it is the utter dedication to his art which
has brought him the distinction he now enjoys. Shy and aloof like a scholar, he
avoids publicity. He is happiest in the company of kindred spirits, more
especially the younger artists who have lighted their lamps from his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a distinguished gathering that met to honour him. Two great connoisseurs
like the Chief Justice of Madras and the President of the Legislative Council
participated in the function and paid eloquent tributes to the master
violinist. There was a purse and a casket, rich apparel and flowers, all
reminiscent of the Courts of cultured Indian monarchs. But the unique nature of
the function lay in the spontaneous homage of the people to one among
themselves who had scaled the heights of artistic achievement. The freedom that
India has won acquires a special meaning when the people cherish the arts and
pride themselves as partakers of the glory that belongs to artists like Sri
Naidu. Today he is an all-India figure; he is among the elect who have heralded
the renaissance of Indian Art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

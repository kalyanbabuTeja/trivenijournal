after she had reached college and entered the lecture-room, the rain settled
down to a steady downpour. The rain-drops made a strange, soft music, and the students
sat looking dreamily out, paying no attention to the voice of the history
lecturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the lecturer’s chair drops were falling tappa-tappa-tappa through a leak in the
roof. Presently he, too, began to feel that this was no time to give a lecture,
so he turned to a book in which he was soon engrossed. More black clouds slowly
gathered and, gradually, the lecture-room became darker as the rain began to
fall more heavily. Every now and then a cold rain-laden wind swept over the
students who drew their coats more tightly round them and huddled close
together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lila and her companions sat talking, she would every now and then look out at
the green grass swaying in the wind and at the green grasshoppers leaping
joyously in the rain. Presently, Venkateswarulu left the room and stood on the
verandah looking now at Lila and now at the rain; four or five of his friends
got up to join him. The lecturer was dosing over his book while Venkateswarulu
continued glancing at Lila as he talked to his friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
gust of wind swept over the students and Lila, looking at the rain, was filled
with memories of her schooldays. As she sat dreaming, every incident of those
days rose clearly in her mind. That was long, long ago! She was a child, then;
she may have been some ten years old. Both she and Venkateswarula were in the
first form; he must have been about twelve and, oh! how mischievous he was! One
day, after the second period, the teacher had dismissed all the children for
break and Poorna and Lila went with the others for a drink of water in the
courtyard. Poorna finished drinking first and walked back to the class-room
without hearing Lila calling to her to wait. When Lila joined Poorna in the
room, the teacher for the third period had not yet come, so she sighed with
relief and sat down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poorna
came up close and told her that she had seen Venkateswarulu touching her books
and slipping something into one of them. This annoyed Lila and she searched
through the books until she found a piece of paper. She started reading but
could make neither head nor tail of it, at first, for the writing was quite
illegible. At last, however, she managed to make out: “Please come to play with
me this evening; I have something to tell you,” then there followed two or
three sentences as illegible as the first, and Lila felt quite upset.
Meanwhile, all the other girls had crept up from behind and were trying to read
the letter; then, tittering and giggling, they returned to their seats. Poor
Lila was so embarrassed that, for quite a moment, she could think of nothing </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>at
all. How she wished she had found this letter when she was alone! Then she
might have kept calm. “The Teacher is coming,” whispered </span><span

“show him the letter.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the teacher entered the class-room, he noticed that all the girls were
giggling. “What’s the matter?” he asked. Ah well, it could not be helped, so
Lila quickly took the letter and placed it in his hands. He read it through
quickly, then looked up sternly at the class. “You little dolts!” he said and
waited a moment or two; then he spoke again: “Tell me who wrote this,” he said.
“If you tell the truth, you won’t be punished.” The children sat ‘like squashed
lice.’ Again the teacher demanded who had written the note, and still nobody
answered. “Tell me at once, or I’ll have the whole class stand on the benches!”
Even then nobody spoke. Then the teacher turned to Lila: “Who do you think
wrote this letter, Lila?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

four or five months before this had taken place, Venkateswarulu had nicknamed
Lila, the Pumpkin, and the name had soon spread throughout the school. After
the letter incident, however, the teasing of Lila passed all bounds although
nobody could catch the boy at it. To Lila’s growing annoyance, the letters of
the nickname appeared one by one over the benches and walls of the school
house; it went so far that she began to be afraid of walking alone to school! How
angry she was at being teased like that; oh, what a naughty boy he was in those
days! Those days, however, had passed away and everybody had now forgotten the
nickname. It must all have happened quite five or six years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lila and Venkateswarulu matriculated the same year, and both entered the same
college and were placed in the same section. She wondered now whether he still
remembered how he used to tease her, and she still felt shy to look at him.

peon came into the lecture room and handed a note to the lecturer. He woke up
with a start from his dose and read the note aloud to the class: it was a
notice about the debate that was to be held that same evening. After the
announcement the room was filled with laugher, coughing, giggling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evening had set in, the students of the Intermediate Section were already going
into the hall where the debate was to be held; soon the hall was packed. The
rain, lifting little by little, had finally stopped, while drop followed drop
from the eaves. A few crows sheltering in a banyan tree were cawing softly to
themselves, and a squirrel crept daintily along a branch, stopping every few steps
to sit up and eat something between its paws. Through the black clouds that
still chased across the skies, an occasional ray of sunlight slanted out and
played over the soft green of the grass. Twilight was slowly deepening as the
debate began. The electric lights were switched on and, in the sudden glare,
the debaters blinked uneasily. This evening it was the Lecturer in History who
was presiding over the debate; at his instance, some of the girls joined in. By
and by it was Lila’s turn to speak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

begins slowly but, as she speaks, her tempo increases. The entire hall listens
in complete silence, even the lizards on the walls seem to be listening; a few
insects whirl round the lights–they alone are moving. On the whole, Lila is
speaking well and all the students sit attentively hearing her; yet, just as
her speech is drawing to a close, somebody starts coughing loudly. At once two,
three, four, five...the whole hall is coughing. The chairman raps on the table
and orders silence; one by one the coughs stop. Again a cough; everybody looks
in that direction. The chairman, looking at Venkateswarulu, speaks in English:
“You seem to have a bad cough.” Venkateswarulu stands up obediently: “Yes,
Sir,” he replies, also in English, and the hall resounds with roars of
laughter. The chairman looks sternly at the students, then tells Lila to finish
her speech.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lila’s eloquence becomes quite impressive; even those who had scoffed are swept
away by the torrent of her oratory. As she finishes, the hall resounds again
with applause and shouts; proudly, Lila walks back to her seat and the girls
all congratulate her profusely. Lila herself feels that she has spoken well,
yet she also feels dissatisfied; she feels as though there had been something
lacking in her speech. What was that something? When everybody was listening so
attentively, why should Venkateswarulu have created a disturbance? Of course,
he was just teasing, but why should he go on teasing her?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lila was going home in her carriage, some words floated across to her: “How are
they selling pumpkins in the market?” This question was greeted with much
laughter and, in that laughter, Lila recognized Venkateswarulu’s voice, and it
made her wonder. That night she could not sleep for thinking of Venkateswarulu
and his teasing. Since coming to college she had often heard the word pumpkin,
but she had not minded it at all; but now that Venkateswarulu had laughed over
it with the other boys, she felt stung as though by a scorpion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

week or so passed. One day Lila was reading in her room; the early morning
sunshine was falling on the <i>mandara </i>blossom outside. The flowers stood
out clearly in the sunlight and, as she looked, a tiny sunbird alighted on a
twig. It was like a small yellow lemon; with its tiny beak it drank honey from
the flowers, and Lila fotgot her books as she watched it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

postman opened the door and placed a letter op the table. Lila wondered at the
handwriting on the envelope; it was not that of any of her girl friends.
Vaguely troubled, she started reading the letter; as she read, her hands began
atrembling with her sudden surprise and excitement. She had never expected this
to happen: poor boy, he was asking her forgiveness! Lila’s eyes shone as she
read those dear words. Quickly, she bolted the door and began reading the
letter all over again. Again she read it; two, three times and, as she read,
contentment, joy, pride swelled in her heart, and two tears slowly fell from
her eyes. She folded the letter carefully and placed it in her bosom. Yes, she
must treasure it like her life. Why could she not just as well have locked it
up in her box? Ah, because this was the letter in which Venkateswarulu was
begging forgiveness for having teased her...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

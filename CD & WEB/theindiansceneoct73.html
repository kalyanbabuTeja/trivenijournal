outstanding event <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in the </span>quarter
October–December 1973, is the five-day visit to New <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Delhi of </span>Leonard Brezhnev, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>the </span>Communist Party Chief of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Minister, </span>Srimati Indira Gandhi, and
the conclusion <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>fifteen-year
Agreement on Economic Co-operation between the two countries. This <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>another <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>symbol of </span>the growing friendship between India and the USSR
which began about <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>1955 </span>when
Khrushchev and Bulganin visited India which reached a s<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>ort of </span>climax in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>1971 </span>when
the Indo-Soviet Treaty of friendship and c<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

</span>It <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is well- known</span> <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>how </span>this treaty c<span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the war with Pakistan <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>December 1971 and to the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>liberation of </span>Bangladesh. It <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>also </span>enabled India to occup<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>y </span>a leading role both politically and
militarily <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>South and
South-East Asia. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>The </span>recent
visit of Brezhnev goes a great deal towards assuring India that she has a genuine
and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>reliable </span>friend <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>USSR who will come to her rescue
wheneve<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>r </span>necessary. This was
made specially clear in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the </span>speeches
he made at the public reception given to him in the Red Fort and in the
Parliament. This constitutes <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the m</span>ain
significance <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>his visit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Such
an assurance was necessary because there was an apprehension in India that the
detente between <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the </span>USSR and
the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>USA which resulted from </span>Brezhnev’s
visit to Washington some months earlier and the growing economic co-operation
between the USSR and the West might lead to the weakening <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>ties between India and <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>USSR. </span>Such a view was expressed by
our Prime Minister in June last immediately after she came <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>know <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>the detente. She was afraid that the detente might result <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in the t</span>wo super-powers carving the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>world </span>into <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>two </span>spheres <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>influence
and pursuing agreed politics to the detriment of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>other </span>countries. Such a thing happened in International affairs
in the past and it would not be surprising or strange if <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it </span>happened again. <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>It w</span>as a game in <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>which </span>the great powers accustomed to <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Soviet leaders immediately recognised the force of her views and took the
earliest opportunity to remove her fears. Prime Minister Kosygm told on June 29
a delegation of the Indo-Soviet Friendship Society which met him in Moscow that
the Soviet-American detente was not directed towards a joint attempt to dictate
to other peoples, that the USSR always stood by the side of India in her
difficult days and that in view of the Treaty of 1971 India could depend on Moscow’s
help at all times. The visit of Brezhnev was in a way aimed at strengthening
the assurance given by Kosygin and it has succeeded in achieving the aim to an <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>appreciable extent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
his address to both Houses of Parliament Brezhnev referred to the detente and
even went to the extent of complimenting the American leadership (something
rare in Soviet references to America) for its ‘political realism, and an
awareness of the demands of time in having forged a detente with Soviet Union.
This has not led to any adverse criticism in Parliament or elsewhere. India now
understands the Soviet attitude in the matter. Though it is not quite clear
whether the explanations given by the Soviet Chief completely satisfied our
Prime Minister, it is significant that in the joint declaration issued at the
end of his visit there is the statement: “The Prime Minister of India welcomes
the detente between the USSR and the USA as a step towards relaxation of
tension in the world.” This goes to show that there is a better understanding
of the subject between the two countries and this is a point of great value to
both of them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
visit is of significance from the political standpoint in another way. There is
in the joint declaration little reference to China. Readers are aware that the
relations between USSR and China are highly strained. There are ideological
differences between the two countries even though both belong to the Socialist
and the anti-imperialist camp and there are also disputes regarding border
areas. One reason for USSR coming closer to India is her need for a reliable
political ally in the third world of sufficient weight in her diplomatic war
with China. In spite of this she is not averse to India’s present attempts to
normalise her relations with China. This is in contrast to the attitude which
Soviet leaders displayed five years ago when Mr. Fryubui said that what
surprised the Soviet Union most was that India spoke of reconciliation after
she was abused and humiliated by Peking. In those days some leaders in Moscow
even feared that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>India </span>might
forge an <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>alliance with </span>China to
the disadvantage of USSR. The fact that in the joint declaration there is <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>little </span>reference to China shows that
Soviet leaders now better appreciate the stand of India in the matter, and
recognise India’s right to shape her policies as she best understands them.
There <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>a limit beyond which
it is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>not </span>prudent for them to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>impose their </span>views on the Government
of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
unwillingness to impose <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>their </span>views
on India is also shown in respect of the subject of Asian security. It was in <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>1967 </span>that Brezhnev enunciated his
doctrine of Asian security–doctrine which invited the countries of South and
South-East Asia to come closer together and enter into a Sort of alliance in <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the </span>interests of common security. He
has not however spelled <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>out at </span>any
time all <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the </span>implications and
details of such an alliance, though he has been quite keen on <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it. </span>In <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>his discussions </span>with Indira Gandhi it came up for consideration
and he <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>also </span>referred to it in
his address to the Indian Parliament. He pointed out that conditions were at
present favourable for the conclusion of such a security pact. <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>But </span>it did not make any appeal to our
Prime Minister. The situation in Asia is very much different from that in
Europe where there are only two blocs–the Atlantic community with which <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>USA </span>is associated and the Warsaw Pact
countries under Soviet leadership. It is not difficult to arrive at some
understanding between them. Not so in Asia where there are too many causes of
tension between country and country. Moreover an Asian security Pact under the
initiative of USSR will rouse <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the </span>suspicion
of China and will add to tensions instead of easing them. India’s stand that
such a pact is neither possible nor desirable at present appreciated by
Brezhnev and he <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>did </span>not put any
pressure on India to accept his proposal. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>The joint </span>declaration <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is
c</span>ontent with the observation that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>India
</span>and the Soviet <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Union “</span>attach
particular significance to a broad development of mutually beneficial co-operation
and the strengthening of peace and stability <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>in Asia </span>through common efforts by all the states of this largest
and most populated area of the world,” an observation to which no one <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will </span>take any objection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
point on which Brezhnev was keen was on getting port facilities for <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Soviet </span>ships moving about <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the waters of the Indian Ocean.
Here also India does not seem to have made any commitments. In his speeches in
the Parliament Swaran Singh, our Minister for External Affairs, denied emphatically
that there were any such commitments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is worthwhile noting in this connection that the growing understanding and the
closer relationship between India and Soviet Union is not unwelcome to USA. In
his talks with the Soviet ambassador in Washington the US Secretary of State,
Henry Kissinger, stated that the talks in New Delhi, between Brezhnev and
Indira Gandhi, did not in any manner go against the interests of the US and
were entirely in keeping with the spirit of detente. It may therefore be concluded
that one significant outcome of Brezhnev’s visit is the guarantee that
friendship between India and Soviet Union will continue in spite of the
latter’s detente with USA and her growing economic co-operation with the West a
co-operation necessitated by the domestic situation in USSR. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
is also a second aspect of his visit which is equally welcome to India. The
political situation in the country has become a source or misgiving and anxiety
to the Government of Indira Gandhi. Apart from the headaches caused by
factionalism in her party there is the irresponsible behaviour of opposition
parties which take advantage of domestic discontents and indulge in all sorts
of agitations leading to the disruption of the smooth working of the political
machine. Among these parties is the CPI which is closely allied to the Soviet
Communist Party. The association is so close that on all crucial matters it
bows to the dictates of the Soviet Party, its mentor. Surveying the situation
in India Brezhnev felt it necessary and desirable to give a piece or advice to
the CPI leadership in their dealings with Indira Gandhi’s Government and the
Congress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Though
the CPI has electoral alliance with the Congress, and though it is a member of
the coalition government in Kerala along with the Congress, it has not
hesitated to lead agitations against the Government of Indira Gandhi and to
organise strikes which have been proving so detrimental to the economy of the
country. It is in this context that Brezhnev told the CPI leadership that the
Government of Indira Gandhi is wedded to the pursuit of socialist and
anti-capitalist policies and that nothing should be done by the CPI to obstruct
her policies and that on the other hand it should do everything to strengthen
her hands. There is therefore some hope that at least one of the more active
among the opposition <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>parties will </span>henceforward
adopt a more positive and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>constructive
</span>attitude towards the Government of Indira <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Gandhi. </span>Of course no one wants outside interference in shaping
the domestic <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>politics </span>of our
country.<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>But <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this </span>is a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>peculiar </span>case. Communism <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is
</span>an <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>intern</span>ational
movement. Communism in India <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>a
part of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it. </span>Whatever influence
the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CPI has </span>on Indian <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>politics </span>is the outcome of an
external force. What Brezhnev <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>has now </span>done
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>not something new. But it <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is welcome </span>because the outside
intervention <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will henceforward </span>strengthen
the hands of the Indian Government and not weaken i<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>t. He plainly told </span>the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CPI
leadership </span>that there was no need for strikes in a <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>developing ec</span>onomy <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>where </span>production at an increasing
rate w<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>as </span>the main problem. He
also asked them not to make much fuss about <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>monopoly </span>houses. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>This
is </span>sound commonsense. At a time when, public sector concerns are <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>not yielding </span>any returns, there is no
meaning in preventing the expansion of such houses i<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>f they </span>are capable of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>bringing
profitable </span>returns. It <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is also </span>significant
that when Madhu Limaye, the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Socialist
leader, </span>sought and secured an <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Interview
w</span>ith <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>him, </span>Brezhnev

the relevance of opposition parties i<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>n
</span>a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>developing </span>economy, a

of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his visit–and perhaps </span>more
important than this–is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>its e</span>conomic
outcome. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>The country is passing
through </span>a severe economic crisis. Economy <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>for some years has </span>been more or less stagnant. No solution has
been found for the problems of rising prices (especially of essentials like
food, clothing, etc.) and unemployment. It is in this atmosphere that the fifth
Five-Year Plan which provides for a total investment for about 54,000 crores
has been prepared. It is not quite clear how the resources required for the
purpose can be mobilised. Acute differences have arisen among experts on this
issue. Part of it consists in foreign exchange to the tune of 4,000 crores. It
is in this context that we have to evaluate the significance of Brezhnev’s
visit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The visit has resulted
in the first place in the conclusion of a 15-year economic agreement between
the two countries. This gives an assurance that whatever aid the Soviet Union
gives to India will be of a fairly long period character, not subject to
fluctuations due either to domestic situation in Soviet Russia or her economic
commitments to other countries with which her relations are growing closer. It
appears that the Soviet leader was prepared to enter into even a 25-year
agreement but India did not want to commit herself to such a long period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the second place
there is now the likelihood of the Soviet Union meeting India’s foreign
exchange needs to the extent of 600 crores. The details of the scheme for which
the aid will be granted have still to be worked out but they will all be the
“core-sector” schemes. The terms on which the aid will be granted are more
favourable than in the past as they allow for a longer grace period and
maturity though the rate of interest continues to be 2.5 per cent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the third place the
Soviet Union has agreed to import a large variety of Indian manufactured goods
in place of or in addition to mere raw materials. She has also agreed to export
to India several essentials like fertilisers, power-generating equipment, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the fourth place she
has agreed in respect of the production of these manufactured commodities to
provide designs and specifications and supply equipment and technology to the
extent required. This will ensure that the goods manufactured will be to the
tastes and needs of the consumers in Soviet Russia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There is also provision
in respect of some goods like leather for the setting up in India of Russian
centres of production. There is a corresponding provision for the setting up of
Indian concerns in the Soviet Union as for example a production unit in Siberia
for the manufacture of paper and pulp to meet Indian needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the expansion of industries set up previously with Russian aid like the Iron
and Steel Plants in Bhilai and Bokaro, the Oil Refinery in Mathura, the Copper
Mining complex in Maland-Jhand, etc. The equipment needed at Ranchi to enable
it to work to full capacity will be provided. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There is no need to go
into further detail about the economic agreement. The point to be noted is that
it covers a wide field and that it brings about a qualitative change in the
kind of economic relationship between the two countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is quite true that
compared to the total needs of the country the resources made available by the
Soviet Union do not amount to much. But we should keep in mind when estimating
the value of any external source of help that no country can make progress by
relying entirely on external aid. Every country should try to stand on its own
legs. The role of external help ought to be peripheral. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During the quarter the
malady of social indiscipline which has for some years overtaken the country
manifested itself in a variety of ways. There was sabotage by the employees of
the Indian Airlines which led to the declaration of a lock-out by the
management on November 25. There was a wild-cat strike by locomen<i> </i>in the
third week of December, the third of its kind within the course of six months.
There were communal clashes in Meerut and several other towns of Northern
India. There was the usual crop of student disturbances in Jammu-Kashmir,
Madras and Karnataka. In the last of the states it necessitated a reshuffling
of the cabinet. There were violent disturbances in both Karnataka and
Maharashtra on the border issue for nearly three weeks accompanied by Bandhs.
None of those who resort to activities like these are mindful of the huge
losses resulting from them. To them the public interest has no meaning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For example, the Bombay
Bandh sponsored by Shiv Sena on December 18 in protest against the “atrocities
committed on Maharashtrians in Karnataka” brought a loss of Rs. 40 lakhs to
hotels in the city, of Rs. 1.20 crores to the textile mills, Rs. 40 lakhs to
railways besides huge losses to shopkeepers, and others whose work came to a
standstill. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Airlines employees
have not cared to see the rationale behind the new shift system introduced by
the management in the interests of efficiency (which today is far below
international standards), economy and safety. How inefficient the Airlines has
become in recent years is shown by the increasing proportion of delays in
flights. It was one-fifth in 1967-68, one-third in 1971-72 and two-thirds in
September 1973. The management wanted to introduce the new schedule in
agreement with the employees but the representatives of the latter wrecked the
negotiations by dilatory tactics. Air traffic has practically come to an end,
only a few skeleton services being maintained. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The same failure to see
reason is clear in the case of the December strike of locomen. To induce them
to call off their earlier strike the Railway Minister hastily agreed to reduce
their working day to 10 hours. On further consideration it is now found that it
cannot be put into effect immediately and that it would take three to four
years to do it. Implementation involves the construction of additional staff
quarters, running rooms, crew vans, and looplines, the acquisition of
locomotives, and the recruitment and training of nearly 20,000 additional staff.
To complete this process it takes time. A committee, with the representatives
of locomen included in it, was set up to work out the details but the locomen
went on strike even before the committee went half-way through its work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The time has come to
consider whether the right to strike should be recognised as a right at all.
Rights should always go with duties. But those who exercise the right to strike
do not feel that they have corresponding duties. The disruption which their
action causes to every sphere of public life does not carry an weight with
them. Some effective remedy has to be found for the malady of social
indiscipline which is growing worse from day to day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

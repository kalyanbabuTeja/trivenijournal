style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Karl
Marx’s view that reality precedes idea, referred to economic reality which he
saw projected into life entire. As such it has been found inadequate though the
great importance of the economic factor could not be belied. Particular ideas
grow out of the compulsion of particular economic conditions but such ideas do
not constitute the whole realm of idea. There are ideas common to and
independent of all economic circumstances. Among them must be classed such
ideas as the human desire for freedom, love, friendship and man’s natural
proclivity towards music and the arts. Economic conditions do affect the shape
of these ideas but do not and cannot override them. These ideas are as much
part of reality as economics is and must affect action on reality. Hegel’s
famous dictum that the real is rational and the rational is <span class=GramE>real,</span>
placed reality on the basis of necessity. “Everything that is, is real” because
necessity changes and with that, reality. Thus does reality achieve <span
class=GramE>solidity.</span> Yet reality is always reaching out to
supra-reality and in order to reach the latter, man, both individually and
collectively, tries to transcend reality. That is a matter of common experience
though the understanding of it is not very common. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
understanding of it is however necessary, for, by such understanding alone we
can understand life as both individually and collectively lived. Understanding
life is necessary for the purpose of doing justice to life. Man does try to
transcend reality but without an understanding of reality, often gets bogged in
reality and is unable to get beyond it. Over and above that, men’s ways are
interlinked and react on one another. Social progress is the sum total of
interaction: so is national progress and ultimately, progress of humanity.
Progress includes in this context periodic retrogression. The <span
class=GramE>Indian</span> who is even in this age rooted to <span class=SpellE>casteism</span>,
reacts on his fellow-countrymen and puts a brake on their progress. His effort
to transcend reality is bogged in reality. Rather, he imagines transcendence in
permanence. He quotes Western scholars in support of caste without regard to
the historical perspective of scholarship. Indians and Pakistanis have
inherited a legacy of communalism which many among them have raised to the
status of nationalism. Many an Indian equates Indian nationalism with Hindu <span
class=SpellE>suzereignty</span> and traces its birth from the epochal question <span
class=SpellE>Bankim</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chatterjee</span> put into the mouth of the devotee in <span
class=SpellE><i>Anandmath</i></span>: “Won’t my desire be fulfilled?” But that
question also <span class=SpellE>epitomised</span> the self-questioning of the
erstwhile dependent Indian’s aspiration to be free. It germinated, at least
partially, revolutionary <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>. Between these two
trends Indian nationalism desperately tries to maintain itself on the secular
plane. The Hindu nationalist sees no great reality in that but considers his
creed to be the sign-post for humanity for all time. The Pakistani is bred on
communal nationalism as the great reality that has been derived out of the
unreality that, according to him, Indian nationalism was. Yet there are people
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
who feel called upon to transcend that reality in order to try to reach secular
nationalism without which life seems incomplete to them. That is a move towards
supra-reality. One is always trying in personal life to attain what one
believes to be progress. Not <span class=SpellE>unoften</span>, however, one
resorts to chicanery and meanness for that purpose. One tries that way to get
the better of one’s kith and kin. An approach of that kind to progress is
inhibited by reality. It is not capable of transcending reality.” But it may
seem to secure material advantage and the question might then be asked where
the inhibition is. For, apparently, in this case it has not worked. Reality
appears to have changed for the better. It is not the transcendental which man
fundamentally tries to attain. He considers it progress because he has been,
unknown to himself, <span class=SpellE>dehumanised</span>. He corrodes the
self-estimation that mankind has built itself into, through centuries of
culture and civilization. <span class=GramE>He</span> who wants to transcend
himself in love, sometimes strays into lust or some such perversion. He is then
a prisoner of reality. He runs counter to social purpose and is himself held
back. The anti-social man is at war with his environment because he is at war
with himself. The communalist man is thwarted, mutilated, <span class=GramE>incomplete</span>.
A nation that yields to communalism, parochialism or chauvinism bars its own
way to <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>. It rots in reality just as water
finds its own level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Because we could not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be up to him, we developed in regard to
him an inferiority complex which fed itself on his supposed sins of omission
and commission. These sins, far more of omission than of commission, were
themselves derived out of the very large canvas of his perspective. Thus it was
that the unity and integrity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were his only concern; he did not give enough and timely attention to the
demand and commitment for linguistic states, with the result that there was
great trouble. He relied on China’s age-old culture and peaceful ties with
India and was not prepared for the gross treachery which that country
perpetrated on us revealing that communism, with the help of which she regained
solidarity, was but new wine in old bottles and a catalyst for revival, from
the depths of ages, of her demoniacal expansionism. Jawaharlal Nehru must have
had limitations as everybody has, but it seems in looking for them we are only
succumbing to our own limitations. That is definitely not the way we can
transcend ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been easier when Mahatma Gandhi issued the call to us all Indians, to raise
our heads high and stand up to the iniquities of foreign rule. That was the
consummation of a historical process of self-assimilation of our people into
emerging nationhood. It drew unto itself forces of the human spirit, both
native and foreign. It released our pent-up energies into a rebirth of
self-perception. The resultant rally of human entities was phenomenal. The
struggle in non-co-operation with the foreign government claimed a legion. The
self-immolation of thousands in the revolutionary movement was also superbly
transcendental. Violence and non-violence alike were a people’s essays in the
conquest of reality. Conflicts arose, however, as soon as the country developed
an image of the reality that was coming. Through them emerged the task of
creating and stabilizing a new reality. Consolidation of the new reality
involved strains and stresses the burden of which fell mainly on Jawaharlal
Nehru. It falls on us individually too and almost makes us go under. Willy <span
class=SpellE>nilly</span>, however, we must establish ourselves in new,
evolving reality for, to rest where we are means to perish. Also the collective
compulsion prevails over individual deficiency. There are efforts, however, to
divert the compulsion into particular channels: socio-economic or <span
class=SpellE>religio</span>-cultural. There secularism fights back communalism,
capitalism is challenged by socialism and democracy will fight to the last
ditch for survival. The struggle of life is itself transcendental and might yet
salvage us out of the self-pity in which we are involved today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
what is transcendence? Where is its base? If it is merely an abstraction, it
will always elude us. It might be said that the march ahead is itself
transcendental. The individual life progresses from stage to stage; so does the
collective, the national, <span class=GramE>the</span> universal. Transcendence
also must therefore be reality. It might be called the Grand Reality. The
lover’s wait for the beloved the ascetic’s search for self-realisation, the
explorer’s adventure, the scientist’s research for truth and the writer’s
effort to encompass the realms of experience and intuition–all come under the
quest for the Grand Reality. These are realities as much as the mundane,
humdrum and cut and dried sorts are realities. The pilgrim through the ages as
whom Tagore describes <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in her national song, is no mere imagination calculated to enthuse the
imaginations of her people. It is the collective entity of the people which has
its ups and downs and treads the tracks of time. It is the historical
personality </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>composed of the individual personalities which
have traversed the past, are traversing the present and will traverse the
future. That </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>it is no mere poetic fancy is apparent from the
fact that just as a nation lives on common memories, the individual has roots
in the lives of generations at his birth-place. One who has lost one’s roots at
that place, treasures its memories irrespective of the fact that the human
context, one knew there, no longer exists. The refugee sighs for the place
which he has found himself compelled to quit. An integral relation between him
and that place is a reality. So the universal <span class=GramE>man</span> who
has crossed over from pre-history to history, is also no figment of
imagination. He has his existence in history and the knowledge that everything
has an end and makes room for new experiences, gives him an unlimited
perspective for the future. That is the point where according to Karl <span
class=SpellE>Jaspen</span> existentialism means humanism; but it is for the
individual man the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>point of departure for infinite
self-expansion. Jawaharlal Nehru’s odyssey for the discovery of India was also
projected through the ages. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
then is reality reaching within the confines of reason to transcendence.
Nothing supernatural is involved in it. Broadly its base is materialism or as
M. N. Roy put it rather more aptly physical realism. But transcendence is
worked largely by idea of which reality is the spring board. There are strands
even in our physical existence which come to life only in transcendence. Such
is our response to music and other arts which enable us to reach unsuspected
heights and depths in ourselves. The current habit of harking back to the lives
and sayings of the great people of the past might also be traced to a
sub-conscious anxiety to find back in what is believed to be the historically
caused vacuum of the present, our foothold in the legacy of past generations.
It is all right if it enlivens our sense of living in the present. We are parts
of history and are conditioned by it. In our individual ways we also help to
make it. Rooted to history and feeling himself an active participant in it, man
derives self-confidence in making his future. No fates are involved except
destiny and the effort to make it. Man needs be made accordingly
self-conscious. What he objectively is he needs subjectively know that he is,
so that he might direct himself to its realisation. To make him know is the
task of education. Even theology does not bar man from self-transcendence.
Those who believe God to be the arbiter of human destiny also want man to work out
that destiny. Education needs be so contrived as to make him conscious of that
end. The conscious individual will constitute the conscious society, nation and
ultimately, humanity. Possibly he will help the solution of many of the
problems besetting the world. Anything that mutilates life by meanness or
discord makes man less of a man. If and when conflicts are unavoidable, they
need be resolved by natural justice so that they do not debase and degrade
humanity. Man serves himself best and most by always trying to get out of the
rut which seeks to envelop him. There are occasions on which he rises to
heights when he loves, worships, sacrifices or dedicates himself. But it does
not last and when he deviates, he brings society down with him. There is no disregarding
reality but there is no reality that could but find release in transcendence.</span><span

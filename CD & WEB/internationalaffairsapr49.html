the conclusion of the North Atlantic Pact which will be formally signed on
April 4, the most important step was taken by the anti-Soviet powers with the
United States as their leader, in the preparation for World-War III which now
seems inevitable unless a miracle happens in the meanwhile and there is a
change of heart among those who are in power in the United States and U.S.S.R.
in accordance with the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, God’s Prophet in the Atomic
Age. The seeds of this war were sown so early as 1945 when the Second World War
was still going on. One step after another was taken, first by one party and
the next by the other until both parties resolved as it were not to learn
anything from the experience of history and to resort to the traditional method
of war for gaining their ends–which consist of nothing else except the
destruction of the enemy. History has taught mankind that the actual outcome of
any modern war is nothing but destruction on a colossal scale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
antagonism between Soviet Russia and the so-called democracies of the West is
the product of the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 and is therefore a generation
old. The democracies tried their best to destroy that revolution but did not
gain their ends. In their turn the Bolsheviks tried hard to create trouble in
every country with the idea of bringing about a world-communistic revolution
but gave it up as a hopeless task, especially because it led to the growth of
Fascism in countries like Germany. One extreme always leads to another. A sort
of compromise was then brought about and Soviet Russia was admitted into the
League of Nations in 1934. But there was in reality no change of heart on
either side. To both it was a mere matter of expediency. The democracies were
bent on destroying communism and for this purpose they did not shrink from
helping Mussolini, Hitler and Franco–the Fascist dictators and surrendering to
Hitler at Munich in 1938. But they miscalculated and Hitler turned against them
instead of against Soviet Russia. Events that led to the Second World War
clearly demonstrated that peace could be preserved only on one condition and
that was the union between Soviet Russia and the Democracies. The latter failed
to understand this and by the time they realised it, it was too late. All this
confirmed the suspicions of Soviet Russia towards the democracies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

purchase the goodwill of Soviet Russia in the later stage’s of the Second World
War–when there was even a fear of her entering into separate treaty with Hitler
in protest against the failure of the democracies to open a second front in
Western Europe–President Roosevelt agreed to Soviet Russia becoming supreme in
Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and including in her sphere of influence
countries like Poland </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

friction between her and Russia. But Roosevelt </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>control
over him. The Churchillian tradition was preferred to the tradition of
Roosevelt. And moves were begun to oust Russia from the predominant position
which she gained in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe–and also in Manchuria and
Korea–first through her military campaigns and next through recognition by her
allies in the war. It is from these moves that the present friction between
Soviet Russia and the Western democracies originated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Organisation which even otherwise would have had to face the same difficulties
as the League of Nations. It stood in the way of the conclusion of peace
treaties with Germany, Austria and Japan. From this moment onwards it became
the keynote of the foreign policy of the United States to bring pressure on
Soviet Russia, outflank her and weaken her in South-Eastern Europe, the Middle
East and in China. It first took the form of aid to Greece and Turkey which
bordered on Soviet Russia and her sphere of influence and which would secure to
the United States air and submarine bases from which Soviet Russia could be
easily attacked. It gradually developed into the Marshall Aid Plan for the
economic recovery of Western Europe which were to serve as bases for attack on
Russia from the West. The grant of military aid to countries included in this
plan became an integral part of it. In Britain itself which had now practically
become a satellite of the United States–Mr. Attlee and Mr. Bevin succeeded in
spite of the opposition of the rebel group in the labour party in persuading
the British public to think of Russia as their enemy and the need for aligning
their country with the United States in all matters of foreign policy. The
outcome of this was the Anglo-French alliance and the formation of the Western
Union consisting of Britain, France and the Benelex countries, a union
primarily for military purposes, Subsequently this led to a closer
understanding between the United States and the countries of the Union
regarding the policy to be pursued in Western Germany. It was concluded that
Western Germany should be consolidated into a separate political entity, that
her industrial resources should be developed, that she should come once again
an arsenal but that this arsenal should help the Western democracies in the war
against Russia. The Atlantic Pact is the culmination of all these successive
steps for making of Western Europe an integrated political, economic and
military unit working under the leadership of the United States in a future war
with Russia. For a generation and more the interests of Canada have become so
closely bound with those of the United States that it is impossible for her to
follow an independent foreign policy. This is how the countries on either side
of the North Atlantic have now become members of the new pact. To these
countries–Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, Luxemberg, Norway, Denmark, Canada
and the United States–Portugal and Italy have now to be added. In spite of the
opposition of the communist members the Italian Parliament voted in favour of
the Pact. The Government of Portugal has also signified its willingness to
become a signatory to it although such a course is opposed to her existing
treaty with Spain. This is however a minor matter. For it will not be
surprising if in the name of military strategy to put down communism Spain also
is invited to join the Pact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Pact contains thirteen articles. Articles 5 and 6 are the most important ones.
Under article 5 “the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of
them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, if such armed attack occurs, each of
them...will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith,
individually and in concert with the other parties, such action as it deems
necessary including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the
security of the North Atlantic Area. Under article 6 the meaning of the terms
North Atlantic Area and of attack are made as comprehensive as possible.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ratification of the Pact by the Senate of the United States which is now a
foregone conclusion–as on all fundamentals of foreign policy both the political
parties are agreed–will for all practical purposes enable the President to
resort to military action to enforce the terms of the Pact without waiting for
any formal declaration of war by the Congress as required under the
constitution. In this way the constitutional difficulty referred to in the last
issue has been overcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is necessary to understand the exact nature and significance of the Pact in the
present international set-up. In the first place it is a clear recognition of
the ineffectiveness and failure of the U.N.O. as an instrument for maintaining
world peace. This was what Mr. Bevin himself has said in his broadcast. “There
has long been a striving to get organized to prevent war. We were hopeful as a
result of the bitter experience we have all been through, that the steps we
took toward the end of the war would provide us with an organisation likely to
secure that end. That organisation was the United Nations. But frankly, just as
the League of Nations did not fulfil the purpose, neither has the United
Nations.” Mr. Dean Acheson, the U.S. Secretary of State, gave expression to the
very identical view. The Atlantic Pact therefore tries to bring into existence
an organisation which is a substitute for the </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is in the second place a Pact which relies on force and war for bringing peace.
It is now announced that the U.S. State and Defence departments prepared a
$1,800,000,000 arms programme for Western Europe to resist communist
aggression. It is also reported that President Truman “would seek wide
authority to allocate funds between North Atlantic Treaty Members and other
nations whose security was vital to U.S. interests. This would allow swift
movement of military supplies in the event Russia stepped up pressure on any
single country.” All this is in addition to the enormous sums set apart for
defence purposes in the United States itself.</span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is here that the tragedy of the whole situation lies. It is the verdict of
history that pacts and measures like these inevitably lead to war. And history
tells how heavy and irreparable are the losses of modern warfare. It has been
calculated that in World War I the Allies mobilized 42,190,000 troops of whom
5,160,000 were slain, 13,000,000 were wounded, and 4,120,000 were prisoners and
missing and that the Central Powers mobilized 23,000,000 troops, of whom
3,380,000 were killed, 8,400,000 were wounded, and 3,600,000 were prisoners and
missing. World War II produced 15,000,000 deaths in battle among the great
powers: U.S.S.R. 7,500,000; Germany 3,000,000; China 2,200,000; Japan
1,500,000; U.K. 300,000; U.S.A. 300,000; Italy 300,000; France 200,000. In
U.S.S.R. there were 8,000,000 civilian lives lost and a similar proportion of
civilian losses in other countries. The material costs of these war run to
astronomical figures. They came, it is said, to 338,000,000,000 dollars in
World War I and to 1385,000,000,000 dollars in World War II. And these
sacrifices have not led to more of human welfare, or freedom, or security or
democracy. The position is much darker to-day than in </span><span

is staggering to think what a Third World War is likely to bring in its train.
The horrors of atomic bombing can be better imagined than expressed. And all
this will be in addition to the havoc caused by the other methods of deadly
warfare. Few will survive such horrors and those few will have to lead lives more
miserable than those led by the primitive savages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

United States and all other countries which have become parties to the Atlantic
Pact are proceeding on the hypothesis that the arrangements they are now making
and those that they hope to make in time to come will give them a sure victory
in the Third World War. But this is a doubtful proposition. There is an equal
doubt regarding the prospects of a Soviet victory. What is only certain is that
the road chosen by U.S.A. and U.S.S.R., the only two great powers now left to
struggle for world supremacy have chosen a wrong goal as well as wrong methods
and means of reaching it. They should drop the idea of world supremacy. They
should also realise that war will never help them in the achievement of such an
ambition. The total annihilation of human culture and civilisation would be the
only outcome of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
India and to the countries of South-East Asia and Africa the Atlantic Pact
brings another implication. Among the parties to the Pact are leading colonial
powers like Britain, France, Holland, and Belgium. The Pact will be effective
only on condition that there is a complete understanding between the United
States on one side and these colonial powers on the other and such an
understanding can only be on one basis viz., that the United States gives its
support to these powers in their determination to hold their colonies under
imperialistic control. There is therefore a danger that the Pact will tighten
the grip of these powers over their colonies in Asia and Africa which are now
struggling for independence. The Western democracies are not democratic in
their dealings with their colonial dependencies. Their policy in this respect
is characterised by extreme racialism, feudalism, economic exploitation and oligarchic
and bureaucratic rule. As a recent writer has put it: “Most of the pioneer work
in developing the theory and practice of modern totalitarianism was done not by
the opponents but by the exponents of modern liberalism. Although the
Government of colonial empires is rarely mentioned in this connection,
colonialism actually gave the Western World its first great opportunity for
dictatorial experiments...Governments which, in their domestic affairs, were
firm believers in the value of constitutional democracy, found it natural in
the field of colonial administration faced by the necessity of maintaining
minority rule over a subject population, were unable to preserve the concept of
freedom under law in its European vigour.” The Atlantic Pact will therefore
perpetuate the totalitarian methods of rule in the colonies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
this is no imaginary danger is borne out by three significant happenings in
March. The Dutch have not as yet reconciled themselves to the need for
implementing the resolution passed in January last by the Security Council on
Indonesia. Even the watered-down resolution initiated by Canada has not been
given effect to. They took no notice of the resolution passed at the Asian
Conference. This is because they are sure that America to which the Atlantic
Pact is of greater moment than the freedom of colonies will not bring any
pressure to bear on them in their dealings with Indonesia. In the second place
Senator Tom Connally, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
declared thus while referring to the fear that American aid to the Netherlands
might contribute towards the strengthening of Dutch military operations in
Indonesia: “According to our information the Dutch have not incurred heavy
military expenditure in excess of their expenditure in that area prior to
December 21 last year (where they started their military action against the
Republic). Moreover, it is reported that these operations are supported from
local revenues and do not constitute a charge against the national budget of
Netherlands. Under these circumstances it seems to the Committee most unwise to
cut off aid to the Netherlands and thus completely disrupt Dutch recovery and
seriously impair the entire European Recovery Progrnmme.” Thus in the eyes of
America Dutch recovery has priority over the freedom of Indonesia. A third
point to be noted in this connection is the American proposal to develop
backward colonial areas with a view to provide new services of raw material and
badly needed supplies of strategic materials like manganese, tin, iron ore, and
tungsten. A development on these lines will mean the continuance of the old
colonial policy under which the peoples of these dependencies had to be cont
with their role of suppliers of raw materials for the industries of their
imperial masters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is in this context that one has to examine the significance of the conference
of the (British) Commonwealth Prime Ministers to be held on April 21, in
London. Making a statement on this subject in the British House of Commons Mr.
Attlee said that the conference was intended to discuss and settle certain
constitutional questions not fully discussed at the last October meeting. The
need for settling them has become urgent today as the policy which the
Commonwealth as a whole should adopt towards the Atlantic Pact has to be
decided. Britain is a party to the Pact and so also Canada. Australia and New
Zealand have had close defence ties with the United States since the Second
World War and they will naturally welcome the Pact. South Africa too may have
no objection to it. It is the attitude of India–and Pakistan and Ceylon to some
extent–that has now to be clarified. And this is the reason why the leaders of
British public opinion have come to see that in the conference Pandit Nehru
will occupy a leading position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It will be his duty to place two important points
before the conference. One is that India is determined to declare herself under
the new constitution to be a Republic. The conference should accept this
position. The other is whether the older Dominions and Britain can evolve a
constitutional formula which will maintain a close association between the
Republic of India and the Commonwealth. The Crown has all along been the
external symbol and link and it can no longer serve this purpose when once
India along with Eire becomes Republic. The older Dominions are not prepared to
give up the Crown as the link. Under these circumstances some other means has
to be devised which will keep up the unity of the Commonwealth. It is proposed
by some that the Commonwealth might consist of two categories of
members–members accepting a common Crown and members not so doing. There would
be no objection to such a course if it does not carry with it any inequality of
status. It is this constitutional question that has to be settled.</p>

from this the more substantial and meaningful issues is the implications of any
association between India and the Commonwealth. Here there is a real dilemma
for Indian leaders to face. If any such association implies that India should
adopt the same foreign policy as Britain and the older members of the
Commonwealth do this would be indirectly committing India to the upholding of
the anti-Soviet Atlantic pact. This raises serious issues. But if India is not
prepared to adopt a policy Britain and the other Dominions may not be very much
intrested in keeping India in the Commonwealth. The situation therefore is a
highly delicate one and it is quite possible that the London Conference might
only be exploratory and might not come to decisions on matters of foreign
policy. It may tackle only the constitutional issue although this issue has no
importance by itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the interests of world peace if she becomes neutral in the power-contest
between the United States and Soviet Russia. In a war between these two States
under the terms of the Atlantic Pact Russian invasion of Western Europe would
be a matter of certainty and it would mean the bombing of Britain and her ruin.
Referring to several other aspects of such a war Professor G. D. H. Cole
observed more than a year ago: “It (such a war) would, whatever its outcome and
its effects on the two main belligerents, be plainly a sheer disaster for the
rest of the world, and above all for the former Great Powers of Europe, which
have lost their effective standing on a level with these two giants. At any
rate, it would be a supreme disaster for both France and Great Britain, on
whichever side they were ranged. It would be so because both France and Great
Britain are too tired and weakened by the wars they have fought already to have
any prospect of facing another without sheer collapse, and also because neither
of them could hope to enter such a war as a whole-hearted supporter of either
of the main belligerents–so that there would be added to the disaster of
international the high probability of civil war, or at the very least of
fundamental divisions that would tear their societies to pieces.” There is much
wisdom in this observation and it may be that a powerful neutral bloc alone
could save the world from a Third War. India should become associated with that
power which will eagerly cooperate with her in averting such a catastrophe. Is
it too much to expect from our Premier Pandit Nehru that before committing
himself to any active association with the Commonwealth he would have this
aspect discussed and clarified?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1 style='text-indent:.5in'>INDIANS have always known that India is one
country. Others have generally been unable to understand this. The size of the
land and the variety of the population have puzzled them into thinking that
India should in truth be several countries and its people many nations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is very much as if a hare should look
at an elephant and say that so huge a creature could not be one animal, and
insist on thinking that it is in fact a number of hares put together. This
error at the base explains the many erroneous notions which vitiate much
foreign thought regarding India, whether that thought is of the Englishman who,
till recently, believed that he was the divinely appointed guardian of this
country or of the Argentine representative on the United Nations’ Security
Council who urges that India should be asked to quit hold of the Hyderabad
nation which in his view it has subjugated by force.</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Whatever may be the motive behind the error of the
Argentine representative, there is no doubt whatever about the motive of
Englishmen. It is unnecessary to think that these people are very bad to
believe that they are not quite pleased with the Hindu population of India.
India fed numerous English households which now have lost this source of
livelihood. This they might justly attribute in a large measure to the Hindu.
When Mahatma Gandhi was in England, he was asked to visit the textile labour
area and shown the suffering which his khaddar programme had caused. The
Mahatma’s answer was that even after the reduction his programme had caused the
labour population in England had more and better food than the corresponding
class in India. But each wearer is keenly alive to the pebble in his own shoe
and the English today should be definitely the worse off for the loss of this
country from their possessions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The loss would be felt by the labour class as well
as by the capitalist class. That is why practically all England voted for the
partition of India into two Dominions and a possibility of the Indian States
wishing to remain outside both the Dominions. Pakistan might give them a
foothold and the States might give some more. There should have been a
suggestion in subtle ways to various States to claim independence and the right
to standout of the Indian Dominion. Mysore took some time to join. Travancore
claimed independence. Kashmir joined India only when hard pressed by Pakistan’s
unsympathetic attitude. Hyderabad stood out to the bitter end. All of them are
one with India now and can only be the better and the happier for it. But to
the people who believed that it was their rule that made India one, and that
when that rule ended it should in the nature of things fan into bits and call
for their help again, the Unity that has been achieved should be the cause of
sore disappointment. What a pity, they will be thinking, that after all that
was done; India was divided into only two pieces and not more!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This and nothing else can explain the attitude that
Mr. Bevin took up on India’s police action against the Razakar outrages in
Hyderabad! India, it seems, developed a ‘warlike spirit’ in this context.
Hindus and non-Razakar Muslims of Hyderabad in any number might suffer any
amount of horror for any length of time at the hands of Razakars. There may be
a flight of any number of refugees from Hyderabad to Indian Territory. Razakars
might make raids into Indian-Union territory and loot and molest populations.
Trains may be held up, passengers robbed and outraged. Three ministers, who by
no means were unfriendly to the then existing regime, might be so moved by the
excesses of the Razakars and the unwillingness of their Muslim fellow-ministers
to take action against these that they resigned their offices in protest.
Still, India should have been patient and just looked on. Would the influx of
refugees into Union territory create problems to the Union administration? Why,
they should even meet them. Might some Hindu population in the Union lose its
head and injure Muslim citizens in its midst? Why, preach patience to them; if
they do not learn it, give them a beating. Allow the innocent population in
India to run any risk, but do not lift up a finger against ruffians on the run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

imagine. This is not how England dealt with such difficulties when she had
charge of India. Not only after paramountcy was established did the British
authorities intervene to restore order and ensure security to person and
property in Indian States. They did it from the very beginning; in his book, <i>Our
Indian Protectorate</i>, dealing with the policy in regard to Indian States,
Tupper, once of the Indian Civil Service, freely illustrates the manner of this
intervention. The fundamental basis of the intervention was that “Indian States
are not nations.” (Page 7) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

suppose that both Russia and France were to hold aloof ‘Independently,’ says
Sir Henry Maine (International Law p.5) of any other benefits which the Indian
Empire may confer on the collection of countries which it includes, there is no
question that, were it to be dissolved or to fall into the hands of masters
unable to govern it, the territories which make it up would be deluged with

themselves...Is it imagined that in this great game for power, our countrymen
would not be invited to cut in? Is it supposed that they would decline, or
accept and play worse than their predecessors? Surely our countrymen in the present
generation are not less bold and enterprising and adventurous than our
countrymen and Frenchmen of a century and a half ago? What was done by Clive
and Watson in Bengal would be done by English, Irish or Scotch. It would be
done in all probability both better and more quickly, even if no one had the

my mind it seems quite idle to contemplate the relinquishment of British
Supremacy in India. If we could imagine the British nation guilty of so weak,
so cruel, so foolish a. repudiation of its responsibility, considerable
territorial power would once more be acquired by British adventurers;
Parliament would not leave the sovereignty we have won; and in the end the

few details. The adventurer who can do more than Clive though not possessed of
his genius may be there, but the Indian States and the Muslims of India have
belied the hopes of all his class. There is no likelihood of England having to
come back to take care of us. But there is the danger of the United Nations’
Organisation blundering under the guidance of present day counterparts of
Tupper of ‘Our Indian protectorate’ and of even well-meaning Englishmen like
Mr. Bevin moved by memories of power recently relinquished. If this guidance is
supplemented by such swash buckling for peace as the Argentine representative
on the Security Council of the U.N.O. has exhibited in the last few days, the
position of an honest nation like India will be truly uncomfortable. But this
is dangerous to the U.N.O. as much as to any one nation. In its handling of the
Indonesian and South African questions, the Organisation has shown itself a
true follower of Dogberry and let rogues show themselves for what they are by
allowing them to steal away. By being firm with those who are not rogues it
will only prove how fully it has imbibed Dogberryan principles as the town
watch of Cosmopolites and fulfil its task of maintaining peace no better than
its unlamented predecessor in that role, the League of Nations. That indeed
would be a pity but perhaps it is not the inevitable end. A South American may
learn, though slowly, that India is not a land of violence like South American
countries, that the Indian Union and Hyderabad are not in two different rent
continents like Italy and Abyssinia nor, like Germany and Austria, merely
contiguous to each other, and that the people of Hyderabad are of a piece with
the people of India. Even conservative Englishmen may relent when they realise
that the only ruler whom they expected to play the part of an ambitious Oriental
potentate has found out for himself the danger of dancing to their tune. In any
case patience is sovereign with India and this and the facts which are open to
any impartial observer to see may still bring the Hyderabad issue to the
conclusion that alone is safe and satisfactory. Hyderabad is to India bone of
her bone and flesh of her flesh and no amount of repetition of the Untruth, and
by never so many persons on or off the Security Council of the U.N.O., can make
it a separate nation and an Independent State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the family was at <span class=SpellE>Kalavarayi</span> village in <span

precocity was such that he composed his first Sanskrit verse at the age of ten
and was able to give predictions from horoscopes. At fourteen, he had studied
most of the well-known Sanskrit classics and had become an extempore speaker
and poet in that language. He even composed a long poem called the ‘<span
class=SpellE>Bhringa</span> <span class=SpellE>Dutam</span>’ on the <span
class=GramE>model</span> of <span class=SpellE>Kalidasa’s</span> ‘<span

<span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span> Sastri was thus a literary genius, he had a
predilection for the life spiritual and was particularly fond of performing ‘<span

a family whose cult was ‘Sri <span class=SpellE>Vidya</span>’ and Sastri had
mastered the <span class=SpellE>Kundalini</span> Yoga. His later disciple <span
class=SpellE>Kapali</span> Sastri, in his Sanskrit work “<span class=SpellE>Vasishtha</span>
<span class=SpellE>Vaibhavam</span>” written in <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span>
<span class=SpellE>Shastri’s</span> own words, recounts a number of miracles
that occurred during his guru’s peregrinations in search of quiet spots for
doing penance. When he was only 23, <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span> Sastri
proceeded to <span class=SpellE>Navadwip</span> in <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
to compete for the title of ‘<span class=SpellE>Kavyakantha</span>’ which was
being awarded by an academy of formidable scholars there. Sastri passed the
difficult tests he was put to with an effortless ease that stunned his
examiners who unanimously conferred the title on him forthwith. After visiting <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Varanasi</span></st1:place></st1:City>
and other holy centers in the North, Sastri proceeded to <span class=SpellE>Tiruvannamalai</span>

exercises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The brothers noted the street and the house carefully, including a <span

morning. When they turned up in the morning the house and the Andhra couple had
mysteriously disappeared and there was another house in its place! Sastri
composed a thousand Sanskrit verses in praise of <span class=SpellE>Arunachalesvara</span>
and called it ‘<span class=SpellE>Harasahasram</span>’. He took up a job as a
Sanskrit Pandit in a local school, learnt Tamil within ten days and started
teaching in that language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the Ashram of <span class=SpellE>Padmanabha</span> Swami. Although Sastri
was impressed by the serene countenance of the <span class=SpellE>Brahmana</span>
Swami, who was observing silence, he admits that he was not drawn towards him
at the time as he thought that the Swami had forsaken <span class=SpellE>Varnashrama</span>
Dharma. <span class=SpellE>Padmanabha</span> Swami asked Sastri to give a short
discourse on the <span class=SpellE>Sloka</span> ‘<span class=SpellE>Suklambaradharam</span>’.
After explaining the meaning of the <span class=SpellE>Sloka</span> as
applicable to Braham, Vishnu and <span class=SpellE>Ganesa</span>, <span

attending to several subjects at a time. He exacted homage from even
rationalist intellectuals and although himself without modern education, he had
among his disciples and admirers many Masters of Arts, authors, professors and <span

day he suddenly resigned his job, proceeded to <span class=SpellE>Tiruvannamalai</span>
and settled down in a hut constructed for him by one of his disciples. Living
entirely on milk, he completed one <span class=SpellE>crore</span> ‘<span

Sastri the results he expected and one day he decided to see the <span

time at <span class=SpellE>Tiruvannamalai</span> and he feared that the Swami’s
cave would be crowded by visitors. Strangely enough, there was none when he
went and the Swami was sitting outside the cave. <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span>
Sastri prostrated himself before the <span class=SpellE>Brahmana</span> Swami,
caught his right foot with his right hand and the left foot with his left hand
and prayed for his grace for realizing what his penance had failed to secure
for him. The Swami broke his silence and speaking in Tamil in a whisper said
“Penance is the realization of the self and the discovery of who that ‘I’ (<span
class=SpellE>Naan</span>) is. Find out where the sound of the Mantra you are
repeating emanates from. That is real penance.” Sastri sat in meditation before
his newly-found Guru and later when he came to know that the Swami’s original
name was <span class=SpellE>Venkataraman</span>, he rechristened him as ‘<span
class=SpellE>Ramana</span>’. Thenceforth, the <span class=SpellE>Brahmana</span>
Swami came to be known as ‘<span class=SpellE>Ramana</span> Swami’ and in
course of time as ‘<span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span> <span class=SpellE>Ramana</span>’
to the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

decided to perform ‘<span class=SpellE>Tapas</span>’ in the ‘<span

As an act of gratitude to Goddess <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span> for getting
a <span class=SpellE>Sadguru</span>, he decided to compose a thousand verses in
praise of Goddess <span class=SpellE>Uma</span> and this was tacitly approved
by the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>. Sastri took a vow that he would
complete the thousand in twenty days and started. But he had a trying time of
it as he was afflicted by whitlow on the fingers of his right hand and on the
last day, he had yet to compose more than 200 <span class=SpellE>Slokas</span>.
Resolutely facing the situation, he engaged five scribes and started dictating
the <span class=SpellE>Slokas</span> feverishly in the evening. <span
class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span> came there and sat by his side with his eyes
closed. It was midnight when Sastri completed the ‘<span class=SpellE>Uma</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sahasram</span>’ when the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>
opened his eyes slightly and asked “Have you written down all that I said?” “With
your abounding grace, I have completed the task” replied Sastri who, only then,
<span class=SpellE>realised</span> that he owed to the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>
the sudden inspiration that seized him at the time of the completion of his <i>magnum
opus. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

class=SpellE>Maha</span> <span class=SpellE>Vidyas</span>. He also composed the
‘<span class=SpellE>Ramana</span> Gita’ (300 <span class=SpellE>Slokas</span>)
based on the Tamil teachings of the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>. During
this period, he suffered from an excess of <span class=SpellE>Kundalini</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sakti</span> in his body and consulted the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>
who advised him to rub almond or castor oil on his scalp. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wife, <span class=SpellE>Visalakshi</span>, passed away in 1926. Returning to <span
class=SpellE>Arunachala</span>, he was, as usual, immersed in ‘<span
class=SpellE>Tapas</span>’ and composing of new works like the unique ‘Indra <span
class=SpellE>Sahasranamam</span>.’ He had a <span class=SpellE>Darshan</span>
of Sri <span class=SpellE>Aurobiodo</span> and The Mother at <st1:City w:st="on">Pondicherry</st1:City>
and went on a tour to <span class=SpellE>Sirsi</span> in <st1:place w:st="on">North
 <span class=SpellE>Caoara</span></st1:place> where his disciples gave him a
royal reception. While staying at <span class=SpellE>Sirsi</span> (1931) he was
writing a weekly letter in Sanskrit to the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>
at <span class=SpellE>Tiruvannamalai</span>, reporting his activities at <span
class=SpellE>Sirsi</span>. No less than 13 such letters have been reproduced in
<span class=SpellE>Kapali</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> book ‘<span
class=SpellE>Vasishtha</span> <span class=SpellE>Vaibhavam</span>.’ From the
names by which Sastri has addressed the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span> in
these letters, it is clear that he treated the latter as God in human form. <span
class=SpellE>Guhavatara</span>, <span class=SpellE>Visvaguru</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Karanaguru</span>, <span class=SpellE>Parasarya</span>, <span

class=SpellE>Mahasena</span>, <span class=SpellE>Punyasloka</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Bhaktavatsala</span> are some of the appellations used by Sastri
in addressing the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>. It was at <span
class=SpellE>Sirsi</span> that his disciple <span class=SpellE>Kapali</span>
Sastri composed his ‘<span class=SpellE>Bhashya</span>’ on ‘<span class=SpellE>Saddarsanam</span>’,
a Sanskrit work by <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span> Sastri explaining the
teachings of <span class=SpellE>Ramana</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span>.

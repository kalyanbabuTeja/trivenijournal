<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(University
of Saugor)<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
<i>Liliom </i>is known practically all over the world, it is strange that the
dramatist who gave it to mankind has not yet received much serious attention at
the hands of the critics. In fact Molnar tried his hand at various forms of
literature, for, besides the dozen plays he has left behind, he has also to his
credit a large volume of short stories, novels, fantasies, skits and poems
which he had been writing from his boyhood days almost to the day of his death.
This is mentioned here to suggest that, even if Molnar is not known to many of
us in this part of the world, he need not be treated as a literary amateur who
had only incidentally invaded the stage, or as one who is only a minor figure
in the dramatic history of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Molnar
was born a Hungarian, though his mind is cosmopolitan, his proper stage Vienna,
and his dramatic lineage French, The Vienna of his day had acquired a glamour
out of all proportion to reality; it was the Vienna of Schnitzler and Herman
Bahr. For long, in an otherwise matter-of-fact Western world, Vienna had been
associated with the outward expression of spontaneous exuberance, full of<i> </i>song
and laughter, and easy-going sentimental people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
charm of the legend may perhaps be explained by something deeper than the envy
of a rather drab society for one that is light-hearted and gay. The gaiety
which was peculiarly Vienna’s cannot be measured by any of the familiar catch
phrases like ‘Wine, Woman and Song’. These are but vulgar epitomes of Viennese
eclecticism and, rightly understood, they imply the unabashed acceptance of the
good things of life, the desire for self-expression, a discriminating
appreciation of beauty and a sense of humour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Naturally
enough the Viennese sense of humour is civilised and mature, characterised by
two broad features: the habit of not being solemn when one is serious, and the
ability to discern the funny aspect of an idea. It is also known that high
comedy flourishes in a society where exists this civilised sense of humour. It
was in this atmosphere that the theatre in Vienna and Budapest flourished, with
such dramatists as Schnitzler, Bahr, Herzog and Molnar.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
them–and, I might almost add, round about them–in the theatre of
Austria-Hungary (and it is better to take them together as Archibald Henderson
has done) a transformation of naturalism had already taken place in the hands
of Schnitzler, while Bahr’s pleasant comedy <i>The Concert </i>or Karl
Schonherr’s <i>The Solstice </i>had asserted more than once that whether it is
sophisticated society with its elegancies or flirtations or with its clever
mockery and restrained regret, the drama’s main burden was, what a critic has
called, ‘the waltz-time civilisation’. For a while, of course, Schnitzler
carried the naturalistic method to the romantic field and Bahr experimented
with expressionism. But the main burden continued to be realism, partly because
of Austria-Hungary’s crying need for the ‘right to live’ during the inter-war
years and partly because, as Gassner has stated, the stirrings of the realistic
drama in Europe had influenced the external transformation of the
Vienna-Budapest theatre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
consequence was that the romantic spirit as ingrained in Hungarian nationalism
was superficially democratised and transformed into the home of the bourgeoise
and the hovels of the proletariat. “Romance, instead of stalking on the fields
of honour or storming high heaven, wore less braid; fashionable clothes and
rags served equally to cover its palpitating ventricles.” Moreover, the
Hungarian playwrights had at their best begun to adopt a playful objectivity
towards the exacerbations of romance; and their leader, particularly in the
field of drama, was Ferenec Molnar. The contemporary Hungarian life was
dominated by a landowning aristocracy grudgingly co-operating with a mercantile
upper class. This class patronised the arts with unstinted enthusiasm but
tolerated only a pleasant evening in the theatre. Entertainment spiced with
urban sophistication became the criterion of modernity in the Hungarian
theatre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the inter-war years especially, the entertainment in the Hungarian as well as
the Central European theatre was leaved by a high sense of civilised humour, as
we know from the plays of Alfred Savoir or Ernest Vajda, <i>Fata Morgana, </i>or
even some of the plays by Lengyel, Bire and Fodor among others, are
characterised by that peculiar trace of nationalism that is what dipped in
saccharine without invalidating our modern sense of satisfaction with it. To
the average spectator who cannot see below the level of the surface, the main
source of appeal will of Course be either pure fun or unadulterated satire,
according to his frame of mind. But for the trained spectator the laughter will
be ‘thoughtful laughter’ where fun is mingled with a high level of intellectual
exertion. And Molnar’s comedies are, what we may call, such sugar-coated pills
intended to capture primarily an audience that had grown addicted to the
cabaret so common in Vienna and Budapest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was natural therefore that Hungary’s leading playwright Ferenec Molnar, was a
man of the theatre and that his plays epitomised all the virtues and defects of
his school. His life and work reveal everything that is characteristic of a
theatre that won wide acceptance abroad and belongs to dramatic history as one
popular way of coping with life, that is, by sugar-coating it. Incidentally,
his personal life too reflected this tendency, and his personality, inflammable
in its many courtships and hedonistic in its taste for feminine charm, music
and brandy, was coloured by the gifts of facile showmanship and sugar-coated
compassion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Molnar’s
first dramatic success was <i>The Devil </i>(1907) though an earlier play <i>Jozzi
</i>(1904) he had struck a favourite vein. Molnar had always been fond of
children, writing an engaging novel about them in <i>The Paul Street Boys, </i>and
the same strain continued in <i>Jozzi </i>which dissected the spoiled children
of the comfortable classes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Devil, </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>written three years later, is (as Allardyce
Nicoll has said) “a play in which the satanic agent appears garbed as a man of
the world”. At best the play was a fashionable variation on the Faust theme,
with Mephistopheles employing suggestion to facilitate adultery. Although
amusing, and although it brought Molnar the first taste of international
reputation and a membership of the Petofi society, yet the play is thin and
lacks the consolidated effect of some other plays on the Faust theme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the glory which the play brought to Molnar spurred him to marriage which,
though entered into romantically, was not a success. Its failure hurled Molnar
on a speculation on the nature of marriage and love in general. The result of
this speculation was <i>Liliom </i>(1909) on which is based Molnar’s chief
claim on pos</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>terity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is a tale of an amusement park bouncer who maltreats his wife and tries to rob
a cashier when he needs money for the baby she is expecting. It is a
tragi-comic tribute to the nobility that exists in everybody. Behind Liliom’s
worthless behaviour and a vagabond’s false sense of bravado remains masked an
affectionate human being; the only trouble is that his good angel is <i>gauche </i>and
inarticulate. He is destined to repeat the pattern of his life even in his
ghostly existence, after he has stabbed himself to avoid arrest for the
intended robbery. From the earliest scenes, which bear the stamp of the
naturalist school, the scene shifts to the only kind of heaven that Liliom
could have imagined–a celestial police court. Fifteen years later he is paroled
for a day to visit his family and to redeem himself by a good deed. But Liliom,
‘the useless lily,’ is unchanged. Eager to bring his daughter a gift, he can
think of nothing better than to steal a star for her during the descent.
Craving affection in his crude manner, he slaps her when she shrinks from him;
the heavenly police, shaking their heads deploringly, take him back as a
hopeless case. But his inchoate love remains a fact that his simple wife–and
perhaps heaven too–understands fully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
play, showing remarkable dramatic inventiveness and theatrical originality, was
a failure when first staged in Budapest in 1909, but was a remarkable success
when revived ten years later and is now Hungary’s chief claim to theatrical
greatness. Mr, Lynton Hudson has said that “even if he had never written
another play, his place in dramatic history would be secure”. And Molnar knew
this, for, when the famous Puccini wanted to use this play as a libretto for an
opera, Molnar refused saying that “the world will remember Puccini’s <i>Liliom </i>and
the name of Molnar would be forgotten”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a play <i>Liliom, </i>says Allardyce Nicoll, “exists in the main for the sake
of the scene in Heaven where the hero, an unsuccessful waif….is arraigned
before a higher court”. ‘Behind its realistic background there is a symbolic
lacoon, and Molnar’s synthesis of his defects of sentimentality and emotional
contrivance becomes so perfect that sheer theatricality is assimilated in what
Lynton Hudson calls, “the play’s character portrayal and its universal truth.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next play and the four others which followed it, were either comedies or
comedies mixed with fantasies, each possessing variable merits and limitations.
<i>The Guardsman </i>(1911), “a witty piece of sophisticated drollery on the
theme of marital infidelity,” was successful as a film in spite of a fine
symbolism underlying its brilliant comedy. For a while laughter seems to
triumph in the plot devised by a jealous husband to test his wife, and if the
curtain ironically falls on a man thoroughly baffled by a woman’s wit, you can
detect Molnar’s “fundamental contempt of the Komodiant, of that side of our
nature which eternally falsifies the truth”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

Attorney-at-law </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(1912), also known as <i>The Wolf, </i>was
a farce, while <i>The Swan </i>(1914) and <i>Fashions for Men </i>(1915) pursue
a skilful way between ironic comedy and sentiment. <i>The Wolf </i>is a
variation on the theme of the <i>Guardsman </i>in a lighter vein; <i>The Swan </i>revived
the princess-meets-commoner theme and tells the story of the heroine who,
falling in love with her tutor, decides to remain a swan majestically floating
on her own watery element rather than step in an awkward manner on the common
ground; <i>Fashions for Men </i>is “an ironic comedy of a hero, Peter, who acts
with magnanimity when his wife runs away. His reputation for saintliness,
however, brings its own rewards and his business is shown as prospering
mightily from the esteem he has won f</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
these plays that were written before World War I the predominant mood is that
of a gay cynicism coupled with a constant awareness that the theatre should be
as theatrical as a film should be cinematic. Not that, unobtrusive and kept
well below the surface, there was not<i> </i>some universal truth or that once
while there was no spark of the symbolism of the earlier <i>Liliom. </i>The
spirit of fantasy also remained alive to develop in the first play that Molnar
wrote during the War. Serving as war correspondent during the first World War,
Molnar found time to give a view of the business he was engaged in a miracle
play <i>The White Cloud </i>(1916) a part of whose action, as in <i>Liliom, </i>takes
place in heaven. The note of fantasy which always colours Molna’s central ideas
remained in the play and gave him kinship with the author of <i>A Kiss for
Cinderilla.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
the next few years Molnar, too preoccupied with various other types of writing,
did not produce a play till 1923 when <i>The Red Mill </i>(produced in New York
as <i>Mima </i>in 1928) developed the strain of <i>The White Cloud. </i>It is a
philosophically conceived play, the characters in which are God, Lucifer, and a
perfect human being. In structure as well as in substance the play comes near a
morality play with a kaleidoscopic symbolism in which Life, conceived as a
mill, grinds humanity into a tragic caricature of what it sets out to become.
The forty scenes of <i>The Red Mill </i>begin where <i>Liliom </i>ended, in
heaven where Lucifer strikes a wager with the Almighty that he can ruin the
best of men. The choice of the perfect man is, of course, left to God, and the
Devil corrupts his innocence with the time-honoured instruments of
corruption–gold and woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
the abstract thinker in Molnar emerged out of the one-time cynical and
theatrical dramatist, and I have sometimes felt that Molnar had caught the
Pirandellan spark and doubted the reality of the human individual. Not that the
theatricality of life goes out of his vision but that he perhaps believes in
Evrienoff’s famous statement: “Every minute of our life is a theatre...”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
in spite of his fundamental emphasis on the human soul, the outwardly realistic
action has not been abandoned at the altar of fantasy, as in the next play <i>The
Glass Slipper </i>written in 1924. It combined a naturalistic background of low
life with romance, re-telling the Cinderella story with gentle irony, since the
Prince of the fable is only a middle-aged cabinet maker. The Cinderella heroine
is a Budapest servant girl who has been nourished on too many romantic plays.
The resultant is a fine yarn of sentimental fantasy threaded in an external
realistic action with the dialogue now and then Sprinkled with Viennese
dialect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

next play <i>The Play’s the Thing </i>(1924) again proved Molnar’s mastery of
the art of capricious and sophisticated comedy, as in the subsequent <i>Olympia
</i>(1927) he displayed once more his skill as a satirist of royalty and high
life in general. One almost feels that <i>The Play’s the Thing </i>completes
the circle and returns to the technique of <i>The Red Mill </i>or <i>The White
Cloud. </i>Its story is this: Albert Adam, the young fiancee of the actress, by
chance overhears her making love to another man, whereupon one of his friends,
a dramatist, hastily concocts a one-act play in the dialogue of which the
overheard words occur. The result is that, when he listens to the rehearsal of
the piece, Albert is happily convinced that the love-scene was fictional, and
thus for him the imaginary becomes the actual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which is available in the English version though I understand that he had
written two more plays. In <i>The Good Fairy </i>a romantic usherette from a
Budapest theatre gets involved in a series of adventures as a result of her
desire to do good to everybody–thus preserving in a way Molnar’s reputation as
an expert in the creation of amusing and theatrically effective situations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
are the<i> </i>plays of Molnar many of which had an established reputation on
the<i> </i>Hungarian stage. Dramatically speaking, however, Molnar’s lineage
may perhaps be traced to junior Dumas and to<i> </i>Scribe with his situations
and dialogues having a finish that may occasionally appear a bit too rounded.
In fact, Molnar’s dialogues may be said to have been modelled, too much on the
Cabaret style, though his theatre-instinct enabled him to master a technique
that helped him to know that craftsmanship plays a great part in all stage
successes. Molnar can calculate the exact effect of every spoken line; he knows
just which will raise a laugh and which only a lump in the throat. Molnar’s
sense of stage was so perfect that he rarely missed establishing the right sort
of balance between fantasy and theatricality, though the critics hold that the
brilliance of his comic dialogue, so effective in the original, has been
heavily lost </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

be absurd, as in the first one-act play of the trilogy <i>Theatre</i>, but the
ludicrous, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which he gradually introduces into the network
of absurdity, has a charm that only a few dramatists have achieved. The height
of dramatic perfection Molnar attained in <i>Liliom, </i>and, as Barret Clarke
has shrewdly observed, if he does not live by any other play he will live by
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

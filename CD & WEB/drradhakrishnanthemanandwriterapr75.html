I reflect upon the tragedy, not his but ours, of the last days of Dr
Radhakrishnan, sans speech, sans memory, sans everything, my thoughts go back
to the striking picture or his, with his long coat, white turban, white dhoti
wound round in Bengali fashion with the folds in front, and more than
everything else the sharp glint of his eyes through his glasses and the ever
vigorous expression on his lips. He was never known to have appeared in any negligent
mood. He was always alert with his penetrating mind into everything he came in
contact, whether persons or books. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Years
back, in 1932, in <span class=SpellE>Waltair</span> as the Vice-Chancellor of
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Andhra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, he was all active, attending
to so many details. I happened to meet him just for <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of a foreword for a book of mine of sketches of some of the important men in
public life. The printed matter was in his hands earlier to my meeting him, by
previous arrangement. He accosted me as I entered his study which put me at
ease. He made enquiries as to my stay and its duration. In a few minutes more,
his typist handed him a few sheets of<i> </i>typed paper which <span
class=GramE>he</span> glanced through quickly. Without waiting for<i> </i>any
more formalities, he read out in his own powerful voice the contents of<i> </i>the
foreword which he had intended as befitting the launching of my first book into
the literary world. No doubt, the foreword was more generous than I expected,
and it contained very arresting expressions of his literary approach to the subject.

in me on his side.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, it was
not much of<i> </i>a difficulty for me, or for that matter, for any of his vast
circle of acquaintances, to call on him without previous notice. He appeared
ready to greet visitors of whatever rank or degree of acquaintanceship, with
his usual raised voice of familiarity and benign smile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is true no other person in recent times has had such an amount of world-wide

Vice-Chancellor or a Chairman of the Upper House of Parliament or an ambassador
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> or
the President of India, all the roles were to him coming in the usual way. Yet
he remained the Professor of philosophy, which <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
he deemed as in no way less significant or dignified than any of the new
positions which he was destined to occupy. It was said that he even advised a
friend who was receiving fresh <span class=SpellE>honours</span> but had
started as a Professor in life, to introduce himself to newcomers as a
Professor only. He attached indeed more significance to being a teacher than
being a President of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of public importance and dignitaries from foreign <span class=GramE>lands</span>
who met him as President, carried the impression of him as a real intellectual
of the first rank, unperturbed by the changes which certainly <span
class=SpellE>publicised</span> his presence more frequently to the world. The
balance of mind which he retained in all his rapid transformations of the
higher offices he held, proved him well-anchored in a spirit of equanimity and
composure, germane to a philosopher. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>With all his elevated rank in official society,
there never was an occasion for friends known to him to complain of any assumed
reserve on his part. He was quite normal in spite of many official functions to
be attended to and too much restriction of the protocol. He even liked to have
a chat wherein he could revive an old association to memory or engage himself
in a light conversation recalling familiar landmarks of public life in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. If <span
class=GramE>an</span> younger spirit tried to regale him with anecdotes of the
highly placed in life or draw his attention to some of the current gossips in
politics, he affected no aversion but enjoyed with a sense of <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>, the comments and reflections. Still, he was wary
enough not to give the impression of his conversation descending into levity of
any kind. </p>

monographs and pamphlets upon all aspects of philosophy of both the East and
West have emerged from him; still, for all his repute as a great writer, he
would not treat in highbrow fashion any of the writings of many an aspiring
young writer. Rather he would bless him with a kind word if sought, and promote
his claims to further-laurels by his enthusiastic encouragement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Students
of philosophy consider his two volumes on Indian philosophy as a classic which
will stand time. Criticisms and contradictions are not unknown to authors in
every stage of their rising popularity; Radhakrishnan too was not free from the
clutches, of such carping reviewers and unsympathetic critics. Even while the
English world had accepted him as a master of language and style, our own
academic diehards hesitated to pass him (in) their tests. The penalty of
greatness has to pay its price in sharing praise and dispraise in the same
manner. <span class=GramE>And he, as a true philosopher bore with them, neither
complainingly nor showing ultra-sensitivity.</span> His writings flowed on with
the same rate of creativity, season after season. There was the same eagerness
and response to his output in the ever-widening circle of thinking minds the
world over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from philosophy and his solid contributions to the expression of an urgent and
world-embracing purpose, his service to literature was singular. He gave his
unique gifts of brilliant ideas of <span class=SpellE>splendour</span> and
vividness to the reshaping of a society plunged in its own conventional
attitudes to the impact of a growing consciousness among all the other nations
for a new way of life. At the same moment, he chastised the militant Western
countries to desist from pouring molten steel into the veins of the youth’ and
preparing them for mutual destruction through wars. Whatever he wrote, he made
it a point to release philosophy from the bare prison of <span class=SpellE>textualism</span>
and scholastic studies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was because he could interpret philosophy in terms of comprehending the
aspirations of the entire humanity that sometimes other religionists like
Christian began to suspect him as having only based his thoughts on their own
tenets. It appears to be the fate of great minds to be misjudged whenever they
swept the world by their resurgent philosophy. <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath</span>
Tagore, with his “<span class=SpellE>Gitanjali</span>” captivating the entire
world, was in the same manner suspected of Biblical influence on his poetry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of Radhakrishnan as in the case of the Rt. Hon. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sastri</span>, the spoken word nearly got in its own form on to
the printed page. But unlike any other known writer a vast distinction existed
in the way that Radhakrishnan wrote his superb works which have brought the
West and the East nearer to each other. If his utterances often struck
listeners by his powers of packing his thoughts within a half-hour in the most
extraordinary manner of arresting phraseology and metaphors, he no less proved
his claim to recognition as an invigorating thinker in print where his mind
reflected both the erudition he had gathered during his long studentship and
the flair for enlivening expression of even abstruse thought by the best
individualistic presentation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Beautiful
quotations gleaned from every source of literary execution nestled round his
exposition of<i> </i>a point which otherwise would have remained <span
class=SpellE>unillumined</span> for his readers. Often his mind went to fetch
beauties of other minds in order to <span class=SpellE>emphasise</span> and
carry conviction to his listeners or readers of what his thesis tried to
develop. For illustration, let us just take his speech delivered at the
Philosophical Conference in 1934, when he laid his indictment at the doors of
the militant nations of the West preparing the youth of their countries to a
great sacrifice of lives through wars. He dwelt upon a story of Oscar Wilde. He
said: “Oscar Wilde has a great story which reads thus: Christ came to a white
plain from a purple city and as He passed through the first street, He heard
voices overhead and saw a young man lying drunk on a window-sill and said: “Why
do you waste your soul in drunkenness?” He said, ‘Lord, I was a leper and you
healed me; what else can I do?’ A little further through the town He saw a
young man following a harlot and said: “Why do you dissolve your soul in
debauchery?” and the young man answered: ‘Lord, I was blind and you healed me;
what else can I do?’ At last in the middle of the city He saw an old man
crouching, weeping upon the ground and when He asked him why he wept, the old
man answered, ‘Lord, I was dead and you raised me to life, what else can I do?’
Here the story ends. If Jesus should visit us today and find that we are
comfort-minded and have taken to worship of the most monstrous illusions like
militant nationalism and are pouring molten steel into the veins of innocent
youth that it may be used to undreamed-of heights in mutual destruction and ask
‘Why do you indulge after so many centuries of civilization, in human
sacrifices on this colossal scale?’ Our answer would be: ‘Lord, you gave us
eyes but no sight; you gave us brains but no soul; you gave us science but no
philosophy’.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
appositeness and the poetic exhortation inlaid in the illustration and the
inference suggested are surpassingly original and unforgettable. That is
Radhakrishnan! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
memory for passages of excellence in literature of both English and Sanskrit,
he had plenty. The quality of such selections also never flagged for all his
many occasions to speak and write. The same memory relieved many a smaller man
of too much <span class=SpellE>labouring</span> for being <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
as an old acquaintance or stray visitors at his door. He often proved a
sympathetic listener encouraging the other with his superior gift of proving
his equal and showing interest in the other by his attentive hearing. His witty
remarks at times added to the piquancy of an observation or the juiciness of a
narration. He was not trying to lord it over anybody or benumbing the person
into an abject reticence in his presence. The observant listener in him often
inspired the visitor, particularly if he happened to be young in years, to
greater ease and confidence than even words of encouragement could provide. He
was human in the best sense of the word. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
more can be said of his eminence among men of knowledge and power; but none
else had in an equal measure the qualities of an orator, writer and thinker,
all gathered in one. The <span class=SpellE>Churchills</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Sastris</span> too did not possess in an abundant measure all the
three. He was out and out a force for making the citizens of the world relieve
the way of life which our ancients alone had shown to mankind from times of
yore. If he was not destined to portray a more dedicated life of service to
philosophy, it was because of the necessities of a changing <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> which
placed him in demand for different services after her liberation from a foreign
yoke. Necessity alone drove him to<i> </i>render his share in New
Administration and <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> the dream of Plato for a
philosopher-king at the helm of secular affairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

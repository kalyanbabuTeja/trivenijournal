mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> assigns the Doctrine
of Trusteeship an important role in his politics for the upkeep of the true
democratic spirit in society. Writing on equality Mahatma Gandhi advocates “Voluntary
abdication of riches and the power that riches give, and sharing them with
people, for the common good” and commends, to that effect, the trusteeship
doctrine in the following words: “I adhere to my doctrine of trusteeship, in
spite of the ridicule that has been poured over it. It is true that it is
difficult to achieve in practice. So is non-violence. But we made up our minds
to negotiate that steep ascent. We have found it worth the effort.” For <span
class=GramE>the</span> operation, (of non-violence) however, <span
class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> lays down the condition that “complete reliance on
God is essential for non-violence.” The same condition in a wider sense holds
good with this doctrine too. In the course of his talks on socialism, <span
class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> said: “Trusteeship is my answer to the issue of class
<span class=SpellE>conftict</span>.” Such a doctrine must have more than purely
secular notions behind it. This doctrine has its genesis in the divine dictum
that “Nothing in this world belongs to thee or <span class=SpellE>thine</span>”,
which great religions all do proclaim. Religion assigns man the status of a
trustee in the worldly aspect of his life. Man’s thoughts might be working in
terms of its negation, consciously or unconsciously, but life in its practical
working would not miss it, but would be running its course in pursuit of its
spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>, the great king, said, “I have heaps of wealth
all around me but none of it is mine.” When <span class=SpellE>Yudhishtira</span>
defined wealth as the harbinger of sin, the great <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span>
said to him “God created wealth for <span class=SpellE><i>Yajna</i></span><i> </i>(sacrifice)
and He enjoined it on man to acquire wealth. “The <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span>
also urged on him that he was in duty bound to acquire wealth and perform <span

considered the best means to serve the social good and the sustenance of
humanity. <span class=SpellE>Vemana</span>, the great philosopher-poet
interpreting it said: “With all the earnestness inspired by hope of immortality
for one’s life, one should earn wealth and knowledge, for service to humanity,
and he should attend to it with due promptness awaiting death’s call at any
moment.” To prevent all possible misunderstanding, it is further clarified in
the <span class=SpellE><i>Mohabharata</i></span><i> </i>that it does not imply
that all wealth is intended for <span class=SpellE>Yajna</span> or Dana (gifts
and charity), but it may be <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> for one’s
maintenance, for help to his relatives and others, for meeting other legitimate
obligations, and for Dana and <span class=SpellE>Yajna</span> as well.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <span class=SpellE><i>Mahabharata</i></span><i>. </i>This is to be treated
as a fact of experience God <span class=SpellE>Sree</span> Krishna said that he
would bestow health, wealth and prosperity on his devotee who surrenders
himself to him with unequivocal faith in him. <span class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span>

mind always aspires for health, wealth and prosperity. Desire, acquisitiveness
and ambition are integral factors of human nature: acting as creative forces
they provide the initiative, the incentive and the impetus for all man’s
productive activities, rousing his aspirations to their limits and also
according to the will cherished, that the benefits thereof do survive him for
his posterity too. These human impulses impelling him, man takes to acquiring
wealth in right earnest, absorbing himself entirely in the work with all his
mental and physical resources, and his mind solely devoted to God for his
blessings to ensure success for his efforts. These conditions are designed for
the individual and it is the individual that could acquire wealth, build up
reserves and hold it sustained. The duties, responsibilities and functions of
the State lie on a different footing and they do not fit in with these
conditions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Individual
wealth or private property has thus behind it the divine will and the divine
sanction. Even conceding Marx’s dictum that all wealth is the product of <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>, <span class=SpellE>labour</span> itself, physical
or intellectual, has to be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> as the gift of
God, world experience testifying to it. The sanctity of private property should
not be infringed upon. The State is there to encourage, help and promote it by
all means. Private property serves as the bulwark for the economic structure of
the State and the State which destroys the integrity of private property or
discourages its acquisition in any manner, always stands faced with the risk of
economic disaster. European economy has already been experiencing the fallacy,
as the policy of discountenancing private property is being pursued there, and
it has since lost its vantage ground in the pattern of world economy. <span
class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span> says: “Complete renunciation of one’s own
possessions was a thing which very few, even among the ordinary folk, were
capable of. All that we could legitimately expect of the wealthy <span
class=GramE>class,</span> is for them to hold their riches in trust and use
them for the service of society. To insist upon more would be to kill the goose
that laid the golden eggs.” <span class=SpellE>Mahatmaji’s</span> conception of
trusteeship does not differ from that elaborated and clarified in the <span
class=SpellE><i>Mahabharata</i></span><i>. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

is a fact of life. Politics may aim at equality, but it could never be achieved
to perfection. If at all attempted, it may be at the cost of individual
freedom, perhaps its entire suppression. It was attempted in Russia and China
under conditions of unprecedented regimentation, binding down the individual,
with State control in every aspect of his activity, followed by the abolition
of private property; all to put down disparities. Yet disparities persist in
the physical and intellectual capacities of the individual and the State cannot
help <span class=SpellE>recognising</span> it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to the Karma theory of Hindu philosophy, the responsibility for the existence
of inequality is attributed to the individual himself, as also the
responsibility for mending or ending it. This responsibility may be met a long
way by the individual, as a response to his self-exertions, followed by
incessant efforts, conditioned by their purity and the purity of their cause,
and all action surrendered to the Divine will for its effect, with due faith in
God. As the spirit develops in society, the evil gets mitigated in due course,
the disparities becoming less and less acute. At least bare necessities would
scarcely be felt wanting. <span class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span> says “God will
give food and cloth to one who exerts himself to the best of his abilities with
faith in Him.” In case any such contingency arises, society may be trusted with
the responsibility to meet it. <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> justifies the
claim of the individual to this limit, as a matter of divine verdict for the
sustenance of the body and soul to pursue life’s purpose, and he urges on the
responsibility of the State and the society to meet it. Bare necessity is a
physical need and it may be met; but beyond this, all luxury is a mental
craving and could not be satisfied at any stage. Happiness is more a mental
phenomenon and it could be had by the proper set up of the mind, by <span
class=GramE>a knowledge</span> of life’s working, its limitations and the
vicissitudes that confront it, and the ways and means to avert them. With all
the disparities in wealth and the attendant amenities of life, <span
class=SpellE>Dharmavyadha</span>, the butcher, <span class=SpellE>Toladhara</span>,
the grocer, and <span class=SpellE>Janaka</span>, the great king, are all said
to have lived happy and peaceful, and equally so, conscious of their duties and
responsibilities, duly responding to them, by prompt and conscientious
attendance to them, surrendering all action to the<i> </i>divine will. The <span
class=SpellE><i>Mahabharata</i></span><i> </i>assigns to them the seat of
knowledge. Disparities or no disparities, a society of people brought up in
this spirit, equipped with the requisite knowledge, could be ensured happiness,
true and real, the sole aim of man’s life and equality assured to that effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Freedom
for the individual to work out his own destiny is essential for rendering his
progress real and enduring, morally and economically. It infuses the sense of
godliness and purity of life in him and gives all encouragement to his
enterprising spirit. It may be implemented by an economic programme, providing
for free enterprise, permitting due economic freedom to the individual,
opportunities being wide open, and the incentives set free, to work their way
unfettered, to keep up the initiative and the impetus for man’s productive
activities. <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> politics inculcate it and <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> methods facilitate it. <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span>
deprecates all force and says: “The good brought about through force will
ultimately destroy individuality which is the foundation of all real and
abiding progress. Only when the change is effected through persuasion and the
force of love, it can be fully preserved.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wealth
carries with it the divine responsibility to serve the social good. <span
class=SpellE>Yajna</span> (sacrifice) and Dana (gifts and charities) are
enjoined by our scriptures to meet the purpose, and they include several forms
of gifts; gifts of food, cloth, house, land, cows, gold, marriage donations and
others; all tending to social good. These gifts are prescribed as a religious
or divine injunction for one’s own salvation, particularly gifts of food and
cloth which should be scrupulously attended to by the rich and the poor alike,
as occasions arise and means permit. Underlying this is the wide-spread faith,
that as <span class=SpellE>Danam</span> (gift) is duly observed, wealth gets
perpetuated from birth to birth and brings salvation to man. According to <span
class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span> “the majority follow the path of purity by faith
and not by knowledge.” This process goes on <span class=SpellE>on</span> no
simple scale, but working as it does on a <span class=SpellE>decentralised</span>
system it passes unnoticed and when brought to account, it would reach
significant proportions. Breach of this responsibility will have its <span
class=SpellE>repurcussions</span>, and wealth will be changing hands to suit
its conditions. The moral influence this process exercises is a unique feature
of Hindu society, and any interference by the State, or otherwise, in its
working, would greatly impair it, and it could never be restored by the State
with its mechanical means. <span class=SpellE>Danam</span> or gift is a divine
injunction and has behind it the religious aspect, and the State cannot
interfere with it in any way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reiterates the traditional religious view that man by nature is God-minded. He
is endowed with knowledge and he possesses the power of thinking and discrimination.
Enlightened, he could <span class=SpellE>realise</span> the realities and
implications of life and his status in the world in the light of their spirit,
in relation to God and to humanity, and in the course of it, the God
consciousness and the force of love, the embodiment of God in him, awakened,
inspire in him the spirit of service to God and service to humanity. The
individual thus influenced, the moral sense and the humanitarian tendencies
thus prevailing over his mind, the required change of heart, insisted upon by <span
class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span>, for the proper set up of the democratic spirit,
would be ensured to society, the requisite social consciousness forthcoming.
Religion will be of effective service in this respect to equip society with the
requisite knowledge and enlightenment to set the human values to action, to
play their part to restore integrity to social life and promote the true
democratic spirit in its working. <span class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span> commends
for this purpose ‘non-violence and the doctrine of Trusteeship’ which places
man in the status of a trustee in the worldly aspect of his life. They are the
fundamental principles of religion, which promote the ethical and spiritual
standards of man regulating his relations and conduct, his duties and
responsibilities to humanity, and as well also, his activities for the progress
of his life to its real ends. The <span class=SpellE><i>Mahabharata</i></span>
commends them as the moral and spiritual guide to pursue life’s purpose. This
is practical religion and is capable of universal application and would be
congruous to working in co-operation with politics to bring up a society well
ordered, with social conduct and social relations self-restored and
self-adjusted and truly democratic in its spirit, society getting conscious of
its moral and economic bindings, duly enlightened by the knowledge of the
implications of these doctrines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

democracy is not a mechanical thing to be adjusted by the abolition of forms.
It requires change of heart.” This truth is not finding due appreciation even
among his followers, now in power, and they are resorting more to the former
course only, following more or less the Marxian methods of working. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

socialism aims at the building up of society predominantly on considerations of
economic values, ignoring the human values, the vital role they play in shaping
it; and it could not maintain the moral and spiritual stamina of the society,
to bring in the necessary sense of duties and responsibilities; it has only
promoted misconceived notions of rights, material considerations outweighing
all others, fostering bitterness among men and all resulting in unrest and
constant political struggles with no end in sight. <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
politics, influenced by the element of religion, provide the safeguard against
the materialistic preponderance society is generally prone to, in its working.
Individual freedom, the doctrine or trusteeship and non-violence, and an
economic policy based on the principles and the spirit underlying them, these
playing the leading role in mending their operation, accommodate the
co-ordinate functioning of the material and spiritual values and ensure
society’s progress in both the aspects; and they, as well, maintain the moral
stamina of the society, promote an appropriate sense of duties and
responsibilities and a legitimate understanding of rights, and render the
social relations and conduct mutual and cordial, peace and contentment reigning
all through. <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> assures us that Marxian aims
could be <span class=SpellE>realised</span> through his politics while he
denies their achievement through the Marxian methods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

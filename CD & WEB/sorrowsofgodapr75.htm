awakening consciousness spread and from it emerged light which shot through space.
Continuing to spread it diversified and condensed into minute particles which
gravitated, aggregated, rotated and reacted, and stars, moons and planets were

some of these He infused life and consciousness, and these moved and crawled
and walked and functioned subject to the laws which He made for them. More and
more complex beings He created without halting to judge how they would behave. <span
class=GramE>As a new creature was made and it came before Him.</span> He gave
it a set of laws for its conduct and <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> which
it followed faithfully in its existence. To the little ant, as it appeared, He
gave a set of rules and laws to follow and obey in life, and it went away to do
and live accordingly. To each creature, small or big, the mosquito, the spider,
the snake, the fish, the cat, the dog, the tiger, the elephant and others, and
to the various birds, as each was created and appeared before Him, He similarly
gave suitable rules and laws to follow, and each went away to obey them and

rising enthusiasm He continued to create more and more sophisticated creatures
even though He had difficulty in managing some of them. But by altering and
readjusting the process and mechanism of their manufacture He was able to
establish control over them and make them obey His laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the two-legged man came and stood before Him. As He had framed and given laws
to follow in life to other creatures, so He gave to man also. But to His
surprise He saw that man did not mean to abide by them. He explained that the
laws were for his good, for his happiness and well-being, but he looked careless
and indifferent. He repeated His advice and instructions but man did not heed,
and turned to go. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>God
held His hand and stopped further creation to attend to the problem of man, but
man had gone beyond His control. What had gone wrong in the complex human
machine made up of many parts and pieces, circuits and inter-linked gadgets,
due to which man behaved like that, He wondered. He checked and rechecked and
altered some circuits and took out some parts, but to no effect. Then He called
those men who had been created and who were at large in order to dismantle
them, but the, disregarded His call and went their way. What worried Him was to
find that, though He had kept the procreating power of all creatures under
restrictive rules which regulated their generation, He had omitted to keep
check on the procreating power of man. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>If<i>
</i></span>the other creatures did not mind the laws which God made for them,
they were to go out of existence because their procreating power was controlled
by Him. But not so with man who was conscious of his unrestricted self-creating
power. And therefore he ignored His command. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>God
watched amazed and alarmed. Man started creating man recklessly and haphazardly,
unlike the man God had meant to create. As a result man remained <span
class=GramE>not of one specie</span> like other creatures, in spite of having some
resemblance in physical shape and form. Fantastic human products came in
increasing number and they were so varied in <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>
and conduct that there was no peace, no harmony in their home or outside and no
understanding, no adjustment in their activities and inter-relationship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

burst out of their environment, disturbing peace and order, breaking nature’s
laws and upsetting God’s plan and purpose. They felled trees, plucked flowers,
killed other creatures, cut the surface of the earth, obstructed and deflected
the course of streams terraced the sides of hills and drove tunnels through
mountains. Glittering gold and diamond buried deep in the earth for protection from
sun and rain they dug out and spoiled by the touch of their greedy hands and the
focus of their lustful eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

was confusion and devastation all around. The earth quaked, the sea waved, air

killed and ran from one another. Man was on rampage. Nature, stripped of its

glory and shy sweetness by the crude hands of man, was in tears which fell from

He disobeyed his Creator, disregarded His wishes and followed not His laws and
injunctions. He flouted His authority to establish his own. The many things and
creatures which God had created were put in disorder and disarray and these
looked up to Him for help and protection. Man oppressed <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

bells to call His attention. But God was helpless. He watched and regretted
having made a Frankenstein who advanced to molest Him too. Man disfigured His
image and gave it many odd shapes and fantastic forms. He sometimes fixed Him
on a cross and sometimes cut Him to small size to put Him inside a four-walled
temple. He <span class=SpellE>symbolised</span> Him whimsically and his vanity
made him elevate his own smallness to greatness by describing God as one like
himself having similar body, mind, feelings and sentiments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>God
was disgusted at such caricature of Him by man who put on show strange and funny
models of Him cut out of stone and told fantastic and ridiculous tales and
stories about Him as if he knew all about Him since he was born. God was
bewildered; He was annoyed. But He was helpless. Man was beyond His control. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Prior
to the advent of man God was free and familiar with His creatures, with the
birds, animals and all the rest. He used to appear before them, play with them,
share their joys, feelings and emotions and join in their work and activities.
He was not mysterious but familiar to them. They knew Him as one of them. But
when man came and misrepresented Him and gave a false and strange picture of
Him and made Him look small, odd and fantastic, He felt ashamed to show His
face and appear before them. He hid Himself and became mysterious. The birds
looked for Him at dawn and called Him to join in their song as before; the
animals came out in the open to play with Him; flowers blossomed and spread
their fragrance to welcome Him; but poor God had no face to show them. It was hideously
<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> and disfigured by man. He hid behind the
clouds, sad and dejected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
man made His stay there also intolerable. In his little meaningless languages
man composed hymns and prayers, which contained no sense, to <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> His and these he recited again and again and louder
and louder till God’s ears could stand no longer. Disowning and disobeying Him
in all respects and in all things <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>life
man’s prayers and solicitations added insult to the injury inflicted by him on
God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
the creation <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>man God had in
His mind the creation of higher and higher beings, but He realized after His
experience with man that if He created more sophisticated and higher beings
than man they would defy Him more. So He stopped further creation and in
regret, sorrow and disgust, higher and higher above the clouds He withdrew to
be out of the reach of man’s vision, man’s calls, shouts and prayers. And more
and more He mystified Himself and dived into the dark space. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Why
did my beloved man turn like this? Why did he go astray? Why did he forsake all
that I had given him–good sense, clear vision, good sentiments, good
understanding, the power to judge and discriminate, which would have brought
him all the joys, all the bliss, all the happiness that life and the world
could give? Why did he go off the good, smooth path on which I had placed him?
Why did he not look and listen to me? Why did he disregard and disobey the good
laws I had made for his safety and security, for his well-being and happiness? <span
class=GramE>O why did my beloved man leave all that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

sorrow?”</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
God wondered, lamented and reflected. Man was in sorrow, in distress and
suffering and sank more and more in them as he left the lead of God who spoke
and warned from within his heart till he threw Him out. Man’s sorrows made Him
sorrowful, but man made His stay with him impossible. He not only disobeyed and
flouted Him, but his false description <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>Him and his insincere worship and prayer which allowed Him no peace, no
rest, made His presence in the world miserable. His relation with His creatures
also became embarrassing because <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>man’s
hideous misrepresentation of Him before them. Yet as He departed from this
world He thought not so much <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the
faults of man as of his sorrows and sufferings. But He was helpless to help man
who cared not for Him and who never wanted <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>to </span>understand His true <span class=GramE>Self</span> and to know
what message He had for him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Man
was still His most beloved creature. He loved him still and loved him all the more
for his sorrows which made His own sorrows deeper and more <span class=SpellE>agonising</span>.
And He regretted all the more His helplessness to help man. Unable to bear the
sight of his sorrows as He moved away from the good earth and its creatures He
saw the earth crumbling under the hand of man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Away
He moved faster and faster with the receding galaxies into the hollow of space
to create another earth but an earth having all other things as in this except
man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
there was one man who truly loved Him, who trusted Him, who had abiding faith in
His taking care of him and doing what was the best for him. And so he had no fear,
no worry, no discontent, <span class=GramE>no</span> agitation in mind. He had
accepted and followed the rules and laws of nature which he understood God had
made for his welfare and happiness. He walked erect, looked forward with
confidence and whatever came and whatever happened he found in them the loving hand
of God working for his good. In his trustful dependence on Him he had wished
for nothing, because he believed that what he would wish and desire might not
be for his good but what He would give would be. So he never prayed, never sang
hymns to praise, flatter and <span class=GramE>please</span> Him. When others
shouted and prayed he entreated them not to trouble and disturb Him. “Can’t you
trust Him to do the best for you?”–but none listened. He didn’t read the holy
books in which he was distressed to find untrue statements and raise descriptions
of Him. He turned away from where greedy, lustful people sat in worship and
made offerings to God in the hope of pleasing Him to grant them their wishes.
He was pained to see that these people gave Him no rest, no peace and kept
shouting and praying “Give me this, give me that, <span class=GramE>give</span>
me more and more.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

withdrew from there and looked up to the sky where he saw God moving away from

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is remarkable how a literary genius can find material in the most unusual
incidents and connect them into a topic of interest. What would most probably
have been deemed to oblivion and obscurity in the dusty pages of the journals
that dealt with the problems of British administration in India is brought to
life in <i>The Confessions of a Thug </i>by John Meadows Taylor. It is
interesting to note how he <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> all the information
he had gained as an administrative officer into a novel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
may be many who may not even be familiar with the name Thug in India today but
in the 18th and 19th centuries the organization of Thugs had made travel
practically impossible in the country. Curiously enough both Muslim and Hindu
Thugs were united in a common cause, in the worship of Kali or <span
class=SpellE>Bhavani</span>. It was an absolutely close-knit fraternity which
was bound by common rules, regulations, superstitions and customs. There is no
knowledge about the actual origin of this association. In 1816, however, a
paper was published by Doctor Sherwood in the <i>Literary Journal </i>of Madras
in which he had made a very detailed study of the ceremonies and practices of
the Thugs of Southern India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1830 Colonel <span class=SpellE>Sleeman</span>, who was the political agent for
the Central Provinces, brought to light certain gruesome crimes committed by
the Thugs of that area. On the basis of the papers he published and the appeals
he made for the eradication of Thugs, the attention of the public was aroused
and mass scale preparations were made to apprehend and wipe out all Thugs in
the country. It was in the form of a crusade, and Colonel Meadows Taylor was
one of the officers entrusted with the work of apprehending and trying Thugs in
the Central Provinces­.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Philip
Meadows Taylor was the son of a merchant and was born in Liverpool in the year
1803. His father’s failure in busi­ness landed him in financial difficulties,
so he undertook the job of working as a clerk for a merchant. When he was
fifteen years old he was sent to Bombay to work in the same capacity for
another merchant. Certain unhappy incidents made him give up civil life and
take to a career in the army, so he enlisted as a soldier of the <span
class=SpellE>Nizam</span>. In his regiment he had to make the first
investigation about the Thugs. Later, he acted as the Regent for the minor son
of the Raja of <span class=SpellE>Sholapore</span>. Later on when he was made
Governor of one of the <span class=SpellE>Berar</span> districts he managed to
keep perfect peace during his regime. He had a natural inclination for writing
and a flair for narrative. Most of the information and personal experiences
acquired during his long stay in India find their way into his novels. Besides <i>The
Confessions of a Thug </i>he has also written a number of historical novels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>The Confessions of a Thug </i>is based on the notes he
had prepared during his service in India and also his personal encounter with a
notorious Thug. In 1834 when he was recovering from a bad attack of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Jungle<i> </i></span>Fever he wrote this
book as a mere form of relaxation. He had a good deal of first hand information
on the subject of Thugs and his mind was absolutely full with the extensive
notes he had made on individual cases. In his preface to the first edition
which was published in 1839 he tries to explain his reasons for writing the
book. He makes it quite clear that his motive was not to gratify a morbid taste
in people for tales of horror and crime, but to expose fully the practices of
the Thugs. While accepting the author’s explanation one still has the feeling
that he would have also been prompted to a certain extent by the idea of the “Whiteman’s
burden” which most English administrators of India had at that time. In his
preface to the second edition the author explains why the book had been received
<span class=SpellE>favourably</span> by the English public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
hero of the confessions is not an imaginary character. He is created from the
author’s personal encounter with a notorious Thug. In the year 1832 the author
came to know a well-known Thug who was working as an informer for the <span
class=SpellE>Nizam’s</span> territories. He had narrated to the author the
story of his life and his exploits as a Thug and how he had been instrumental
in the murder of seven hundred and nineteen travellers. The very idea was
gruesome and terrifying but Meadows Taylor was very curious to know as to how a
human being could so degrade himself, bring himself down to the level of an
insensible wild beast, and mercilessly kill so many innocent men and women. The
book is a very interesting and fascinating study of the criminal instinct not just
in one but a group of individuals. The main incidents described in the book are
dependent upon actual facts, but a certain amount of fiction has also been used
to connect the events and make the adventures of the Thug as interesting as the
nature of his horrible profession would permit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
book is written in the form of a narrative in the first person. <span
class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali the Thug narrates his adventures to the author,
and only now and then the author makes his personality felt by the occasional
comments, remarks and explanations. In the first chapter the Thug tries to
justify his profession. He calls <span class=SpellE>Thuggee</span> a game or a
sport akin to the hunting of a wild animal. For the Thug the prey is man
against whom he has sworn a “relentless unerring destruction.” The author is
positively horrified and revolted by this statement, but is prompted by
curiosity to know the reason why a human being develops such hatred towards his
own fellowmen. There must be some psychology behind such hatred, so he asks the
Thug to relate the story of his life, how he became a Thug and his exploits as
a member of that gang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
confession starts with the faint recollections that <span class=SpellE>Amir</span>
Ali had about his early childhood. He had been born in a well-to-do family and
he had a little sister who had been very attached to him. He could remember a
journey that he and his family made from their village to another and how the
party had halted at a village for taking rest and food. It is here that they
met a stranger who had taken a great fancy to <span class=SpellE>Amir</span>
Ali, and when in the evening the party started on their journey, the stranger
with another unknown man accompanied them on the pretext of friendship and
company. But when the party reached a lonely part of the forest these two
strangers suddenly attacked them and killed every member of that group by
strangling them with a handkerchief. <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali could
only remember the dead body of his mother and he fell <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>over<i> </i></span>it weeping. At that stage one of the Thugs put his
handkerchief round the neck of <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali with the
intention of killing him, but the stranger who had probably taken a genuine
liking for him saved him and took him to his house and adopted him as his son
as he had no children of his own. The name of this stranger was <span
class=SpellE>Ishmail</span> and he was the leader of a band of Thugs. He
however took <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali and put him in the village with
his wife who looked after him affectionately and brought him up. His education
also was not neglected, the village <span class=SpellE>Maulvi</span> took him
in hand and taught him his letters and how to read the Koran. After attaining
manhood <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali was then faced with the task of
choosing his career. The old teacher advised him to become a <span
class=SpellE>Moolla</span>. At this stage of his narration the Thug repents for
not having taken the advice of his teacher, then he takes comfort in the fact
that life is dominated by the decrees of fate and since it was fated that he
should become a Thug he could not decide as to which course <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to<i> </i></span>follow in life. Unable to
take a decision on his own he approached his foster-father <span class=SpellE>Ishmail</span>
one night after he had returned from one of his expeditions and asked him for
guidance. <span class=SpellE>Ishmail</span> naturally spoke in very glorious
terms about his own profession and he also tried to explain the philosophical
significance behind the organization of Thugs, and how the belief in the ‘Divine
authority’ unites even people from different religions, the Moslem and the
Hindu, to live as brothers. This account given by his foster-father so
impressed <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali that he had no difficulty in
making up his mind to enter the organisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
take the life of a living creature whether human or beast takes a great deal of
determination and courage, The hesitation has to be overcome but once that is
done the individual becomes something like an addict, much like a beast, a
man-eater for instance; that once having killed becomes a habitual killer. This
is more or less the psychology behind the inhuman attitude of the Thugs. A few
days later <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali had the opportunity of killing a
tiger and for the first time he had a feeling of elation in taking the life of
a living creature. So on <span class=SpellE>Dasara</span> Day <span
class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali was initiated into the profession, and a pickaxe
was given into his hands as the symbol of his profession. He was then again
reminded about the divine nature of his profession and how destruction is a
part of life which is essential and how Thugs have been given the power to
destroy by Kali herself. As a sign of his having joined the fraternity “<span
class=SpellE>goor</span>” or “brown sugar” was distributed all round and he too
was made to eat some. After the ceremony he had an occasion to see the Thugs at
work. An old man and his handsome young son were strangled and <span
class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali was overcome with pity and sorrow for the death of
the fine, handsome boy. One of the members of the gang justifies this killing
by telling <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali the long story of injustice and cruelty
that the old man had inflicted on him and had made him more or less an outcaste
in society until he joined the organisation. Thus the killing of the old man
and his son was motivated by a sense of revenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
that incident <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali had the opportunity to kill
his first victim and thereafter it became very easy for him to plan and execute
the murders and in course of time he became an adept. All the descriptions are
very gruesome and horror-inspiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
some years, due to various accidents and other happen­ings, the band was
considerably diminished and <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali was find­ing it
difficult to continue his work, so he and a few others joined the <span
class=SpellE>Pindaris</span>, a group of robbers led <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>by<i> </i></span>a man called <span class=SpellE>Chettoo</span>. Though
they managed to get a good deal of money and plunder it did not have the
excitement of <span class=SpellE>Thuggee</span>. Besides, they could never get
on with a gang that did not have the unity that the Thugs had. Finally they
gave the <span class=SpellE>Pindaris</span> the slip and stole what they could
from them and got away. For sometime <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali and his
father lived with the vast wealth, they had accumulated, but the restless
spirit prompted him to start again on his exploits. This time he reached a village
which seemed very familiar and he met a young couple going to another town. The
wife was extra­ordinarily beautiful and bore a striking resemblance to him. She
had round her neck an old coin on a thread which was supposed to have been
given to her by a brother lost in childhood when her parents had been killed by
Thugs. <span class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali always had a fascination for charms
and amulets and he decided to murder this couple just for the sake of that old
coin. He posed as a friend and travelled with them and after reaching the
outskirts of the village he killed them. He got the chain from the neck of the
girl and while doing so he looked at her face and was impressed by her
extraordinary beauty. It is this face that haunted him throughout his <span
class=GramE>life,</span> for it was later on that he came to know from an old
member of his gang that this was his own sister and that the so-called charm
was the very coin that he himself had given her as a child. There was the rule
among Thugs that women should not be strangled. This was the second woman that <span
class=SpellE>Amir</span> Ali had killed. It appeared as if the curse of <span
class=SpellE>Bhavani</span> had fallen on him, for this time when he returned
home, the Rajah of his village arrested him and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>his<i> </i></span>father. His father was tortured and put to death and
he was branded and set free. His possessions were all seized and his wife
coming to know that he was a Thug died of grief. His only child, a daughter,
was taken care of by the <span class=SpellE>Moollah</span> of his village.
However before being arrested again he managed to get money and secretly gave
it to the <span class=SpellE>Moollah</span> for bringing up his child. The rest
of his life he spent in prison. The last task he did was to act as an informer
and be instrumental in the arrest of an old Thug who had been responsible for
the murder of his mother and father and who had deliberately kept the truth
from him and had not prevented him from killing his own sister. This last act
of revenge over, the Thug was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in
captivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
book is a mine of information about many surprising and unfamiliar customs.
There is a complicated hierarchy in the organisation of Thugs, the principal
person being of course the leader. There are people who are allotted particular
jobs–the grave-diggers, stranglers and the <span class=SpellE>organisers</span>.
On comparing the Thugs with similar secret organizations like the <span
class=SpellE>Pindaris</span> and the dacoits, the author comes to the <span
class=GramE>conclusion, that</span> the Thugs though detestable were a little
more humane than others as they saw to it that their victims never suffered for
more than a minute before death. Besides there were some strict rules and
regulations–women should not be molested; none should be tortured; and there
was a strong bond of fellowship that knit the gang together, whereas other
underground organizations did not have this code of <span class=SpellE>honour</span>.
This does not mean that Meadows Taylor had any admiration or praise for the
Thugs. On the other hand he had all contempt for them, and considered them to
be inhuman in their attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
style of Meadows Taylor is quite interesting. Being at the same time faintly
reminiscent of the 18th century picaresque novels it has also an individuality
of its own. He attempts as far as possible to incorporate Urdu and Hindi words
and idioms into his style in a very appropriate manner, so as to make his
narrative as realistic as possible. Again he draws the line of distinction
between the author and the <span class=SpellE>narratory</span> or the hero of
the novel. It is only the hero of the novel who utilizes so many vernacular
words. The author, when he speaks as himself, on the other hand, never
digresses from the language of the conventional Englishman. The difference
between the two speeches is very cleverly represented. One must not forget the
fact that Meadows Taylor was so familiar with the local dialects that it was
not at all difficult for him to transfer the tone, the rhythm and idiom of
vernacular speech to the style he had used. This makes his style very realistic
and effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is interesting how Meadows Taylor could just take the facts and figures about
the activities of Thugs and mould them into a novel. Generally such <span
class=GramE>type of picaresque novels are</span> very dull and monotonous; and
the nature of the topic is such that the events and incidents become very
stereotyped. Meadows Taylor has tried to overcome this defect as best as he
could; he has therefore introduced an element of suspense and mystery which is
clarified towards the end of the novel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>More
than a century after the <i>Confessions of a Thug, </i>John Masters used the
same topic as the theme of one of his novels­ – <i>The Deceivers. </i>This book
which was published in the year 1952 can be compared to the <i>Confessions. </i>The
novel starts with the marriage of William Savage to Mary Wilson, and their
journey to the <span class=SpellE>Mandya</span> District where Savage was the
Collector. The day after they reach their headquarters they come to know that a
young woman was going to be a Suttee. Her husband had been missing for sometime
and recently she had confirmed in her dreams that he was dead. Chandra <span
class=SpellE>Sen</span> was the <span class=SpellE>patel</span> of the village
and he was the one who gave them all the details of the missing man whose name
was <span class=SpellE>Gopal</span>. According to him there was a striking
resemblance between William Savage and <span class=SpellE>Gopal</span> except
of course the complexion. This fact makes William Savage think that the only
way of saving the woman was to impersonate <span class=SpellE>Gopal</span> and
appear before her and thus avert the Suttee. While on this mission of saving <span
class=SpellE>Gopal’s</span> wife, Savage meets a man who contrives to give him
a chance to see a gang of Thugs at work. This sets him off on the trail of
Thugs operating in that area. He naturally found it very convenient to keep his
disguise to facilitate his work as he would be readily accepted into the gang
as one of them. After great hazards and dangers he finally manages to unearth
the various gangs of Thugs and also proves that Chandra <span class=SpellE>Sen</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>patel</span>, is also one of them and thus brings them
to justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Meadows
Taylor had based his <i>Confessions of a Thug </i>on his own experiences and
had tried to give an artistic shape to every report that he had prepared about
the Thugs. There is therefore a good deal of <span class=SpellE>versimilitude</span>
in his account. Even his principal character is drawn from real life and is not
just imaginary. The author has himself explained that he has cleverly
manipulated fact and fiction to maintain and sustain the story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Though
the theme and subject are the same the very technique of John Master’s novel is
different. It is not written in the form of an account but as a narration in
the third person. Besides he makes his aim and purpose very clear in his post-script
to the novel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“My
purpose in this book as in <i>Night Runners of Bengal </i>was to recreate the
feel of a historical episode than write a minutely accurate report.”<sup>1</sup>
There is no doubt that he has taken all his material from General <span
class=SpellE>Sleeman’s</span> report and Meadows Taylor’s novel, but he has
given his story a different perspective altogether. Where Meadows Taylor has
made use of all the information he had collected about the Thugs, John Masters
makes use of only a few selected incidents and limited material. Meadows Taylor
makes the Thug his main character, and he tries to arrive at a psychological
explanation of the inhuman actions. Besides he tries to advance the theory that
evil is a sort of a power and once in the clutches of evil it forms a vicious
circle from which it is absolutely impossible to break away from. In every case
that he has studied in the <i>Confessions </i>Meadows Taylor makes it quite
clear that there is a history of frustration and a motive for revenge. He does
not defend the action of the Thugs, but he tries to <span class=SpellE>analyse</span>
the motive behind such inhuman <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
<i>The Deceivers, </i>John Masters also describes the practice and beliefs of
the Thugs, but his main idea, however, is to bring out the full implication of
the personal struggle of William Savage which is drawn on the lines of General <span
class=SpellE>Sleeman’s</span> report. It is however nowhere indicated that the
methods <span class=SpellE>Sleeman</span> used were the same that Masters has
described in his novel. There is no doubt that some of the incidents described
by John Masters are more or less reminiscent of General <span class=SpellE>Sleeman’s</span>
report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
in the Confessions the incidents were represented from the Thug’s point of
view, in <i>The Deceivers </i>as William Savage is the hero, the incidents are
narrated from his point of view. The story of <i>The Deceivers </i>is not the
adventures of the Thugs; but the story of William Savage, the activities of the
Thug is only an essential part of the plot of the story. The few incidents
about the Thugs which find their way into the novel are highly dramatized to
increase the interest of the story. It is also highly improbable that the hero
should have taken on the garb of a Thug and encountered various dangers, and
neglected his wife in order to bring to light the secret practices of the
Thugs. A certain amount of unusual and sensational events have been used by
John Masters to make the story gripping and interesting. Meadows Taylor’s novel
is written in the style of a picturesque novel. As the author makes no attempt
to dramatize any event there is a certain monotony and boredom in his book.
Further there is no progress so far as the main character is concerned. Nowhere
in the book does he attempt to show a self-realization or remorse in the
attitude of the character. The <i>Confessions </i>is just a narration of his
exploits and not a means to self-realization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Meadows
Taylor’s book gives one side of the picture, that is, the activities of the
Thugs; John Masters’ novel gives the other side–the struggle of the hero to
suppress the Thugs.</p>

class=GramE>Besides the very perspective is also different.</span> In the story
of the Thug, Meadows Taylor has very rightly taken the Eastern attitude–namely
the preponderance of fate in shaping events. Again and again through the
various incidents the author stresses upon the element of chance and fate.
There is no scope for the reference to a personal struggle or a personal
involvement as the principal character is helpless in the clutches of a divine
providence. This attitude may be a reflection of the author’s own belief in
destiny and fate which he has referred to in his other novels also. In <i>The
Deceivers </i>Master’s attitude in spite of the melodrama is entirely
different. It is more the personal involvement of William Savage rather than
the story of the Thugs.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Besides John
Masters was interested in tracing out the genealogy of the Savage family and
not the progress of the Thugs. He has there­fore conveniently and very aptly
too used the title “Deceivers” which in an ordinary sense may refer to the
Thugs themselves as a transliteration of the Indian word. There may however be
a greater involvement in the title “Deceivers” for it might also refer to
William Savage and other characters in the novel who in one sense or the other
are deceiving others and deceiving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=GramE>themselves</span>.
We are also very keenly aware of the “Whiteman’s burden” in this book, from the
way in which the author manipulates fact and fiction. In <i>The Deceivers </i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>J</span>ohn Masters can be commended for the
wonderful way in which he has taken the bare facts of a report and turned it
into an interesting story. Meadows Taylor can be praised for his truth to
details and his unusual interest in a gruesome organization, the activities of
which were in complete darkness. John Masters’ novel, however, has the makings
of a popular novel. He has gone out of his way to make the story interesting so
that he has had to use a good deal of highly unrealistic incidents. So far as
the story is concerned he has been able to maintain the suspense and the
interest, but he has failed to make the novel realistic. On the other hand
Meadows Taylor has made little or no effort to fit all his material into the
framework of a popular novel. Hence the work is tedious and at points very
stereotyped. We can only commend him for his patience in the collection of
facts and his <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> to gather them all into a
novel.</p>

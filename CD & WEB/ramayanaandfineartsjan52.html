Ramayana of Valmiki has exerted an all-pervasive and abiding influence on the
national life of Indians through the ages. Though literature and religion have
felt most the influence of the epic, yet its effect on fine arts in the country
has been no less significant. The available specimens of ancient and medieval
architecture, painting, numismatics and sculpture testify to the vitalising
influence of the first national epic of ancient India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
early architecture of India seems to bear the stamp of the marvellous
descriptions of cities and palaces in the Ramayana. Valmiki tells us in his
description of Lanka that surrounding the impregnable wall of the city is a
large moat (‘parikha’) adorned with lotuses (v. 2. 14),–a detail which is
faithfully portrayed in early representations of the moat at Sanchi and
elsewhere. Beyond the moat, we are further told, is the ‘prakara’ or
surrounding wall, completely covering the mansion of Ravana (v. 4. 25-6), This
description is corroborated by the high wall shown in early sculptures,
sometimes with a plain top line as at Amaravati. The ‘atta’, ‘prakara’ and
‘torana’ (v. 37.39) of the city of Lanka find an echo in the early sculptures
at Sanchi, Amaravati and elsewhere, and are described in the ‘Arthasastras of
Kautilya. The ‘toranas’ or gateways of Lanka, decorated with creeper patterns,
all of gold (v. 2.18), are imitated in a ‘torana’ from Amaravati showing this
creeper decoration, wherein leaves are shown as entwining the ‘stambhas’ or
jambs. Actual designs are observable in plenty on the jambs of the ‘toranas’ at
Sanchi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The early representation of Lakshmi bathed by
elephants, as seen in Bharhut, Bodhagaya, Amaravati, Udayagiri and other
places, are reminiscent of Valmiki’s description of the Pushpaka that Lakshmi
on lotus, with a lotus in hand and attended by elephants, was carved it (v.
7.14). On the ‘torana’ gateway of Sanchi, the goddess Lakshmi is very often
represented seated as well as standing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cave
No. 3 of Nasik represents, as supporting the structure, a whole row of goblin
figures which are described by Valmiki as supporting the Pushpaka and roaming
in the aerial regions (v. 8.7). The ‘ihamrigas’ (or quaint animals,
reproductions of variegated sculptural fancy) referred to by Valmiki as
decorating the pillars of the Pushpaka (v. 9.13) abound in early sculptures of
Bharhut, Sanchi, Bodhagaya, Mathura, Amaravati and a number of other places.
The figures of the gentler sex carved on the shaft of the pillar and pilaster,
as finely displayed at Bhuteshvara near Mathura, appear almost as if fashioned
to answer the description of Valmiki that ‘naripravekas’ or excellent female
figures adorned the Pushpaka (v. 7.7). Likewise his description of the Pushpaka
appearing to be borne as it were by excellent geese (v. 7.7), seems to be
adhered to in an early sculpture from Amaravati wherein, under the pillars and
pilasters, the plinth of the palace is decorated with a frieze of geese. Again
the presence of ‘vedika’ or rail near the ‘jalavatayana’ or perforated window,
which is another feature of early architecture as represented in the Kondane
cave, seems to have been hinted long before by Valmiki (v. 9.16). On the
strength of these evidences, we may justly assume that the architects of early
India undoubtedly drew inspiration from the architectural motifs supplied by
Valmiki in his epic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
India no survivals of Ramayana paintings of the ancient period have been left
for our edification, except the consummate manner in which Bhavabhuti
introduces them in his ‘Uttara-ramacharita’ to intensify the pathos of the
opening Act of his play. Yet specimens of paintings belonging to the medieval
period have been fortunately preserved in the different museums of India.
Indeed, if we could survey the whole development of Indian painting from
beginning to end, we should find the Ramayana (and the Mahabharata) afford its
most constantly repeated themes. The India Office possesses several pages of an
illustrated Ramayana of considerable interest.<sup>1</sup> Several scenes from
the Ramayana have been illustrated in the paintings of the Rajput school, whose
period may be taken from the beginning of the 13th century A. D. to the middle
of the 19th century A. D. The Jodhpur Museum preserves a collection of 91
paintings on the Ramayana drawn nearly a hundred years ago. Among the
collection of paintings by A. Cunningham,<sup>2</sup> plate LXI depicts the
composition of the Ramayana by Valmiki and its teaching to Kuasha and Lava.
Plate XXI illustrates the episode of the capture of Shuka and Sarana by
Vibbishana and the stern speech of Sri Ramachandra. Another spy episode–that of
Shardula and another Rakshasa–is represented on plate XXII. In both these
pictures, several of Valmiki’s descriptive passages are vividly realised. The
half picture reproduced on plate XXIII illustrates the temptation of Sita by
Ravana. Several pictures and drawings follow the course of the many battles of
the siege of Lanka. Plate XLII. B reproduces a picture from Kangra depicting a
forest scene, while plate LX depicts Lakshmana extracting a thorn from Rama’s
foot. A Jammu drawing of the 17th century depicts Hanuman with a tree in hand
fighting the Rakshasas of Lanka <sup>3</sup> while another painting from the
same locality belonging to 1640 A.D. depicts the siege of Lanka and is
preserved at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.<sup> 4</sup> An extremely familiar
subject met with in all localities is that of Rama and Sita enthroned, attended
by Lakshmana with a chowry in hand and by Hanuman who kneels at Rama’s feet. An
18th-19th century Jaipur work of this type is reproduced by H. B. Havell.<sup>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
considerable was the influence exerted by the Ramayana on the fine arts of
Greater India is proved by the copious evidence available from Kambhoja, the
neighbour of Champa. In the Musee Khmer at Phnom-Pen are preserved ten groups
of ancient paintings of episodes from the Kambhojan version of the Ramayana,
depicting such well-known episodes of the Balakanda as Janaka finding Sita,
Rama breaking the bow of Siva and his encounter with Parasurama on his way back
to Ayodhya after marriage. (See Nilakantha Sastri: <i>Ramayana in Greater
India, </i>Jor, Vol. 6, Pt. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is likely that some of the descriptions of the Ramayana may have been utilized
for representation on the face of coins. One of such descriptions is that where
the citizens of Ayodhya, on being apprised by Dasaratha of his intention to
anoint Rama as ‘Yuvaraja’, exclaim how great is their desire to see the noble
and mighty Rama going on the lofty state elephant with his head screened from
the sky by the umbrella held aloft (II. 2.22). The elephant-rider type of coin
of Kumaragupta I is a splendid example of this lovely theme of an<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>emperor riding the state elephant in all his glory with a
single parasol raised over his head. Plate XV, 16 of the catalogue of coins of
the Gupta dynasty (in the Catalogue of Indian Coins) is a gold coin of
Kumaragupta I of the 5th century A.D. Its obverse shows the king with sword in
the right hand, riding an elephant and advancing left, and behind the king is
seated an attendant holding an umbrella over him. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“In India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Rama
and Sita, Hanuman and Ravana, Vishnu and Garuda, Krishna and Radha, and the
Kauravas and the Pandavas are everywhere in sculptured stones about the temples
and on the carved wood-work of houses, on the graven brass and copper of
domestic utensils, or painted in fresco on walls, Rama like Vishnu dressed in
yellow, the colour of joy, Lakshmana in purple, Bharata in green and Satrughna
in red. The figures carved on the ivory combs used by the women and painted on
the back of their looking-glasses, or wrought in their jewellery and
bedcoverings and robes, are all illustrations of characters, scenes and
incidents from one or other of these heroic histories.” (George C. M. Birdwood:
<i>The Industrial Arts of India </i>Pt. I. p. 26).</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the extant Indian sculptures depicting scenes from the Ramayana, the most
considerable are those in the Dasavatara temple (Gupta) at Deogarh, Halebid
(Hoysala), and the Hazara Rama temple (Vijayanagara). Rakshasa faces are found
sculptured in the Durga temple, Aihole, and in cave III at Aurangabad.<sup> 6</sup>
The Bharhut sculptures (2nd century B.C.) contain a hermitage scene, supposed
by Cunningham to be the hermitage of Rishi Bharadvaja at Prayaga or of Atri at
Chitrakuta, showing Rama, Lakshmana and Sita standing before the sage.<sup> 7</sup>
A more elaborate and dramatic representation of Ramayana scenes in their
sequence is to be found in four parts of a story-telling panel in a sculpture
at Nagarjunakonda (2nd century A.D.)<sup> 8</sup> The stupendous shrine at
Paharpur (Bengal) belonging to the 8th century A.D. contains some panels which
can be recognised as having connection with several themes of the Ramayana that
have the most popular appeal to the ordinary men and women to this day. (R. C.

bas-reliefs representing scenes from the Ramayana are to be found on the walls
of the highest gallery in the tower of the Golden Horn at Cambodia, now known
as Ba Puon. Among the Rama reliefs may be mentioned the interview of Rama and
Lakshmana with Sugriva, the duel between Sugriva and Vali, the ten-headed
Ravana on a chariot drawn by lions facing Rama who is carried by Hanuman, the
ordeal of Sita, and Rama enthroned.<sup>9</sup> Again in the Angkor Vat
(originally perhaps a Vishnu temple) of Cambodia, there are reliefs
representing eleven episodes from the Ramayana, such as the death of the demon
Viradha, Rama pursuing Maricha, the death of the Rakshasa Kabandha, the
alliance of Rama with Sugriva, the duel between Sugriva and VaIi, Hanuman
finding Sita at Lanka, the Lanka battle-field etc., ending with the return of
Rama in the aerial chariot Pushpaka. The first six scenes are also to be found
in the Rama reliefs at Prambanan in Central Java, a temple of the 9th century
A.D. The Prambanan reliefs are decidedly superior in artistic merit, though
they do not follow Valmiki’s Ramayana closely.<sup> 10</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

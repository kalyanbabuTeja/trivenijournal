<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a saving that <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath</span> <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>
was a product of the permanent settlement. This is certainly not true in the
sense that had there been no permanent settlement there would have been no <span
class=SpellE>Tagore</span>. It only means that the stable social conditions
signified and supported by the settlement offered his genius a suitable base
for operation. The country had settled down after the tumult of the fall of the
<span class=SpellE>Mughal</span> rule. The last effort of pre-British <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to assert
its independence had collapsed with the suppression of the Indian Mutiny.
British rule had by virtue of administrative efficiency restored law and order
in the land and the people were disposed to accept it somewhat as a divine
dispensation. In <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> the permanent
settlement not only consolidated land relations but put community life on an
even keel. The feudal set-up of life which that settlement gave shape in accord
with the requirements of foreign imperialism, presupposes dependence of human
relations on a super power represented on one hand by the king, the feudal
landlord and on the other, by the Church. It also commits excesses by its power
and there are revolts against excesses. Apart from those however, it connotes a
placid life-stream best symbolized by the unending <span class=GramE>murmur</span>
of bamboo-groves in the villages. It is but natural that under such a setting
abiding values of life should come to the fore. In <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
at this period there was revolt against tyranny and exploitation by indigo-planters,
and literary expression of the revolt in <span class=SpellE>Deenabandbu</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mitra’s</span>. <i>Nil <span class=SpellE>Darpan</span> </i>translated
into English by the Rev. Long. There were also isolated revolts against British
power notably under the influence of the <span class=SpellE>Wahabi</span>
Rebellion, a religious crusade by Muslims. But all the while newly-found
contact with the West had had a cultural impact which attained the dimension of
a social and cultural renaissance. Henry Vivian <span class=SpellE>Derozio</span>,
a teacher at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hindu</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, was the young
poet and evangelist of the renaissance, and <span class=SpellE>Rammohan</span>
Roy was the harbinger of the social revolution that followed in its wake. Both
wrought convulsions within Hindu society which reacted and even made them
suffer but there was no turning back the process of modernization of social
life and thought. Stalwarts appeared in the process among others, <span
class=SpellE>Kesab</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Sen</span>
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>who
instilled the spirit of nationalism into the current of renaissance, and <span
class=SpellE>Iswar</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Vidyasagar</span>
who made the wind of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>humanism blow into the orthodox Hindu
society. <span class=SpellE>Vivekananda</span>, at this period, equated service
of God with service of man and his social philosophy had far-reaching social
and political results. Michael <span class=SpellE>Madhusudan</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dutt</span> had in the meantime recalled to popular understanding,
in inimitable blank verse, our national heritage as treasured in the epics, and
political self-perception found first literary expression in <span
class=SpellE>Bankim</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chatterjee</span> and Poet <span class=SpellE>Nabin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chandra</span> Sen. Public life then was externally stable yet not
static. It was involved in<i> </i>the dialectics of thought-currents and
cross-currents which found their voice in <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath</span>
<span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>. The god of life was his mentor, not
necessarily identifiable with God yet acceding to the increasing purpose of
life. Human loves and fears, joys and ordeals revolve on the background of the
cycle of seasons. All found in <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath</span> massive
expression, not even the subtlest mood or situation escaping divination and
resolution by him in poetry and song. Not, however, only the perpetual thrills
of life. Social situations were reflected in his novels and stories. Human and
national problems received treatment at once comprehensive and minute in his
essays and articles. His plays depicted intricate situations in society and
personal and collective lives of man. And he responded to the very first stirs
of national awakening by<i> </i>his writings and kept pace with the nation’s
march to freedom as long as he lived. His universal mind scented danger of
isolation from the West in the non-cooperation movement but did not fail to
assess the epic significance of Mahatma Gandhi’s emergence as the leader of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
millions. His fears were in due course belied. He maintained organic contact
with the national liberation movement and died six years before attainment of
independence. Shortly before his death he issued his political testament in a
famous essay: The Crisis of Civilization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Powerful
poets appeared in <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> in his wake: <span
class=SpellE>Mohitlal</span> <span class=SpellE>Majumdar</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Satyendranath</span> <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> among them,
but there were others too. <span class=SpellE>Satyendranath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dutt</span>, though junior to <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>,
died prematurely long before the Master who addressed a moving elegy to him.
They were also evangelists of patriotism. <span class=SpellE>Kazl</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nazrul</span> Islam, however, struck a path of his own. He was a
rebel poet compromising in his nationalism and not bound by non-violence in his
search for freedom. He was an amalgam of the many streams of Bengali thought
and culture and created a synthetic current of them all in endless poetry and
song. He was struck down by mental illness while barely forty, and still lives,
the great potentialities of his genius tragically unfulfilled. <span
class=SpellE>Jasimuddin</span> was another distinctive poet who introduced
village themes into Bengali poetry with appropriate idiom and diction, and was
widely appreciated. He is now in <st1:place w:st="on">Eastern Pakistan</st1:place>.
Two somewhat senior poets were late <span class=SpellE>Jatindranath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bagchi</span> who harked back to national history and later a <span
class=SpellE>Jatindranath</span> <span class=SpellE>Sen</span> Gupta who voiced
in his poetry the personal life-current involved in national life. About a
decade junior to <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>, <span class=SpellE>Saratchandra</span>
<span class=SpellE>Chatterjee</span> pioneered a batch of novelists and
story-writers <span class=GramE>who</span> probed the working of human emotions
in reaction to social stresses and tensions <span class=SpellE>Bibhuti</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bhushan</span> <span class=SpellE>Banerjee</span>, the far-famed
author of <span class=SpellE><i>Pather</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Panchali</span>
</i>(Ballad of the Road) and other scintillating novels, was an outstanding
member of this group. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first signs of departure from <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> were given, even
while he was still living, by a group of writers centering round a monthly
magazine called <span class=SpellE><i>Kallol</i></span><i>; Kali <span
class=SpellE>Kalam</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Pragati</i></span><i>, </i>the
latter published from Dacca, were ancillary to <span class=SpellE><i>Kallal</i></span><i>.
</i>This group of poets and story-writers pretended to ultra-modernity in its
attempt identification with the fallen and mean in society and disregard of
accepted norms of what should be shunned as obscene. In its youthful enthusiasm
it talked of steering clear and going beyond <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>.
There was a <span class=SpellE>furore</span> for the time being; <span
class=SpellE>Rabindranath</span> himself joined the controversy and almost
settled it by writing in modern style and setting a standard of decency. The
writers of this group have since mellowed <span class=GramE>down,</span> some
of them have achieved renown and received the <span class=SpellE>Sahitya</span>
<span class=SpellE>Akademi</span> prize for literature. A recipient of many
awards is the comparatively older but still vigorous <span class=SpellE>Tarasankar</span>
<span class=SpellE>Banerjee</span> who has, in a large number of novels and
stories, depicted the transition of his people from declining feudalism to
advent of democracy and industrialization. His personal identification with the
freedom movement and deep insight into the joys, stresses and tensions
generated by social forces released by national liberation, have placed him in
the pinnacle of ability to portray his age for the benefit of the ages. <span
class=SpellE>Manik</span> <span class=SpellE>Bandopadhyay</span> has died early
but has left brilliant portrayals of the common man’s life. Other contemporary
writers have concerned themselves with the stresses and tensions of middle
class life but some of them ventured into the alleys of lives of the
mine-workers and even reached unto creatures that once were men. <span
class=SpellE>Charuchandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Chakravarti</span> who
writes under the pen-name “<span class=SpellE>Jarasandha</span>” has made a
special mark by translating his experiences as a jail official into a number of
vivacious novels and stories depicting the impact of society on lives </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
individuals. In poetry <span class=SpellE>Sudhindranath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dutt</span> and <span class=SpellE>Jibanananda</span> Das are the
most prominent of the period closely following <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>.
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Both are history-conscious but while Das projects himself as
the eternal pilgrim of history, <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> is tormented by
the agonies of his age. The personal quest of both is oriented unto love and
nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was, roughly speaking, the position at which Bengali literature rested at the
time of winning of national independence. Trends since then have varied from
the political to the anti-political–from efforts at what is called proletarian
literature to literature mirroring the vacuum created by the end of the
idealism which </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>accompanied the freedom movement. These two
trends have little in common and their votaries are at loggerheads with each
other. The so-called proletarian writers are sprung from the middle class and
their <span class=SpellE>proletarianism</span> is very rarely first-hand. Yet they
swear and by political struggle and call the uncom</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mitted
writers escapist and their literature a literature of decadence. The latter
write mainly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of frustration in society and in the individual.
Their novels and short stories paint stresses and tensions of society and the
impact </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of such stresses and tensions on individual
lives often causes entanglements of love and sex, renewing the old problem of
obscenity </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and literature. Abstract poetry and painting <span
class=GramE>are</span> an offshoot of this situation. Proletarian poetry is
political and struggle-oriented. These varieties of modern literature have,
however, rarely fulfilled the supreme criterion by which they could be
recognized as art. \<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the classical form is not obsolete yet. <span class=SpellE>Kalipada</span>
Bhattacharya has ventured to write the stories of Gandhi’s life. <span
class=SpellE>Azad</span> Hind <span class=SpellE>Fouz</span>, the <span
class=SpellE>Chittagong</span> <span class=SpellE>Armoury</span> Raid and
allied subjects in the form of epics much in the style of Ramayana and <span
class=SpellE>Mahabharata</span>. Epics have a way of taking liberties with
rhyme and <span class=SpellE>metre</span>; and Bhattacharya’s are no exception.
But dimensions are massive, <span class=SpellE>treatlment</span> of subjects
exhaustive, and the effort as a whole is prodigious, <span class=GramE>Though</span>,
necessarily, modernists would not look at them, discerning critics have
accepted these epics as a faithful record of soul-stirring events of one of the
most significant periods of history and well calculated to stand the test of
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

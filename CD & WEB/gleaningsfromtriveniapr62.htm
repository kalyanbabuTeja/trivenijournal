<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>By C. JINARAJADASA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>There is a
widespread idea, especially in the West, that India is a very old land with a
culture which has already seen its highest expression. This judgment is partly
true, because India is a very old land and, to a superficial observer, Indian
culture seems hard and unyielding. Yet, as a matter of truth, very great
changes are taking place just now, in spite of the fact that, to the
superficial observer, everything is the same. Only the other day, an Australian
friend of mine expressed with a sense of depression, ‘I was in India twenty
years ago, and everything seems exactly the same now!’ He noted only the signs
of poverty, and the general untidiness and lack of organisation. He, of course,
could not know the changes which have already begun to be effective in the
Indian mind during the last fifteen years. India does seem as if she were
‘played out,’ if we note only the conservatism in customs and manners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>On the other hand,
one of the most interesting things in India is that, though she is old, she is
really at the beginning of a great career. There is it great parallel between
India to-day and the beginnings of Greek culture. There is this difference,
however, that Greece began for the first time; whereas India, which has already
a great culture in the past, is beginning once again. This is a thesis hard to
prove, and yet, I will do what little I can to justify my belief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Let me first
take Indian drama. As one sees Indian plays, there is a great rigidity of form,
and a very slavish subservience to an old and effete tradition regarding
scenery and presentation. In the old days, the Indian drama was not intended to
be realistic, but symbolic. Therefore, exactness of costume and scenery was no
part of the dramatist’s equipment, for the audience co-operated with him in
imagining the atmosphere, which normally is created in the best equipped
theatres by intense truth to scenery and to period of action, etc. Indian
plays, as one sees them to-day, are intensely distasteful, because of their
artificiality and lack of actuality. Yet, on the other hand, the appeal they
make, not so much to the outer senses as to the mind, is many steps in advance
of what is known in the West, except in a few of the greatest dramatists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>That it is
possible to retain the Indian spiritual and subjective quality in drama, and
yet be perfectly true to nature, is evidenced by the work of Tagore and
Chattopadhyaya. One of my most vivid memories is Tagore’s <i>Post Office, </i>performed
in his own house during the Congress of ten years ago, when Tagore himself took
one of the parts. Everything was true to life in scenery and costume, and yet,
the play retained its own subtle quality. Those of us who have seen the work of
Harindranath Chattopadhyaya know how, without in the least ceasing to be
Indian, he is at the same time true to nature in his staging and action. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>All these
characteristics of the new age can be applied to develop Indian drama, without
in the least taking any- thing away from its own striking characteristics. I do
not think there will ever be any need to imitate the West in this matter
blindly. But, on the other hand, Indian drama can be more accurate in
presentation. When it does so develop, I see before it a very great era. As the
Greek drama grew out of the simple songs and dances of the religious
festivals,–the word ‘tragedy’ means the ‘songs at the goat festivals’–when the
dancers sang and danced in honour of Pan, so I foresee a bright future for the
Indian drama out of the present stratified ideas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Similarly too
with Indian music. All European musicians know at once the remarkable subtle
quality in Indian melody, and the rhythm in the Indian drummer always amazes
them with its complexity. But, on the other hand, Indian music has no sense of
harmony, and there is, therefore, a sense of monotony. A great Indian musician
has told me that he does not foresee that India will ever in her singing
develop on the lines of the West with ‘four part’ singing. This may well be.
Yet, on the other hand, I do feel that Indian music, though old, is just at the
beginning of a great expansion. I am fairly conversant with a good deal of
Western orchestral music, and I do not think that India will ever achieve the
great range of spiritual ideas revealed in music by composers like Beethoven,
Mozart, Schubert, and others. When one listens, for instance, to the best <i>vina</i>
play, one feels that in that pure music, there is something like the effect of
a Western orchestra, but in miniature. Just as when we look through the wrong
end of an opera glass, the scenery, though clear, is tiny, similarly the
delicate tones produced by the <i>vina</i> have a symphonic quality.<b> </b>I
see no reason why Indian musicians, if they will study Western music, may not
apply its philosophy of music to develop Indian music along her own lines, but
into a new field. A great deal can be done in India with Community Singing,
because song is very near to the Indian temperament. Every Friday evening at
the Headquarters of the Theosophical Society, there is Community Singing, where
the residents sing together Eastern and Western music. If Community Singing
could be developed at public meetings, Indian composers would quickly see new
possibilities in song. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Taking the field
of painting, one of the most amazing things is to note how the Bengal School of
painting has such great similarities with the earliest Italian School. Both
schools are ‘primitive,’ that is to say, are bent more on the feeling side of
life than its actual photographic representation to the mind. In Italy,
the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘primitive’ school went its way
developing stage by stage, till it reached a climax in such an artist as
Bottcelli, in whose best work, life and form are balanced, and exquisiteness of
painting is inseparable from great feeling and idea. Similarly, I see for
Indian painting a development in the course of a few generations, which will
make painting something closely woven with the highest cultural life of the
people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In similar ways,
department after department of Indian culture is feeling a new birth. It is by
comparing what the West has already achieved, that one sees clearly the signs
of this new birth. In India, in all the arts and crafts, there is a great sense
of beauty, but it is now traditional, that is to say, the craftsman works by
rote, and does not feel sufficiently a true creative urge. But since life is
all the time creative, this urge is in the very texture of our being. If only
we understand the principles of creation, that is to say, the principles of
art,–<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘art’ means only ‘doing’–we shall
feel how our future life as an Indian civilisation is inseparable from artistic
expression. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>If only our
artists will look with the eyes of the West on Indian scenes and on Indian men
and women, they will find plenty to inspire them. Almost every day, as the
fishermen pass on Adyar river in their catamarans, I can see many a Greek
statue. Even when I look at one of the most pitiful sights in Madras, that is,
coolies pushing loads in George Town, I feel a thrill of delight at the
perfection of their muscles, and note what perfect models they are for
sculpture. There is nothing so lovely as an Indian road, with its colour; a
coaly woman sometimes can become the subject of a great poem, so graceful she
is. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The rebirth of
Indian culture is wonderfully assisted by the fact that there is behind India a
great storehouse of spiritual energy waiting to be released. When, with her
patriots and her religious leaders, Indian artists come to do their part in the
Great Plan for India, once again there will be such a flowering of Indian
ideals and achievement, as has never been in the past. Wonderfully great as
Indian achievements have been in the long past, I believe that greater
achievements still are in store for her in the future, not only in the domain
of religion and international achievement, but also in the domain of art. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Shelley
considered the distinction between poetry and prose to be a vulgar error. If
that observation were true, the distinction between poetry and drama should
also be considered to be non-philosophical. In all primitive literature, where
the sense of form has not yet dominated the minds of men, the various literary
forms tend to flow together. We see such a merging of literary forms in the
story of Nachiketas as given to us in the <i>Kathopanishad</i>. Here the epic
and the dramatic elements so blend together that we are compelled to re-examine
the fundamental principles of literary criticism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The first act of
every drama is narrative in spirit though it is dramatic in form. It tells us
all that has happened before the drama begins, introduces us to the persons,
tells us in what relation they stand to each other, and helps us to become
interested participants in that interplay of character upon situation which is
the essence of a drama. In the <i>Kathopanishad </i>this non-dramatic part of
the story is given to us in narrative form. The form in which we have it, is
therefore more in keeping with the spirit of literature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>A sacrifice
forms the background of the story and knits together the two principal human
characters in the story, Vajasravas the man in quest of a soul and Nachiketas,
his son, who represents the soul in quest of God. A third character, Death,
which is a super-human being completes the group. The term sacrifice implies
giving up what we love. It is not associated with getting rid of what we do not
want. It is this law of life which is broken by Vajasravas. The world is too
much with him. In this respect he represents average humanity which substitutes
the form for the spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>It is against
this narrative background of the story that the dramatic element emerges. Every
drama implies a conflict. What is of interest to us is not the external
conflict between Vajasravas and Nachiketas, but the conflict within the mind of
Nachiketas himself. This latter conflict is between the sense of reverence
which he owes to the parent, and the sense of reverence which he owes to the
ideal to which the parent himself offers such formal homage. There is always
some disparity between theory and practice, between the ideal and the actual.
This is due to the limitation of instruments through whom the ideal is expressed.
Such limitations are found in every society and in every individual. The
satirist sits on the brink of this gap between theory and practice and laughs
at it. The idealist tries to bridge the gulf. It is because Nachiketas is the
child of light that he feels keenly this tragic burden of life. But he is saved
from becoming a moral prig by his sense of reverence for the parent. His
protest takes the form of self-surrender to death, the hound of heaven. While
the earth-bound parent seeks death in life, the pilgrim soul of the young
idealist seeks life in death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>It is at this
stage that the dramatic element in the story emerges. It is the conversation
between Nachiketas and Death. Death is the ideal spectator of the drama of
life. Death sees life entire. He is therefore the conscience and the articulate
voice of the Cosmos. The drama of Nachiketas thus becomes the drama of humanity
itself. Every civilisation has its book of the dead, The ancient Egyptians
believed that Anubis would weigh the soul of man against a feather, and if it
were pure and light as a feather, it would go to heaven. Plato in his <i>Phaedo
</i>tried to dispel the doubts of the shadow gazers. The <i>Kathopanishad </i>similarly
turns the light of the spirit upon the darkness of the flesh. But it does not
give to us a ready-made formula. It puts within reach of the adventurous spirit
the means of becoming the discoverer of the Self. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The dialogue
between Nachiketas and Death, between the soul and the knower of the Self, is
the drama of every man, with Time as the stage and the stars as the spectators.
Though Nachiketas may appear to be wiser than Vajasravas, he is yet in the
penumbra of the spirit. His divine discontent is a proof of his being awake in
the spirit, and his voluntary renunciation is a sign of his fitness to be
initiated into cosmic wisdom. Realising as he does that death is only the death
of the non-atman, he asks Death to enlighten him on the nature of the residuary
nature of the Self. He asks Death, “That which thou beholdest as different from
Dharma and Adharma, as different from cause and effect, as different from what
has been and what shall be, please tell me that.” (II, 14). He desires to know
the nature of pure consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The dialogue
between Death and Nachiketas is a progressive lifting of the veil. The man who
has liberated himself from the trammels of the flesh discovers the soul. The
soul which has liberated itself from the senses, in and through which it
functions, discovers the Self. In either case the higher values are discovered
by a voluntary surrender to it. <i>Sah nau bhunaktu </i>“May it devour us.”
Death, similarly, when approached from its brighter side is the illuminator.
From the darker side it is the devourer, the compulsory separator of man from
the good things of life. It is because Nachiketas approaches Death as the
illuminator of life that Death answers him and says: “He, the eternal among
non-eternals, the intelligence in the intelligent, who though one, fills the
desires of many–those wise men who perceive Him as existing within their own
self, to them belongs eternal peace and to none else.” (V, 13). Death enforces
this point of view not by logic, but by drawing upon experience which is the
poetry of life. The unity of the Self is brought out by the simile of the one
sun that illumines the world, the one air that sustains all life, and the one
fire that takes many shapes according to the form of the substance which
sustains it. It is also enforced by the simile of the many rivers merging in
the one ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Truth, like
sunlight, has a universal democracy. The way to seek life, said Shelley, is to
go to Death as a pupil. He said in his <i>Adonais</i>:</p>

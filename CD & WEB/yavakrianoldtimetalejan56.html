<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were good friends, the scholar, Raibhya and the ascetic, Bharadwaja. The
scholar was far famed for his mastery over Veda and ritual and men whispered in
awe that he could raise and subdue even malevolent spirits, being an adept in
that black Atharva Veda; and people were really afraid of him, for he was
rather furious when roused and difficult to deal with. The ascetic was a very
humble man and very lovable, minding nothing but his austerities; he loved all
mankind in his own humble way and none else with more admiration than this
terrible Raibhya.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

each had sons. Raibhya had two, Arvavasu and Paravasu, a</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nd
had the satisfaction of even his own fame for scholarship being eclipsed by
that of his sons. Consequently not a few were the invitations to that family to
attend and officiate at Yagnyas of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rich people; even
Maharajahs were among their clientele; and so they were rolling in wealth and
were first among the honoured in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the land. Not so was
the other family of Bharadwaja; he had an only son; Yavakri was his name. He
was just like his father, humble and very very rigorous in his ascetic ways. He
too loved all people. He had only one fault. He was sometimes rash and then he
could be very self-willed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
they grew, and growing years brought out the contrast between the two families
too prominently for Yavakri’s liking. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>None would invite him
or honour him and none would give him money, and quite properly, for, of what use
was he to them? He was just a Brahmin in name, with no knowledge of the Vedas. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
used to call him, in derision, a ‘Brahma Bandhu’ i.e., one whose sole title for
recognition was that he was related to Brahmins, himself being an ignoramus.
The pain of it therefore sank deeply into his heart and he began to muse. He
had been so intently doing Tapas and pouring out himself in adoration to the
gods, and if the gods could not give him knowledge of Veda </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>straightway,
without the arduous course of discipleship at the feet of a Guru, what good was
his Tapas and what its efficacy? He </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would perform his
Tapas with more rigorous austerities and compel the gods to give him
scholarship and then he would be as good as Raibhya and his sons. So resolved
Yavakri, and who could say that his aim was not laudable! Knowledge of Veda was
knowledge of God and a life after the Divine was worth all the three worlds.
But, there was a fly in this ointment. Yavakri’s effort was born in envy and
his Tapas was for power and not for wisdom. It was for wealth and fame. The
wise Bharadwaja saw the seed whence this resolve of Yavakri sprouted. He was a
man of peace and wisdom and he tried to dissuade his son. Why should his son
entertain feelings of rivalry with the family of his dear friend and what good
could come out of this endeavour? Who had heard of any becoming learned in the
Veda without going the hard course with a Guru? As we said Yavakri was a
self-willed lad and his father could not dissuade him. We may take it that the
story of Yavakri’s venture reached the ears of Raibhya and his sons, and very
likely raised little but half-concealed smiles on their faces; and report would
have certainly taken the information back to Yavakri that his rivals only
smiled with derision at his great resolve and it made him keener and all the
more eagerly bent on his effort to attain knowledge by Tapas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
began Yavakri’s great Tapas. Long and hot days in summer he would sit between
the five fires and continue his hard penance. In chilly blood-congealing blasts
of mid-winter he would be neck-deep in the river doing his Tapas. Neither rain
nor wind, nor the sun nor the storm could deter him from his purpose. The
shivering snowfall had no terrors for him. It was a terrible effort. In the
intensity of his effort Yavakri forgot everything else; and his one-pointed
meditation caused concern even to the king of the Devas. The great Indra had to
come down to the ascetic and he came, not to grant his dearest wish but to
dissuade him from his enterprise. Indra was the wise one and he asked: “Oh
Yavakri, what may be thy wish that thou art inflicting such torture on these
tender young limbs of yours?” Yavakri looked at the intruder before he replied
and recognised in him Indra; who does not know that this ruler of the
celestials would not stick at anything to thwart the penances of ascetics! He
had diverse weapons to achieve his purpose; and they included the Apsarasas,
those lovely damsels, to see whom meant, even for the most virtuous and
disciplined, to succumb to their charms and waste all the efficacy of
hard-earned Tapas. So he should also appear reasonable and not anger the lord,
who it was that should ultimately grant his greatest desire. Yavakri was, we
said, a generous heart also; he would ask the boon not only for himself but
also for all <i>dwijas</i>. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He said: “Oh Indra, I would that every one
of the twice-born should become immediately learned in all the Vedas without
having to undergo the rigors of discipleship <i>(gurukula-vasa)</i>. I would </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>obtain
from you this great boon so that I may be blessed by all the twice-born to be
born hereafter.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Lord of Heaven remonstrated: “Oh, you high-souled one, can there be any effort
more futile than this! It is an <i>impossible</i> you ask. The wise have said
that a man is to reap the reward of his own toil. When one labours for a
purpose the result will be wholesome and sweet to him. Otherwise the tinge of
the salt will be there, for the fruit is not really his own. The law of Karma
decrees that one shall enjoy the fruits, good or evil, of his own deeds and
there shall be no vicarious heaven or hell. The force of your Tapas will not
make the boon endure, even if I were to grant you the boon you ask for. So,
please desist.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Yavakri would not take a denial. He kept silent and continued his own
predestined way. Years passed and the glory of his Tapas began to worry the
dwellers of heaven. They asked their king to see that somehow Yavakri gave up
his obstinate Tapas. So the great God had to come down once more. Now he changed
his tactics. There was a particular spot in the river where the stream was easy
to ford and bathe, and where Yavakri used to have his prayers <i>(anushtana)</i>.
Indra assumed the disguise of an old man and began to pour into the stream
handfuls of sand without end. Soon the ascetic Yavakri made his appearance and
saw the withering old man at his never-ending task. A smile rose to his lips.
“You old one, what may your purpose be? You throw handfuls of sand so
unceasingly into the stream.” “Wise sir, You know streams of people cross over
at this spot to the other side of the river, and great indeed is their toil and
my heart has taken pity. I shall build a bridge of sand and then people can
easily walk over, and countless generations to come will bless the name of the
old one who toiled so hard for their comfort,” said the God in disguise.
Yavakri laughed outright. “Has any one heard of such a preposterous venture.
Why, the handful you throw in is being washed off the very minute you put it
in, don’t you see?” said he. The old one replied: “Sir, do not make fun of my
venture. Ages may pass but the effort of this old man shall bear fruit.” “You
are crazy, sir,” exclaimed the young one. “Oh! no, I have heard of one Yavakri,
who is said to be performing terrible austerities to make all the twice-born
learned in the Vedas without <i>gurukula-vasa</i>. If his effort should
succeed, why should not mine?” Yavakri fixed a steady gaze at the old one and
so great had been his Tapas that it revealed the Indra in the old man. “Oh,
Heavenly Lord, is it you? But, I say unto you, neither taunts nor laughter
shall move me from my resolve. There is some point in what you say, I admit.
You say that one may not reap what others sow. But I believe it was you that
gave Trisanku heaven, for the great Viswamitra would give his Tapas for it,”
said Yavakri. Indra replied, “Sir, but reflect, was the heaven lasting for
Trisanku? Do you not see him, head down and heels up, in the southern skies
even now? Therefore, young man, desist. But you shall have your reward; you
have indeed performed great and rigorous Tapas. You and your father shall be as
learned in the Vedas as Raibhya and his sons. “Nay;” he added “even more. And
that will be as per the law of seers, for they have said the father is the lord
of the son and shall enjoy what his son earns in this world and that. May your
father enjoy the fruits of your Karma.” With great reluctance, at last, Yavakri
had to consent. He ran to his father to break the news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the old man did not jump at the news. He was rather in a gloomy mood. “It
forebodes no good, my son,” he said, “this sudden learning. Your Tapas was
conceived in envy. The fruit will be of the same nature as the seed. Now you
will have pride, that you have caught up with Raibhya and his sons in learning.
You will like to prove it by parading it before all; and that is sure, to be a
sore point with them. And bad blood may arise thereby. They say pride goeth
before a fall. I do not like to have all the learning in the world in
preference to friendship with Raibhya. Mind, do not anger him; he is noted by
all as an angry man. Should he get angry with you, who will save you? People do
not like one who would push himself to the front, elbowing others out in the
process. The future alone will reveal whether this Indra’s gift is really for
your good.” Yavakri hastened to protest: “Why, father, Raibhya is as much to be
worshipped by me as you, being your close friend. Why on earth should I anger
him? And if he should get angry without cause; who can help it? The Veda which
we have obtained with so much effort will save us. But, father, why should you
expect adverse winds? Please do not be sad and damp my spirits.” And the father
was meekly acquiescent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yavakri
kept scrupulously the word he gave to his father. He would in no way come into
the picture where the Raibhya family was concerned. But he kept his word in
letter only and not in Spirit. Where others were concerned he was not the old
retiring Yavakri; he would show his new learning and bring down any one who
would dispute with him authority in Veda. There was much heart-burning
consequently in the neighbourhood. But none would convey to the meek father the
haughtiness of too son, lest they should give him pain. So the days went by and
Yavakri was acquiring fame and wealth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Priests who could officiate at such gatherings were everywhere in demand. The
demand also came from a neighbouring king for Raibhya. But he was getting old
and the least strain now might upset him. So he remained in the hermitage and
sent his two sons in his stead. All he could do was tending the household
Agnis, with all his heart, in the morning; and morning and evening he would
wander about in the forest to fetch firewood and the Kusa grass needed for his
worship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mind was not calm; he had no mate to give him company, which alone would have
given him the proper joy of the season. Old Bharadwaja would attend on the
sacred fires <i>(Agnis)</i>, and when he was away at the river, a hired blind
Sudra would watch the doors of the room where the Agnis were kept. Now, Yavakri
could hire the services of servants. He had therefore nothing to do in
particular So he used to wander all alone in the forest shadows morning and
evening, rapt in thought, very disturbing indeed to a youthful person in the
strength of natural urges. His father had evidently forgotten that his son had
come of that age when manhood required the companionship of woman. The old man
had lost his mate in life very early when Yavakri was a tiny child, and
thereafter, what with having to attend on the motherless babe and on the Agnis
and carrying on his several disciplines, he had no time for thoughts of woman.
But how could it be similar with the youth?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evening it was fairly dark when Yavakri went out. The slanting rays of the Sun
had cast on the sky the rich hues of evening clouds and a softness was
descending on the forest hermitage. The ascetics were having their dips in the
river before performing their ablutions. There was none in the cottages, either
in Yavakri’s area or in Raibhya’s. All was still.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on a sudden Yavakri saw the bewitching vision of a sweet damsel whose presence
evoked in him thoughts of lust. She was the wife of Paravasu, the younger son
of Raibhya, and was of Tare beauty. Singing to herself in her soft musical
voice, and in happy abandon in dress and deportment, in utter ignorance of the
presence of any prying soul, she cast an immediate spell on Yavakri. Loneliness
is dangerous to youth even in a forest hermitage. Yavakri had propitiated the
gods by the rigours of his austerities in solitude and acquired knowledge of
the Vedas, but he had not enjoyed the benefit of a disciplined life and
Brahmacharya in the household of a Guru. As he slowly approached her, his mien
and manner told her that something was amiss. She was not kept long in
suspense. Yavakri approached and, in humble tones of maddened love, told her of
his consuming passion and prayed for a few moments of bliss with her. She was
frightened and did not know what to do. She dared not refuse, for who had not
heard of Yavakri’s Tapas and a curse would certainly be her reward if she
refused him flatly. But if she erred with him, and this came to the knowledge
of o Raibhya, worse woe to her! Yet nature has a soft way of letting us slide
on the wrong path. She was young and her lord had long been away and it was the
maddening spring time, and who could deny the comeliness and youth of this
importunate. Her helplessness would be her defence, should she be found out,
and she would always be the unfortunate innocent woman wronged by the brute
strength of primal man. She yielded and in their loneliness was committed an
act of sin for which, in those days of unrelenting justice, the penalty was
only death. Satisfying the satan in himself and in her, Yavakri departed. Now
really a strange fear seized her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

little while thereafter and Raibhya stepped in. Instinctivel he felt something
had gone wrong. His daughter-in-law did not greet him at the doorstep as usual.
He found her in a corner, absorbed as it were in a dream. With a start, she
realised that he was before her, and down ran bitter tears from her eyes, the
weapon of women, stronger than Indra’s bolt. Raibhya was worried and it took
him sometime before he could sufficiently soothe her; then she told him what
had happened. How the hated Yavakri desired her, and how, afraid of his great
Tapas and possible curse, she had to reluctantly yield to his masculine
compulsion; it was all narrated amidst sobs of injured innocence, and great was
Raibhya’s anger. “Did the wretch dare so much? I shall teach him what it is to
molest women, and of Raibhya’s household at that,” he cried out in anger. He
might have used his occult sight to find out the truth, that all the guilt was
not Yavakri’s alone, but when anger surges in unchecked flow, insight and
wisdom have to hide away in the darker corners of the heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was now more terrible than the raging fire before him. He pulled away a bit of
his matted locks and put it in the fire, muttering uuknown terrible Mantras,
and there arose from the fire a lovely maiden, just of the features of his
daughter-in-law, only more lovely and more bewitching. The process was repeated
with different Mantras and a huge monster of terrible and menacing mien stood
before him. “What commands, my master,” roared the Rakshasa. “Go, both of you
and manage, between you, to rid the world of that accursed wretch, Yavakri,”
was the stern command.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

father had gone out to the river. It was noon. The Sun was scorching the wood
with his hot rays, and Yavakri in listlessness wandered away from his hermitage
into the woods to cool himself under the spreading shades of the towering
trees. There came to him the sound of a familiar and sweet voice, now sounding
even sweeter; was it not the silver tone of Raibhya’s daughter-in-law? How
lovely she looked, and what happiness she had showered on him! Yavakri hastened
in the direction of the voice and there stood she, more fascinating than ever,
and when she looked at him, enchanting love drew him to her bosom.” Yavakri
once had pierced through the guise of an Indra, but now guilt and doom hurried
him on and he ran to meet her, and into a bower they stepped. A few minutes
later Yavakri arose from. his short-lived heaven into the stern reality, and he

it was the work of the vengeful Raibhya.” Water, water, and where was it to be
had? He ran everywhere pursued by the monster. He ran to the lake. It was dry.
Suddenly, in despair, Yavakri remembered that in the fire-cottage of his
father, water would always be kept in pots for the needed purificatory rites.
So he ran there for very life but even there the fates stood against him. The
blind Sudra servant, who was the watch, mistook that somebody was intruding to
defile his master’s Agnis, and caught him in the grip of his long arms, and,
struggle as he would, Yavakri could not wrench himself off from that vice-like
grip, and terror suppressed any possible word of mouth. Before he could recover
his voice, thud, thud, thud, the sounds of heavy footfalls behind him, the
whirl and the swing of a trident, and the thing had pierced through the heart,
and out ran his blood in torrents and Yavakri was no more.</span><span

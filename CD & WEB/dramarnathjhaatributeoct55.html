<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
death at Patna on September 2, in his fifty-ninth year, of Dr. Amamath Jha is
an incalculable loss to Educational India and has come as a particular shock to
all those who have had the privilege of knowing him, for it means not merely
the disappearance of an outstanding personality, but verily the end of a
certain tradition–what may be called the ‘Jha Tradition’. Of ancient lineage
and lofty birth, Dr. Jha was the elder of the two distinguished sons of a great
father, the late Mahamahopadhyaya Sir Ganganath Jha, veteran educationist and
Vice Chancellor, and probably the greatest authority, in his days, on Sanskrit;
the younger being Mr. Adityanath Jha, who crowned a brilliant educational
career in the Allahabad University by topping the list of successful candidates
in the I. C. S. examination of 1934, and is now, at a comparatively early age,
the Chief Secretary to the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Government of Uttar Pradesh. Dr. Jha was
unquestionably a man of great intellectual attainments and extraordinary
versatility. A </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>profound scholar in Sanskrit, he was equally
learned in Persian, Urdu, Bengali, and Hindi. And, in English, which was his
chosen </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>field, he was reputed to be the ablest professor
in all India. Primarily a man of letters who began his career as a Reader in
English, he ultimately, by force of brain and character and a highly cultivated
mind, won a wide intellectual position in the whole of the North.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
ardent educationist that he was, Dr. Jha was a fervid champion of the teaching
profession, whose lot he always sought to improve and whose rights he never
failed to defend. He brought to the study of their problems a trained mind and
a profound vision. His counsel was of high value in the wide range of educational
and cultural problems which the transition in India has brought about. Despite
a somewhat forbidding manner and look, he loved his students well and was proud
of not a few of them (and he had good reason to be), for many of them are men
who achieved distinction later in life and are to be found today occupying
positions of high responsibility in the service of the country. He was justly
proud of the fact that the Allahabad </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>University, generally
contributed the largest number to the Civil Service, both at the Centre and in
the State. To every student of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>his who asked for it, when he went to
take leave of him after the Final examination, he used to give a testimonial
such as he deserved, which was sure to be his passport to a career, and he
needed no other. In his later years it used to be said that he was utilising
nearly all his salary in ‘scattering largesse’ to the needy and deserving
students of Allahabad University whose brightest product he himself was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
long the Head of the English Department of the (Allahabad) University to which
he was appointed when only thirty-two, he rose in the natural course to be the
Vice-Chancellor, almost succeeding his father, and later of the Banaras Hindu
University in succession to Dr. Radhakrishnan. But even when he was not the
Vice-Chancellor he was still a power in the former, for such was the personal
ascendancy which his personality, position and intellect obtained for him in
the University. His handling of problems was rivalled only by his handling of
men, and in both he was consummate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Jha’s official career, when late in life he accepted, reluctantly I should
think, the Chairmanship of the Public Service Commission, first of U. P. and
next of Bihar, added nothing to his fame, which endured to the end as that of
professor. In that sphere he was pre-eminent, and his lectures which thrilled,
countless batches of students of the Allahabad University and occasionally also
of Oxford University which he visited as exchange professor, are perhaps his
finest memorial, for he was a supreme example of the Indian’s mastery of the
graces, subtleties and nuances of the English language. Young men of the
present generation cannot easily realise the awe and fascination which he
inspired, or the weight attached to his lightest word. It was this fascination
that made him the object of a cult, an honour which none of his compeers in the
University or outside enjoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Jha’s special excellence lay in the field of speech, and he was perhaps never
more happy than when he was on his feet. He was a most accomplished speaker and
self-possessed debater, whom it was at all times a pleasure to hear. His
speeches were no polished orations (which, even in the case of some of our most
distinguished men, are often the result of prodigious labour and brain
torture), for he invariably spoke extempore, inspired by the occasion.
Electrifying as they were in their effect, they were, for sheer grace, vigour
and finish, seldom equalled and never surpassed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
debate he was formidable, and his mere presence on the scene seemed to
extinguish other people. He had a stature physical as well as intellectual,
which made even men of considerable stature look small. At the same time he
could be remarkably cool and composed. The most violent attack from the other
side he would brush aside in a sentence, generally of studious Courtesy, and
resume his theme, lending an air of intellectual distinction to his
performance. And what was really striking was the readiness, the keenness and
the felicity of his verbal wit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is difficult to do justice to the charm of Amarnath Jha’s conversation, never
lapsing into the commonplace and ever lively </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and brilliant,
enriched by anecdote and spiced with wit. To listen to him was to enjoy an
intellectual repast, and it was something always to be taken for granted that
where sat ‘A. J.’ there was the King of the Table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Endowed
with a fine and fastidious literary instinct which never failed him when he
took pen in hand, he was one of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>neatest and daintiest
of letter-writers–and he mostly wrote his letters in his own flawless hand.
Even his most casual letters were a delight, being matchless specimens of the
epistolary art, revealing the craftsman and cultivated man he was, while his
more elaborate ones could be described as patterns of prose, which were not
unoften distinguished by passages of rare beauty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jha was an insatiable reader with a passion for the splendours of literature</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rather
of many literatures, and his library containing a vast number of books was a little
Bodleian in itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Beneath
his somewhat rough exterior there glowed a heart full of warm human sympathies.
In spite of his many preoccupations, he moved much in the larger world and was
a familiar and prominent figure in social circles. A most welcome guest in many
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>a home, he was also a splendid host. With all this, there
was still in him an aspect of loneliness, perhaps also a vein of melancholy, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which
one could not fail to notice: early in his career he had been deprived of that
beneficent influence which is the peculiar gift of one’s partner in life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
unjustly, perhaps, is a feeling of disappointment entertained by many of Dr.
Jha’s admirers that he had not reached the heights which were expected of him.
The reason for this is to be found in the fact that he, an intellectual
aristocrat every inch, found it somewhat difficult to fall in line with the
democratic forces of the new order. But this does not in the least detract from
his celebrity, for he was <i>Amarnath Jha</i>–a fascinating, highly-gifted,
exceptional man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

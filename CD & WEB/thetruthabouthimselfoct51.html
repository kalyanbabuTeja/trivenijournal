mixed jaggery in the coffee. And later, when he had emptied the cup, she
bashfully announced, “This is the fourth month.” That was all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by the eldest boy Raghu, she retired into kitchen so that she might brood over
her husband’s startling remark about his being a ‘good man.’ A mother of three
children–all of them boys–Shanta never liked discussing intimacies in the
presence of the boys. In another month Raghu will be ten years old. And what is
‘goodness’ anyway? Feeding the wife and the children? Hard times are yet to
come. There is the schooling of the bard and, if the next baby is a girl, there
is the hunt for the son-in-law. It is not as though he had never tasted coffee
mixed with jaggery. Family life entails so many handicaps and difficulties.
During the last nearly seventeen years of their married life, they had
encountered several hardships, and they had smilingly faced them all. Never did
he show vexation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she crossed into the hall, Shanta caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror
which hung on the wall. Hers is not a dazzling beauty. She has comely features
and a quiet bearing which ripened into fulness with experience. Only those who
watched her closely would know how beautiful she could be when she smiled. Hers
is beauty which never draws attention to itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

smiled now–a slow, wistful smile that curved her lips, suggestive of a sense of
pathos, as though a thought which she dared not utter crossed her brain. Before
the smile faded, she approached her husband, and apropos of nothing, remarked:
“Maybe it is only the third month.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

felt a gurgle in his throat. He made a dash into the drawing-room, closed the
doors with a bang and attempted reading the newspaper. He wanted to say aloud,
once again, “How long should I remain a good man!” He put aside the clumsy
pages of the newspaper and looked into the mirror on the table. The wrinkles
beneath the eyes are deepening; the number of grey hairs is growing. Gone were
the days when he could put off<i> </i>shaving<i> </i>for another day. He
counted them. There were sixteen grey hairs in the beard. He counted them once
again. Only fifteen. Something touched his feet. It was the second boy Seta
playing<i> </i>on the floor with an emptied ink bottle. These ugly brats are
the cause of it all! Each child meant five more grey hairs. He pulled up the
boy, gave him a smack on the back and pushed him out of the room. He shot the
bolt and removed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

would never know that her husband had been wrestling during the last three or
four months with a vast mental upheaval. Barriers are erected between man and
man; that is not all. In each man’s mind there is a thin screen, held tightly
from falling by society. At some unguarded moment–maybe while soundly asleep on
a sultry summer night, or when the earth thrilled to the rainfall–for some
unknown reason, the screen sags and falls down, revealing the frightful
skeleton of the true self–the self which is smarting and chafing, banging and
biting. There was a fire in Ramamurti’s inner life–one of its sparks being the
morning’s vexation; the sea had heaved and the remark he made had been but the
foam on a wave; the earth had quaked somewhere and the smack he administered to
the boy had bee</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

is in his early forties, and the chain which bound him to the family had
snapped He now ceased to be a husband, a strand the social pattern and a mere
citizen discharging his duties. The eternal man burned in him leaving behind
the core of individuality which defied and transcended religion, custom, and
tradition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
his younger days, Ramamurti had nursed high-ideals. Contact with Western
thought and culture had rendered him sensitive to the shortcomings in his own
society and infused in him a zeal for reform and the spirit of revolt. About
love, marriage and children he had ideas which are considered progressive and modern.
And what had happened to those visions of the complete life, those dreams of
perfect bliss? Like most of his friends, he married young-a tame, loveless
marriage to a country girl. Had Shanta ever discussed love? Shanta ‘falling in
love’–the very notion is absurd. Like everybody else, he brought up a family,
never bothering about the growing population of the country! The passion for
art, the devotion to a cause, the worship of culture, and the grim
purposiveness that governed all–all these had died out. His life was devoid of
glory, beauty or freshness, or the joy of fulfilled ideals. An alien culture in
the native soil–that in a sense is the tragedy of Indian youth. All those who
failed to fulfill themselves have turned into truly tragic figures; they either
sank into oblivion or plunged into notoriety. Ramamurti had forsaken the path
of easy living and chosen to be a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

a month, Shanta had begun to find proofs of the change that had come over her
husband. That day Ramamurti was not at home; he was away on camp. The post
brought a cover addressed to her husband in Telugu. Shanta kept it on the
table. Sometime in the evening, Gopi the youngest boy had embarked on his usual
destructive campaign and few things escaped his survey. The cover fell into his
hands and Shanta retrieved it in time. It never occurred to her that she should
not read her husband’s letters. Her husband had even approved of the practice.
It was a luxury which betokened mutual trust. The letter was un-dated and
without address:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Murti–I make bold to write this. The knowledge that you have a wife and
children has till now checked my wish to write to you. Sooner or later we have
to cut the knot. To have been able to keep ourselves in check thus far, I
believe, is a sacrifice we made for the sake of society. I knew long back that
you were in love with me. I suppose you are not fully aware of my desire and of
my affections. A Hindu woman does not go a-hunting. Looking through the slit in
the door, she keeps waiting for all time. You knocked at the door and I had no
choice but to cross the threshold. I know that one day you would take me away

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Analysed, the modern man’s ideal of beauty would be
found to be composed of the features of the leading film actresses, of the
pictures illustrating the newspaper advertisements, and their mental make-up
very much like that of the heroines in the popular novels. A combination of the
various elements unfortunately does not yield the perfection of beauty. The
beauty of anything beautiful is its uniqueness. A thin oval face, fishlike eyes
with large lashes, a long high nose, and a mouth curled to be kissed, a blade
of grass come to life in the human form–Hope without hunger, Divinity without
torture,–the illimitable source of experience–that is Priya Bharati as imagined

Not too young by appearance, just about twenty or twenty two years old. He
walked along the street for four days, and all the time he saw she was there;
she looked at him; even stared at him. A broad, round face–he preferred an oval
face, but what could he do? –wide eyes, her complexion pure as the sky cleared
of clouds; in her hair, white, red and yellow flowers; clad in a green saree
elegantly folded–there was no doubt that this was she! The woman who stepped
out of his day-dream, waiting to melt into his night-dream. It was quite common
for respectable middle-aged men in western countries to run away with their
maids. That appeared crude to Murti. It was devoid of beauty, distinction or

“I am planning to write a novel and I wanted to study from real life the

would they believe him? He ignored and even chafed at the possibility that they
might give no credence to his story. If society thought the intentions of a
middle-aged, respectable citizen and a responsible husband were dishonourable,
then surely it showed how degraded our present-day society had become. Such a
society had no right, could never claim any right, to assess his conduct and

is not, a void would form in his life which nothing could fill, not even
thoughts of her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

packed a few things and started immediately to Shanta’s home. The train journey
put him in the frame of mind which vividly recalled past memories. The day
after marriage,–Shanta’s bashful smile slyly displayed behind the thin white
saree, the odd way in which she yawned–her limbs carelessly stretched and a
far-off, sleepy look in her quiet eyes–there was beauty in her very clumsiness
and oddness, charm in her very weakness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>R.
K. Narayan’s forte is genial ironic comedy. But in <i>The Guide </i>he seems to
have transcended its frontiers as his ironic vision grew into sympathetic affirmation.
The motif is recognizably autochthonous. It is a question of Indian culture,
and Hindu religious tradition. In it he explodes the myth of the popular <i>sadhu
</i>and castigates Hindu superstition in his own inimitable way. But towards
the end of the book he evinces a peculiar serious concern in Raju’s
transformation which is, however, not easily comprehensible or convincing. In
the later sections of the book Raju becomes sincere and the author serious.
From this we may infer that Narayan had more in mind than mere amusement when
he was writing the book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
this interpretation in our view we may trace Narayan’s mental maturation as a
novelist. In “Mr. Sampath” he sees the world as being controlled by blind and
unpredictable forces, a stage where forces and tragi-comedies are eternally
played, He says that, if one gets a comprehensive view of the good and the
evil, it will be better than presumptuous condemnation of whatever one thinks
evil. In <i>The Guide </i>he seems to have got a comprehensive view of human
activities, the comic and the tragic, the silly and the serious, the ridiculous
and the sublime. From<i> </i>detatched ironic observation of the absurdities in
certain human activities, he has grown to see with tolerance and sympathy that
even the absurdities of certain things in life have in them some germs of
beauty. It is an exhilarating vision of human activity to see that even a
wretched stupid, because he is human, is yet capable of sublime instincts and
gestures of self-sacrifice at certain critical moments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a probing into the psychology of the bogus <i>sadhu. </i>Kamala Markandaya’s
<i>He who Rides on a Tiger </i>also deals with the bogus <i>sadhu </i>theme.
But as Prof. Iyengar points out, in Kamala Markandaya’s <i>He who Rides on a
Tiger </i>we have only a scamp </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in the end but in <i>The Guide </i>we
have a ‘saint’. Now the crucial question is “Is Raju’s transformation real and
convincing?” One may argue in the following way. Raju is a stupid and a coward
too. The huge absurdity has become his life. The circumstances have become
tremendous and threatening. So he could not but accept his role. It is the
story of a reluctant saint. As for the logic it is perfect. But perfect logic
is cruel when it denies the human considerations of the situation. At any rate
we cannot deny Raju’s individuality as a human being as long as he is not
mentally imbecile. He can think still. And he begins to think of himself. And
that is the first step, of course, to think <i>dharma </i>in his private and
public life, to redeem himself. The external circumstances helped to awaken his
soul to the sincerity of his deeds. So now he can at least identify himself
with the public cause. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
whole thing is, of course, an ocean of colossal absurdity, stupidity, and
superstition. But something significant has been churned up. There has been
developing in the background the supreme idea of non-egoism and self-sacrifice.
The actual facts in the story are cunningly left to the magic wind. But one
fact is real, the idea of the change wrought in the hero, the realization of his
hypocrisy and consequently, in the last moment, giving himself up sincerely,
whatever may happen. It is a kind of sublimity in such a person–naive, simple,
and unsophisticated. The worldly facts are not so much important because even
if a miracle happens it will be an accident. But the fact of the man changed,
remains the significant miracle to us. It almost shows that ‘the ridiculous’
has also ‘the sublime’ in it as long as it is human. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
course, the co-existence of the ridiculous and the sublime in thought and
action verges on incongruity unless one should maintain a keen and delicate
balance. And it is the delicate balance between ridicule and reformation,
satire and ascertainment, facile optimism and “destructive cynicism,” that is
the supreme achievement of Narayan in <i>The Guide. </i>We can clearly see the
two existing side by side, especially, in the later part of the book. The tempo
is tremendously worked up. On one side there is the ridiculous overdoing, the
crowning absurdity of the bogus <i>sadhu, </i>the busy newspapers, the
functions, visiting fuss, gamblings, teashops; on the other side the
conflict-bound life of a realising man caught in the pangs of conscience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The last scene is the most important one. Raju is
sincere and the author serious, both for the first time perhaps. Raju thinks:
“If by avoiding food, I should help the trees bloom, and the grass grow, why
not do it thoroughly?” The author comments: ‘For the first time in his life he
was making an earnest effort, for the first time he was learning the thrill of
full application, outside money and love; for the first time he was doing a
thing in which he was not personally interested.” In the act of sacrifice Raju
sags down. The author seems to imply that he has become spiritually also a
guide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One<i>
</i>should admit that this phase is not so adequately artistically realised in
the book. But undoubtedly it hints at the vital idea. It is not impossible. It
provokes our imagination and, as with all works of art, suggests endlessly and
leaves it off... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
we can see that beneath an apparent nonchalance towards the deep, great things
of life there is a lofty equanimity in Narayan that is always true to Indian
culture and never sceptical of the great truths of life. In fact “The Guide”
can be studied as an affirmation of the invincible optimism and sublimity of
the Indian religion that recognizes the humanity of the most wretched person
and promises redemption if he thinks of <i>dharma</i> even for once and shows a
gesture of sacrifice at any time. Many stories from the Indian mythology and
traditional heritage testify to this </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
however, above all other interests, the perennial appeal of R. K. Narayan as a
novelist is due to his genius for humour, his inimitable gift, the reconciling,
unifying, balancing element. The sympathetic humour and broad humanity of R. K.
Narayan have no parallel in Indo-Anglian fiction. Mulk Raj Anand has power and
amplitude but Narayan has the gift of healthy, refreshing, Invigorating humour;
compassionate, sympathetic, even profound. It ranges from annihilating
sceptical satire and devastating irony to the most blissful revelations of the
sparks of sublimity hidden in every simple human being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

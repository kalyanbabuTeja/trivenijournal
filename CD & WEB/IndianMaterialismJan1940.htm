</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did not the Indian scholars take to the study of Indian materialism?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject of Indian Materialism has not attracted the attention of Indian scholars save one.<SUP>2</SUP> The few books that we have on this subject are due to European initiative. It was in the year 1828 that Wilson for the first time spoke of Indian materialists almost in a casual manner.<SUP>3</SUP> He calls Charvakas advocates of materialism or atheism. In the year 1837, Colebrook dealt with the subject of Hindu Materialism. On that occasion he wrote that, for want of an opportunity of consulting an original treatise on this branch of philosophy or any connected summary furnished even by an adversary of opinions professed by Lokayats, he was unable to give any sufficient account of their doctrines.<SUP>4</SUP> After this, ‘Sarvadarsana Samgraha,’ an opposition work of the 14th century A.D., was discovered.<SUP>5</SUP> This work gives an account of the Lokayata System<SUP>6</SUP> from the point of view of the writer, a Vedantist. Cowell translated somewhat roughly this work in the year 1862 and published it in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.<SUP>7</SUP> Since his writing,<SUP>8</SUP> Muir wrote an article on Hindu Materialists. He gave large extracts from a few later texts illustrating materialistic tenets.<SUP>9</SUP> In 1873 Cowell contributed an Appendix to the collected works of Colebrook.<SUP>10</SUP> He mostly emphasised there the theory of knowledge held by the Lokayats. We know of no other work since then till 1899. In that year Rhys Davids, the great Buddhist scholar, sketched the history of Lokayata with a different interpretation. He used this word "Lokayata" in the sense of "nature-lore," and supported this meaning by many extracts from Sanskrit and Pali sources.<SUP>11</SUP> This brought to light the question of Buddhist materialists.<SUP>12</SUP> This work has cleared the ground a good deal. In the same year 1899, Hillebrandt gave a short sketch of Hindu materialism. He cited Muir in his work.<SUP>13</SUP> He did not seem to be aware of the work of Rhys Davids. Max Mueller in the same year referred to the Lokayats.<SUP>14</SUP> In the year 1907 an Italian, Pizzagalli, published a work on this subject.<SUP>15</SUP> This is the first systematic work published In the form of a book. The previous writers showed the way in the form of articles. In 1908 a French scholar, Suali, wrote of materials for a history of materialism in India.<SUP>16</SUP> He confined himself to, and largely drew his material from, a later text of the sixth century A.D.<SUP>17</SUP> This article is valuable for the large extracts he made from the text.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not till 1916 do we again hear of any other writer on Hindu Materialis Garbe has given a brief sketch of Lokayata, not adding much to what was known already.<SUP>18</SUP> Poussin gave a sketch of Hindu Materialism in the same year. He confined himself largely to Ajita Kesa Kambalin. In support of his statement he has given valuable Buddhist sources.<SUP>19</SUP> Even at this stage, when the nationalist movement was at its zenith, we do not hear of any Hindu writer dealing with Materialism. Up to this time it must not be thought that there were no other European writers who referred to Materialism. There were many, <SUP>20</SUP> and they referred to Indian materialism in a small manner. The next important work was by an Italian scholar, Tucci, In 1923.<SUP>21</SUP> It is significant that some Italian scholars have taken to the study of Indian Materialism. Some others have taken the study of Culture and Political Science in ancient India.<SUP>22 </SUP>The next general work is that of Shastri. The date of publication is not known. He mentions Tucci. It must have been after 1923 and around 1928. He wrote an article in 1931 dealing with some aspects of materialism.<SUP>23</SUP> He is the only Hindu writer on this topic.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see that this important phase of Hindu thought has been only casually noticed by European enquirers.<SUP>24</SUP> I now understand that a work on ‘Indian Materialism’ in Russian has appeared in Moscow recently. At Sun Yat Sen University, Moscow, Thalheimer gave a lecture on ‘Indian Materialism’ in 1927. (A. Thalheimer: ‘Introduction to Dialectical Materialism,’ chapter on ‘Indian Materialism.’ pp. 102-115). The omission of treatment of this phase of thought by Hindu scholars is not accidental. Why? Were the social conditions and wants of the times favourable for such a treatment? <SUP>25</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time when Hindu culture was unknown to European scholars and to Europeans in general, when missionary vilification of India was great <SUP>26</SUP>, came the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784. Wilkins, Jones, and Colebrook inaugurated the new science of Sanskrit Philology. Till 1830 European scholars paid attention only to classical Sanskrit. Gradually the studies were extended to the Vedas, Upanishads and Buddhism. They came to know the oldest period of India last. The foundation of the Pali Text Society in 1881 gave a further impetus to the study of Buddhism. In 1883 and 1885, Weber made another branch of literature available, that of the Jains. By the end of the 19th century the progress of Indian studies reached its high mark.<SUP>27</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before the discovery of these literatures, the Indians were regarded as heathens. In the early stages research was solely confined to Philology. That the heathens produced a wonderful literature astonished the Europeans when their researches into Philology led them to study Sanskrit literature. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Philology led in turn to the development of researches in Archaeology, Epigraphy, Numismatics, Inscriptions, editions of original Texts, and so on. These in turn necessitated researches into Indian History in general. The second stage of Research in India is characterised by its emphasis on historical studies. Everything depended on the fixing of dates. Still, with a few exceptions, Indians have not yet taken to history-writing. The rise of Indian historians coincided with the rise and development of Indian Nationalism. R. C. Dutt is the father of Indian nationalist historians. At this stage European scholars themselves encouraged the Indians to take to the study of history.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The heathen stage corresponded to that when Philology did not yet dominate the field of Indian Research. When it did, it gradually led to the study of Indian history.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another stage in the social development of India made necessary a corresponding phase of research. For years the Indians were told that they knew very little of politics, that they had no text-books on politics, that their capacity for political thinking was little. This was a direct challenge to the Nationalists. The few historical and philological researches did not enable them to counteract these derogatory remarks. At this time the Nationalist movement in India broadened from land-owning professional classes to the rising trading-merchant, usurer-industrialist classes. The objective content of their demands equally widened. The need for political research was also felt. Coinciding with this, a text on political science was discovered in Southern India in 1906.<SUP>28</SUP> The growth of the Nationalist movement, and the discovery of this text, gave a powerful impetus to the development of Political Research.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, more Indians took to the study of Indian Political Science. Between the years 1914 and 1932, text after text on Political Science was published. Scores of works in the original have been edited on this subject. Many doctoral theses in European Universities were written on Indian Political Science. This research was a need for the Nationalist claims and it was helped by the previous philological and historical researches.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research in India had three romances. It showed all the enthusiasm and the defects of Romanticists. The early Sanskritists showed an enthusiasm for philological research, as the Factory Inspectors showed for the working class in the nineteenth-century England. The need was felt by one class, but their demands were voiced by another class. That was the historic mission of the early Sanskritists. The later Sanskritists were aided by a few Indian scholars and together inaugurated a new era in historical research. This was a stage of collaboration. The leadership was still in the hands of Europeans. The third stage is definitely characterised by Indian studies suited to the angle of<I> </I>political science. It must not be thought that research did not tackle other fields. Researches into Indian Medicine, Astronomy, Surgery, and other fields were the natural outcome of<I> </I>"political research." The honeymoon phase of<I> </I>these stages is now over. Today research in India is on a stock-taking level, comparison-verification level, reconstruction level.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then came another event. With the year 1880 may be dated the Indian Industrial Revolution. The processes at work may be dated as early as 1850. The development of<I> </I>plantation industries is the fore-runner of<I> </I>the Indian Industrial Revolution. The development of<I> </I>capitalism, of<I> </I>a colonial character, has begun. These changes wrought in social economy by this event–the shifting of<I> </I>the population, the growth of<I> </I>towns, the rise of<I> </I>the Proletariat, the proletarisation of<I> </I>the Peasantry–created changes in the existing needs and values.<SUP>29</SUP> Such needs grew to consciousness earlier among the rising middle class than among the proletariat or the peasantry. The organisation of this consciousness took several forms. In the political sphere, it took the form of Nationalism. In the industrial sphere, it took the form of<I> </I>Protectionism. In the social sphere, it took the form of Reform. The rising middle class felt the shackles of Brahminism as much as those of feudalism. Brahminism was a brake upon their free development in accordance with their new needs.<SUP>30</SUP> The result was a crop of reform movements all over the country. Herein lies the origin of these movements. These movements took the characteristics of the place where they originated. In Bengal, it led to the Brahmo Samaj; in the Punjab, it led to the Arya Samaj; in Bombay, it led to the Sarvajanika Sabha; in Madras, it led to Theosophy. In Bengal, the movement stood for Modernism; in Punjab, it stood for anti-Westernism in Bombay, it stood for Liberalism; in Madras, it stood for eclecticism. An analysis of these movements discloses the class and national characteristics of these movements. These movements felt the need for research as much as the general political movement. The illustrious leaders, like Ranade, Bhandarkar, Chintamani–ablest scholars of India–took to Social Research. At this stage, political research differentiated itself into other fields, particularly into social research. An enquiry into the Caste System, an enquiry into the child-marriage system–these are the topics of the social research school. But these social research scholars wore Whig pants on Indian shirts. They were more content to vegetate in reformism in negative denials rather than to display the "positive background of Indian Sociology."<SUP>31</SUP> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far we see that these scholars have not felt the need for a more positive interpretation of Indian culture. Research in India correctly reflected the needs of the class, the rising middle class–of which most of the researchers are composed, save the early Sanskritists who played the conscious part for the Indian middle class. Curiously at that time, the middle class was in its nascent stage.<SUP>32</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research in India has not reflected the needs of the Proletariat and the Peasantry. The Proletariat in India, in spite of the great social forces in its favour, lacks leadership, organisation, and political education. The subjective elements are weak. It has no tradition of "Emancipation groups." It has no working-class ideologies. It acquired its few "historic levels" of consciousness in its strike-struggles, in its struggles for an organisation, for its existence. The interests of the rising middle classes do not coincide, except at certain definite historical periods, with the interests of the Proletariat.<SUP>33</SUP> Naturally, the middle classes did not take to research which will aid and reflect the needs of the Proletariat. Nor is the Proletariat of village life, with no past experience of factory or mental discipline, with the inherited background of inertia of ages, with the stamp of Brahminism and illiteracy writ large on its brow, cowed by a jobber, <SUP>34</SUP> bullied by an employer, fleeced by a money-lender, squeezed by a priest, exploited by the government and its land-owning, professional, trading-merchant, usurer-industrialist class allies, the Indian proletariat is still weak. Its consciousness in also weak.<SUP>35</SUP> But Trade and Politics, Industry and Capital are drawing this class, which had remained sunk in apathetic indifference, into the whirl of history. With the present increase in consciousness, organisation and experience, is also seen the appearance of working class papers and magazines <SUP>36</SUP> and the need for its own research. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nor is the proletariat allowed to imbibe a ready-made ideology which suits their interests, which expresses their needs, which leads them to paths of revolutionary action. The government and its allies are in its way. Neither is the expression of their own experience of daily struggles with the ruling classes given a free scope. ‘A Communist Manifesto’ of 1848 is a taboo in India. A moderate strike leader is summarily executed for "high treason" and misdemeanour against His Majesty the King. A friend of the Soviet Union, whatever his class, is a sedition-monger. An organiser of the working class consciousness is given a prison in the Laccadive or Maldive islands. Or he is sent off the road to Mandalay.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research in India did not reflect the needs of the Peasantry. If Civilisation has made Peasantry its pack animal, in India the peasantry is created worse than a pack animal. In Taine’s words, the Indian peasant has been "the mule" of three autocracies–the Hindu, the Moslem, and the British. He is exploited in a four-fold direction, by the Government, by the land-owner, by the money-lender, and by the village priest.<SUP>37</SUP> Nowhere has Priestdom taken such strong roots as in rural India. The question of the emancipation of the Proletariat and the Peasantry in India is at bottom a question of the emancipation of the Indian society from Brahminism, Feudalism and Imperialism. Here too, the interests of the rising middle classes did not coincide with the interests of the agricultural proletariat.<SUP>38</SUP> But the phenomenal growth of the peasant movement during the last four years and the increase in their consciousness is reflected in the appearance of Kisan publications and the need for their own political researches.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increasing failure of the political demands of the rising middle classes, and their inability to gain further commercial successes,<SUP>39</SUP> hastens their movement towards socialism,<SUP>40 </SUP>towards recognition of the interests of the Proletariat and the Peasantry. The pressure from above is equally balanced by pressure from below. The momentum of this pressure towards socialism–towards the recognition of the interests of the Proletariat and Peasantry–is reflected, meagre as it is, in research as well.<SUP>41</SUP> This is the reason why we produced one book only on Indian Materialism.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now see why the question of the treatment of Indian materialism by the Indian writers is not accidental. A history of materialism in India is a history of Brahminism. It is also a history of the social conditions which gave birth to Brahminism, a history of the class domination of the Brahmin class. It is a history of oppression and general reaction all round. In short it is a history of the social question in India. Consequently no class but the Proletariat and the Peasantry or its idealogues could voice this need for research. The "political research school" did not understand that every political question is at bottom a social question. The "social research school" did not understand that every social question is at bottom a political question.<SUP>42</SUP> These two schools in twin avoided any treatment of "positive" materialist thought in India. The very researches into Artha Sastra (Hindu political science) reveal that Lokayata (Materialism) is a fore-runner of Artha Sastra.<SUP>43</SUP> Yet net<I> </I>a word has been said on Lokayata.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Read any journal of the learned or non-learned societies in India, look where you will, you are confronted with Indian political science and allied topics. But nowhere do you find references to Materialism, save in Colebrooke, Muir or Cowell.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pioneering work of European scholars is to be commended. Muir gave us a glimpse of the possibility of reconstructing a history of Indian Materialism. Suali was ambitious but he did not go further than merely citing a later text. Rhys Davids did not go further than Buddhism. The following papers are humble attempts to meet this gap in a reconstruction of "a history of materialist thought in India."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been the peculiar misfortune of India to be known more by her superficialities than by her essentials. India is not a country of tigers and snakes alone. It is not all a country of saints and hermits. Nor is it "loin cloth" and "goat’s milk." Taj-Mahal, Seville Row, the white residences of Simla are not the whole of India. India did not always pray and meditate.<SUP>44 </SUP>India has its teeming masses, its struggles, its history. Those who only know an ascetic India do not understand India.<SUP>45</SUP> Its masses struggled for life, groaning under the weight of oppression, rebelled, took to arms, were defeated and misled. Now and then a Buddha, a Mahavira, an Asoka, a Chaitanya came across their way. What little they gained they lost. Autocracy after autocracy broke their spines. With all this, India is not without revolutionary traditions. Leaders of democratic progressive thought were non-Brahmins.<SUP> 46 </SUP>Some of her kings were of non-Kshatriya origin.<SUP> 47</SUP> The best protestant thought is from non-Brahmana castes.<SUP> 48</SUP> Even in our own generation, India’s first labour leader was a workman.<SUP> 49</SUP> Likewise, India is not wanting in materialist thinkers. Not all thought is other-worldly. Not all thought is idealistic. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Materialist thought in India is one phase of her struggles, her history. What is "materialist thought"? Broadly speaking, it is the view that upholds the primacy of matter to other things. Any attempt to define "materialism" and seek for such a thing in the history of India is not only absurd but futile. Because materialism has changed in content at every epoch in Indian history. Materialism is also the natural born son of India.<SUP> 50</SUP> Given the conditions, the classes, the ideas, and institutions of the Vedic period, materialist thought is bound to appear. Attempts to define that materialism is as old as philosophy and not older, <SUP>51</SUP> in this light, are also futile. In India it arose at definite stages of social development. The incomplete incoherent Vedic cosmologies, the hedonistic priestdom, the Vedic ceremonials and the philosophical tenets of the day led to the birth of materialism. <SUP>52</SUP> Materialism in the early stages of Hindu culture took the form of Naturalism. It was a protest against the Supernaturalism of the day. This took several forms at that stage. It took the form of free-thinking. It took a sceptical form–yet free-thinkers and sceptics were not materialists. Of the many negative movements against Supernaturalism, Lokayata is one. It combined in itself all the features of the free-thinking and the sceptic movements of the day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a later stage it became agnostic. Buddhists and Jains were agnostics. They wore materialist pants. Agnosticism led in turn to Atheism. At each stage materialism depended on the knowledge of Sciences. It made use of the then obtainable knowledge of Physics. Astronomy, Logic and Psychology. Its theory of knowledge bore all the defects of the sciences of the day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lokayata came to be confused with Nastikas, with all heretical movements later. Hence we have to treat Lokayata in a strictly historical sense <SUP>53</SUP> without losing sight of the conditions that gave birth to it. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At another stage it came to be regarded purely as a "theory" of sensations. Sensations were regarded as the only source of knowledge. A view is held that a materialist is one who has to do with that which may be touched, handled, seen or otherwise perceived through the senses.<SUP> 54</SUP> This was viewed purely from the point of view of the "physical inquirer. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a still later stage, it took a hedonist character. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roughly, materialist thought in India may be divided into various phases:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I. <I>Naturalism, </I>against Supernaturalism, coupled with Free-thinking and Scepticism, represented by Anti-Vedins, Upanishadic and post-Upanishadic materialist thinkers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">II. <I>Agnosticism, </I>represented by some aspects of Buddhism and Jainism.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">III. <I>Atheism, </I>represented by early Sankhya.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IV. <I>Sensationalism, </I>represented by a sect of Lokayats. One may speak of atomic or mechanical materialism here. <SUP>55</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">V. <I>Hedonism, </I>represented by the last stage of Lokayata.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the materialist thought in India is of a protestant character because it has been intensely practical and was the product of practical needs. In its protests, it has not developed its theoretical side. Knowledge of Social Sciences was weak. For want of this, most opposition writers had recourse to mysticism <SUP>56</SUP> and useless dialectics. This weakness is represented in general in the weak theoretical works of the materialists themselves. But not all protestant thought is materialist thought. The Indian phase of materialism, because of its concrete nature, has at all times taken a stand against supernaturalism, against magic, above all against Brahmins, their practices, and their philosophical tenets.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Materialist thought in India is one branch of thought expressing the relations between men and men, men and things, conditioned by time and space, having for its starting point the world as it is, as it exists. In the words of Russell,<SUP> 57</SUP> we may regard materialism in India, historically, as a dogma set up to combat orthodox dogma. Despite the wishes of the protestants, nothing less definite than a dogma enabled them to fight the dogmas they disliked.</P>

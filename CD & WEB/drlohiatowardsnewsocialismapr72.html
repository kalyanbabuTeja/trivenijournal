Dr. Ram <span class=SpellE>Manohar</span> Lohia said, “I have nothing with me
except that the common and the poor people of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place> think that I am perhaps their
own man.” Indeed, Lohia was a dedicated and kindly individual, a man of people
who lived and worked for them. Although he will ever be remembered as a
forceful exponent of decentralized socialism, a fiery propagandist of a ‘New
Socialism’ and an ardent support of Hindi, his real worth lay in the sympathy
and affection which he had for the Indian masses. He was gentle in manner and
wore an unostentatious and simple look. In him were combined many great
qualities- humanism and compassion of Buddha, sacrifice and affection of a
prophet and courage and rage of <span class=SpellE>Samkara</span>. If he proved
a terror for the men in power, he was a source of inspiration and courage for
the poor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1928 while Lohia was a college student in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:City></st1:place>,
he started taking an active part in the freedom movement of the country. He <span
class=SpellE>organised</span> and led the college students to boycott the Simon
Commission that had come to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to inquire into the working of the Reforms of 1919, and to negotiate with the
Indian leaders on the further constitutional reforms. And it was in this year
that he came into close contact with Jawaharlal Nehru, who had come there to
preside over the Youth Conference. He also came in touch with <span
class=SpellE>Subhash</span> Chandra Bose, but it was Nehru who left a deep
impression on him. Nehru too was much impressed by his sharp mind, his talent
for speaking and his fervent nationalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1929 Lohia left for <st1:State w:st="on">Berlin</st1:State> for higher studies
from where he returned to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the beginning of 1933, after having earned a Ph. D. degree in Economics. In
1934 a socialist party, known as the Congress Socialist Party, was <span
class=SpellE>organised</span> within the Congress. The party started its
Weekly, the <i>Congress Socialist, </i>to disseminate the socialist ideology
among the Congress workers and the Indian masses, the editorship of which was
entrusted to Dr. Lohia due to his logical and progressive approach to the
economic and political questions of the day. In 1936 he was made Secretary of
the Foreign Department of the Congress on the recommendation of Jawaharlal
Nehru. He held this post for about two years. In 1938 he was included in the
Executive Committee of the Congress Socialist Party. From 1939 to 1946, <span
class=SpellE>Lohia’s</span> life was one of continuous struggle against the
British Government. During this period he worked under the guidance and
leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and passed about four years behind bars. In
February 1947, the Congress Socialist Party held its session in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Kanpur</span></st1:place></st1:City>
under the chairmanship of Dr. Ram <span class=SpellE>Manohar</span> Lohia. At
the <span class=SpellE>Kanpur</span> Session the party decided to drop the word
‘Congress’ from its name and assume a new status and title as an independent
Socialist Party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the post-Congress period, Lohia constantly pressed for adopting new objectives
based on new assumptions. Consequently, the socialist leaders resolved to eschew
doctrinaire political thinking in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of pragmatic
and empirical analysis of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
s problems as a necessary first step in evolving a new democratic socialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1952 there was a merger of the Socialist Party with the <span class=SpellE>Kisan</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mazdoor</span> <span class=SpellE>Praja</span> Party (KMPP),
with the result that a new socialist party, known as <span class=SpellE>Praja</span>
Socialist Party, was formed. As the President of the P. S. P., Lohia pleaded
for a greater incorporation of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ideas in
socialist thought. He asked the Indian socialists to understand the importance
of a decentralized economy based upon the resuscitation of cottage industries.
He seemed to be against both capitalism and communism on account of their fad
for big and heavy machines. According to him, both the systems are wasteful and
hence unsuitable for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In contrast to them, Gandhi’s ideas and action, Lohia strongly pleaded, may act
as a filter through which socialist ideas would flow and get rid of their
dross. He said, “Nobody would be happier than I if Gandhi’s ideas were also to
influence the other two systems, capitalism and communism, but one may
reasonably doubt that this can be done.” <sup>1</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Developing
his argument in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
economy, Lohia explained that the world today was in the grip of two systems
and the third one was in the making. He argued: “Capitalism and communism are
almost fully elaborated systems, and the whole world is in their grip, and the
result is poverty and war and fear. The third idea is also making itself felt on
the world stage. It is still inadequate, and it has not been fully elaborated,
but it is open.”<sup> 2</sup> Lohia called this idea the true socialist idea.
This socialist idea, according to him, is to be based on Gandhi’s ideas of
decentralized economy and village government. He, therefore, urged the
importance of small machines which would utilize the maximum <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> power with small capital investments. This type of
thought-orientation was not liked by many of his colleagues. About a year after
(in June, 1953), <span class=SpellE>Asoka</span> Mehta put forward his thesis
of the ‘Political Compulsions of a Backward Economy’ in which he tried to
maintain that the ideology of the Congress was coming near to that of the
socialists, and hence he urged for an ideological alliance between the Congress
and the P. S. P. Lohia, as a counterbalance to it, presented his ‘Equidistant
Theory’ and asserted that the socialists were still as much equidistant from
the Congress as they were from the communists. He, therefore, did not like the
P. S. P. to have an alliance with the Congress on policy matters. However, he
saw no harm in making an electoral adjustment with the Congress under special
circumstances. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Disapproving
his party’s policies of alliance and adjustments with the Congress in <span
class=SpellE>Travancore</span>-Cochin, he demanded the resignation of <span
class=SpellE>Pattom</span> <span class=SpellE>Thanu</span> <span class=SpellE>Pillai’s</span>
socialist ministry in the face of police-firing in 1954 on a linguistic issue.
When the <span class=SpellE>Praja</span> Socialist Government refused to
resign, there came a split and a new Socialist Party of India was formed in
1955 under the leadership of Dr. Lohia. In the later years, efforts were made
to bridge up the differences between the <span class=SpellE>Praja</span>
Socialist Party and the Socialist Party of Lohia in order to propagate the
ideals of socialism and work for a socialist order in the country. But there
were three conditions on which Lohia was not ready to make any compromise with
the P. S. P. leaders. These were: No alliance with either the Congress or the
Communist Party (as maintained in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Gaya</span></st1:place></st1:City> thesis of the party);
complete internal democracy or freedom to discuss internal differences
publicly; and disciplined functioning of the party. It was on these issues that
he had left the P. S. P. Till his death, the unity, between the two socialist
parties could not be made possible due to his <span class=SpellE>unreconciling</span>
attitude. Lohia was a man who preferred to break with rather than to compromise
with anybody at the cost <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>his
policy and principles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Lohia
not only contributed to the development <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>socialist movement in the country, but he also reflected on certain questions
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>political importance and
thereby tried to build up his own socialist theory, Contemplating the process <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>history, he tells in his famous
work, <i>Wheel of History</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>(1955),
that history appears to move in an inexorable cyclical order and that it moves
without emotion. He dismisses Hegelians’ and Marxists’ interpretations <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>history, for their answers do not
provide us with a definite clue to the workings <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>history. He writes: “For, those who profess to give us a law
or even some inkling <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>a
process as to how man has developed through various periods must be able to
indicate why peoples and classes have risen and fallen. If there is no answer
to that, it would be futile to speak <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>a law of history. To describe symptoms is not to indicate causes”.<sup> 3</sup>
According to Lohia, no fixed law can be established about the purpose or design
in history. While thinking over the history <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>man, he remarks that “it would be well to remember that
historical enquiry has still to concern itself with the discovery <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>facts and that some <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>these are undiscoverable. The
conflict in testimony and facts is also not resolvable at all in some cases.
When such is the condition in relation to facts <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>outward phenomena and events, what to speak <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>those subtler motives and
feelings, which influenced the great men <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>history but dwelt either in the sub-conscious or have not been
communicated to us and which are a vital key to the designs and purposes <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>living.”<sup> 4</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
still the history moves in a cyclical order. <span class=SpellE>Lohia’s</span>
notion <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>history corresponds
to the Aristotelian cyclic theory. He disagreed with the notion <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>straight linear historical
advance. According to him, while there may be no universal validity in the
findings <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of most of </span>the
cyclical philosophies of history, they are certainly more objective than the earlier
philosophies of linear progress and have greatly leavened historical study. Lohia
found himself in agreement with <span class=SpellE>Spengler</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Northtrop</span>, <span class=SpellE>Sorokin</span> and Toynbee–the
exponents <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the cyclical
theory <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>history in the West.
Like them, Lohia also believed that “the rise and fall <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>peoples and <span class=SpellE>civilisations</span> has ever
taken place and, as students of history, we must have all concerned ourselves
with the rise of the British Empire, the fall of the <span class=SpellE>Pharoah</span>
Empire, the rise of the Gupta Kingdom and the fall of the Roman Empire and so
forth...”<sup> 5</sup> In the course of cyclical movement, a country may reach
the zenith of civilization and may also go down to <i>nadir, </i>perhaps, to
rise again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Lohia
further tells in his <i>Wheel of History </i>that human history is
characterized by a tussle between crystallized castes and loosely cohesive
classes. The internal oscillation between class and caste is the chief factor
of historical dynamics. He writes: “Castes represent conservative forces of
stagnation, inertia and prescriptive right, while classes stand for a dynamic
force of social mobilization. Thus all human history, according to him, has
been ‘an internal’ movement between castes and classes.”<sup> 6</sup> This
internal struggle between the castes and classes and between motives and
civilizations will go in the history till the evil in man and society is not
prevented from breeding. And he hoped that “the world might through intelligent
design try to achieve a multi-<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> harmony of
human race.”<sup> 7</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Lohia
came to believe that industrialization and mechanization of agriculture would
not do much good to the human race as they would further accelerate the
struggle for power on both national and international levels. Hence he advised
the socialists to <span class=SpellE>organise</span> the state and society on
the pattern Gandhi suggested in order to maintain steady progress in society
and achieve harmony of human race. He stressed the need of original thinking
and initiative on the part of Asian socialists. He advised them to frame their
policies in the context of a civilization emerging from centuries old despotism
and feudalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Discussing
the problems of Asian socialism, Lohia tells in his speech, delivered at <st1:City
w:st="on">Rangoon</st1:City> to <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the<i>
</i></span>preliminary meeting of the Asian Socialist Conference on 26th March,
1952, that in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> where economic problem is
still to be solved the European type of socialist democracy is of little use.
The Asian masses will be willing to sell their democratic rights if they are
convinced that they can procure bread through some economic system. And an
attempt at traditional rationalization in Asian countries “would be inevitably
followed by an economy similarly constituted as either the capitalist or the communist
pattern.”<sup>8</sup> Both capitalism and communism believe in the progress of
the same type of economy. The only difference between a capitalist and a
communist is that while the former encourages private property, the latter
converts it into public property. Rationalization ultimately leads to
unemployment. “Once you set about rationalization, hundreds of millions of
people in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>as also in other Asian countries, </span>will
be thrown out of employment.”<sup>9</sup> As it cannot solve the problem of
poverty in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>, he stressed the need of
rationalization with machines which do not need much capital. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Lohia
came to believe that the methods adopted by European socialists for economic
and political reconstruction were not suitable to Asian countries, particularly
to <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. A
new method must, therefore, be sought. He writes: “The peasant must learn
intensive agriculture and he must be persuaded to enter into co-operative
farming of one type or another. Such machines should be made available to him
as do not cost much capital. He must develop initiative and, therefore, maximum
state power, both legislative and administrative, should belong to him in his
village community. Communist <span class=SpellE>redivision</span> of land is a
hoax to begin with and a futile cruelty in the end. Socialist <span
class=SpellE>redivision</span> of land, because it is coupled with
decentralization of power, will produce good economic results as well as a new
way of living.”<sup>10</sup> According to him, European socialists have always
been trying to define socialism in terms of universal concepts, although they
have achieved some successes. Their socialism is a gradual and constitutional
socialism. Asian Socialism cannot afford to be that. According to him, the
whole Asian situation is such that its application must be drastic whether in
agriculture or industrial processes or in the process of nationalization.
Capitalism is incapable of achieving economic re-construction because of
private capital. On this point Lohia was in complete agreement with Karl Marx.
But he did not trust the communists because he thought that they had always
attempted to employ gross economic poverty for insurrectional pressure on the state.
Asian socialists must understand this situation to fight against injustice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

up the main objectives of Asian socialism, Lohia tells that it should strive
for the attainment of such concepts as the democratization of administration,
small capital outlay such as <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>small </span>machines,
<span class=SpellE>socialised</span> property and maximum attainable equality. And
the method he suggested for their realization corresponds to the <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> method of mass action. He dismissed communist
class struggle as immoral and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>violent </span>because
of its faulty <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>analysis </span>of
capitalism. Socialist class struggle, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>according
</span>to him, “must correspond to the aims of decentralized society, <span

economic and spiritual results.”<sup> 11</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

considered the mixing of dogmatic religious and political considerations a bane
of Asian politics, because <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it </span>leads
to the development of sectarian and communal outlook. In the absence of any
settled democratic tradition, terror and assassinations, often, assume the role
of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>political </span><span

the emergence of a new <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>class </span>of
bureaucrats and technocrats. As these diverse trends make possible <span

an exponent of <span class=SpellE>decentraliz<span class=GramE>:d</span></span>

on the lines Gandhi suggested. The socialist state, according to him, must aim
at the decentralization of both economic and political powers. He called his
socialist state a four-pillar state.<sup> 12</sup> In this state, an attempt
will be made to synthesize the opposite concepts of centralization and
decentralization. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Its </span>four

of all governmental and plan expenditure shall be through <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>village, </span>district and city <span

city and district <span class=SpellE>panchayats</span> or any of their
agencies. (3) The post of collector shall be abolished and all his functions will
be distributed among various bodies in the district. As far as possible, the
principle of election will be applied in administration, instead of
nominations. (4) Agriculture, industry and other property, which is
nationalized, will, as far as possible, be owned and administered by village,
city and district <span class=SpellE>panchayats</span>. (5) Economic
decentralization, corresponding to political and administrative
decentralization, will have to be brought about through maximum utilization of
small machines.<sup> 13</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

world, liberal as well as proletarian, has hitherto known only the two-pillar state.
Constitutional theories are being evolved and their elaborate applications
continually reconstructed in order to achieve division of the state’s functions
and powers into its two limbs, the federating centre and the integrating units.
But democracy, according to Lohia, can warm the “blood of the common man only
when constitutional theory starts <span class=SpellE>practising</span> the
state or four limbs, the village, the district, the province and the centre.
Organically covered by the flesh and blood of equalities already indicated,
this constitutional skeleton of the four-pillar state can bring to democracy
joyous <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>.”<sup> 14</sup> He also felt the
necessity of creating a fifth pillar in the form of a world government. This is
necessary for bringing about peace in the world. All those, who desire for a
world peace through a world government, “must aspire to achieve a world view of
equality and against class or caste or regional inequalities.”<sup> 15</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that happens it will change its traditional forms on practically every major
score.</span> In place of an increasing standard of living within national
frontiers, decent and minimum living standards for all men in the world will be
assured. In place of the alternatives between parliamentary and insurrectionary
action, a balanced mixture of constitutional action and civil resistance,
wherever necessary and possible, will be followed or <span class=SpellE>practised</span>.

property and in comet socialization of all property except such as does not

ratio in incomes will be brought about. In place of an international
organisation of unequal members, a comity of nations, equal in membership and

maintained. In fact, socialism must first achieve the union of mankind in the
mind before it can translate that into practice.<sup> 17</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

urged all the socialist parties of the world to think in terms of an effective
world union. “No true internationalism can arise unless its votaries realize
that the present crisis of foreign policy is a crisis of human civilization and
that it can be overcome only by a union of minds all over the world that cuts
across national frontiers and interests and is prepared to hold general
principles even when they operate against one’s own system of national or world
alliances”.<sup> 19</sup> <span class=SpellE>Criticising</span> India’s foreign
policy he often remarked that Indian Government’s foreign policy was more a
glittering quilt of imaginary international achievements to cover up the
poverty and misery at home than a genuine effort to create new world forces.
Hence he advised India’s socialism to keep in the forefront of its
international aims India’s dissociation from the British Commonwealth and
continue unceasing efforts to build up a third system, which adheres to the
principle of equal irrelevance between the two camps and refuses to put itself
in alternative service of either. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

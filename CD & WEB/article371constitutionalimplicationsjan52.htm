Mysore State from the operation of Article 371 in the next few weeks. It was a
wise surrender on the part of the Mysore Government, if only because it staved
off a greater constitutional crisis. The wisdom of the action of the Government
of India and of the compromise, however, is open to question, both with regard
to the particular case and the exemption from Article 371.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

take up the case first. What was the occasion for the Government of India’s
intervention? Some of the accused, including the principal accused, Mr. Raju,
had apprehensions that they would not get a fair trial in the Mysore State
because the Chief Justice was the complainant and a witness for the police
prosecution in the case. The Mysore Government saw no adequate reason to
exercise the discretionar</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

under the Indian Constitution to seek a transfer of the case to another State.
Subsequently, the Government of India advised the Mysore Government either to
transfer the case or import a judge from another State who would not be under
the influence of the Mysore Government and High Court. The Mysore Government
declined the advice. Whereupon the Government of India issued the Directive
under Article.371. Finally, the Mysore Government agreed to import a judge
rather than transfer the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Would
the importation of a judge serve the purpose which the accused and the
Government of India seem to have in common? No objection may be raised in any
quarter to the fact that the imported judge would have to be technically under
the jurisdiction of the Mysore Government and the Mysore High Court. But,
should there be an appeal from the judgment of the imported judge, it would in
the first instance be to the Mysore High Court. The purpose of the accused and
the Government of India is not merely technical, but substantial. It is more
probable than improbable that the accused would plead that they would not get a
fair trial on appeal in the Mysore High Court. Further, the Government of India
would not have over-ridden the Mysore Government if they were satisfied with
the <i>bona fides </i>of the latter. If their insinuation, however
diplomatically concealed, was that the Mysore Government, and perhaps the
Mysore High Court, were interested in denying a fair trial to the accused in
this particular case, have they made sure that the Mysore Government, left to
themselves, would not import an accommodating judge? If the satisfaction of the
accused be the principal concern and if the Government of India cannot trust
the Mysore Government in this matter, it is best that the case is transferred
to another and distant State, far removed from the influence of the Mysore
Government and the local communal and personal influences. It is best to
transfer the case to the Supreme Court itself, if that be possible, so that
justice to the greater satisfaction of the accused may be done and also seem to
be done, as they say. Once the Mysore Government submitted to the censure and
the dictation of the Government of India, it should make no difference to them
if the trial is held in some other State. It is best to transfer the case now,
than later as the result of another Directive from the Government of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Had the Government of India constitutional or
statutory power to intervene in this case? The question arose during the debate
in Parliament on the 8th February 1951, when Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, then Home
Minister, moved a Bill to extend the Criminal Procedure Code to the Part B
States, namely, the erstwhile Indian States. Under the Code, which at the time
applied to Pact A States only, the power to secure the transfer of cases from
one State to another vested in the Governments of the States, and the Central
Government had no such and concurrent power. At the last moment, at “the
eleventh or twelfth hour” as he put it, Mr. Anantasayanam Ayyangar suggested at
the Central Government should have concurrent power to withdraw cases, or
transfer them from one State to another. Mr. Rajagopalachari opposed the
suggestion on merits. He observed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:32.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“At
present I feel, and I think that most Members of the Supreme Court and the High
courts would resent any powers being taken by the executive government as such
to transfer or withdraw cases in the manner suggested by Mr. Anantasayanam
Ayyangar....The redistribution of powers as between, in the first place, the
executive government and the judiciary, and between the States and the
Government of India, should not, I think, come in a Bill of this nature, and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there
would be grave objection to it…..I do not th</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ink we can incorporate
in this Bill the provision that he has suggested, both because of the respect
that we should show to the judiciary and from the point of view of the respect
that we should show to distribution of powers. I think that we should not
reopen that question now. The emphasis which Mr. Anantasayanam Ayyangar laid
was entirely on the powers that we should reserve for the executive to withdraw
prosecutions. I think the less we reserve in that way the better on the whole.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Mr. Anantasayanam Ayyangar would not be denied. He pressed his plea that such
power was necessary, for “there are exceptional cases arising out of purely
political considerations”. He had instances, which he did not want to state
before the House, in which various people were oppressed. But Mr. Rajagopalachari
was unmoved. He said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“So
that the position may not be left in doubt, I have to make it clear that I
stand unconvinced. Every criminal does feel oppressed when the law is moved
against him, and I do not think it would be proper for us not only to apply our<i>
</i>law to the B States, but also for the first time introduce a new principle
by which the executive government at the Centre could take power to transfer
cases from one court to another within another B State or from one State to
another. It would not be welcomed by the Supreme Court.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Soon after the lunch interval, however, Mr.
Rajagopalachari announced that, as the result of discussion at an informal
committee during the interval, he had agreed to Mr. Anantasayanam Ayyangar’s
proposal that power should be reserved for the Central Government to transfer
cases, and that he would himself move such an amendment on behalf of the
Government! This was a complete change of front, not-withstanding that there
was no corresponding change in the situation as it stood before lunch,
regarding the respect due to the distribution of powers between the Centre and
the States and the respect due to the judiciary. Mr. Rajagopalachari, however,
did not accept the proposal that the Centre should have power to withdraw cases,
a proposal in which Mr. Anantasayanam Ayyangar was more interested.</p>

we are really going to give power to transfer cases from one State to another,
the proper authority which can have that power should be the Supreme Court and
not the Central Government. In fact, I can envisage a situation where there
will be a lot of political pressure being brought to bear on the Minister in
charge of that department; he will also be subject to interpellations in this
House as to why a particular right was exercised or not exercised.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bakshi Tek Chand, who was formerly the Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court
and spoke with special authority, supported Mr. Venkataraman’s suggestion. He
urged that Mr. Rajagopalachari’s amendment would sanction “interference with

objectionable ch</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mr. Rajagopalachari was not willing to give the
power of transfer to the Supreme Court, partly because, in his opinion, the
question of transfer concerned public opinion rather than the judiciary, and
partly because the Supreme Court was not consulted. He, however, said that if
the power was misused by the Central Government, he would support the motion
that the Supreme Court should exercise the power. He declined to give an
assurance that, irrespective of the working of his amendm<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>ent, he would as soon as possible, transfer
the power to the Supreme Court. Mr. Ethirajulu Naidu of Mysore, who apparently
knew more of the background of the proposals of Mr. Anantasayanam Ayyangar and
Mr. Rajagopalachari, said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

question is: are we going to have the rule of law or are we going to have the
rule of the executive?....The point is whether the Supreme Court is to be the
final arbiter, or whether it should get mixed up with politics and the
executive should decide the matter….If the Hon. Home Minister is not prepared
to confer the power on the Supreme Court without consulting it, this matter may
be deferred and can be dealt with separately.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the intensity of the opposition to his proposal, Mr. Rajagopalachari asked
permission of the House to withdraw his amendment. Surprisingly enough, he was
refused permission! Instead, it was put to the vote and defeated! While it was
an ungracious rebuff to the venerable and illustrious Home Minister, it
emphasised the intensity of opposition to vesting in the Central Government the
pOwer to transfer cases. Nevertheless, this was the very power that the
Government of India exercised in the Raju case, and sought the oblique autho</span><span

of Article 371 of the Constitution for it. To do an act which Parliament had so

the 8th February 1951, when the debate on the Criminal Procedure Code took
place, and the 3rd November, when the Directive was issued, there was enough
time for the Government of India to consult the Supreme Court, the High Courts
and the Governments of the States, as well as all others concerned, about the
advisability of vesting in the Supreme Court the power of transfer of cases
from State to State, and to enact suitable legislation under Article 140 of the
Constitution and Sec. 527 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Except for Mr.
Rajagopalachari, opinion was unanimous in Parliament in favour of investing the
power in the Supreme Court. If suitable action had been taken in time, while
the correspondence about the Raju case was proceeding, the Supreme Court would
have been seized of the matter, and the Government of India saved from having
to invoke Article 371. As Messrs. Anantasayanam Ayyangar and Rajagopalachari
said, such cases of transfer would be very exceptional and would not cast a
heavy burden on the Supreme Court, which would itself lay down rules of
procedure regarding such cases. Would it be uncharitable to suggest that the
Government of India were bent on exercising the power themselves by hook or
crook, and were averse to vesting it in the Supreme Court?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in comparison with States like Madras, Bombay and even the Centre itself.

be done. In the present case, some of the accused apprehended that they would
not get a fair trial in Mysore. The Government of Mysore, which is on the spot
as it were and was directly and exclusively concerned, did not share the
apprehension. But the Government of India, who are far away and were not
concerned, apparently did. In issuing the Directive, the Government of India
overstepped their constitutional and legal limits, defied Parliament, and
ignored their assurance that Article 371 would not be applied to Mysore except
to avoid a constitutional break-down. The Government of India must have very
strong and overpowering reasons for such an extraordinary action. What were
they? If they want their action to be appreciated properly, they should publish
all the relevant correspondence between them and the Mysore Government and the
representation they might have received from other quarters, if any. The Mysore
Law Association, which <i>post facto </i>supported the Government of India’s

the Raju one are peculiar to Mysore, and cannot and do not occur in Part A
States but to which Article 371 does not apply. Indeed, Mr. Anantasayananm
Ayyangar said that there was a plurality of cases, and not only one cage. His
amendments would have applied to all the States, whether A or B. Similarly, Mr.
Rajagopalachari's amendment would apply to all States. If there were more cases
than one, what happened to the others? Did any of them take place in A States?
And, if so, did the Government of India look on helplessly? They could have
prevented possible injustice if they had at least secured power to the Supreme

for co-ordination of policies and administration in an ever-increasing number
of matters is being increasingly felt. Further, it is not always possible that
the political party in power at the Centre will also be in power in the States.
In both these contingencies, which are more probable than improbable,
co-ordination between the States, and between the Centre and the States, may
not always be possible by persuasion. A single State, standing on its
constitutional al1tonomy, can handicap national policies by non-co-operation.
The Centre should have over-riding powers to ensure co-ordination and
co-operation for national ends. Article 371 should be retained permanently and
applied to all States. It will mean that the Centre will gain at the expense of
the States. All realists acknowledge its inevitability.</p>

over the States under Article 371, and the Supreme Court does similarly over

restoration of unitary Government in India, which may well be accompanied by
extensive delegation of powers to the States. Time and tide are with a

it connotes the living law of life; so one serves God by serving the human
beings through love. One should also resist untruth and evil through

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji’s
approach to the concept of property is rather attractive. He propounded the
doctrine of trusteeship which he described thus: “The prince and the peasant
will not be equated by cutting off the prince’s head. Not by confiscation or by
expropriation or by cramping of superior talents can the wealth or happiness of
all be increased but by those who have more of the world’s goods and superior
talents using their advantage not for self but for the good of society as a
whole.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a great ideal. Gandhiji believed that <i>Satyagraha </i>is the sanction for
enforcing the moral doctrine of trusteeship and that an egalitarian society can
be brought about only through this process. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Constitution in effect accepted the doctrine but imposed a legal sanction for
enforcing it. It declares the citizens’ fundamental right to property. A
positive and a negative duty are implicit in the said right. He should enjoy
his right in such a way that he does not come into conflict with that of others.
He should also respect and protect the rights of those who help him to acquire
his property and to enjoy the same, viz., tenants, <span class=SpellE>labourers</span>,
etc. Law of social control which the Constitution enables the State to make is
nothing more than enforcing the duty implicit in the said right. But there is
an essential difference between the doctrine of trusteeship and the law of
social control. The former is voluntary; it is based on self-sacrifice, and
sustained by the sanction of non-violent resistance to evil; the latter is
enacted and enforced by the State. The former is an ideal and the latter is
pragmatic. The later can be replaced by the former only when the individual
becomes perfect and does not require external sanctions to discharge his
duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

countries in the West have rejected the theories of retribution and deterrence

discussion, whether Gandhi in the circumstances in which he was murdered would

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
conviction was based upon his experience in political cases. He believed that
the Courts were instruments of imperialism. He </span><span style='font-size:

experience in political cases in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> leads one to the conclusion
that nine out of every ten condemned men were totally innocent. Their crime
consisted in the love of their country. In ninety-nine out of hundred, justice
has been denied to Indians as against Europeans in the Courts in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This is
not an exaggerated picture but it is the experience of almost everyone who has
something to do in such cases. In my opinion the administration of law is thus
prostituted consciously or unconsciously for the benefit of the exploiters.”
This is a strong indictment. In those days there was no separation of the
judiciary from the executive. The said evils are inherent in such a system. In
some political cases the picture drawn by Gandhiji may be correct. But in my
experience in other cases and at higher levels, by and large, with rare
exceptions, the judiciary, before and after independence, discharged their
duties objectively and conscientiously. This indictment was the justification
for the Indian Constitution directing the State to separate the judiciary from
the executive. Though some advanced States immediately carried out the reform,
other States postponed it on one pretext or other or implemented it with great
reluctance. The said reform has not yet been completed throughout the country.
It is hoped that the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> centenary year will see
the completion of this urgent reform. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

strongly believed in voluntary arbitration for deciding disputes. His award in
the dispute between the employers and the <span class=SpellE>labour</span> of
textile industry in <span class=SpellE>Ahmedabad</span> was the result of that
conviction and indeed for about 20 <span class=GramE>years</span> parties
abided by it. The efficacy of arbitration depends upon the moral and
intellectual <span class=SpellE>calibre</span> of the arbitrator and also on
the sincerity of the parties to settle their disputes and their confidence in
the arbitrator. These are very difficult conditions and my experience is that
in most of the cases, parties seek arbitration with mental reservations and
invariably the award turns out to be the first step in the long course of
interminable litigation. Arbitration serves a simple society. It is abused in a
sophisticated one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

philosophy of Gandhi is certainly against the costly infrastructure of law and
justice. While the complex national and international relations cannot avoid
complicated legal structure, there is room to simplify it and particularly at
the village level. The <span class=SpellE>Panchayats</span> of the old evoked
respect and confidence but those of the present are riddled with political
faction. An urgent reform is called for to simplify legal procedures, to reduce
the number of appeals, to cut down the expenditure and to enable the poor to
have their rights decided at public expense. The doctrine of equality for which
Gandhiji stood for, would be flouted, if the law and the Courts become the
sporting ground of the rich. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

believed in the preventive method as much in medicine as in law. In <st1:place
w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> he persuaded his clients to settle rather than to
go to Court. He believed that the true function of a lawyer was to unite the
parties <span class=SpellE>riven</span> asunder. He had not taken false cases. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

believed that though the profession of law was a means of livelihood it was
none the less a public service and it could only justify its existence through
service. Gandhiji’s concept of the role of lawyer was consistent with his
philosophy of law. He sought to <span class=SpellE>spiritualise</span> the
practice of law and advised lawyers not to depart from truth and honesty. He wanted
the profession to serve the country and to <span class=SpellE>practise</span>
law without compromising truth. He declared that the duty of the lawyer was
always to place the correct </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to arrive at the truth. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

clients. His sayings embody high legal ethics and he followed them
scrupulously. The Bar can only ignore his advice at its own peril. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in his abiding faith in the individual and his self-realisation through
service. But the State has done lip service to his principles and tried all
these twenty years to build up the social structure from the top making the
individual a cog in the machinery of the State. Gandhiji has become another God
and his philosophy has become another <i>Ism. </i>His name is invoked but his
voice is ignored. It is hoped that one day having learnt the lessons by the
hard <span class=GramE>way,</span> we will go back to him in search of truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is today, in every part of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a keen
desire for national integration, and an effort to achieve it. Attention is
being directed to the many causes and tendencies which have promoted
disintegration since the attainment of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>.
Committees under the chairmanship of eminent leaders of public opinion, like Dr
C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar and Dr <span class=SpellE>Sampurnanand</span>, are
recommending the adoption of measures to counteract <span class=SpellE>casteism</span>,
<span class=SpellE>linguism</span>, materialism, provincialism and other evils
which threaten national unity and impede our progress to a higher level of
thought and action. The feeling is widespread that, during the last decade,
deterioration has set in, both in the matter of the recognition of moral values
and in the choice of means for compassing desirable ends. While technical
efficiency <span class=GramE>and</span> scientific knowledge are on the
increase, there is not a corresponding insistence on the promotion of a
cultured and benignant outlook on life and its problems. In most spheres of
public or private activity, the emphasis is on speedy success, acquisition of
wealth and rise to power. In the daily tasks of life and in working for the
welfare of the ordinary citizen, goodness, gentleness, courtesy, refinement,
idealism are at a discount, and praise is bestowed on the ‘clever’ person who
pushes himself forward and manages anyhow to attract attention. It is usually
assumed that objective success is the one thing that matters. This is a malady
which has affected our politics and administration, our schools and colleges,
our trade and commerce. There is a general lowering of standards, and the
prevailing inefficiency and corruption <span class=GramE>have</span> become the
subject of common talk in streets and market-places, and in buses and trains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is indeed no necessary conflict between goodness and efficiency. It may even be
urged that goodness, rightly conceived, is an important constituent of
efficiency. Goodness is not mere softness or weakness of spirit. It is the
result of prolonged training, mental and emotional, and can ultimately be
traced to a selfless and joyous dedication<i> </i>to Duty, valued as the
highest good. ‘Cultured efficiency’ is a term often used to indicate this
balanced and harmonious development of the individual man who pursues his own
good while promoting the good of all. If ever there is a sense of conflict, the
good man will, without a pang, efface himself. There must be a return to this
type of idealism which sustained the nation in its darkest hours during the
freedom struggle. Every man can be a light unto himself; but the presence of a
few Shining Ones at the highest level in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>, and at every level including the villages in
obscure corners of the country, will make it easier for him to light his lamp
and illumine his personal life. The ranks of such Shining Ones–the loftiest as
well as the lowliest–must swell. This is the first step in national
integration. And to this end, a wider diffusion of the wealth of poem and song
and the words of wisdom of the epics and scriptures of <span class=GramE>humanity,</span>
must be deemed to be at least as valuable as the diffusion of scientific and
technological study. Poetry and philosophy will bridge the gulf between man and
man, and between nation and nation. An awareness of the immanence of Spirit in
Matter will furnish the requisite atmosphere for the success of all schemes of
integration, political as well as social. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the course of discussions relating to the problem
of national integration, it is sometimes pointed out that the re-organisation
of States on the basis of language was the initial error, from which flowed
most of the troubles with which the country is now faced. It is necessary to
counteract this view and to remind the public of the important fact that the
early pioneers of the movement for such a re-organisation were men of unsullied
reputation, and patriots of the front rank who played a distinguished role in
their provinces. They took an active part in all-India politics; they pleaded
for the creation of new provinces like <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>,
Orissa and Andhra even before the assumption by Gandhiji of the leadership of
the nation. <span class=SpellE>Sachchidananda</span> <span class=SpellE>Sinha</span>
and Mahesh <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> of Bihar, <span class=SpellE>Nilakanta</span>
Das and <span class=SpellE>Gopabandhu</span> Das of Orissa, and <span
class=SpellE>Venkatappayya</span> and <span class=SpellE>Pattabhi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sitaramayya</span> of Andhra, urged the claims of their respective
regions to recognition as distinct administrative units of what was then known
as ‘British’ India. They felt that national consciousness would be fostered by
the formation of well-knit, homogeneous provinces possessing a common language,
history and tradition. It was, in their view, a step in the process of
nation-building on sound, well-understood lines. Lokamanya Tilak and Sri
Aurobindo blessed the movement, for they looked upon it as a sign of national
awakening, similar to the movement for the re-integration of <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
after its unfortunate partition by Lord <span class=SpellE>Curzon</span>. The
sponsors of the movement were quite aware of the problem of linguistic minorities
in the proposed provinces, and of possible disputes ever border areas. But
these, they argued, could be solved in a spirit of friendliness as between
brothers and good <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
complete power to shape the nation’s destiny passed to the Congress, and the
Congress was called upon to implement some of its pledges to different
linguistic groups, a new situation arose. It was one thing to accept the
principle of linguistic provinces, and even carve out Congress Circles on that
basis, in the old-time administrative units of <st1:place w:st="on">British
 India</st1:place>. But an independent <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> incorporating the former
princely Indian States found itself in a different situation. Claims and
counter-claims to various regions of the country were pressed with vehemence,
and even while the Fazl Ali Commission was at work, violence broke out in some
parts of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
But the recommendations of the Commission were accepted, in the main, and the
States were re-<span class=SpellE>organised</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
the principle behind the re-organisation was sound, the working out of the
details gave rise to trouble. The bitterness of linguistic rivalries assumed
ugly shapes, and a new term of reproach–‘<span class=SpellE>linguism</span>’–was
coined by those who had always opposed such re-organisation. But, even as
democracy is a valid concept and the democratic process is welcomed for its
undoubted virtues, despite some serious drawbacks like party strife and
election <span class=SpellE>manouvres</span>, the formation of Linguistic
States is a satisfactory arrangement despite the antagonisms to which it has
given rise. There is a definite integration within the borders of each State;
the tensions between <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> States and between
the majority and minority language groups within each State are being eased by
the functioning of the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities and the Zonal
Councils presided over by the Home Minister of the Central Government. Andhra
which was among the earliest to seek separation has also been the first to
solve the problem of linguistic minorities within the State of <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Andhra Pradesh</st1:place></st1:State> by
according a proper status to Urdu, Tamil and other languages. The State has
also led the way in coming to friendly agreements with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> and Orissa on matters of common
concern. The proposed recognition, by the Parliament of India, of English as an
associate language for the purposes of the Central Government and for
communication between the States, will go a long way to allay the present
discontents. The suggestion to scrap Linguistic States is a course of despair.
Wisdom lies in taking adequate steps to promote harmony and goodwill, and, in
particular, to encourage a study of Indian literatures other than one’s own.
Our common <span class=SpellE>Indianness</span> will then become evident, as
also our common indebtedness to Sanskrit and English which, at different stages
in our history, promoted the cultural unity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

class=SpellE>Appa</span> Rao, the centenary of whose birth is being celebrated,
was a forerunner of the literary renaissance in Andhra. The nearest approach to
a culture-state in Andhra during the latter half of the nineteenth century was
the <span class=SpellE>Vizianagaram</span> Raj (Visakhapatnam District) in the <span
class=SpellE>palmy</span> days of Sri <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Gajapati</span>. Statesman, scholar and patron of letters, this
‘Prince charming’ gathered a brilliant coterie around him. <span class=SpellE>Kasinatha</span>
Sastri, the Sanskrit savant; <span class=SpellE>Venkataramana</span> Das,
master of the <span class=SpellE><i>Vina</i></span><i>; </i><span class=SpellE>Narayana</span>
Das, the gifted poet and <span class=SpellE><i>bhagavatar</i></span><i>; </i>Principal
<span class=SpellE>Ramanujachari</span>, the finest flower of Anglo-Sanskrit
culture, adorned his court. Younger than these stalwarts, but destined through
his dreams and his literary achievement to be a herald of the Dawn, was <span
class=SpellE>Appa</span> Rao, constant companion of the Maharaja whether at
home or in his travels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Moving
in the atmosphere of a luxurious court, <span class=SpellE>Appa</span> Rao
developed an exquisite taste. His sense of the beautiful in art and literature
was remarkable. He was a graduate of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
but, unlike most graduates of his generation, he was a first-rate scholar in
Sanskrit and Telugu. In addition, he was a lover of the classics of English
literature, and was <span class=GramE>specially</span> fond of the lyric poets
of the early nineteenth century. He felt that, if Telugu literature was once
again to be a life-giving stream, the decadent <span class=SpellE><i>prabandha</i></span><i>
</i>ought to give way to the lyric. In common with Gidugu Ramamurti and others
among his contemporaries, he conceived a distaste for the archaic prose-style
brought into fashion by <span class=SpellE>Chinnaya</span> <span class=SpellE>Suri</span>,
as it was, altogether divorced from the speech of even cultured Telugus of the
day. The bridging of the gulf between the spoken and the written <span
class=GramE>Telugu,</span> and the elevation of the lyric into a distinct
literary form were <span class=SpellE>Appa</span> <span class=SpellE>Rao’s</span>
main contributions to the Renaissance. His published works are few. To most
Telugus of the present day he is known as the author of a remarkable social
satire–the <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>. </i>The play is
long and rambling; there is no unity in the plot and the end is unconvincing. <span
class=SpellE>Inspite</span> of its brilliant dialogue and its faithful
portrayal of certain phases of contemporary life, <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>
</i>is not the finest expression of <span class=SpellE>Appa</span> <span
class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> genius. The style of the play has caused a serious
misunderstanding. It is an exact reproduction of the local dialect of the
Visakhapatnam District, and wonderfully true to life. But the opponents of the
reform of Telugu prose writing seized upon this as a sample of the ‘standard spoken
Telugu’ which the reformers <span class=SpellE>favoured</span>. They charged <span
class=SpellE>Appa</span> Rao and his school with having sought to import into
the language of books all the mannerisms and even the vulgarisms of a local
dialect. But the language of the play was the living language of Comedy, in the
same way as <span class=SpellE>Viresalingam’s</span> <span class=SpellE><i>Prahasanas</i></span><i>
</i>reflected the spoken dialect of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rajahmundry</st1:place></st1:City>
and around. For the purposes of other and more serious literary expression, the
reformers urged a close approximation to the spoken language of the educated
classes, but not an exact reproduction of it. <span class=SpellE><i>Kanyasulkam</i></span><i>
</i>has attained the position of a classic and its main characters–<span
class=SpellE>Girisam</span>, <span class=SpellE>Madhuravani</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>Ramappa</span> <span class=SpellE>Pantulu</span>–are highly <span

and not just ‘types’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Raju</span>’ and his ballad of ‘<span class=SpellE>Purnamma</span>’.
Lofty and moving sentiments couched in homely phrase are a special
characteristic of these tales. Time and again, he expresses poignant regret
that he had worn himself out in vain yearnings after the ‘fruits of the
empyrean’ while he spurned the beauteous things that lay right around him. This
is a reference to his early love for classical literature, either Sanskrit or
highly <span class=SpellE>sanskritised</span> Telugu. The ineffable beauty and
grace of the native Telugu idiom was missed by him till late in life. But he
made ample amends by enshrining it in a series of beautiful poems. There are
few things in Telugu literature finer than the closing lines of <span
class=SpellE><i>Kanyaka</i></span><i> </i>where the chaste <span class=SpellE>Vaisya</span>
maiden flings a curse on the king who wished to ravish her: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ideas for which he lived won splendid recognition. During the past four decades
a large volume of literature has grown up, through poem and song, play and
story, which can be, definitely traced to his influence. Part of this
literature is ephemeral and takes us too far from the traditional values which
are still valid despite the passage of time. It represents a revolt and, in the
process of discounting the past, forgets that life and literature have many
facets of which the modern movement is only a partial expression. A return to
classicism, and to the emphasis on the <i>form </i>as well as the content of
literature, is in evidence today. But <span class=SpellE>Appa</span> Rao played
a great role; he shaped Telugu literature during the period of transition from
the classical to the modern, and moved a new generation to its depths. That
generation became the makers of modern Telugu literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Appa</span> Rao was an admirer of

fifty years ago, when all <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> paid homage
to the poet on the completion of his fiftieth year. Tagore and <span

close on the celebration of the Tagore centenary. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

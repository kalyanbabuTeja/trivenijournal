mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Who was the spiritual master of Rabindranath? The
answer to this question has set many a person a-thinking continuously, and for
long converted their minds into so many churning-rods. When the English
rendering of his <i>Gitanjali </i>was first published, several of the
Theosophists, for instance, understood by his frequent reference to “My
Master”, one of those august adepts on the Himalayas in whose existence they
believe, while the Christians, who said that the book was but biblical in the
intensity of its mystical vision as well as in its emotional and expressional
apparatus, thought that the term alluded to Christ. Of course, as every earnest
student of his works knows, he meant nothing of the kind. For his Master was
none else but God with His individualized aspect in is own inner consciousness,
whom he gave the especial appellation of <i>Jeevan-devata</i>, “the Lord of
life.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>However, on one occasion, in reply to a young
Sindhi school-girl’s query, “Who is your Master?” the Poet replied readily,
“Buddha.” Now this is quire significant because it is usually stated that his
thinking was influenced effectively and invariably, if not exclusively by the
Upanishads. That is undoubtedly true. But may it not be also that the Poet’s
conception of Godhead was not only as that of a Person, but that it was
impersonal as well, He becoming It, the lover or the Beloved becoming Law, too?
Again, was such an impersonal envisaging of the Core and crux of the universal
entity or existence a later phase of his own spiritual evolution? For it does
not appear to have been so patent during the first half or so of his pilgrimage
or pursuit of the Oversoul, unless his initial interior experience, while he
was yet in his teens, converging on conversion, that One Supreme (without a
second) Energy underlined the million-faceted manifestation, called creation,
be a proof in point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The fact of the matter, as it would appear, is that
though the Poet “sang of many a song in many a mood”, yet, as he himself has
said in one of his songs, “their ultimate meaning has always pointed to Thee.”
(God) But this “Thee” was sometimes “He” and at other times “It”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A study of his works written in the course of the
latter half of his last earthly quest, however, leads the writer to suggest in
all humility that the impersonalization of the Eternal, so to speak, was
emphasized by him, towards the end of his career. It may have been impressed on
him, no doubt, by the Upanishadic allusions to, or implication of, the Truth of
Life, as against the Lord of Life. Could it be that this was due to his having
studied, in the meantime, the Buddhist scriptures? Or, was it influenced also
by the process and “provocation” and pressure of modern science? Or, again, was
it as a result of a realisation on his part, just as the Buddha evidently had,
that, in the ultimate, even his poetic vocabulary and imagery, so rich and
variegated could not angle within its net the inexhaustible nature of the One
Indivisible and Eternal and that all that he could say truthfully at the
penultimate end of his search was the Supreme Reality is best represented in
syllables of silence. He is “It”. In this connection one little fact may be
mentioned, for it is quite suggestive. Edmond Holmes’ <i>Creed of the Buddha </i>was
one of the Poet’s great favourites among books, so much so that he had more
than once recourse to it, something very unusual for him. Maybe, then, that his
answer to the aforesaid inquiry was made at a time when he had, perhaps, a
little while before read the book afresh! Maybe, again, he might have used the
name “Buddha” in the special sense that “The Enlightened One”, was not merely a
particular historical person but the Eternally Illuminated One, that changes,
when It so chooses, a Saul into a Paul, a Siddhartha into a Buddha. In other
words, Buddha may have meant to him a personal expression of the impersonal,
eternal Law, though the frigid absoluteness of Truth or Law can be converted
into an object of adoration and affection only by the vitalizing warmth of
personalization,–of making it a person’s own through devotion, and discipline
and dedication. And this is quite logical because, in the last resort, as
Gandhiji says, “the Law and the Law-giver are one”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In most parts of the world, the question as to
whether political parties are necessary does not arise. Political parties are
considered to be a concomitant of the democratic form of Government, but in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> my friend
<span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> has
kept the debate alive. Recently at an <span class=SpellE>AlCC</span> meeting
Mr. Nehru felt called upon rather vehemently to say: “I am entirely in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of the Party System of Government.” In this
particular debate I feel sorry that I cannot go all the way with my good friend
<span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span>, much as I admire his idealism and the
spirit of service in which he has raised this issue. For as long as one can
foresee, political parties will, in my view, be necessary in a democracy. <span
class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> says that elections should be held on the
principle of selecting the best man. That is not quite so simple because, when
thousands upon thousands of people have to vote, the question arises: Who is
the best man? How do we weigh the quality of one man as being better suited to
represent us than another? The answer is that one votes for the man who
represents one’s point of view better than the other candidates. That is, one
votes for the man with whom one has the greatest ideological <span class=GramE>affinity</span>.
That is what political parties are about. They are groups of people with common
thoughts or common programmes or common policies, offering a choice to the
electorate. Therefore, in selecting the ‘best man’, the mechanism of a
political party becomes a great aid, or should be a great aid, to the
electorate. </p>

that Party politics are acquiring a somewhat bad name in this part of the
world.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> We have seen how, in one country of <st1:place
w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> after another, party democracy is giving way to some
form or another of dictatorship or autocracy. There is a growing cynicism about
all politicians based on the fact that most politicians, according to public
opinion, do not <span class=SpellE>practise</span> what they preach. There is a
gulf between profession and practice on all sides, and there is growing
cynicism as a result, which is very dangerous because, if people really come to
believe that all politicians are crooks, democracy will not survive for long. <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> Nelson Rockefeller, a likely candidate for the
Republican nomination in the next <span class=SpellE>presidental</span>
election, recently said quite aptly that “to call politics dirty is to call
democracy dirty.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a current world trend as a result of which the political party tends to
become too dominant over the individual. The political party in most parts of
the world, though not total like the Communist Party, is in danger of becoming
all-pervasive, of trying to dictate to a member his thinking on almost every
aspect of life. This phenomenon was referred to by the well-known Italian
novelist <span class=SpellE>Ignazio</span> <span class=SpellE>Silone</span>,
who has been in the past a member of the Italian Socialist Party. He pointed
out that the Party system in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was also tending in the direction of dominating the minds and lives of people
too much. He made the plea that the party should be kept to its proper place.
Just as, much earlier, somebody has said: “Render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s
and unto God what is God’s,” so too, since the party reflect an attempt to run
the State, a point comes where we must tell the party to keep its hands off
certain spheres of life which should </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>really belong to the
individual conscience and the individual personality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

regional boundaries or the banning of the nuclear bomb on which my great leader
Rajaji and I hold very different views and freely express them in public. We
believe that this should be so and that it is not on every public issue that
members of the party </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party has said from the start that the
party will not follow the lead of the other parties in trying to indoctrinate
and capture student <span class=SpellE>organisations</span> and groups of
students. In our Statement of Policy we have said that we will keep out of the
Universities. We will go and address study circles or meetings but we will not
set up groups of students based on our platform and subscribing to our
programme. That stage must come after they have graduated and become full
citizens. Similarly, in the case of trade unions and workers who today are, we
know, exploited by the various political parties, we have kept our hands off
trade unions and said that, while our members may go and serve as individuals,
there will be no <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> TUC to add to the INTUC,
the HMS, the AITUC and the UTUC. We will not form a fifth Trade Union Congress
just because others have set this pattern. So, in these ways, we have tried to
keep out of what we consider unnecessary or undesirable party activity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

not contest Village <span class=SpellE>Panchayat</span> elections. Recently,
there was a great deal of pressure from some of our <span class=GramE>people</span>
who asked, why, when the others were not abstaining, we should do so. It was, they
said, an unfair handicap. I am very glad therefore that the AICC at its recent
meeting has reaffirmed the Congress Party’s decision to keep out of Village <span
class=SpellE>Panchayats</span>. That makes it much easier for us to adhere to
our own stand without being blamed for unduly restricting the Party’s
activities. There are ways in which we believe that the party should limit its
activities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>‘Left’ and ‘Right’ </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
common terminology, parties are either ‘left’ or ‘right’. I have felt for a
long time that these words have become altogether meaningless. I was delighted,
therefore, when on June 13, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Nehru, when asked
about the left and the right wing elements in his own Cabinet at a Press
conference, replied: “These terms do not fit in our politics.” I hope that
after this statement by Prime Minister the heresy which I have been trying to
preach that the words ‘leftist’ and ‘rightist’ have no meaning will be a little
better appreciated. Harold <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> had something
interesting to say on the subject apropos a similar discussion in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> many
years ago. Referring to the quarrels between the left wing and the right wing
of the Labour Party to which he belonged, he once observed: “Too much
preoccupation with the wings is likely to disturb the flight of the bird.”
Actually these terms were taken from the sitting arrangement in the French
National Assembly, after the French Revolution, which, rather like our own
Parliament, the <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span>,
was a semi-circular horseshoe. Those who sat on the right of the presiding
authority happened to be moderates at that time and those who sat on the left
were those who were the most extreme. This antiquated terminology of the French
Revolution we have carried into entirely different situations where it has no
meaning at all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
would like to ask the reader what he or she thinks is a leftist party. Perhaps,
if you thought a little, you would say that a leftist party is a party that
believes in rapid progress, in the fullest human liberty and one that is
opposed to tyranny of any kind. And you would say that those who believe in the
concentration of power and authority in one or in few hands are rightists. If
that is so, it is obvious that the Communist Party in India, or in any other
country, <span class=SpellE>symbolises</span> extreme Right reaction, because
it believes in the fullest concentration of power in the hands of the party
dictatorship in charge of the State machine and that the <span class=SpellE>Sarvodaya</span>
people, like my friend <span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> and Acharya <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bhave</span>, who believe in the fullest <span class=SpellE>decentralisation</span>
following Gandhiji’s thinking, are extreme leftists. But that is not how our
newspapers use these terms. By the same logic then the Communist Party is
extreme right, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Nehru’s Government is inner right,
the PSP is the centre, <span class=GramE>the</span> <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party is inner left and the <span class=SpellE>Sarvodaya</span> group as the
extreme left. That would certainly be a more logical application of these
terms. However, in order to avoid confusion, I would suggest that intelligent
people stop using these meaningless <span class=SpellE>lables</span> and go
behind them to <span class=SpellE>analyse</span> the content of political
programmes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
word leftist also has another disadvantage. It becomes a subtle cover or veil
to hide the real coloration of a person, ‘Leftist’ is a very convenient cover
for hidden communists, crypto-communists, and fellow-travellers. <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> A. D. <span class=SpellE>Gorwala</span>, one of the
finest political commentators in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> today, in his issue of May 23
of <i>Opinion </i>says: “What an umbrella-word is ‘leftist’! How many take
shelter under this umbrella’s shade! Is a well-known medical man a communist?
Well, he is a leftist! Is an equally well-known writer, a scientist, a
communist? You know, the apologists will say, both of them are leftists. Is
Krishna Menon a communist? Pat comes the answer, ‘He is a leftist.’ Are
journals which persistently support the Soviet cause communist? No, they are
always leftist. And therefore, for another reason, that it causes confusion and
gives aid and comfort to the communists as a cover for their underground
activities also, it is a term that should be avoided. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
then should the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party be correctly
described? Believers in <span class=SpellE>Statism</span> like the communists
and <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Nehru call it reactionary. Most unattached
people call it conservative. The first description is obviously motivated by
the desire to create prejudice and is a mere term of abuse. The second
description is not objectionable if it means that the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party would like to conserve what is good in India’s history or tradition. I
would, however, take exception to it because I do not think that the programme
and manifesto of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party are
Conservative. I think a more accurate description of the party would be to say
it is Liberal and <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>. The policy of minimum
government and of maximum individual liberty comes directly from Gandhiji’s
teaching. You remember Gandhiji’s phrase “That Government is best which governs
least.” This is the basis of our programme. Gandhiji also said: “I look upon an
increase in the power of the State with the greatest fear because, while
apparently doing good by <span class=SpellE>minimising</span> exploitation, it
does the greatest harm to mankind, by destroying individuality which lies at
the root of all progress.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similarly,
Western Liberalism also bases itself on minimum government and maximum
individual liberty. It is not the Conservative but the Liberal school of
economists, like Professor Hayek, Professor <span class=SpellE>Roepke</span>
and, may I say Professor <span class=SpellE>Shenoy</span>, who are the
staunchest individualists. In Europe, if you know the party spectrum, you will
find that the Conservative Party in Britain and the Christian Democratic Party
of Italy and Germany are more <span class=SpellE>Statist</span> than the

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
in the spectrum, the Liberal is the most individualist, Conservative or
Christian Democrat more <span class=SpellE>Statist</span>, the socialist more <span

Hob-house, in his book on “Liberalism”, says: “Liberalism is the belief that
society can safely be founded on the self-directing of personality; that it is
only on this foundation that the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>true Community can be
built. Liberty then becomes not so much a right of the individual as a
necessity of society.” In other words, the Liberal believes that the human
being is capable of rational choice; the Liberal believes and has faith in the
people. Professor Parkinson said recently in an article published in an English
journal: “The word ‘liberal’ means generous or openhanded. But generous with
what? With freedom and political responsibility.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it happens that I was elected a Patron of the Liberal International, some years
before the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party was formed. At a
conference of the Liberal International in Italy in 1959, soon after its
establishment here, I produced the programme of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party and asked them to comment on it. The leaders of world Liberalism were
puzzled as to why Rajaji had called it a conservative party. According to them,
ours was a liberal programme. They passed a resolution which said: “The 9th
Congress of the Liberal International held at <span class=SpellE>Gardone</span>,
Italy, from October 1 to 4, 1959, welcomes the formation of the <span
class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party in India and trusts that this party will
prove a staunch and successful upholder of the values and policies of Liberals
which are so necessary for the development of the good life, for friendly
relations between the people of the East and of the West and essential to the
peace of the world.”</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the world as a whole, I would say that the gulf between Democratic Socialists
and Liberals is becoming very narrow. In more advanced and educated countries,
there is not very much to divide the Liberals and Socialists any more. You
know, for instance, that <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Woodrow Wyatt, only a few
weeks ago, made the suggestion that the British Labour Party and the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liberal
Party should merge in a common party to oppose the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Conservative
Party. The German Social Democrats are among the leading members of the
Socialist movement in the world. Soon after the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party was formed, I tried to find out where their new programme, which they
published in October or November 1959, about three or four months after ours,
disagreed with ours. It may amuse you to know that practically, right through,
the new German Socialist programme echoed the terms of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party’s Statement of Policy. We took the trouble to publish it as a pamphlet
with the title “Who is outdated?” in parallel columns. </span><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is what the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party said in August 1959: “The party believes that in the field of production,
the free choice of the producer and the consumer must be given a basic place
and importance. In industry, the party believes in the incentives for higher
production and expansion inherent in competitive enterprise, with adequate
safeguards for the protection of <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and against
unreasonable profits, prices and dividends where there is no competition or
where competition has not secured the necessary corrective.” Four months later
in November 1959, this is what the German Social Democrats produced: “The free
choice of consumer goods and services, the free choice of a place to work, free
initiative for employers, are decisive foundations and free competition an
important element of a free economic policy. Totalitarian control of the
economy destroys freedom. The Social Democratic Party therefore <span
class=SpellE>favours</span> a free market wherever free competition really
exists. Where markets come under the domination of individuals or groups,
however, manifold measures are necessary to preserve the freedom of the
economy. As much competition as possible–as much planning as necessary.” </p>

Socialists are moving nearer and nearer the Liberal position. In fact,
communists also are trying to edge away from the collectivist creed. <span
class=SpellE>Djilas</span>, the Yugoslav communist, again in jail for his
insistence on expressing himself, said in his book, <i>The New Class”</i>
“Communism as an ideology has run its course. It does not have any new thing to
reveal to the world.” Because of this fact, in Yugoslavia, in Poland, and even
in Russia, within the limits of party dictatorship and the secret police, we
can see the beginnings of the struggle to edge away from collectivism, to edge
away from the kind of State Capitalism which some people in our country believe
is Socialism. In Britain, the older generation is more socialist than the
younger. This was not so fifty years ago; it was not so twenty years ago. Here
is the division of the present House of Commons in Britain by age groups. You
will see how, as the age goes up, the number of socialists increases and the
number of liberals and conservatives drops. Age group 20-29–the youngest,
Liberal and Conservative 9, Labour 1; 30-39–Conservative and Liberal 52, Labour
18; 40-49–Conservative and Liberal 140, Socialist 55; 50-59–Liberal and
Conservative 118, Socialist 106. Now we come to the older people age group;
60-69–Liberal and Conservative 35, Socialist 75; over 70–Conservative 3 and
Socialist 20. So it is becoming a creed of the old and the out of date. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

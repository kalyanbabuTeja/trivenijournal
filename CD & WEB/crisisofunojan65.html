style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whenever
I think of the United Nations Organisation (UNO), I am reminded of the quaint
Sanskrit phrase <span class=SpellE><i>smasana-vairagya</i></span><i>. </i>It
means the spirit of renunciation which overwhelms a man when watching the dead
body of a near and dear one being burnt to ashes in the burning <span
class=SpellE>ghat</span>. In most cases that spirit passes away sooner or
later, and the man resumes his normal life, until he is faced again with a
similar scene. The U. N. O. and its predecessor, the <st1:place w:st="on">League
 of Nations</st1:place>, owe their origin to similar feelings of nations. The
devastation and massacre, on a huge and unprecedented scale, during the First
World War gave a rude shock to mankind and President Wilson’s description of
it, as the war to end all wars, found a ready response in all quarters. The
result was the <st1:place w:st="on">League of Nations</st1:place>, the covenant
of which was incorporated as a part of the Peace Treaties which ended the<i> </i><span
class=GramE>great war</span>. Its main object was to eliminate war as a means
of settling disputes, though many other humanitarian ideals were added to it.
But the <span class=SpellE><i>smasana-vairagya</i></span><i> </i>did not last
long. The U.S.A. was the first to disown its President’s pet creation, and
though for some time it managed to carryon, the nations of the world resumed
their old world diplomacy, based on pacts and <span class=GramE>alliances</span>,
without much thought of the great organisation which was supposed to replace
them. Big powers like<i> </i><st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>amid
the dins and bustles of the Second World War. This time the holocaust was on a
still greater scale, and men’s minds once more were seized by the spirit of <span
class=SpellE><i>Smasana-vairagya</i></span><i>. </i>When the three victorious
chiefs, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, met at Yalta in February, 1945, and
agreed to destroy German power root and branch, the vindictive spirit could not
smother altogether that of <span class=SpellE><i>smasana-vairagya</i></span><i>

charter for a new League of Nations dedicated to world unity and peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>debate and discussion,
the Conference drew up on 26th June, 1945, the Charter of the United Nations
intended to serve as the framework of a new World Organisation. Its fundamental
objects were: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly
relations among nations on the basis of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples; to achieve international cooperation in the handling of world-wide
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems; and to promote respect
for human rights, dignity and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

we discuss how far these admirable ideals were carried into practice, we must
note the new trend of thought and idealism which this organisation introduced
into the contemporary world. It gave rise to a new faith and hope in the heart
of mankind. The faith grew that perpetual peace is possible and almost within
reach, provided there is good-will among people and they are ready to make
sacrifice for the common good of mankind. War ceased to be looked upon as the
ultimate resort of diplomacy, and instead of force, and resort to war, the
nations chalked out a new line based on mediation, negotiation and
conciliation, to settle disputes among nations. There was also the idea of one
world, in which the weakness of one State is the weakness of all, and the
strength of one–not the military strength but the real strength, the economic
and social strength, the happiness of the people–is indirectly the strength of
all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

than 90 countries and territories, by 1954, had received technical and economic

provided equipment, supplies, and information that by 1953 had benefited 60

loaned to 28 countries by 1953 through the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The International </span><span

(FAO) helped increase farm, fishery, and forest productivity throughout the

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(WHO) fought disease on
all fronts, distributed vast quantities of penicillin and other drugs
(particularly to tropical areas) and fostered effective international
quarantine regulations. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO) undertook to reduce illiteracy, provide vocational
education where needed, and stimulate the world-wide exchange of new
knowledge.” More recently this body has turned its attention to a programme of
publications which would promote better understanding and good-will among the different
peoples of the world; in particular, by emphasizing the contributions to the
cultural and scientific development </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of mankind made by
different nations in different ages and countries. An International Commission
appointed by the UNESCO has recently </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brought out the first
of the projected six-volume history of mankind written on a new plan, in which
emphasis will be laid not on wars and conquests which now fill the pages of
history, but on the peaceful activities which have enabled mankind to make steady
progress from a primitive life<i> </i>to the present state of culture. There
are also the International Labour Organisation and the International Court of
Justice which have rendered splendid service to improve the status of <span

UNO has been steadily expanding these activities. In 1958 more than fifty

record of humanitarian work is merely illustrative and by no means exhaustive
and activities in these and other fields increased with progress of time.
Although, great as they are, they may not be very much when compared with the
immensity of the work that still remains to be done, still nobody can deny that
so far as the non-political work is concerned the UNO has not disappointed the
expectant world. But the same thing cannot be said of its political work. In
this field the high hopes of bringing peace and security to the whole world
were dashed to the ground almost from the very beginning. The UNO Charter was
based on the assumption that the war-time agreement between the three great
powers, <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Great Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> would continue and
give it strength and vitality. But it was not long before <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> not only
held aloof but was the <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of a rival grouping in
the UNO. The atmosphere of 1945 in which originated the UNO Charter was
entirely changed within less than five years, and this accentuated another
great danger to world peace and security. The Charter was signed on 26th June,
1945 and on 6th August of that year the first atomic bomb destroyed <st1:City
w:st="on">Hiroshima</st1:City> in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It was a terrible warning of
the new age which the world had to face. The UNO was alive to the great danger
and made repeated attempts to control the manufacture of atom bombs, but
unfortunately the opposition of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
frustrated all attempts to make this world organisation for peace and security
the sole custodian of this dangerous weapon. The result has been an unchecked
growth of more and more deadly weapons of destruction on a massive scale, and
the peace and security of the world depend today not so much on the UNO but on
the U.S.A. and Russia who had the monopoly of this deadly weapon until towards
the end of October, 1964, China succeeded in manufacturing it. The shadow cast
by this great danger is lengthening every day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

apart from this the record of the UNO as the guarantor of peace and security of
the world has not been very satisfactory. It is true that its interference has
been effective in many cases of a minor nature, but its failure is also writ large

the Communist Government was established in China and Chiang Kai-<span

under the protection of U.S.A., the membership of UNO was granted to this
refugee colony of less than 9 million people and not to the People’s Republic
of China which exercised authority over the 650 million inhabitants of the
mainland of China. This farce of recognizing the homeless wanderer Chiang as
the true representative of China is enacted every year and there is no doubt
that the mainland of China has been kept out of the UNO merely by the pressure
brought to bear upon the other nations by the U.S.A. The most populous nation
in the world is not a member of the UNO and a satellite of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
functions as a permanent member of the Security Council. Its effect was soon
perceived. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> boycotted
the UNO as a protest and <span class=GramE>its</span> indirect, and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s direct, support led to a civil war in <st1:country-region

main reason of these and other failures is that the <span class=SpellE><i>Smasana-vairagya</i></span><i>
</i>of the nations has passed away and the old ideas of power politics among
the big nations have regained their sway. But Russia alone cannot be accused of
this charge. England and France violated the letter and spirit of the UNO
Charter when they wantonly invaded Egypt and bombed its cities in 1956. Our own
country–India–also cannot be absolved from this charge. When China destroyed
the independence and civilisation of Tibet, India did not lift her little
finger and did not even support the motion to bring the case of Tibet before
the UNO. The will-o’-the-wisp of Chinese alliance made India remain a mute
witness of this crime against humanity and thereby sacrifice the fundamental
principles for which the UNO stood. Thus the UNO, instead of being an impartial
organisation for securing peace and justice </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

become more or less a handy instrument for serving national interests in the

and drove away the foreign Portuguese Government, the big Powers of the West
would have passed a vote of censure and probably taken other steps against
India, but for the veto of Russia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In some cases concerning the weaker nations, the
UNO has achieved some success in preventing war, only because of conflicting
interests of bigger powers divided in their sympathy to the rival states. The
UNO Emergency Force succeeded in preventing open collision between Israel and
Egypt. Far more arduous was the undertaking of the UNO to establish peace
between the rival warring factions in Congo, just freed from the yoke of
Belgium. The UNO took upon itself the responsibility for maintaining peace and
security without infringing any internal function of the government. The
magnitude of the task will be apparent from the fact that in September 1960,
16,400 officers and soldiers, supplied by 28 nations, were engaged in Congo operations.
But this expensive military operation could not be carried on because some
nations who were against it for self-interest, but were in a minority in the
General Assembly which sanctioned the military operations, adopted a more
dubious method to nullify the efforts of the UNO, by withholding the payment of
subscriptions due from them according to the rules of the UNO. This point is
not so simple as it appears but has a long history behind it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The UNO exercises its power through a General
Assembly and the Security Council. Each member State is a member of the
Assembly and has only one vote, irrespective of its size or population.
Decisions on important questions require a two-thirds vote; others only a
simple majority. It normally meets only once a year. The Security Council
functions as its Executive body and is always in session. It has five permanent
members (China, a France, the Soviet Union, United Kingdom and the United
States) and six non-permanent members elected by the General Assembly. Decisions
of the Council require seven votes, viz., the votes of all the five permanent
members and two others. This means that the dissent of a single permanent
member means the rejection of the proposal. This clause was inserted because it
was thought just that all the big five powers, on whom would rest the chief
burden of carrying through any military operations, must be in accord before
any arduous work was undertaken and, considering the relation between the five
great powers in 1945 when the Charter was drawn up, it was hoped that they
would always act in accord on all major questions of policy. But the break of
Russia as the head of the communist bloc from the other four permanent members,
created an altogether new situation. This was <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
by the frequent use of the veto power by Russia to thwart all the proposals
which were not to the liking of the communist bloc. The gravity of this danger
was <span class=SpellE>realised</span> when the Security Council decided to
take military action against North Korean forces who had invaded South Korea,
as mentioned above. At that time Russia had boycotted the Council by way of
protest against the selection of Formosa rather than China as the permanent
member of the Security Council, Everybody <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
that had Russia been present in the Council, she would have used her veto to
thwart the project of sending military aid to South Korea, and the whole Korea
overrun by the communist forces of North Korea, would have turned ‘Red’. To
prevent such a catastrophe in the future, powers were given to the veto-less
and more representative General Assembly to deal with similar situations. This
meant that Russia would no longer be able to prevent any such action by its
veto if the General Assembly decides to take it. Russia naturally grew furious
and found a way out of the difficulty. The Congo military operations were
sanctioned by the General Assembly and not the Security Council, and Russia
maintained that she was not bound to pay her share of the expenses for an
undertaking to which she was opposed. This introduced a dangerous principle.
The example of Russia was followed by other nations, with the result that by
1963, 60 nations owed UNO 106 million dollars in unpaid assessment, largely
though not wholly, for the support of peace-keeping operations. (According to
latest reports U.S.A. has also decided not to pay its usual 40 per cent
contribution–<i>Ed</i>.) At the present moment the UNO is faced with this grave
crisis. It has brought into prominence another grave danger, viz., the division
of the UNO into groups as in a rigid party system, so that it is not very
difficult to forecast the casting of votes on any important question. This
takes away the very foundation on which the UNO was built and which alone can
guarantee that sense of equity and justice without which such an international
organisation cannot survive as a useful institution.</p>

was half past ten on a November morning. The sun shone brightly in a spotless
blue sky. Suburban trains arrived every five minutes as usual at the Churchgate
station, and disgorged loads of humanity. These hurrying crowds, coming out of
the terminal station, which usually flowed through the wide street leading to
the offices and firms and shops round about the Flora Fountain, did not,
however, today take the usual course. Instead, they surged through the opposite
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Nariman Road</st1:address></st1:Street>
leading to the Brabourne Stadium and further down to the sea face. <span
class=GramE>Men and women of all ages and descriptions thronged into this wide
road, pushing, rushing, hurrying, halting, crying and yelling.</span> All of
them seemed to be in a tremendous hurry, impatient and eager. The second Test
Match between <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and a visiting team was being played at the Brabourne Stadium, and people of
all kinds and classes moved by a strange frenzy, were seen running towards the
gates of the Stadium. It was indeed a mad crowd. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stood on the pavement in front of a big restaurant, watching the streams of
humanity rushing past him. He looked like a tramp, his body barely covered by
dirty clothes, his eyes haggard and red, his face unclean and unshaven, his
hair unwashed and uncombed. Standing on the pavement at the corner of the road,
he watched the strange traffic of humanity all around <span class=GramE>him,</span>
Well-dressed men came out of the restaurant and started running towards the
Stadium. Crowds rushing like flood water from the arches of the Churchgate
station passed across his gaze like eddies and currents. Vendors of wafers and
bananas and betel-leaf and cigarettes sent up shrill voices. People asked one
another about the latest score. The whole scene around him was full of hectic
hurry and noise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the men and women marching past Kashinath, memories of the past rushed across

‘Asiatic’. He had been a fi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rst class cricketer in his high school
days. He had captained his team and led it to victory and won the championship
shield. Time and again he had played a veritable captain’s innings, and people
had predicted that young Kashinath would become famous as a cricketer. He too
had harboured the great ambition of playing for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> one day on the C. C. I.
wicket. But this dream of his had remained unfulfilled. Life had shown him
little kindness. He had suddenly lost his father, and he had been obliged to
leave his school and make a living by following his family profession of
carpentry….These memories made him sad and bitter. He wanted to shout at the
crowd, ‘You fools, I know cricket much more than any of you! I love the game
more than any of you! I too wish to buy a ticket and get into the ground and
see this Test! I am dying to do so. But….but….’ He dug both his hands in the
pockets of his dirty coat. There was a tattered rag of a handkerchief in one of
the two pockets, and in the other were a few cheap country Bidis and an almost
empty match box. The cheapest seat in the Stadium stands cost two rupees! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Test was bound to be most exciting. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s most popular batsman Bihari
was in wonderful form. He was expected to score a century as he had done in the
first Delhi Test. This was indeed going to be a great struggle worth going
hundreds of miles to watch. Tens of thousands of people were rushing like mad
men towards the grounds. But did these idiots know how to hold a bat–these
fat–bellied men, chewing betel-leaf, and these decorated dolls of ugly girls,
who ran past Kashinath? <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Worms</st1:place></st1:City>–who
knew nothing of cricket! Kashinath felt a surge of bitterness filling his
heart. He was a cricketer. He loved the game. But he was jobless! He had not a
penny in his pocket. He could not purchase a ticket unless he pinched
somebody’s pocket! Unless he turned a thief! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

gave a little start at the thought. Thief! He had never committed theft. While
hunting for a job and starving he had often thought of turning a thief. Why not
commit a theft and go to jail, he had asked himself. They would give him food
and clothes. But that idea had not appealed to his educated and cultured mind.
He had never committed theft. The thought of pinching somebody’s pocket,
therefore, shocked him….But only for a moment. He asked himself, why not<span
class=GramE>?...</span>Why shouldn’t I steal?….All around him there were
shouts: ‘How many runs?’, How many wickets?’ and ‘How many
tickets?’...Kashinath’s mind shouted, ‘Why shouldn’t I steal?’ <span
class=GramE>‘Why not?’</span> He began to watch, the people stampeding past him
with a different eye. He began to calculate whose pocket was assailable with
the greatest safety to <span class=GramE>himself</span>. His heart pounded with
the thought of doing a thing which he had never done. But his eyes sparkled
with the intention to steal. Kashinath was about to faint under the tension of
his inward struggle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

him. Kashinath saw one of the girls swinging a purse. He looked hard at the
purse. It assumed as large a size in his eyes that there was nothing else left
for his eyes to see, and he thought that with each swing the purse asked ‘Why
not?’ <span class=GramE>‘Why not?’</span> Kashinath’s eyes bulged….the next
instant he jumped forward. His hands grabbed. He captured the white purse. And
then he bolted. <span class=GramE>‘Help!</span> Help! <span class=GramE>Thief!’</span>–He
heard the girl’s cries from a distance. But he ran like a mad man–like a man

all a flippant, irresponsible, pleasure-loving, gay, young student in some
college. But how mistaken had he been. She was a good and a kind girl, wanting
to help her father–loving her mother! Industrious, honest, loving! As he wiped
his eyes, he had wished to run back and find the girl out and to return the
purse….But a waiter was standing before him and asking him what he wanted. That
changed the direction of his thoughts. He ordered a good meal. After leaving

and bat. He was about to ask his neighbour about it when he heard a girl
shouting at another “Shanta! Shanta! Do you know that…<span class=GramE>.</span>”
He startled. Shanta! Did it mean that the girl whose purse he had rifled was
seated near him? He looked stealthily at the girl sitting to his left. He could
easily identify the dark girl. He had stolen her money! And he was now sitting
next to her! Her money was in his pocket! Her powder box, her lipstick and so
also the moving letter which her loving father had written to her! What were
the thoughts running at this moment through the poor girl’s mind? Did she think
of her<b> </b>mother? Did she want to send more money to her father? Did she
need the money for herself? Kashinath thought–“But no,” he said to himself! He
mustn’t think of anything. Goodbye to all kind and good thoughts! Goodbye to
honesty! Life is such that you must be hard-hearted and cruel, unless you were
prepared to perish! He flung aside the weakness that was about to envelope him.

you very much” Kashinath said. ‘I deserve to be shot down’, he told himself. He
put the field glasses on, but he had no wish to adjust the focus. Instead of
looking through the binocular, he was lost in his own bitter thoughts…..‘Why

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the days when he had gone through the agonies
of unemployment and penury, he had often thought of ending his own life. He had
often wanted to fling away from his shoulders the burden of life–the unbearable
painful burden of living! The binocular was on his eyes. But he did not see
anything. He was deciding in himself that he would rest himself completely after
returning from this match. <span class=GramE>Enough of this struggle.</span>
What sense was there in carrying this burden of life, struggling to keep
himself alive, starving, running from place to place, trying to be good, trying
not to tarnish the good name of his father? This strange tyranny of life! This
queer burden of life! He had carried this burden on his head for quite a long
time! Enough of this joke!….After returning from this match he would end….</p>

see Bihari almost as if he was sitting in front of me here. He kept looking.
Yes, there he was–Bihari, the darling of the crowds. Two or three young girls,
wearing bright-coloured ‘sarees’ were bending before Bihari and asking for his
autograph. Bihari was making some joke, and grinning. Kashinath kept looking at
that charming picture of the great cricketer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

girls skipped off like gazels after they had secured Bihari’s autograph. Bihari
was left to himself. His bat rested in between his knees. His batting gloves
were put around the handle of the bat. He was waiting for his turn. As soon as
this wicket fell, he would get up, and pick up his bat and gloves, and walk
with slow steps towards the wicket. Fifty thousand people would send up loud
cheers of applause as soon as they saw him. “Buck up, Bihari!” “Come on Bihari!

it was exactly this of which Bihari himself had got tried. He was inwardly
groaning under this strange burden of popularity and responsibility! He wanted
to look hard at the play going on in the middle, since his turn was due. He
must study the swing and direction of the balls. He must decide how to face the
bowling. He must watch each ball very carefully. But his heart rebelled against
this strain. How he wished close his eyes, and stretch his limbs and go to sleep!
He was tired! Very very tired! He had no strength left to walk the road to
fame! He wished that this road would some day come to an end. “When did I take
to this road”, he asked “When? Why? How?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

remembered things–some clearly, some dimly. He had never been fond of books in
his high school days. But the Prince of a State, wanting to strengthen his
team, had picked him up when he was just a lad, and made him play big cricket.
He soon came to be recognized as a rising star on the horizon of Indian cricket.
Fate had decided the mission of his life. Cricketer! Cricket ! He had gone to
England and Australia, broken several records, and now he was considered the
backbone of India’s. Match after match, he had to carry his side on his
shoulders. He had to remember that his side would score only if he played well,
and would collapse miserably if he lost his wicket cheaply. His popularity had
gone on increasing. And with popularity his responsibility too. He had carried
this double burden on his shoulders endlessly. This tyranny of retaining his
own fame and bringing more and more glory to India! He had to play first class
cricket almost all the year round. When the Indian season was over, he went to
England to play the Lancashire League Matches. When the English season was
over, he returned to India and played the Tests. India! Lancashire! India
again! Struggle for runs! Struggle for wickets! Struggle for averages! Unending
struggle! He had never had an occasion to play freely and to enjoy himself! He
didn’t even have time to be ill and to lie in bed….He must live up to his name!
He must carry the burden on his shoulders without respite, without complaint. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sudha had begun just when his career as a fine cricketer had started. His life
as a husband had synchronized with his life as a responsible and famous player.
He loved Sudha. He had spotted her on the occasion of a friend’s marriage. He
had liked her immensely. He had wooed her, and married her. Even today she was
just the young girl who had fascinated him. Fair, delicate–a charming little

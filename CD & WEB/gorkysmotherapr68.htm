before the emergence of Maxim Gorky in the literary arena of Russia, the
Russian literature of the 19th century was, as Gorky himself has written, “ever
strong in its democratic feeling, its passionate striving to find a solution
for our social problems, its advocacy of humanity, its praise of liberty, its
deep interest in the life of the common people, its lofty attitude towards
women, its indefatigable searching for some universal, all-illuminating truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City> took
legitimate pride in this noble literary heritage of his fatherland and absorbed
all these traditional traits into his own works, he did not remain a mere
successor to this cultural wealth, but wanted to add something and to enrich
this heritage with new values so far unknown in the realm of Russian
literature. Thus he <span class=GramE>innovated</span> new aesthetic and
literary values in the course of his unending quest for truth and reality and
opened a new chapter in the history of Russian literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
he had said in his paper read at the First All-Union Congress of Soviet
Writers, “the basic theme of 19th century European and Russian literature was
the human personality in its conflicts with society, the state and nature.”
Although this kind of literary productions were realistic in criticizing the
prevailing social condition and in exposing its imperfections, Gorky believed
that such a kind of realism had neither served nor could ever serve to educate
those who stand for socialistic ideals, because this kind of realism, although
it <span class=SpellE>criticised</span> everything, had never made a positive
contribution and, in some cases, had even come to approve of what it had
previously criticized. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

even though such realistic works portrayed rebels who criticized the society of
their time, the motives of such criticism of the existing order of things did
not arise out of a profound and correct conception of social and economic laws
and causes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

started writing his first novels is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>end of the 90’s of the
last century. His first novel <span class=SpellE><i>Foma</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Gordeyev</span> </i>came out in book form in 1900 and his next
one, <i>The Three </i>in the year 1901. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

these two novels we find <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>
as a realist, a critical realist. In <span class=SpellE><i>Foma</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Gordeyev</span></i>, the hero who is an energetic person rising
against the moral principles of his own class, the merchants, wants to get away
from his class, but becomes disillusioned because of his impotent protest. His
dream of a free and independent life becomes frustrated. Again in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>’s second novel, <i>The
Three</i> the young hero <span class=SpellE>Ilya</span> <span class=SpellE>Lunev</span>,
who tries to make his way in life to win a position in society, ends in
frustration and meets a tragic death. In both these novels, we find individual
rebels who vehemently protest against the ills of the existing order of things
and who <span class=GramE>strive</span> their best to break out of their own
social environment. But despite their strong and passionate protests, they do
not see the way out to change the society. Being cut off from the vanguard of
the people, they are not able to see any positive path before them and so they
meet their inevitable tragic end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
doubt, these two novels of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>
present him before us only as a critical realist. But, at the same time, we
find <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>
definitely differing from the critical realists of his days. His heroes remain
rebels to the last and they never reconcile or compromise themselves with the
existing order of things or with their own class. Because <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City> had established contacts with Marxist
circles of his day and had seen for himself how people lived, and had understood
the spirit of his own people even before the publication of these two novels.
Therefore, he was fully aware of the fact that the time was not far off when a
new force, the proletariat would join the social struggle and would play the
role of the vanguard. This awareness of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>
had already been reflected in his earlier writings, in which he had expressed,
in his own way, the beginning of this new phase, the active and militant mood
of the vanguard of the people preparing for a battle. Moreover, we find that
Gorky himself was arrested more than once by the authorities accusing him of
participation in revolutionary activities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
<span class=GramE>came</span> the first Russian Revolution of the years
1905-1907. In this Revolution, Gorky realized the tremendous force of the
people who defined the Czarist rule and this revolution was really a rehearsal
for the victorious one which was yet to come, for it became apparent after this
revolution that the one and the only consistent fighter for the liberation of
the working people and of the entire mankind will be the proletariat. Gorky
himself wrote about this revolution later like this: “Our people had made an
elemental but mighty effort to free their hands and unseal their lips. This
effort was unsuccessful. Yet, it should be considered most valuable because it
was the first concerted effort made by our whole people in all our history.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Following
this great event in the history of the Russian people, Gorky finished his most
popular and powerful novel, <i>Mother. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
contrast to his above-mentioned earlier novels of the 90’s Gorky had found a
new relationship between the individual and society. In his novel, <i>Mother, </i>the
conflicts were no longer mere clashes between individuals driven by their own
limited interests, but were struggles of the people for the basic objectives
and ideals of a noble life. Thus we find, for the first time in the history of
literature of the entire world, no single individual revolting against the
existing order of things and its evils, but the entire working people rising
against the social system and the state which deprives them of their rights and
a good life. Therefore, we find in Gorky’s <i>Mother </i>that the main hero of
the novel is the people and that the basic action of the story is the
historical activity of the people, who under the leadership of the party of the
working class, armed with the indomitable weapon of the most advanced theory,
undertake the decisive battle for emancipation. In this novel, Gorky vividly
describes the types of men and women who combine the correct understanding of
the historical process and the aims of the people, with the ability to fight
for the acceleration of this process and the achievement of these aims in
practice. They are fully confident that a new world will come into existence in
the near future and this confidence is reflected in the words of one of its
heroes. He says that, “the time will come when people will wonder at their own
beauty, when each will be like a star to all others. The earth will be peopled
with free men, great their freedom. The hearts of all will be open, and every
heart will be innocent of envy and malice. Then life will be transformed into
the great service of man and man will have become something fine and exalted,
for all things are attainable to those who are free. Then people will live in
truth and freedom for the sake of beauty, and the best people will be
accounted, those whose hearts most capable of embracing the world and of loving
it, those who are most free, for in them lies the greatest beauty. They will be
great people, those of the new life.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>colourful</span> and heart-warming picture of the world to
come does not in any way seem to be an Utopia, for Gorky unfolds before our
very eyes of reason and understanding, the concrete development of the awakened
masses and the role played by them in the inevitable historical conflict, in
the most convincing method </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of any idle romanticist, but a goal at
sight yet to be reached by the active participants who are advancing on the
path of revolution, making the history of their own. After reading this great
novel, we become fully convinced that the development of this living process of
human history has been shown with such clarity and conviction by no other
writer except Gorky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
this portrayal of the social activity based on socialist principles, which
Gorky has drawn in his novel, has made him as the genuine exponent of the
revolutionary rebirth of the world and has won for him the <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
and privilege of being the founder of socialist realism in literature. Thus
this great masterpiece of Maxim Gorky has set itself not only as an example to
the Soviet writers of his times but has also served as a literary manifesto for
the writers of the entire world, who are striving to help the struggle for the
establishment of universal justice on earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a known fact that the Russian Revolution of the year 1905 gave an impetus to
the peoples of the East in their struggle to overthrow autocracy and alien rule
and that our national movement also took a militant turn in the first decade of
this century, inspired by the example of the Russian workers. Likewise, Gorky’s
<i>Mother, </i>which came out in the year of 1906 following the First Russian
Revolution, has also played a decisive role in shaping the literary outlook of
many Indian writers in the years of struggle for our independence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
can definitely say that it was Gorky who taught us what real humanism is. We
all know that Gorky was a great humanist. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But his humanism was
not of the type of his predecessors. It was something entirely different. His
love for mankind is not merely </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a humanitarian sympathy which sheds
helpless tears for the oppressed and the humiliated. Neither was it the
philanthropy which the sophisticated well-to-do’s show towards those who have
fallen low because of the so-called fate. Humanitarians and philanthropists of
this kind do not consider these fallen ones as men but treat them only as
two-legged creatures, which are in need of some comfort and solace. Gorky never
considered this kind of impotent sympathy which does not raise even a single
finger against the existing evils of society, as humanism. Real humanism does
not shed tears for the people who are suffering, but it really serves as a
source of indignant inspiration to shed even the blood to the cause of the
well-being of all mankind. Therefore, Gorky’s humanism was of a militant type
which not only abhorred human suffering but also strove to abolish it. Gorky
considered human suffering as the world’s shame and wanted that we must learn
to hate it and strive to abolish it. This is the humanism, the militant and
socialist humanism which we all have learnt from Gorky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Moreover,
it was Gorky who taught us by his very life and his writings that writers
should mix with the people and write about what is concerned with the lives of
men and women in a world which is changing and being changed. A writer must be
intimately concerned with this change. He must be always struggling to
understand it. His writing must reflect his experience of this change and his
understanding of his experience. And since this change is world-wide and is
taking place on innumerable levels at once and all the time, he may experience
some difficulty. Yet this difficulty excuses none of the writers for retreating
into a world made artificially static, by excluding from it all the factors of
change which are found in the real world. And, therefore, writers who strive
for real humanistic ideals should not be mere onlookers of the struggle waged
by people for the welfare of mankind, but should become active participants as
one among them in fulfilling the historic task of their struggles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

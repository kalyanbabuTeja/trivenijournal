w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> for many
centuries before what may be called the modern age. Several empires held sway
over large parts of this country and for very long periods. Administration of
justice was necessarily an integral part of governmental functions, and it
would appear that, by and large, the requirements of justice were satisfied, no
doubt in varying degrees, but, on the whole, comparable in their effectiveness
to systems prevailing at the time in other parts of the <span class=SpellE>civilised</span>
world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to the Hindu <span class=SpellE>Dharmasastras</span> and works on Hindu Polity
there were Courts and Judges, the King in person representing the apex of the
system, though even he was not placed above the law. Under the <span
class=SpellE>Moghuls</span> also the ruler was the highest judicial authority.
It is the <span class=SpellE>Muhammadan</span> system of jurisprudence and
judicial administration that was prevailing over the larger part of this
country when the British began to build their empire here, though <span
class=GramE>the</span> Hindu system also was in operation in sizable areas and,
even in areas under the sovereignty of <span class=SpellE>Muhammadan</span>
rulers, their system accommodated the functioning of Hindu rules of law to a
limited extent. I do not propose, however, to dwell on these systems, since the
judicial administration of today is principally a product of British rule, and
represents a total departure from the systems previously prevailing, except in
regard to what may be called the personal law of Hindus and <span class=SpellE>Muhammadans</span>,
viz., the law governing succession, inheritance, marriage, maintenance and
guardianship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
is well known, the British began to exercise governmental powers in the three
Presidency towns of <st1:City w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City>
and <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>, and Courts were established there,
which functioned in the same manner as the High Court in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Later
on, the East India Company, which was the instrument of British domination in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, acquired the <span class=SpellE>Dewani</span>
of Bengal, <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place> and Orissa, which virtually
meant the right and responsibility of administering that territory. In the
Courts functioning in these areas the law administered was the law then
prevailing in this country. Similar appears to have been the position in other
areas acquired by the British. Ultimately, when the British Sovereign took over
the administration of the country into her own hands from the East India
Company after the rebellion of 1857, High Courts were established at Calcutta,
Madras and Bombay, which, together, had jurisdiction over the whole area
occupied by the British. These High Courts continued to exercise original
jurisdiction in respect of the Presidency towns, while they functioned as the
highest appellate Courts in respect of the whole territory under their
respective jurisdictions. By this time the British Courts had been functioning
in the Presidency towns for over a century and had brought with them English
traditions and the English Common Law. Their main features were the
independence of the judiciary and strict impartiality, not only between man and
man but between those in authority and the subjects. These characteristics
manifested themselves markedly even in the functioning of the earlier Courts, Recorders’
Courts, Mayoral Courts and the Supreme Courts. There are instances of the
Courts in <st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City> asserting the supremacy of the
judicial process over the executive, and, when the latter failed to obey the
Court’s writs, the Judges brought the Courts to a standstill rather than allow
the executive to show disrespect. It is significant to notice that in some of
those instances such assertion of judicial independence was made in vindication
of the rights of Indians as against the British who were in authority. The High
Courts which, as I have mentioned above, were established in 1862 inherited and
continued those traditions, with this difference that their sway extended over
all the areas under British rule. I may also mention that one of the significant
landmarks in the history of the Calcutta High Court is a case in which the
first Chief Justice of that High Court, Sir Barnes Peacock, punished a
high-placed countryman of his for contempt of Court and in vindication of the <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> of an Indian colleague of his, Justice <span
class=SpellE>Dwarkanath</span> <span class=SpellE>Mittar</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
should at this juncture mention that, while in other fields of administration
it took many years for Indians to attain high positions, Indians were appointed
as Judges of the High Courts almost from the commencement. Their number was
very small and increased only with slow gradualness. They were men of high
distinction and acquitted themselves in the discharge of their duties in the
highest traditions of the Bench. They made a significant contribution to the development
of law in this country. In addition to being well versed in the customary law
of this country, they displayed a mastery of the British system of law as also
of the Continental systems. It may also be mentioned with special emphasis that
no distinction was ever allowed to be made between Indian and British Judges,
and it stands to their credit that, during the whole period of British rule,
all the High Courts, by and large, maintained the independence of the
judiciary. This is a matter of high importance, since it was quite possible for
the British Judges to have functioned on the basis that they were here to aid,
the consolidation of British power, and acted in promotion of that aim. But
many of them were Barristers of distinction and could not think of acting in
any other manner than in conformity with the tradition in which they were
brought up. This naturally influenced all their colleagues, many of whom came
from the Civil </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Service. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Indian Judges who came from the Bar were brought up in the same tradition,
since the Bar which developed in this country patterned itself after the
British model. This tradition of independence established and built up by the
British Judges, it seems to me, was the crucial factor in establishing the
virtually impregnable position of the High Courts in this country. Many of
these Judges were men of great legal ability and insight. Since, along with
other features of the British Judicial system, the theory of precedent is a
part of the jurisprudence of this country, the decisions given by Judges of
this period are of seminal importance and are worthy of close study even today.
I think it is appropriate to mention here that exactly a hundred years have
elapsed since the establishment of these Presidency High Courts. The <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> and Calcutta High
Courts celebrated their Centenaries a short while ago and the Madras High Court
will celebrate its Centenary on the 6th of next month. These are undoubtedly
historic events worthy of commemoration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Judges and Courts have to administer the law of the
land and, however competent and independent the Judges may be, the system of
law is equally important. Prior to the time of the establishment of the three
High Courts, the body of law in operation in this country was a welter of confusion.
As I have already mentioned earlier, the <span class=SpellE>mofussil</span>
Courts, i.e., the Courts outside the Presidency towns, purported to administer
the <span class=SpellE>Muhammadan</span> law and the Hindu law pertaining to
all matters. These did not lend themselves to the degree of precise treatment
to which we of today are accustomed. To some extent these were modified and
supplemented by laws or regulations, as they were called, promulgated by the
three Governments at <st1:City w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City>
and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>.
There was no uniformity amongst these regulations. The task of <span
class=SpellE>rationalising</span> the position occupied the attention of the
authorities both here and in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and three successive Law Commissions were appointed for the purpose. They did
remarkably good work. The first fruit of their <span class=SpellE>labours</span>
was the Indian Penal Code which gave statutory form to the Common Law of
England relating to crimes, with some modifications to suit the conditions of
this country. It is a remarkable piece of work and has stood the test of time
and has been adopted as the basis in other countries too. Not only did it <span
class=SpellE>humanise</span> the archaic and harsh laws in operation in this
country, but it represented some improvement even over the English Common Law.
The other important products of the <span class=SpellE>labours</span> of the
Law Commissions were the Law of the Transfer of Property and the Indian
Contract Act. While the former did not incorporate the more technical features
of the English law relating to real property, it reflected the basic
principles. The Contract Act gave statutory form to the Common Law principles
of the Law of Contracts with suitable modifications. As, to some extent,
commerce, both national and international, had developed in this country, the
Negotiable Instruments Act also was promulgated. On the procedural side, the
Civil Procedure Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, the Evidence Act and the
Limitation Act were also drafted and promulgated. These also were largely based
upon the system in operation in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
All these enactments resulted in the creation of a uniform body of substantive
and procedural law operative over the length and breadth of the land and
greatly conduced to the process of integration in the administration of law.
This process was furthered by the circumstance that the highest Court of appeal
was the Privy Council, which, by its decisions, brought about unity in the
interpretation of the various questions of law it had to deal with. Tribute
must be paid at this stage to the admirable way in which the Privy Council
performed its functions. It has left us a legacy of case-law which continues to
be an invaluable aid to the administration of justice in this country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is no doubt true that the above-mentioned body of law was, technically
speaking, in operation only in that part of the country which was known as
British India and not in the Indian States, i.e., the principalities under
Indian Rulers. These Rulers enjoyed internal sovereignty. But these States also
were influenced to a greater or less extent by what was happening in British
India in this field. Many States promulgated corresponding laws almost in
identical terms, though in several of the States archaic laws continued to be
in operation in some measure. There was a great variation amongst these States
in the functioning of the judicial organ of Government. While in some States
the judiciary functioned with much the same efficiency, integrity and
independence as in British India, in some States arbitrary rule continued to
hold sway. Thus, by the time India attained Independence, it may be stated
that, in a very substantial measure, a judicial system firmly rooted in British
traditions was functioning and administering laws derived from principles
governing the English Common Law. But one significant feature came into
existence, which represented a departure from the British system, even prior to
Independence. That was the result of what may be roughly called the Federal
set-up of the Government of the country under the Government of India Act of
1935. Under this Act a Government which had been mainly unitary became mainly
federal with the attendant division of powers between the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
and the Units. Accordingly the Federal Court of India was ushered into
existence. But the Federal Constitution operated only in respect of the British
Indian part of India, as the Indian States under the rulers did not join the
federation. The Federal Court, therefore, functioned only in respect of British
India. After the Indian Independence Act was passed by the British Parliament,
India became a Dominion on August 15, 1947. Britain ceased to have anything to
do with the governance of this country and the Privy Council ceased to have
jurisdiction over the Courts of this country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was the position in regard to law and administration of justice when the Indian
Constituent Assembly set its hands to framing the Constitution. Several
alternatives were open to the framers of the Constitution in regard to its form
and content. They could have started with a clean slate making a complete break
with the past and brought into existence a brand new Constitution incorporating
the best features of other systems and improving on them. They, however, took
the wise course of incorporating in the Constitution all that was best in the
existing system. It is not my purpose here to deal at length with all the
features of our Constitution, but to confine my attention to the judicial limb.
It is well known that the Constitution is substantially federal in structure
and based on the parliamentary system of Government both in the <span
class=SpellE>Centre</span> and in the States. The President in the <span
class=SpellE>Centre</span> and the Governors in the States occupy the position
of constitutional heads. The ministries, both at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
and in the States, are responsible to the respective Legislatures. Thus, we do
not have division of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Powers between the executive and the
legislature, of the pattern that exists in the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>United States.
I have already mentioned that our Federation is one artificially created over a
pre-existing Unitary structure. In other words, we did not start with a number
of independent States which yielded part of their sovereignty to a Union
Government in the general interest. The federal structure was imposed by the
Government of India Act, 1935, over the pre-existing Unitary Government. We do
not, therefore, find each State having its own Constitution. The one
Constitution is the constituent law both for the Union and for the States. The
residuary power </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>remains with the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>.
This, however, is not a matter of crucial importance since the topics are
almost exhaustively enumerated </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and allocated and, in addition to a State
List and a Union List, there is also a list of concurrent subjects. The
allocation of powers implies the need for a tribunal to decide in the event of
dispute. That function is performed by the High Courts and the Supreme Court.
It is a distinguishing feature of the judicial system under our Constitution
that, unlike in the United States Constitution, we do not have two hierarchies
of Courts–Federal Courts and the State Courts. All the Courts have jurisdiction
over all <span class=SpellE>justiciable</span> matters excepting those which
are withdrawn by the appropriate legislatures from the purview of the ordinary
Courts and entrusted to administrative tribunals. We thus have an integrated
judicial system for the whole country, though in a sense the High Court of a
State and the Courts subordinate to it are an integral part of the governmental
machinery of each State. It may, therefore, be stated that the High Court of
each State combines in itself, in terms of what obtains in the United States,
the functions of the State Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit Court of
Appeals. The Supreme Court of India is the highest appellate Court not only in
regard to federal and constitutional matters, but in respect of all <span
class=SpellE>justiciable</span> matters. In functioning in this manner its
powers are more or less like those exercised by the Privy Council. If we regard
each of these Courts as really consisting of two courts–one exercising
jurisdiction in respect of state subjects, and the other in respect of federal subjects–it
would be seen that, in principle, the judicial system here is analogous to what
obtains in the United States. But there is one other matter of signal
importance to which reference must be made. It is that our Constitution
contains provisions for safeguarding the Fundamental Rights of citizens, like
freedom of speech, free association, freedom of life and liberty, freedom to
exercise one’s profession, freedom of movement, freedom to reside anywhere in
the country and freedom in relation to property rights. All these freedoms are
subject to certain qualifications in the public interest, such qualifications
being greatest in respect of the last-mentioned right. The High Courts and the
Supreme Court are made the guardians of these rights. This matter was regarded
by the framers of the Constitution as of such vital importance that they
provided for direct access to the Supreme Court in regard to these Fundamental
Rights. I should not fail to add that these provisions are generally derived
from the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution. It will thus be seen
that full recognition is given to Courts performing the essential task of

order that the judiciary may function with the requisite independence, the
Constitution provides for the fixity of the tenure of the Judges of the High
Courts and of<i> </i>the Supreme Court. They cannot be removed except by an
address to Parliament. There are no elective appointments to any Courts, nor do
such appointments require the confirmation of any Legislative body or
committee. As far as the Subordinate Judiciary is concerned, the general
pattern is that we have Civil Courts at three levels and Criminal Courts at two
levels. This is, by and large, the position over the whole country. By way of,
illustration, I may give the position in this State. We have, at the lowest
level, Courts of <span class=SpellE>Munsiffs</span>, whose territorial
jurisdiction extends over some two or three thousand square miles and whose
pecuniary jurisdiction is of the order of about <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>.
5,000. At the next level we have Subordinate Judges’ Courts, which deal with
original Civil work of larger magnitude, and, generally speaking, over the
territorial areas of the revenue districts. Many of these exercise appellate
powers also. At the next level we have District Courts, which are the principal
Courts of original jurisdiction in the District and with unlimited pecuniary
jurisdiction. They also function as Courts of appeal in respect of the
decisions of the Courts subordinate to them. On the Criminal side, the
Magistrates Courts are of the lowest denomination and deal with offences which
may roughly be described as corresponding to <span class=SpellE>misdemeanours</span>.
They also conduct preliminary enquiry into felonies and commit the accused in
such cases for trial in the Sessions Court if a <i>prima facie </i>case is made
out. The Court of Session is the Principal Court for the trial of felonies. It.
is generally the District Judge who also functions as the Sessions Judge for
the District. The Sessions Judge also exercises appellate powers over the
decisions of the Magistrates. Sessions Judges also are aided by Additional and
Asst. Sessions Judges. We have no grand Jury system hero and even the Jury
system is not regarded as having been much of a success. In the opinion of the
recent Law Commission it has not taken root in the soil. I should add that
juries have not functioned in this country in regard to Civil matters at any
time. It will thus be noticed that the position in regard to juries here is in
striking contrast to the dominant part played by them in the United States. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the old days a large proportion of Judges were service-men. But for some
decades past, judicial officers at all levels are being recruited from the Bar.
This does not, however, apply to several States in this country, where complete
separation of the judiciary and the executive has not taken place. This
statement may need some explanation. The administration of criminal law under
British rule was largely in the hands of executive officers who, along with
their executive functions, also tried cases as Magistrates. The executive head
of the District was also the District Magistrate. He was the head of the
District Police. This naturally led to continued agitation for the separation
of the executive from the judiciary. This goal of separation finds a place as
one of the Directive Principles of our Constitution. The enlarged activities of
the modern State as a welfare State have brought into being a large number of
administrative tribunals. While ordinary Civil Courts are barred from dealing
with such matters, the High Courts have been entrusted with supervisory
jurisdiction over the functioning of all administrative tribunals and the
Supreme Court is also empowered to review their decisions. These provisions
were introduced as a check against the tendencies ordinarily displayed by
administrative tribunals. We have no family Courts in this country. Special
provisions for dealing with juvenile offenders have, no doubt, been brought on
the Statute Book, but the functioning of these Courts and the rehabilitation of
such offenders is yet in a rudimentary stage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

procedure in the Courts and the functioning of Judges in this country, like the
content of the body of laws, is based on the Anglo-Saxon system. In other
words, the system that prevails is the adversary system and not the
inquisitorial one that is said to <span class=SpellE>characterise</span> the
Continental systems. In the proceedings of the Courts, the Judge plays the part
of an umpire and is above the din and dust of controversy, leaving it to the
opposing counsel to lay bare all aspects of factual and legal issues. This does
not mean that the Judge’s part is negative in any sense. The effective control
of the proceedings is in his hands. But the lawyers play a vital role and are
indeed regarded as officers of the Court. It would be no exaggeration to say
that the generally satisfactory character of the decisions could not be
achieved without the part played by the lawyers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

shall say a few words about the Bar in this country. Except in the cities of
Calcutta and Bombay, the position of lawyers here corresponds more to that in
the United States than in England. We have no dual system here. The lawyer both
acts and pleads. There were satisfactory Bar Councils attached to each High
Court. Recently the Advocates Act was passed by Parliament to integrate the Bar
of the whole country. Under its provisions, there are to be Bar Councils in the
States and an All-India Bar Council at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>.
The structure of this organisation is federal in character. The scheme is to
make the Bar an autonomous body. The Bar also has built up high traditions all
over the country. This country has produced many great advocates. But the Bar’s
part has not been confined to the legal field. They have been in the forefront
of the public life of this country and the large majority of our national
leaders came from the ranks of the Bar. They have all along been the stoutest
champions of the liberty of the citizens. In addition to the Statutory
Councils, everywhere there are Bar Associations which have been functioning
vigorously in promoting the interests of the profession and maintaining its
high standard. Recently an All-India Bar Federation has come into existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

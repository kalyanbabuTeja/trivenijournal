are told in the Christian Scriptures that once a Great Battle was to be fought

believe it or not, it stood still! The Great Battle was fought to the finish,
showing the unruly wicked party that nothing could be gained by the show of
evil. Good triumphs always in the end, though it does not seem to be so in the
beginning. We have the great story or Leo Tolstoi. A good man came to harm and
was even imprisoned for a long time. One day the culprit was also in the same
prison (and he came to it very much later than he should have done) and asked
forgiveness of the good man. The story is <i>God sees the Truth, but waits to

today seems different, so different that we seem strangers on this planet. The
immovability of life, the constancy that was ours, is gone never more to
return. We see but do not understand and we wonder what life is all about.
Where are the people, places and things we saw and knew and understood? Where
are all the old memorable things, including monuments and huge buildings and
forts? Where are the untilled lands that spread for miles, and the places where
we laughed and romped about and went on horse or donkey rides? Where are the
smiling faces that made life a thing of wonder and meaning? Where are the
talkers who talked on till late in the night and whose talks were a pleasure to
hear? Where are the big matronly women who would come at any emergency and
squash all troubles? Those were the days when men, even big-made men with power
and influence, quailed before one or more of these matronly-looking women who
were indeed ladies to their finger tips. They understood much, though they said
little. They looked harsh, even fierce, but they were the last word for softness,
sympathy. There was nothing they’d not do, from coming to soothen a bereaved
family in the middle of the night, to looking after children that were not theirs
but who were in their keeping for one reason or another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all’s so changed that I cannot believe it is true. How can my country and people
change so much overnight? I ask myself to find that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>I </span>am the only one to ask this question, as though it were a
played-out question like the one literary students asked a decade or so ago as
to whether Pope was a poet? Today we accept him as such, seeing that poets and
poetry have changed so much that there is no knowing who is a poet and what
poetry is. But then it is the price we pay for the change we want or wish <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for, </span>almost as if we were like the
child in R. L. Stevenson’s short-story who wanted to go where the cars came
from and was tired of being too long in the country he was. The gypsy has taken
possession or us and we are restless, after one thing or another. The
intellectuals call it a quest and the mediocres, travel. That this travel is
neither education nor experience, as <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>old
</span>Bacon would call it, makes travel a disturbing influence. We see this in
the lives of those who have travelled, expecting from travel the best that’s to
be seen, heard and felt. Human that we are, we cannot help being restless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is this <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>so? w</span>e ask, and the
reason is that travel out our environment into another makes us change. We
begin to dress and feel and behave as the natives o<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>f </span>the country we are in do. Yet, with all our imitativeness, we
are different from them and we feel it as much as they do. A day comes when,
with all our adjustment to the people and the country, we feel we are not being
accepted and are even discriminated against. We say: “Hell with the place and
the people! If this is civilisation, let’s have nothing to do with it!” We go
back to our country to find it not the same as we left it, and we are mad with
our people and ourselves. Why need our country have changed? We wish we had not
left it and yet we feel we are not poor for all our travel. We have seen people
and places and things. They are different from ours, so what? We now see that
there’s reason for their difference, much as we love that country, we wish we
had not been born there, feeling as we do the simplicity and primitivity of our
country and people. For despite all the show of our people in progress or
advance, they have not changed. And you wish they had really changed rather than
make a show of it. You feel mad about this unchangeables and associate it with
rank stupidity and this is certainly not tradition as you think and feel it
should be. Why are the people such hum<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>bugs?
You ask yourself. The answer is that they are first</span> bluffing themselves
and all others afterwards. They cannot help it. It is because they do not know
where they are and how they stand in the context of life. And with a view to
showing others that they are progressive they change, clothes-wise and even in
speech. But beneath there is the old that is rigidly the same and wants no
change and the change they make is in such directions as would have been better
without any change. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rich fields, the many happy villages and the love for flowers and greenery
seemed to have gone out of life and in their place are to be found factories
and small industrial plants and pseudo villages where the joy of the people is
changed to sorrow. Instead of the farmer growing rich crops and feeling himself
self-sufficient, he is being enticed into the city so that his land may be
taken away from him. The farmer no longer feels happy as a villager and the old
trades are no longer there to occupy himself and others with. He leaves for the
city. He will get all his pleasures and comforts from the cities and thither he
will always travel. He sells his bullock-cart and the bulls and even the
hutment that was his from olden times. He goes out in hopes of a new life and
there is his wife who wants a change from the one she knows, in keeping with
the change in the city-born folk, and the man also wants a change and before
long, there are the children who are now roaming the streets and learn the
ill-manners of the city-born children. It is needless to continue this sad
story of the villager in detail, except to state the outline. One day he finds
himself in the lock-up for dealing with illicit liquor. His wife who was as
loyal as loyal could be, sees in her new paramour the sign of a new life and,
before the children turn up home, the couple have eloped to Bombay. The
children look after themselves as best as they can and grow up before their
time. They have no mother or father to look to. They soon learn the ways of
life and either join a gang of thieves or do work for a pittance. Love and the
sense of belonging have left them. They feel themselves orphans and they have
none to turn to because all are so busy, looking after themselves. One can live
or die, depending on what one wants to do. There is none to go out of his way
to advise or help. Why should anyone go out of his way when life’s hard and
things have changed? It’s time one changed or quit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

living is gone. In their place artificiality and formality are gaining ground.
What a number of marriages are wrecked every few months in this country and in
the world because the sanctity of marriage is not adhered to. Where marriage
has become a synonym for licence in loose living, there can be nothing good for
indiviauls, societies and the states to show. What a number of teachers, doctors,
nurses, scientists and technicians see in life a bleak affair. Their life-time
work and experience being ridiculed at every turn and mediocres are taking

wanted <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>America to be the El Dorado </span>of
the world and the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>refuge </span>of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>all </span>who suffer or are pained. Russia
can do much to tide <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>over </span>Chinese
invasion if only Russia sees in God the Maker <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>Heaven and Earth and grants individual the freedom to live. Or
what are men but chattels if they are not free? China, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>all </span>said and done, is an Eastern country, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with </span>Eastern traditions <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>love and plenty and the world <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>looks </span>to the East for Peace not <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Yellow </span>Fever. Wherever we live we want
life and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>its </span>comforts, the
finer things of life. Above all we want human beings who are <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>like </span>God, for they alone give meaning
to <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>life </span>and tradition, and make
it continuous, undying, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>like </span>literature,
art and religion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

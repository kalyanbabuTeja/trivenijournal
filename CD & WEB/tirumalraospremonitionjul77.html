style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Sundaram, a physician from Madras, who had come to Bangalore for a respite, and
his friend Hari Rao, a lawyer from Maharashtra, were sitting in the columned
hall of the temple of Hanuman on the outskirts of Basavangudi. It was the last
Saturday of the month of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shravan </i>(August).
Dr. Sundaram, spectacled and light of build, was seated on the floor, although
in trousers, and was dangling his shoeless feet over the edge of the raised
floor. His companion, the lawyer, heavier and somewhat rotund, was squatting on
the floor, his feet tucked beneath his thighs. He was clad colourfully in
gold-bordered <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dhoti </i>and wore diamond
ear-rings. His eyes were congested and red. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
hall where they were sitting adjoined Hanuman’s temple on its left and was
situated in front of the main shrine. Notwithstanding the images of Rama, Sita
and Lakshmana which were the temple was known as Hanuman’s. Entering through
the temple tower, one walked on a narrow path, about fifty feet long, cool and
shady with trees, alive with monkeys in their branches. The path led to the
main hall of the temple, behind which was visible the towering figure of
Hanuman, a twenty-feet of sinew in granite, clothed in brass. A Titan in size
and strength, Hanuman was sculptured sideways, his face and body turned away
from the hall with its throng of people, his hands uplifted in salutation. In
front of his turned face, through a small window in the side-wall of his
temple, level with his eyes, across an intervening hall, were seen the images
of Rama , Sita and Lakshmana, and these were quite small, about three feet in
height. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he repeated deprecatingly. “Tirumal Rao is gone. He was a gem of a man. We
prayed that he should get well, took upon ourselves to do an <i

died. All unexpectedly. What is the use of talking? What if we perform an <i

open. We shall be back home before it gets hot.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile
the people in the hall had started singing devotional songs. “The voice is
rather grating,” observed Hari Rao. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

came your devotion to Hanuman?” asked Dr Sundaram. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“I’m
not a devotee really,” replied Hari Rao. “Tirumal Rao was. He and I were much
together since our early days. He was four years older than me, and he was my
ideal. His devotion naturally affected me. Eventually my mind took a different
turn. However, I can’t say I lost my faith entirely. The influence of the
cradle extends to the pyre, they say. Tirumal Rao was not just a brother, he
was like a father to me, he was everything to me. He educated me, he arranged
my marriage, and I owe my success to him. He did everything for me, and then he
died. He did not spare himself for others, and God did not spare him.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Checking
the break in his voice, Hari Rao continued, “Yes, he was a rare man. He was a
pure soul–like Hanuman. Like Hanuman, he remained single. Hanuman was his
chosen deity. This temple reminds me of him. That is why I come here often. I
feel his presence here.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rao fell silent. The song in the main hall ceased, and in its place, another
rose, sung in a voice, thin like old age, Suddenly Hari Rao exclaimed,
“Sundaram, look there! Look through the window beyond the flag-mast!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that’s it! His face is turned towards this side, away from the entrance to his
shrine, away from the throng of devotees who show their adoration of him. He is
indifferent to them all. He is lost in an adoration of his own–in his adoration
of Rama. What a massive body he has, what muscles of iron, what lustre of
bronze! But on his monkey-face what humility! Is it not moving, even pathetic?”

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Listening
to Hari Rao, Dr. Sundaram got up and walked to the flag-mast. Peering through
the small window high up in the side-wall of Hanuman’s temple, he stood gazing
for a while on Hanuman’s face which was visible through it. Then he came back
and sat down by Hari Rao and said, “Yes, what you say is true. And for all that
you say to the contrary, you talk like a devotee.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not a devotee,” said Hari Rao. “I am a lawyer. Just as I can speak for my
client on any side of a case, I speak for Hanuman, but my spirit is untouched.
What I was trying to say was that Tirumal Rao was kin to this Hanuman. His gaze
was turned away from the wordly crowd to a secret vision of his own, and we did
not know what that vision was. He was well-dowered, tall, comely and companionable.
He was popular with people. He had a good job, house and lands. But his mind
was turned away from these. Why? This question vexes me. He did so much for me,
and he died young. He got me married though I was younger than he, and he
remained single. Mother pleaded with him to get married, but he did not listen
to her. I was a briefless lawyer while he started earning early and rose to a
good position in the bank. Talking to him, one would not think that he was
frustrated or lacking in the will to live. Why then did he deny himself?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seems to me, “ Dr. Sundaram, “that for some reason, Tirumal Rao had made up his
mind, once and for all, to remain single. That is why he was drawn early in
life to Hanuman, the white soul untained by desire.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

said Hari Rao. “He was unlike others who remain single for the freedom it gives
them.” He kept away from women. He was genuinely sorry for disappointing his
mother in not getting married. He had told me this himself, and yet he would
not heed her word. Why? And she was destined to see his death, and not his
marriage.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sort of mass reaction to his lapse and its outcome, he, with an innate
spirituality, took the vow of abstinence as an act of propitiation. That he

Rao’s countenance became taut. Dr. Sundaram went on: “Tirumal Rao was young
when he died. He was too young to have the usual arterial disease which carries
off people with a heart attack. At his age one would favour syphilis as the
cause of heart attack. Five or six or more years after it has been acquired,
syphilis attacks the aorta, the main artery which springs from the heart. The
chronic ulcer that he developed in his leg may also have been due to this
disease. For this ulcer the doctor gave him injections of penicillin. Whether
the ulcer was syphilitic or not, it may have responded to penicillin. It
exceptionally happens that the quick clearing of the syphilitic lesions in the
aorta, when penicillin is given, may cause a weakening of its wall. This is
because, with the rapid clearing, the body is not given enough time to
strengthen the wall. The weakening of the aortic wall manifests itself as chest
pain, and the unfortunate fatal complication of its rupture results in sudden
death.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

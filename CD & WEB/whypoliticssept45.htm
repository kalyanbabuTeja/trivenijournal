mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is not everybody that takes to politics; but
there is not anybody that is not concerned with it. For politics determines the
conditions of life. It is easy enough, when one is happy and settled, to
pretend lack of interest in politics. That much snobbery can then be afforded.
Then one professes not to believe in politics. As if there is any question of
believing in it! You might as well believe in eating! But ordinarily one can
adopt such a pose. For then other people are taking care of politics and we can
reap the benefit. Not so, however, when things go astray; prices are high,
famine appears, goods are not available. Then everybody is a politician and as
superior one at that. Then everybody finds fault with politicians. Allied to
this snobbishness is a feeling that politics is something dirty, something too
vulgar for good, decent people. There are people in politics who make it dirty
but they clearly are not those who have determined the world’s statecraft and
socio-economic organisation. The view of politics as something vulgar betrays a
colossal ignorance of the full scope and role of politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>There is yet another sort of indifference to
politics. It springs from an imagined insistence on abiding values. Politics is
mundane, ephemeral. There are greater, more lasting things. But most often such
abiding interests resolve themselves against the background of ordinary joys
and sorrows of life, into matters of day-to-day existence. Nothing very serious
or superior. It is only the deep current of life along which men’s thoughts and
feelings tend to flow. Politics, it is thought does not enter into that
current. It is something outside one’s private existence. It does not touch
such intimate experience as the death of some one beloved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The death of a beloved is the end of a world but it
is not the end of the world. There is even after that a life to be lived, there
are affairs to be looked after. And taken all together, politics has a relation
to the permanent interests of life. The spy pries in to your private chamber,
the dictator is in the way of your meeting your friend by the rippling rivulet.
The values of life that sustain us and that we cherish lost are in danger.
Einstein is in exile, Freud could just leave his country with his life;
Feurtwanger’s manuscripts were burnt. Tagore had to leave his poetic seclusion.
Jawaharlal goes to prison. It does not really seem politics leaves life alone.
War is not the only occasion on which it draws every one within its net. There
has been a famine and your baby died without food before your eyes. Quinine is
not available for your brother suffering from malaria. There is no cloth for
your sister. Alas, for abiding values! Politics affects them as it affects all
else. It causes sorrow, it is capable of causing joy too. It is therefore not
something apart from our personal lives. It touches our self-centered
existence. And what of such experiences as the death of a beloved? Cannot they
often be traced to economic causes having their root in political conditions?
Perhaps, the darling has died because of lack of adequate treatment. Treatment
easily available for the rich is outside the means of the poor. Abiding sorrow
has here apparently a very practical cause. No amount of fatalism can obscure
the relation of politics to life. There are desires which you cannot fulfil
today but which you could have fulfilled were political conditions different.
For politics determines the economic conditions on which family, social and
personal lives very much depend. Because I am poor I cannot fulfil my desire
for a trip abroad, cannot go in for higher education. It would not have been so
were economic conditions different, and these are fixed by politics. One is
then organically connected with politics. So long as one lives in human society
there is no getting away from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>That makes it both advisable and necessary for
everybody to take an active interest in politics. Not that everybody will adopt
politics as a career. But everybody should in his own interest think about
political matters and make his voice felt. There are many ways of doing so. One
can join in the demand for universal adult franchise and exercise the
franchise; one can attend public meetings, join local committees on public
affairs. It is about politics that people generally gossip because politics, of
all things, apparently keeps life going. It is the reflex of the growing life
of the community, and active interest in it would make one feel oneself an
integral part of life. It would connote one’s conscious development along with
and in relation to one’s environment. Politics touches in a real manner all
aspects of life and a living interest in it is a pre-condition of life’s
well-ordered development. One may imagine oneself living in terms of the
eternal, but it is politics that gives reality to the social background of
one’s existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Active connection with politics is thus inherently
prescribed for all of us and its realisation in practice would evidently help
mobilisation of mass opinion with a view to influence the course of public
life. There is no doubt that the pretentious lack of interest in politics is
responsible for much of formulation of policy and procedure in divorcement from
public interest. For this the general indifference to politics is much to
blame. Much of what we criticize is there because we have done nothing about
it. It is an attitude of acute irresponsibility and self-inception combined.
There is indeed nobody–be he the poet in his seclusion or the scientist in his
laboratory, who is absolved from his elementary duty in the political sphere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Political consciousness of membership of social
organization helps disciplined development of one’s individuality as an active,
successful unit of the nation’s entity. Its potentiality is less than only that
of joyful integration of one’s self in political work which then shelters one’s
outer and inner being as well. To say this is not to overlook the fed-up
feeling that comes to all except confirmed revolutionaries whose whole selves
have become merged in the objects they have in view. Even such, however, are
perfectly susceptible to the call of other interests in life. For the capacity
for appreciation of abiding things is not the monopoly of the non-political man.
At a moment of sudden leisure the political man also feels a vacuum, longs for
a final rest somewhere–for the spiritual sustenance of poetry and the arts.
Indeed, the more one realizes the fundamental reality of political life, the
more is one to be supposed to have a total sense of values. The politician that
is a mere careerist has often an ominous, unnotified departure to danger and
does only because he knows fundamentals are at stake. He will be found at the
depth of night meditating under the starry sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>History is witness to the people’s struggle for
self-assertion. To the extent that they are able to assert themselves they
influence the governance of their country and that determines their political
consciousness. Thus, in the U. S. S. R., the only socialist state in the world,
political consciousness of the people has, by all reports, reached the highest
pitch. It stands to reason that only when the people’s realisation of a society
and government of their own are complete and they have no longer to struggle in
that regard they can afford to return to pursuits of a more personal and
abiding sort. The unique defence that the Soviet people have put up against
Nazi aggression is explicable by the fact that they consider all that are most
near and dear to them at stake. It is the opportunity to seek the abiding
things of life that they have saved and not counted the cost. Politics there is
the pre-condition of abiding life. We in India are at the other end. We have
not even political freedom–let alone the social and economic freedom that will
enable us to seek what may roughly be called things of the spirit. Politics
here is the pre-condition of the beginning of life. Only through it can we
reach life abiding. To seek life away from it is for us escape from life. Life
without it would not be real, would not be complete. That is the consciousness
we badly need: the consciousness of the need for political consciousness. Even
for the sake of our personal return ultimately to non-political life. We need
to spread this consciousness. So we need to awaken the people to facts and
movements. But it seems we do not notice the people at all. Certainly, we do
not count them as having a place within the orbit of our existence. The people
need to be aroused, to feel themselves in unison with the course of national
life. They have to feel the pulse-beat of the world’s life to react to events.
Politics then will mean a process of their conscious self-realization. They
will not regard it as something outside them, some thing affecting them
remotely, if at all. They will, for example, feel themselves enthused when the
Kisan Sabha is meeting. They will wait to hear the news when the National
Congress is in session. They will feel themselves a part of the process of
events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Such perception of oneself as part of the process
of history inevitably adds zest to life, adds reality to it. That is easily the
ultimate personal sanction for interest in politics. But it pre-supposes
realization of one’s organic connection with the course of events in the world
and the country. To this end the realization, which is now increasing, that
life is dependent on one’s political and economic existence is a help. Even
short of acceptance of Marx’s materialist interpretation of history, there is increasing
recognition of the supreme importance of the politico-economic factor in life.
No more is it considered something ephemeral, something secondary. It does no
longer do to retire into a sort of other-worldliness. Science has made the
world small; with growing closeness of relations international complexities
grow. Air raids have become facts. War has entered even the remote villager’s
house. Nobody is left alone. Membership of the world community has become a
matter of everybody’s day-to-day perception, active understanding of such
membership expands the meaning of life. Not that everybody would be a
politician; only nobody can deny his or her relation to politics. To leave it
as somebody else’s job is at one end dangerous; at the other it is taking undue
advantage of others. On one hand it causes one injury; on the other it is
shirking responsibility. For it is not possible in this age to live outside
politics. What then is the place of politics in life? Is it not too late to
ask?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

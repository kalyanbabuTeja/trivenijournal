<span class=SpellE>honour</span>, he recalled a <span class=GramE>somewhat</span>
poignant incident when Mr. Sastri was his student. The dress regulations of the
college prescribed that students should wear either a shirt and coat, or at
least a shirt, in the class. As young Srinivasan could not afford either, much
less both, he used to wrap himself in a towel like a shirt. One rainy day he
entered the class without even it and explained to the angry principal that the
towel had got drenched and had been put out to dry. The disciplinarian that he
was, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Bilderbeck</span> fined Srinivasan eight <span
class=SpellE>annas</span>. Whereupon Srinivasan <span class=SpellE>pitiously</span>
begged to know how he was to pay a fine of eight <span class=SpellE>annas</span>
when he could not afford a spare shirt which costs only six <span class=SpellE>anaas</span>!
A few hours later, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Bilderbeck</span> discovered her
husband in his study, praying on his knees to God to forgive him for fining
poor Srinivasan. On the advice of the kindly Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Bilderbeck</span>,
the principal remitted the fine. After relating the incident, the venerable <span
class=SpellE>Bilderbecks</span> expressed their immense joy and pride that
erstwhile “shirt-less Srinivasan” had blossomed into the Right <span
class=SpellE>Honourable</span> V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, a Member of the British
Privy Council and a Freeman of the City of London and had, by his speech at the
Lord Mayor’s Banquet at the Guildhall, enraptured the distinguished audience
consisting of the cream of the British elite by the mobility of sentiments, <span

class=SpellE>Kumbakonam</span>, on September 22, 1869, ten days earlier than
Mahatma Gandhi who was born on October 2 of the same year. His parents were
very orthodox Brahmins. Social reform was in the air. Young Srinivasan was <span
class=SpellE>pressurised</span> by his high school teachers to take a solemn
vow that boys were not to marry till they were over eighteen years old. But his
orthodox parents, following the custom of the day, <span class=SpellE>pressurised</span>
him to marry when he was only fourteen years of age. He faced a crisis. Should
he obey his parents and marry, or <span class=SpellE>honour</span> his vow and
not marry? His parents did not take his vow seriously for the reason that it
was unfair to administer such vows to immature boys, and insisted on his
marrying! This event roused <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> interest in
social reform and prompted him to campaign for post-puberty marriages of girls
and to introduce a bill in the Madras Legislature, when he became a member of
it some years later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sastri was a brilliant student and stood first in several of examinations,
particularly in English and Sanskrit, and won merit scholarships which helped
him to continue his studies. In 1888, he stood first in Sanskrit and got a
first class in English in the B. A. examination. His proud father had a feast
to celebrate the event, to which he invited his friends who were also Sanskrit
scholars. As was the custom on such occasions, there was some chanting of
Sanskrit <span class=SpellE><i>slokas</i></span><i>. </i>Young Srinivasan
challenged the correctness of the grammar of one of the <span class=SpellE><i>slokas</i></span><i>!
</i>The venerable scholars were <span class=SpellE>scandalised</span> by what
appeared to them as the irreverent impudence of the youngster. His father
berated him. Duly humbled, he swore that he would never again correct the
mistakes of others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he could not keep the vow. He challenged the correctness of some passages in <i>English
Grammar </i>by J. C. <span class=SpellE>Nesfield</span>, then a text book. That
a young Indian should presume to correct <span class=GramE>an English</span>,
grammar written by an Englishman caused a sensation. Later, Mr. Sastri
challenged the pronunciation of an English word by Mr. Hall, the British
Principal of the Teachers’ <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Training</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>.
When Mr. Hall retorted that, as an Englishman, he knew the pronunciation of
English words better than his Indian student, Mr. Sastri asked him to consult
the English Dictionary. On doing so, Mr. Hall discovered that Sastri was
correct, and handsomely acknowledged it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sastri was acknowledged by competent authorities as among the handful of the
best speakers in English. Of his speech at the League of Nations in Geneva in
1921, Mr. H. Wilson Harris, President of the International Association of
Journalists who was accredited to the League, said that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span>
turn to speak came last, that the hour was late and the audience was tired
after a long and weary debate and the hall was emptying, but it emptied, no
more during Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> speech! “The slow sentences,
with their faultless phrasing, compelled attention.” After he heard Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> speech, Lord Balfour, head of the British
Delegation, remarked that he then <span class=SpellE>realised</span> to what
heights the English language could rise. Mr. Sastri was universally acclaimed
as the foremost orator in the League. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“no flattery or exaggeration to say that the greatest sensation of that meeting
was furnished by the eloquence of Mr. Sastri.” The <i>Literary Supplement </i>of
the <i>London Times </i>said on June 4, 1964, that “Mr. Sastri was one of greatest

Sastri had a phenomenal memory. He delivered a series of lectures on several
consecutive days <i>extempore. </i>Only a quotation or two were written down.
For instance, he delivered in 1926 at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
the Kamala Lectures on the <i>Rights and Duties of the Indian Citizen, </i>which
in pretty close print extended to about 90 pages! Sir <span class=SpellE>Asutosh</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mookerjee</span>, the famous Vice-Chancellor of the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, had founded the lectures in
memory of his beloved daughter, who had died young. The first series of
lectures were given by Dr. Annie <span class=SpellE>Besant</span> on his
invitation. He had intended to invite Mr. Sastri to give the second series but
before he could write to Mr. Sastri, he passed away. His sons Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Shyam</span> Prasad and Rama Prasad <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Mookerjee</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> conveyed their
dead father’s wish to Mr. Sastri. By the time he received it, Mr. Sastri was
ill in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City>
and was forbidden even to read a newspaper. In view of his rather precarious
health, the engagement was postponed twice. But he refused to accept a third
postponement and insisted on keeping the engagement, irrespective of his
health. I begged him to write out or dictate his lectures, so that if at the
last moment he was not able to speak or read them himself, some one could read
them for him. But he kept mum. His friends in <st1:City w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:City>
and <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>, who got very anxious, wired friends
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City> to
take care of Mr. Sastri. Mr. Sastri and I were guests of Messrs. <span
class=SpellE>Shyam</span> Prasad and Rama Prasad <span class=SpellE>Mookerjee</span>
in their house in which, by the way, books and books and more books filled
every inch of space available<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>–</span>rooms,
verandahs, corridors and even bath rooms! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the evening of our arrival, Sir <span class=SpellE>Nilratan</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sirkar</span>, a very eminent medical practitioner, examined Mr.
Sastri thoroughly. Finally, he said that he would not be surprised if Mr.
Sastri died during his first lecture the next day, and offered to take
responsibility for canceling it and phone the newspapers about it. But Mr.
Sastri would not listen. Sir <span class=SpellE>Nilratan</span> sent Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Bidhan</span> Chandra y, the famous heart specialist, the next
morning. He too examined Mr. Sastri and advised cancellation of the
engagements. But Mr. Sastri would not agree, as he said that he might have
agreed if Sir <span class=SpellE>Ashutosh</span> had been alive, but he would
not postpone again <span class=GramE>to <span class=SpellE>honour</span></span>
the dead savant’s wish. Dr. Roy felt helpless. He gave some pills and undertook
to attend the meeting with the necessary emergency equipment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sastri could not climb the few steps to the Senate Hall and had to be carried
in a chair. The Vice-Chancellor, Sir <span class=SpellE>Ewart</span> <span

alarmed when he noticed Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> health and
offered even at that last moment to postpone the lecture. When Mr. Sastri
insisted on going trough the engagement, Sir <span class=SpellE>Ewart</span>
appealed to the vast audience, which had filled the big Senate Hall to
overflowing, to give up their chairs and squat on the floor and close up to as
near the rostrum as possible to reduce the strain on the speaker, as there was
no loud-speaker then. The sympathetic audience readily complied. Mr. Sastri,
who could not stand and speak, was hoisted on to the table where he sat
cross-legged in <span class=SpellE><i>Padmasana</i></span><i>. </i>Immediately
behind him were Sir <span class=SpellE>Ewart</span>, Dr. Roy and <span
class=GramE>myself</span>, watching in great anxiety. Sir <span class=SpellE>Ewart’s</span>
introductory speech was most moving. Mr. Sastri began to speak. He was much
slower than his wont and spoke with pain which he concealed from the audience
in front of him. He spoke extempore. At the end of forty-five minutes, Dr. Roy
asked me to suggest to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> that he should
conclude his address for the day. I told him that I dared not do so and asked
him, as a medical man, to do so. But he too hesitated. At the end of sixty
minutes, Dr. Roy touched Mr. Sastri on his shoulder and whispered that he had
spoken for sixty minutes and had better stop. But Mr. Sastri gently brushed him
away and continued to speak for another fifteen minutes! He told us afterwards
that what he planned to cover in sixty minutes he took seventy-five because of
his illness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

stethoscope on Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> chest and kept listening.
It was death-bed scene. About fifteen minutes later, Mr. Sastri opened his eyes
and we relaxed. At his request, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> car was
driven at great speed to and fro along the large Calcutta <span class=SpellE>Maidan</span>
about twenty-times to drive air into his lungs. He then felt well enough to go

hard-hearted man like me, I read it, and, strange to say, there is not a page
which does not bring tears into my eyes! Any fine sentiment, any tender
feeling, any affection between brother and brother, and re-union of beings that
have been separated for a time, aye, any homage paid to friendship, to gratitude
or to any of those eternal abiding virtues of human character, brings tears
into my eyes! I stop; I cannot go on; I have to wait and wipe my eyes and then
go on. Why do I do that? A hardened man of the world, why do I do that? Why has
it that effect on me? I suppose it is because deep down in my nature, going to
strata which perhaps in my walking life. I shall never <span class=GramE>touch,</span>

I am a journalist of any standing in the country today, it has been entirely
owing to the (timely) assistance rendered me by a few benevolent editors: the
chief of whom have been the late Dr. <span class=SpellE>Sachchidananda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sinha</span> of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hindustan
Review</i> (alas, long since defunct), the late Mr. K. Ramakotiswara Rau of
Triveni, and the late Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kedarnath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chatterji</span> of the Modern Review–in that order. There have,
no doubt, been some others also (as, for instance, Sir Francis Low of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Times of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place></i> and Mr. Frank <span
class=SpellE>Moraes</span> of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Indian
Express</i>). But these three stand out most prominently from amongst the rest,
like Everest and <span class=SpellE>Kanchinjunga</span> and <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Nanga</span> <span class=SpellE>Parbat</span></st1:place> from
amongst the rest of the mighty Himalayan mountain-ranges. I am all the more
grateful to them because I was not, if the truth is to be told, brought up to
be a journalist, my own father (an eminent editor himself) having been not only
lukewarm to the idea but absolutely antagonistic to it. But, being of a
somewhat stubborn nature myself, I “insisted on being one, paternal wrath
notwithstanding; and the person who initially helped this particular lame dog
over the (journalistic) stile was Dr. <span class=SpellE>Sachchidananda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sihna</span>, of the distinguished trio aforementioned, who
sensed, right from the beginning, that I had a flair (of sorts) for writing and
that, as the editor of the second most reputed English monthly in India (the
first, unquestionably, being the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Modern
Review</i>), he was peculiarly placed to develop that flair of mine to the best
of his ability and to the utmost of its scope. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

did contrive, in the extent, to publish quite a few of my effusions (both
literary and political), and, by so doing, firmly laid the foundation of my
(modest) journalistic career. More than that, he always wished me well bestowed
his choicest blessings upon me, and read eagerly my contributions to other papers
and periodicals, heaping congratulations on me without stint. He is no more
now; and his celebrated journal also has gone the way of “the many <span
class=SpellE>Ninevehs</span> and <span class=SpellE>Hecatempoli</span>”. This
is eminently the place for me to pay him the homage that is rightly his due. He
was not only a great man. He was that much rarer entity, a good man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

possible, It is my irreparable misfortune that I was never destined to meet
him, as they say, in the flesh. In those days <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

and, too, in a ravishingly beautiful <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>format</i>,
because he was a lover of the beautiful in all the arts and sciences. He
himself, let me interpolate, wielded a notably graceful pen, though,
unfortunately, he wielded it very sparingly in his own pages while ungrudgingly
encouraging others to “spread” themselves as much as they pleased. I was in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Trivandrum</span></st1:place></st1:City>
then and saw a copy of it by sheer accident. It was so enchanting in appearance

for its fate at his hands, more than a little apprehensive that it would come
back to me like a homing pigeon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

my astonishment, therefore, when I received a cordial letter from him,
intimating not only his acceptance of it, but (would you believe it?) calling
for more! Though it was far from being my finest journalistic exercise it was
far from being a markedly infelicitous one, either, and my succeeding offerings
showed more signs of promise. He “played host” to them also with the same
generosity as he did to my maiden effort. There was, it now occurs to me, only
one contribution from my humble pen that he was constrained to refuse. The
Mahatma’s first civil disobedience movement was at its meridian <span
class=SpellE>splendour</span> at that juncture, and though, as one belonging to
the “Liberal” tabernacle, I had been; at its commencement, somewhat indifferent
to it, I had, perforce, to align myself with it as the police <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zoolum</i></span> against
the “<span class=SpellE>Satyagrahis</span>” escalated rapidly, even the members
of the “gentler sex” not being spared by the myrmidons of authority. So I felt
it my bounden duty, as a patriotic citizen, to <span class=SpellE>indite</span>
a blistering article against our (the then) ‘alien rulers, going at them, as
the expression is, hammer and tongs. Mr. Ramakotiswara Rau politely declined to
publish it as its publication, in his considered opinion, would, infallibly,
land both himself and his periodical in a spot of trouble. Then I reminded
myself that a cobbler should stick to his last and that, as I began my’
association with Triveni with a literary piece, I would do well to continue
sending in only <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>literary pieces</i> “for
the duration”. After all, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Triveni</i> did
not purport to be a political journal, its <span class=SpellE><i

was one glorious instance when he exhibited his spirit of sturdy independence
which I shall never forget. One fine morning I received a communication from
him suggesting that, “for a change”, as he put it, I might attempt a “pen-portrait”
of Sir <span class=SpellE>Tej</span> Bahadur <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span>,
or the Rt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, or Mr.–not yet “Sir”–C.Y. <span
class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>. Well, it was true that I had not been
interested, even mildly, in this kind of composition before, and I replied that
my intimacy with “the high and the mighty” was limited to that of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Chintamani</span> and that I might be able to paint a (wordy)
portrait of him: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>provided that,</i>
though he happened to be my own father, I would, in the intervals of extolling
to the skies, be allowed to <span class=SpellE>criticise</span> him as and when
I deemed it incumbent on me so to do. He readily agreed, informing me that he
gave me <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>carte blanche</i> (his own
phrase) to write just as I chose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

due course I posted that “pen-portrait”, a long and frank and intimate affair:
and, in due course also, it appeared in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Triveni</i>
without so much as a single emendation from the editor. The editor, as a matter
of fact, was very appreciative of it. Not so, however, the subject of that “pen
portrait”. He took Mr. Ramakotiswara Rau severely to task for publishing it.
But Mr. Ramakotiswara Rau bluntly riposted that I had written it at his own
suggestion and that I had never mentioned in it that he (Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>) and I were related to each other” even
north-north- west.” A certain “Mr. C. L. R. Sastri” (Mr. Ramakotiswara Rau
proceeded) wrote on a certain “Mr. C. Y. <span class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>”
and in consequence, he (Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>) could have no
grouse whatsoever, either against me or against him (the editor). But, of
course, my father was not modified by this (extremely cogent) explanation: he
was not easily mollified when he felt that his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

was not enough for him: one had to lay it on with a trowel! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

some years Triveni fell on evil days, and it has not yet, I imagine, fully
recovered from them. It was at its most resplendent when he himself took an
active part in its management and directed it in every vital detail. But both ill-health
and financial worries, I surmise, supervened and the journal visibly declined
into desuetude. The great thing, however, is that it has not (thanks be!) given
up the struggle and that, under its present editorship, it is still carrying on
gamely. But a “quarterly” is, to be perfectly candid, no substitute for a “monthly”:
and, to that extent, it must be owned (sadly but truly) that it has suffered a “sea-change”
into something “poor and strange”: in contradistinction, that is, to what it
had been when Mr. Ramakotiswara Rau himself remained at the helm of that frail
craft. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

dedicated his energies to doing just that. His successors must, in their turn,
consecrate theirs to treading in his illustrious footsteps. In our hapless
country it is not as everyone knows, the easiest, or the safest, of enterprises
to launch a paper or a periodical: and when, by superhuman effort (nothing
less), it has been got going, our (collective) <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>

then no paucity of famous magazines. Among these Mr. K. Ramakotiswara Rau’s
Triveni undoubtedly occupied pride of place: “it flamed in the forehead of the

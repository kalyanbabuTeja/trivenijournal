style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ORTHODOX
Hinduism offers at least three alternatives for the aspiring Soul seeking the
supreme aim of existence. These are the path of works <i>(karma), </i>the path
of knowledge <i>(jnana), </i>and the path of devotion <i>(bhakti)</i>; the
first of these consists in kindness and charity and in the performance of
rituals and sacrifices which lead the aspirant to salvation, and the second is
of those who strive after true knowledge. It is the claim of the followers of
the latter path that theirs is better than the former which leads only to
rebirth in accordance with the well-known law that action is followed by
reaction. The path of knowledge, on the other hand, leads the seeker to
liberation from which there is no set-back. To the follower of the third path,
the path of devotion, the worship of the Supreme Lord is the only means whereby
to achieve the chief goal of life. The Sanskrit word <i>bhakti </i>comes from
the root <i>bhaj</i> ‘to adore,’ and the follower of <i>bhakti </i>is one who
adores the Supreme Lord. <i>Bhakti </i>is not knowledge, though it may be the
result of knowledge. It is not work, though surrendered to the Lord and thus
made pure, work can be a means to <i>bhakti</i>. Knowledge may produce <i>bhakti</i>
but <i>bhakti</i> in its turn, is not a means to any higher end. It is itself
the terminus and, by its very nature, implies previous knowledge of the object
adored. We thus cannot know by <i>bhakti,</i> but can only recognize by it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

aspirant nowhere. However much knowledge may satisfy the intellect, it cannot
answer the needs of the heart, cannot heal the wounded soul, which are so often
achieved only by devotion. Occasions indeed are plentiful when we use our
knowledge to the utmost, when we put forth our endeavours to their limit, and
yet fail to achieve our ambition. A Soul in such sore straits can find solace
only in seeking refuge in his All-powerful and All-compassionate Maker Whose
mercy and kindness only incidental to His generous nature and who has “at
sundry times and in divers manners” spoken to man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rigveda, ritualism and intellectualism appear to have existed side by side

as the Rigveda, from which time down till the present day it has had an
unbroken and continuous history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all that are devoted to the glorification of Vishnu in the Rigveda. But he is

fact that he is not a sacrificial deity. While almost all the other gods
receive sacrificial offerings, this is the God who is content with mere prayer.
“Like the God of the Puritans, he cares for piety rather than sacrifice, for
devotion rather than offerings...In the later age of Epics and Puranas Vishnu
occupies the high place of one among the trinity, and even forms to his
sectaries the highest God. But the Puranic Vishnu is only a logical development
of the God of the Vedic period. His history is the history of one regular and
normal development. There are no traces here of breaks and stop-gaps, of sudden
elevations and recognitions. From the Vedic age down to the age of the Epics
and Puranas, Vishnu is primarily revered for being the saviour and asylum of
departed Souls.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the twelfth century A.D., the <i>bhakti </i>cult became fully stereotyped. Its
followers were called the Bhagavatas. These people reject the <i>maya </i>doctrine

Soul is also personal and individual. Among those who hold such doctrines there
are four chief schools (<i>sampradaya</i>), the schools of Ramanuja, Madhva,
Vishnusvamin and Nimbarka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the school of Ramanuja (b. 1017 A.D.), the Supreme Self is a personal Pantheos
who is endowed with every conceivable auspicious quality, who is immanent in
all transient things and who transcends all that exists. For the individual
Soul to attain beatitude what is necessary is devotion for this Supreme Lord,
to reach whom the truest way is devotion. This consists, not only in
cultivating an active desire in things divine and an unqualified apathy towards
those that are not, but also in meditation on the Lord with the full knowledge
of the relation that exists between Him and man. The system also recognizes an

the system of Madhva (b. 1199 A.D.) also stress is laid on the cultivation of
the feeling that God is infinitely superior to man in strength, intellect or
measurement, but is always gracious and merciful when man in his utter
helplessness seeks His succour. The duty of devotee is to subordinate his will
to the Divine and to serve ceaselessly his Protector and all those who follow
Him. But the process is difficult, and the path is beset with numerous difficulties,
snares and pitfalls. The heart, this system lays down, requires a careful
education to brave all these and to be fit for consecration to the Supreme
Being. The study of the sacred texts which only can dispel all doubt and
hesitation is the first step. Egotism must go next and the individual should be
able to place himself on a footing of equality with others: He must be able to
serve all looking upon himself as the “lowest of the low,” and “as humble as
the grass beneath the feet of God’s lovers.” The Christian doctrine “Do unto
others as you would that they should do to you,” occurs in Hindu literature in
its negative and more powerful form. Says the <i>Mahabharata</i>, “Do not do
unto others as you would that they should not do to you.” In the next stage <i>(upasana)</i>,
the individual renounces the world and is indifferent to all worldly
relationships. ‘Reverie is his chief pastime,’ meditation almost his only
activity. Vision of God <i>(aparoksa)</i> is the next step, and the intensity
pf this vision is only proportional to the capacity of the individual who
experiences it. When this takes place, the devotee feels the flash of an image
of light before his inner gaze. It is not some form of God, some incarnation of
His, that is visualized on the occasion, but God Himself reaches the vision of
the mind which is trained and educated suitably. When the Lord thus appears He
takes no form likely to awe and threaten His devotee. The suppliant sees Him
smiling and encouraging, and is quite capable of raising up his hands in
thankfulness, overpowered by the kindness of his Maker, his Father. The <i>Mundaka
Upanishad </i>(II. 2.8) describes this stage thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to this world. He is always calm and silent, but sometimes he laughs or weeps,
sings or dances, or exhibits similar tendencies which usually associated with
madness of the mind. His final liberation has yet to come; and when this comes
the devotee reaches the highest heaven, known as <i>Vaikuntha</i>, from which
there is no return. The Soul is not absorbed in this stage into the Supreme
being, but retains still its individuality and enjoys bliss in Divine Presence
and Fellowship. On one point in the conception of liberation Ramanuja and
Madhva are at variance. While, according to the former teacher, all released
Souls enjoy an equal measure of bliss in this heavenly region, and this bliss
is equal to that of God Himself, the latter holds, not only that the bliss of
the individual is inferior to that enjoyed by the Supreme Lord, but also that
no two Souls enjoy the same amount of bliss and that the degree of enjoyment of
the individual depends essentially upon the standard of his worth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not at all easy to describe how a devotee looks and to state how he can be
distinguished from others who do not belong to his class. It may be more
fruitful to study the characteristics of a few individual devotees, and this
may give some idea of the requirements of one who would follow the path of
devotion. In the <i>Bhagavata </i>(VII. 5. 23 f.) Prahlada speaks of how a
devotee spends his time. A confirmed devotee is one, according to this text,
who is engaged in listening to sacred stories, in hearing God’s praise sung, in
uttering His name or singing hymns in praise of Him, in stocking his mind with
Divine episodes, or in recollecting those he knows already, in worshipping and
serving Him through an image or similar medium, and finally in offering up his
Soul in utter devotional surrender. The other example of a devotee is Radha
described in works like the <i>Devibhagavata</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

objects this faculty is wasted; but turned towards God, the Highest, it meets
with a “stimulus responsive of its highest aspirations.” It is for the wise
aspirant, any way, to choose whether he will be a devotee or an intellectual,
“a warm gurgling fountain of love,” or a “block of ice frozen by
intellectualism.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhi’s
contribution to political and economic thought is still a subject of
controversy. While some have depicted him as a “mystic”, “idealist” and
“visionary,” others described him as a “sober realist”, “friend of the poorest”
and “spokesman of the conscience of mankind.” Prof. Parkinson in his <i>Evolution
of Political Thought </i>observed that “of recent years Gandhi is almost alone
in having anything new or useful to say about democracy.” What is <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> democracy and socialism? Gandhi himself once
remarked, “There is no such thing as <span class=SpellE>Gandhism</span> and I
do not like to leave any sect after me.” Yet Gandhi’s ideas on democracy and
socialism have great relevance for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in particular and for the
world in general. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gandhi is not a philosopher in the sense in which
Aristotle or <span class=SpellE>Spinoza</span> is, nor is he a philosophical
theologian like <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span>. The uniqueness of Gandhi’s
contribution to democracy and socialism lies in the fact that his views were
based on wide experience and penetrating understanding of the psychology of
Indians and problems of our society. Gandhi <span class=GramE>was</span> a
“poly-psychologist.” He embodies the soul of our land, he himself observed, “I
am of the earth earthy.” His views on democracy and socialism are not pedantic.
He is held as “Mahatma” not for propounding a new philosophy but because he <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> what he professed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Democracy
is more than a mere form of Government. It is a way of life. It requires for
its successful working a particular frame of mind based on integrity and
tolerance. People should learn to decide their differences through persuasion
and not through pressure, on the floor of Parliament and not in the streets.
Democracy is now derailed because of the crisis of conscience in our public
life. Gandhi prescribed a rigid code of conduct to <span class=SpellE>Satyagrahis</span>
and his <span class=SpellE>moto</span> is that noble ends cannot be achieved </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
ignoble means. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Gandhi,”
in the words of Prof. Parkinson, “is and will </span><span style='font-size:

certainly remain the greatest democratic thinker of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>20th
century.” Respect for the individual and faith in the rationality of man are
the <i>sine qua non </i>of democracy. Gandhi believed and relied upon the
innate nobility of the human heart. According to him “man is a spark of the
universal spirit.” The individual, in Gandhi’s view, should be given supreme
consideration and the state is a means for the development of individuality.
Like a true democrat Gandhi advocated conversion instead of coercion, and laid
emphasis upon man’s rationalism and altruism. His love of and respect for the
individual led him to oppose racism in <st1:country-region w:st="on">South
 Africa</st1:country-region> and <span class=SpellE>untouchability</span> in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Gandhi
despised the dictators. During the Second World War he remarked, “Hitlerism
means naked, ruthless forces reduced to an exact science and worked with
scientific precision.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhi
was not a dogmatic democrat and his ideas of democracy were based on realistic
considerations. Adult suffrage is generally held as a prerequisite of
democracy. But Gandhi <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that in this age of
journalism and capitalism adult suffrage will do more harm than good to
democracy unless the people are educated. So he opposed automatic universal
suffrage. Gandhi was quite severe in prescribing qualifications for candidates
seeking election. A candidate must be selfless, able and incorruptible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Opposition
is the kingpin of democracy. While dictatorship stifles all criticism of
Government with ruthless severity, democracy provides free scope for the people
to <span class=SpellE>criticise</span> or even to rebel against the Government.
No doubt this has to be done in a peaceful and constitutional way. In Gandhi’s
view meek submissiveness is not the mark of good citizenship. Every individual
has a right to bring moral pressure on the Government by non-violent
non-co-operation. The exercise of the right of franchise is but once in a fixed
number of years, the exercise of the right to co-operate or non-co-operate is
from day to day. Gandhi vehemently asserted, “You assist an administration most
effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil administration never
deserves such allegiance. A good man will therefore resist an evil system or
administration with his whole soul. Civil disobedience is the only and most
successful remedy and is obligatory upon him who would dissociate himself from
evil.” According to Gandhi a citizen should oppose not only a bad system of
Government but also a bad administration. A democratic system may become a
diabolic force under a corrupt administration; democracy may be badly
administered. So Gandhi justified civil disobedience in a democracy.
Inaugurating the first All-India Conference of Educators for Secularism,
Socialism and Democracy, the Prime Minister Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Indira</span>
Gandhi observed “We are not against Satyagraha, opposition and criticism. But
we are against a minority of the people gagging the majority.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhi’s
life mission was to promote rural democracy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for the real life of our
nation lies in villages. Real <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
is rural <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Throughout his life he was drawn by the vision of rural civilization. <span
class=SpellE>Decentralisation</span>, both political and economic, was the core
of his thinking. The impact of<i> </i>Gandhi can be noticed in the system of <span
class=SpellE>Panchayati</span> <span class=SpellE>Raj</span> introduced in some
states like Andhra <span class=SpellE>Pradesh</span>. But <span class=SpellE>Panchayati</span>
<span class=SpellE>Raj</span> far from strengthening our democracy has injected
<span class=SpellE>casteism</span> and corruption. Fake Gram <span
class=SpellE>Panchayats</span> instead of real Gram <span class=SpellE>Swaraj</span>
of Gandhi’s conception have emerged. Gandhi had the vision to foresee the evil
consequences of introducing democracy at the grass-roots before making the
voters educated and enlightened. Gandhi’s ideal of democracy in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> was in
making the village the basis of social and economic life. The village should be
transformed into a self-governing unit. All adults should elect the village
representatives who would elect provincial representatives and who in their
turn elect a president. Gandhi’s ideal was that the ruling bodies are to be
relatively small in their number. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Democracy
becomes a name of noble sound but of squalid result in the absence of a
socialist society. The essence of socialism lies in the establishment of
economic equality in society. As Dr A. <span class=SpellE>Appadorai</span>
pertinently remarked “If the essence of socialism is equality he (Gandhi) was a
socialist.” In fact as Prof. V. K. R. V. <span class=SpellE>Rao</span>
observed, his ideas on economic equality are more extreme than those of the
socialists who concentrated their attention on the economic inequalities
resulting from private property and ignored those resulting from differences in
human skills and responsibilities.” <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> looked
at equality more from the needs than from the abilities of persons and in this
respect there is similarity between Gandhi and Marx in their definitions of
socialism, namely “from each according to his ability to each according to his
needs.” Gandhi once stated, “My idea of socialism is that every one should get
the same wages. A lawyer, a physician </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a teacher, a <span
class=SpellE>labourer</span>, a sweeper–all should get equal wages.” According
to Gandhi economic equality should mean equitable distribution of wealth.
Everyone should be assured of a balanced diet, a decent house to live in,
sufficient cloth to cover himself with facilities for educating his children
and adequate medical relief. For the establishment of a socialist society there
can be no greater source of inspiration than Gandhi and his teachings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> is the apex of
<span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> socialism. <span class=SpellE>Sarvodaya</span>
or universal uplift is based on his optimistic interpretation of human nature.
Gandhi, like Rousseau, had great faith in the essential goodness of man. He
advocated governmental minimum, for he believed that the individual will <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> his own responsibility and duty to society.
Individualism is opposed to socialism and socialism is unique in reconciling
socialism with individualism. <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> socialism
starts from the bottom and not from the top–from the individual who is the core
of society. Like the Utopian socialists he <span class=SpellE>visualised</span>
a society wherein there will be no army, no police force, where men and women
enjoy the same rights, where everybody will be left to his own individual
judgment. Individualistic socialism which may appear as a contradiction in <span
class=GramE>terms,</span> was advocated by Gandhi as he was thinking of society
as an organic whole where the differences did not exist. People should have
character. Gandhi held that socialist state is a wonderful ideal provided the
nation has the character to work it in practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
enigmatic feature of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> socialism is the
spiritual approach to socialism. He wanted to build a new social system which
would be in tune with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
ancient cultural traditions. So unlike Marx instead of materialistic approach
Gandhi made a spiritualistic approach to socialism. In his view spirit counts
more than material forces. Gandhi did not accept the thesis of class war and
violence; on the other hand he considered that socialism can be achieved
through class co-operation. He declared, “Socialism is as pure as crystal and
therefore needed crystal-like means to achieve it. Satyagraha is the highest
and infallible means, the greatest force. Socialism will not be reached by any
other means.” Both Gandhi and Marx felt anguished at the misery of the poor and
both agreed over ends. But the two sharply disagreed in the matter of means. <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> socialism is Marxism minus violence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
spiritualistic approach to socialism led Gandhi to advocate the concept of
trusteeship. Gandhi did not draw any distinction between economics and ethics.
Like other socialists Gandhi did not advocate abolition of private property. He
enunciated the thesis of voluntary poverty and reduction of wants by the rich.
The rich should consider themselves as the trustees of the poor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Socialism
is normally associated with the growth of heavy industries and urbanism. But
Gandhi’s spiritual approach to socialism led him to oppose the use of heavy
machines and <span class=SpellE>industrialisation</span>. He once remarked,
“Machinery represents a great sin... The workers in the mills have become
slaves. If this machinery craze grows in our country it will become an unhappy
land.” The root cause of the growth of heavy machines is the unlimited
character of human wants. In Gandhi’s view voluntary reduction of wants will
put a halt to industrialism. In fact Gandhi was not opposed to the use of
machinery. He was against large scale production only of those things that
villages can produce without difficulty. <span class=SpellE>Mechanisation</span>,
in his view, is good wherever there is shortage of hands. As J. P. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> remarked, “He was not opposed to machinery but only
to a craze for it. As he observed, the spinning wheel itself was <span
class=GramE>a machinery</span>. What he objected to was an indiscriminate
application of machinery and the craze for bigger machinery.” It must be
admitted that Gandhi’s attitude to machinery was perhaps the most controversial
aspect of his economic thinking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhi
was a great democrat and socialist. He gave a spiritualistic interpretation to
both and this made his views on democracy and socialism enigmatic. As a true
democrat Gandhi had immense faith in the innate goodness and rationality of
man. As a votary of peace he upheld the democratic method of settling
differences by peaceful methods. In Satyagraha he gave the world a new
democratic technique for solving disputes. If socialism is the philosophy of
the poor, Gandhi was a great socialist. His concept of trusteeship and his
views on the use of machinery were put forth from a spiritual plane. The
uniqueness of Gandhi lies in <span class=SpellE>moralising</span> democracy and
socialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

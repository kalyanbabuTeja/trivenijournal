<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>Among the developments of the
quarter, the conclusion of the Japanese Peace Treaty at the San Francisco
Conference, the oil crisis in Iran leading to the complete evacuation of the
Abadan oil refinery by the British and its consequent closing at least for the
time being the denunciation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 by the
Egyptian Government and the resort to military measures by Britain with a view
to enforce the terms of the Treaty, the admission of Greece and Turkey into the
North Atlantic Treaty organization, and suspension of the truce talks in Korea
for nearly two months and their resumption deserve to be noted. The quarter has
also seen at one stage the probability of an actual war breaking out between
India and Pakistan which, fortunately for all, has not become an actuality.
There is no change in the general world situation. The crisis continues and
atomic explosions are becoming as common in Soviet Russia as in the United States.
The phenomena associated with the Atomic Age are taking a more and more
definite shape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Treaty which forty-eight of the nations assembled at the San Francisco
Conference signed on September 8, 1951 is an event of great importance for a
variety of reasons. Japan has ceased to be an occupied territory and has once
more resumed her place as a sovereign independent State though with reduced
territory and resources. She lost all her dominions and dependencies, and even
some of the small islands which for ages have been regarded as part and parcel
of the Japanese State have been taken away. Two criticisms have been directed
against the terms of the Treaty–one that it was too severe and one-sided and
another that it was too lenient and that the terms should have been harder. But
both criticisms are highly unrealistic. It is true that Japan has not in
consequence of the Treaty become really independent and sovereign. The Treaty
provides for the stationing of the American forces in and around Japan, the lease
of military bases to the Americans and the virtual continuance of the American
hold over the country–the hold which was obtained by the victory gained in the
second world war. All this means that Japan is as much a satellite of the
United States as is Romania, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet
Russia. Critics therefore ask, where do the independence and sovereignty of
Japan lie? The question is relevant and one has to confess that the Treaty
itself is based on the American view that Japan should serve as her satellite
so far as her foreign policy is concerned, and that she should not be in a
position to remain either neutral or work on the side of the Communist bloc in
the cold war that is now going on. The Japanese are conscious of all this, but
they considered this position to be much better than the continuance of
American military rule and have reconciled themselves to it. There is also the
large amount of internal freedom that they can enjoy as a result of the Treaty.
The argument that the Treaty is too soft and that it enables Japan once more to
become a great military power and a source of aggression to the neighbouring
countries, also contains some truth though there is no fear that all this will
happen in the very near future. Though no limits have been placed on the extent
to which Japan might rearm herself, it will take a long time for her to become
a source of threat and aggression to others. With the loss of her empire she is
not in a position to get the raw materials needed for her industrial expansion,
and without a high degree of industrialisation she cannot hope to become an
aggressive military power. That she is bound to rearm herself goes without
saying. This is the very purpose of the Americans in bringing about the Treaty.
It is their determination to use the potential military resources of Japan in
any future war with China and Soviet Russia that has brought about the Treaty,
and such a purpose will not be served if Japan is kept completely disarmed.
Another reason why the Treaty has been regarded as too soft is that it has not
provided for the payment of any reparations by Japan to the Philippines,
Indonesia, Burma and other countries which suffered damage at her hands in the
war. Here again </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>American pressure and influence have brought
them round–except </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Burma which has not signed the Treaty. They can,
if only they are loyal to the United States, get any amount of economic
aid–much more perhaps than what they can expect from a defeated and
economically ruined Japan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
those who did not sign the Japanese Treaty are India, China, Soviet Russia, and
those States in Central and Eastern Europe which are included in the Soviet
bloc. There is no need to go through the arguments put forward by the
Government of India against the terms of the Treaty. But there is a real
difference between her attitude and the attitude of the Communist States. India
is prepared to enter into bilateral Treaty relations with Japan, and
negotiations for </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>this purpose have already been commenced. Though
India had </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>serious objections to the terms of the Treaty,
and though she did not s</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ign it, she is quite willing to recognise
its results and adjust herself to them. But this is not the position of the
Communist States. They do not want to have any kind of friendly relationship
with a Japan which for all practical purposes has become, in their view, a
dependency of the United States. Here is what a Chinese newspaper has to say
about the Treaty: “The people of South-East Asia realize that the Peace Treaty
with Japan worked out unilaterally by the United states and Britain holds in
prospect for the peoples of South-East Asia not peace but war. They understand
that only the unanimous support of the proposals advanced by the Soviet
Government, their discussion by representatives of all countries which
participated in the war against Japan, and the conclusion of a Peace Treaty
with Japan based on the declarations of the United Nations, the Cairo
declaration, the Yalta agreement and the Potsdam declaration will make it
possible to ensure peace everywhere in Asia and will answer the aspirations of
Asia. The Peace Treaty signified still more intensified remilitarization of
Japan and her conversion into an instrument for carrying out the criminal
policy of war and aggression pursued by the American reactionaries in the Far
East.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
exactly is it that the Japanese Peace Treaty registers in relation to the world
as it is situated today? Japan has entered the American bloc as against the
Soviet bloc. The Treaty has added to the strength of American defences in the
Pacific. Taken along with the pact which America has entered into with the
Philippines, Australia and New Zealand and also along with American control of
Formosa, it has given to the United States an unbroken line of fortified
territories in the Pacific on the Asian side into which it will be difficult
for the Soviet bloc to enter. This completes in a way the steps taken by the
United States to build up her Pacific defences. There is no question of right
or wrong in this connection. The cold war is a fact. It is a fact that there
are two rival worlds. And the Japanese Treaty is an inevitable step that the
United States could not but take to strengthen herself in the cold war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
realises that the Treaty has not brought real peace in the Far East nearer. It
has not solved any of those questions which have created tension there. The
dispute regarding Formosa and the representation of the Communist Government of<i>
</i>China on the Security Council are still there. Above all, the war continues
in Korea. It looks as if the truce talks will be resumed. But will they lead to
a permanent settlement of the Korean question? This is doubtful. Neither party
is anxious for a negotiated peace. Each believes in a military triumph. Peace
based on undisputed military strength and irresistible armaments has now become
the watchword of the Americans. Rightly or wrongly they have come to the
conclusion that right and justice do not prevail out of their inherent
strength. They must be backed up by force. So a peace in Korea will be possible
only when a complete victory is obtained in the battle-field and this will take
a long time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
new crisis has meanwhile developed in the Middle East or the Arab world. Iran
has driven out the British from the Abadan refinery: and the nationalisation of
the oil industry which has been the cause of dispute between Iran and Britain
is now an accomplished fact. Oil is the main source of wealth for Iran; but its
exploitation has rested with the British Oil Company all along. The Company no
doubt has been paying large royalties to the Iranian Government. It was even
willing to recognise the nationalisation of the industry and share half and
half of the profits with the Iranian Government. But the Government wanted to
make the industry a wholly national concern, and reduce the British technicians
to the position of Iranian employees, paying them the salaries they wanted, it
is true, but controlling the whole concern themselves. The British at one stage
threatened that they would fight to defend what they considered to be their
legal and legitimate interests; but wiser counsels prevailed and they did not
resort to arms, which would have meant the flaring up of war not only in Iran
but in the whole of the Middle East–a war which would have converted it into
another Korea. There are in England many critics of the Labour Government who
feel that war should have been resorted to, and that the Government made a
mistake in appeasing the Iranians just as Chamberlain appeased Hitler at
Munich. It is their view that British surrender in Iran is today responsible
for the crisis in Egypt and in the whole of the Middle East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
understanding the situation in the Middle East two or three factors have to be
kept in mind. In the first place all the countries of the Middle East–the whole
Arab world–are now dominated by nationalism. People there are not prepared to
tolerate any kind of external control or influence. They want to get rid of the
last foreigner–the last Englishman in this case–having any influence whatever.
The English know this; so also the Americans. But why do they still want to
exercise control over these countries? It is mainly for strategic reasons. In
the cold war between them and Soviet Russia, they cannot afford to ignore the
strategic importance of this area. If they leave it–as the nationalists want
them to do–a power vacuum will be created and it will be immediately occupied
by Soviet Russia. Communist Governments will be established throughout this
region and this would be a decisive victory for Soviet Russia and an equally
decisive defeat for the Anglo-American bloc. Something is added to all this
tension by the presence of the State of Israel in the midst of the Arab world.
It is a State whose existence is anathema to the Arab States. They are not yet
reconciled to it. And if the Anglo-American influence is wiped out completely
from this area, and if Soviet Russia takes their place, no one can say exactly
what will become of Israel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is thus clear that, in the strategic defences that the Anglo-Americans are
building up with a view to prevent further expansion of Communism, the Middle
East occupies a dominant position. If the Middle East is lost everything else
is lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the reason why the British have resolved on defending their treaty rights in
Egypt at the point of the sword. There are two grounds of dispute in this area.
The Egyptians think it derogatory to their national self-respect that any
British army should be in occupation of the Suez Canal Zone which is a part of
their territory. Secondly they want that the British should leave Sudan, and
that Sudan should be incorporated in the Kingdom of Egypt. This is behind their
cry of the unity of the valley of the Nile. The British are not prepared to
yield on either of the two grounds. If the Middle East is important to them
from the point of view of world strategy, they must fight for retention of
control over it, even if such a course brings them into conflict with Egyptian
nationa1 sentiment. Nationalism they know is a strong force and has to be
recognised. But in the modern age extreme nationalism has its dangers. It is
only some kind of co-operative nationalism that deserves to be encouraged. So
they say that some device has to be adopted which will reconcile the Egyptian
nationalism, which is opposed to the presence of foreign armies in their
territory, and the nationalism of the British and the nationalism of the
Americans which equally feel that, unless their armies are stationed in the Canal
Zone, there is no prospect of their defending the Middle East against Russian
aggression which, according to them, is not an imaginary fear but a reality.
With a view to bring about such a reconciliation they have proposed to create a
common system of Middle East Defence, in which Egypt would have the same place
of equality with Britain, France, and the United States, and any army stationed
in the Canal Zone would not be a British army but an international force
organised for the defence of the Middle East area. It would be something like
the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation under the command of the
Americans, but consisting of regiments supplied by all the Treaty Powers. The
Egyptians however have not accepted these proposals. They fear that this would
amount to joining the Anglo-American bloc as against the Soviet bloc, and they
do not like any such alignment. They would prefer an independent line of
foreign policy. Of course the argument between the two sides can be carried on
indefinitely. Can Egypt afford to pursue an independent line of foreign policy?
Can she maintain her independence if threatened by Soviet moves in the Middle
East? She could not even fight successfully against a small State like Israel.
If the British withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone she might become independent
of Britain, no doubt, but she would, the next day, become dependent on Soviet
Russia. None of the small nations in the world can stand on their own legs with
the two giants. Soviet Russia and the United States, striding over the whole
globe. There is therefore no prospect of the British appeasing the Egyptians.
They have already begun the war on the Canal Zone, and if in the general
elections the Conservatives under the leadership of Winston Churchill come into
office, more warlike efforts will be adopted to strengthen the Middle East
Defences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sudan also the British are not prepared to yield. It is a very important area
for them from the economic as well as the strategic standpoint, and it is their
argument that the Sudanese have to be consulted before they are incorporated in
the Egyptian Kingdom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is one factor in the situation in the Middle East which has added to the
inherent complication characterising it. It is the attitude of the United
States. The Government of the American Republic has not taken any firm line of
action in Iran or in Egypt. There seem to be misunderstandings between Britain
and the United States if there are no serious misunderstandings, the United
States is somehow hesitating to make its position clear. She must be prepared
to shoulder the responsibilities which have so far been borne by Britain. If
Britain withdraws and if Soviet Russia takes her place in the Middle East, the
policy which Truman has all along followed to arrest the further expansion of
Communism will be a failure. It is true that taking up the side of Britain in
the Iranian oil issue would have created difficulties for the Americans in
Saudi Arabia and other parts of Western Asia where they have similar oil concessions;
but yielding to the Iranian Government would also mean encouraging the
Government of other Arab States to put forward schemes of nationalisation. In
this situation the Americans would have done well in adopting a more positive
line of action in Iran and Egypt which they have so far<i> </i>failed to do.
The sooner the Americans enter into an understanding with </span><span

British and the French on all the Middle Eastern issues the better it will be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is all the more necessary as supplementing the action which they recently took
in admitting Turkey and Greece to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,
though they are so far away from<i> </i>the North Atlantic. This was done in
the interests of strategy. The next few months are bound to be critical.
Everything depends on the course of the resumed peace talks in Korea and on the
way in which the war situation in Egypt develops. If the talks fail or if the
situation in Egypt takes a turn for the worse, the war area of the </span><span

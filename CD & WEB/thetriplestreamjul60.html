<h2 style='text-align:justify'>Opposing the Congress </h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>While the view
is being expressed in certain quarters that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> ought to evolve into a
party-less democracy, an increasing volume of public opinion s in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of the traditional system of party Government based
on the British model. A multiplicity of parties, some of them of the nature of
‘groups’, is doubtless an evil, militating against stability and orderly progress.
But two or three well-defined parties accepting the democratic way of life, and
pledged to constitutional methods for the achievement of political and economic
programmes, must always be welcome. The growth of an all-powerful monolithic
party which tends to swallow all rival claimants to power, proved dangerous in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and her
satellite countries. The sponsors of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are convinced that, unless an effective opposition to the Congress Party is <span
class=SpellE>organised</span>, the present ruling party may eventually become
an authoritarian organisation, shutting out all possibility of another
constitutional, <span class=GramE>democratic party</span> providing an
alternative Government. The Communist Party which is not wedded to
non-violence, and actually fosters extra-territorial loyalties, may in a few
years <span class=SpellE>canalise</span> the growing discontent with the
present regime and capture power. That would mean the end of true democracy in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Such is
the justification for the formation of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party under the guidance of Sri C. Rajagopalachari, a former Congress veteran
and an elder statesman of the front rank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to the thesis of the new party, there is no vital difference between the social
and economic objectives of the Congress and those of the Communists. State action
for the ultimate realisation of a classless society is envisaged by both. The
difference lies only in the method of attaining the goal. The Congress pins its
faith to parliamentary procedure, but where a considerable minority is opposed
to its policies of <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> and State
Socialism, that minority will be obliged to submit to the coercive power of the
State veiled by legal forms. The</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Communists
would in similar circumstances resort to naked force. Parties like the
Socialists and the <span class=SpellE>praja</span> Socialists are at present
opposed to the Congress as well as to the Communists. But being pledged to the
cause of Socialism they cannot possibly welcome the new <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party. In the view of <i>all </i>these parties, the new party is the symbol of
reaction and conservatism. Its plea for individual enterprise and for the
preservation of private properly, unimpaired by the impact of <span
class=GramE>socialists</span> dogma, is virtually a challenge to the programme
which the Socialists hold dear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
the next general elections of 1962, there is bound to be a re-alignment of
parties. All Congressmen are not avowed Socialists. There are several among
them who have serious misgivings about the type of Socialism which is hardly
different from State Capitalism. They are perturbed by the growing power of the
official hierarchy which indulges in reckless expenditure without displaying
adequate efficiency in the actual implementation of the Five Year Plans. They
realise too that the middle-class intelligentsia and the self-employed farmers
and artisans will soon be swept out of existence, unless they can find an
effective means of having their point of view pressed on the nation’s attention
through <span class=SpellE>organised</span> political action in a democratic
manner. Such Congressmen will walk over into the new party and function as the
natural leaders of the professional classes and of the large sections of the
lower middle class, whether they are in business or <span class=SpellE>farmings</span>.
There will be a countervailing accession of strength to the ranks of
Congressmen from large numbers of the present Communist Party who must deem it
their duty to fight the “forces of reaction” represented by a growing <span
class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party. In this process, they might become more
nationalist-minded and forswear their allegiance to International Communism. Under
such conditions the Socialist Parties may find it proper to give up their
separate identity and align themselves with the Neo-Congress organisation
standing definitely for Socialism and drawing into its fold all the elements in
the national life believing in Socialism as a way of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this analysis of the situation is correct, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> will soon have two leading
political parties wedded to the democratic process–the Congress corresponding
to the Labour Party of Britain and the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party corresponding to the Conservatives. There will always be a sprinkling of
representatives of the extreme Left–the Communists,–and of the extreme
Right–the communalists and the remnants of the old capitalist groups. But the
Congress and the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> will be the main parties
of the Centre, providing by turns the effective means of preserving civil order
and liberty, and functioning as the Government of the day according to the
shifts of public opinion expressed during Parliamentary elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The flare-up of linguistic fanaticism in different
parts of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, notably in
the Punjab and in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Assam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is a significant pointer. While the Constitution of India <span class=SpellE>recognises</span>
fourteen principal languages and seeks to foster them in their respective
regions, the linguistic minorities in each area continue to present a
complicated problem. Andhra Pradesh wisely <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
Urdu as one of the State languages and set an example to the rest of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In the
Punjab, Hindi in the <span class=SpellE>Devanagari</span> script and Punjabi in
the <span class=SpellE>Gurumukhi</span> script were <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
as State languages, but the leaders of the predominantly Hindi region of <st1:place
w:st="on">East Punjab</st1:place> were unwilling to abide by the rule which
required their children to learn Punjabi as a compulsory second language. This,
among others, was a reason for some of the Sikh leaders starting an agitation
for a Punjabi <span class=SpellE>Suba</span>. Sri <span class=SpellE>Pratap</span>
Singh <span class=SpellE>Kairon</span> is trying to restore peace through a new
formula designed to allay the fears of the Sikhs regarding the place which
Punjabi should occupy. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Assam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Congress Ministry took steps to declare Assamese as the State language in
certain important areas, leaving Bengali as the principal language in others.
The leaders of the Bengali minority were not satisfied with the safeguards
provided by the Ministry for the protection of their language. Passions rose
high and an unprecedented reign of terror followed. Large numbers of the
Bengali residents of the State who had lived there for generations were obliged
to seek refuge in <st1:place w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place>. From the Prime
Minister of India down to the common citizens in all parts of India, every one
feels strongly that at long last a limit must be set to such exhibitions of
temper over an issue which needs calm, dispassionate thinking. It is not the
immediate question of a State language which occupied the attention of the
disorderly elements on either side. The occasion was availed of to fan into
flame the grievances of previous years and the rivalries that <span
class=SpellE>smoulder</span> beneath the surface. It is important to remember
that any citizen of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is entitled to reside, carry on business, and seek employment in any part of
it. In his own interest he will develop cordial relations with the inhabitants
of the area, pick up their language, and let his children be taught through it
except in the elementary stage. But where hundreds of thousands speaking a
particular language have for long been settled in a region, it is unfair to
force a language other than their own mother-tongue on the children and impose
a second-class citizenship on them in the event of their failure to learn it at
short notice. This seems to be the case in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Assam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. There has been a
long-standing prejudice against the Bengali language which was supposed to have
gained <span class=GramE>a predominance</span> over the native Assamese in the
realms of literature and public life. This prejudice found sudden and violent
expression during recent weeks. If people speaking two different Indian
languages cannot learn to live as friendly neighbours in any State of the
Indian Union, the very concept of an all-India citizenship will receive a
severe blow, and Indians will become aliens in parts of their own Motherland.
Most Indian languages owe a great deal to the <span class=SpellE>Sanskritic</span>
cultural tradition. There is a community of literary taste and spiritual
outlook which needs to be stressed far more than is being done at present. The
poets and the artists must make it their special vocation to cultivate an
all-India outlook and promote inter-linguistic harmony. They, even more than
the politicians, ought to be the promoters of good will. If the litterateurs of
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Assam</st1:place></st1:country-region>–both
<span class=SpellE>Bengalees</span> and Assamese-can develop a common
allegiance and pay common homage to <span class=SpellE>Shanker</span> Dev and <span
class=SpellE>Chandi</span> Das, the rest of the population will imbibe the new
spirit. At the moment this seems a distant dream. But it is a supremely worth
while one, and the very process of dreaming may bring the reality into being
sooner than we dare hope. </p>

is now more than half-a-century since Sri G. <span class=SpellE>Harisarvottama</span>
Rao was sentenced to three years’ hard <span class=SpellE>labour</span> for
publishing ‘seditious’ articles in a Telugu weekly, the ‘Swarajya’ of
Vijayawada. He took his M. A. degree in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
with Telugu and Kannada as his special study. He had to prepare a thesis in
English, and he chose for his theme “A neglected Emperor-Poet”, <span
class=SpellE>Krishnadeva</span> <span class=SpellE>Raya</span> of Vijayanagara.
This brought him fame as a literary critic of high quality. Young and talented,
Rao was expected to carry everything before him. He chose teaching for his
profession and was getting trained for it in the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Government</st1:PlaceName>

and Masulipatam to their depths Rao took a prominent part in the local
agitation against Principal Mark Hunter who refused permission to students to
wear ‘<span class=SpellE>Vande</span> Mataram’ lockets on their coats. Rao was
‘rusticated’, and his career took an unexpected twist. He turned to journalism
as a mission and his ‘Swarajya’ soon gained prominence as an exponent of the
ardent nationalism of the years 1907 to 1909. His writing was charged with
emotion. The local officials were upset and hauled him up for sedition. The
District Judge of Masulipatam, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kershasp</span>, a <span
class=SpellE>Parsi</span> member of the Indian Civil Service, took a lenient
view and awarded a light sentence. But the Government of Madras appealed to the
High Court and got the sentence enhanced to three years rigorous imprisonment.
Rao thus became an early hero in the freedom struggle and underwent the <span
class=SpellE>rigours</span> of prison life at a time when political prisoners
enjoyed no amenities and were just ‘</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

his release, Rao found himself in a strange new world. The ‘extremist’ leaders
of the Nationalist movement were either in prison or in exile. ‘Moderate’
politics became the vogue. It was difficult for Rao to make a living, for no
employer playing for safety could take an ex-prisoner on to his staff. It was
reserved for the noble-hearted <span class=GramE>founder of the ‘Andhra <span

started <span class=GramE>on his own</span> and founded independent weeklies,
once in English and again in Telugu. They were exceedingly good papers but
never paid their way. On occasions, Rao forfeited heavy deposits to the
Magistracy. He was in the Home Rule and Non-co-operation movements, and wrote
books on politics and biographies of Annie Besant and Abraham Lincoln. He was
in the Madras Legislature in the <span class=SpellE>Swarajist</span> epoch
along with C. R. Reddy and <span class=SpellE>Satyamurti</span>. In later days,
he was prominently associated with the library movement in Andhra. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to a ripe old age, Rao passed away recently. His was a career <span
class=SpellE>chequered</span> beyond description, but always filled with the
desire to render self-less service. He struggled continuously against poverty,
and failure. The recognition that was his due never came to him. He was a
person of unbending rectitude and would not submit to the whims of those who
were in a position to confer <span class=SpellE>favours</span>. His patriotism
and scholarship, his sterling character and readiness to sacrifice his personal
interests were in evidence in his many undertakings. But he was a lonely figure
in public life, standing apart from influential groups of fellow-workers, and
always intent on pursuing his own individual bent. Such men win more respect
than affection. But lives like <span class=SpellE>Sarvottama</span> <span
class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> are part of a nation’s heritage, and the heroism
which is the chief characteristic of their outer activity is indeed a symbol of
the spiritual urges sustaining and uplifting man in moments of utter darkness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

most urgent task of our times is beyond doubt to create a citizen of world
loyalty whose allegiance is not confined to narrow national frontiers. We all
realize that the rapid growth of science and technology rendered the need for
world peace imperative in a nuclear age. The great process of the coming
together of the peoples everywhere has come to <span class=GramE>stay,</span>
and nothing can prevent it from continuing and growing, in any foreseeable
future. As the <span class=GramE>world</span> is fast shrinking and all nations
have to live together, nationalism is clearly impossible of practice. The
claims of World Government under the aegis of a global community are
indisputable, and they can no longer be ignored or postponed. One World has
ceased to be a dream; it is now a reality. “I will not like to live in this
world”, declared Gandhi “if it is not to be one.” And he added: “Certainly I
should like to see this dream realized in my lifetime.” <sup>1</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the preservation of man’s spirit and the unification of mankind through his
chosen means of non-violence. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His oft-repeated insistence on the
self-sufficiency of the village was nothing more than a specific prescription
for curing Indian economy of its many chronic maladies and should not be
regarded as a universal panacea for all the ills of the world. Regional
self-sufficiency was advocated by him only with regard to the material welfare.
It would lose its justification if it were extended to all other spheres of
life. If its strict application was insisted on<i> </i>in cultural and
intellectual matters, it would amount to a most deplorable stagnation of the
human mind. Autarky–in the sense of ‘closing of the doors’, might be valid in a
given context for the objective of providing the material interests but it
might well produce very undesirable results if it is maintained even with
reference to intellectual development. Gandhi would, therefore, regard the
village as his world for material things; but for the things of the mind he
would take the world as his village. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

concern to give a national orientation to the culture of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is more
meaningful in the light of this cardinal feature of his thought. The basic
requirements that are needed to make an Indian culture truly Indian are never
missed by him at any time. During his fateful association with the Indian
people for a long period, he never discarded his adherence to the fundamental
values that are sanctioned by the culture of his country through- out the ages.
He upheld them always, and did not swerve from<i> </i>his path amidst any
crisis. Gandhi first sought to build a solid structure for the culture of his
nation, and he proceeded to raise a secure foundation for the culture of the
world mainly on the national basis of his country’s culture. It was the
uniqueness of Gandhi that he admitted no division between the pursuit of the
national good and the service of all nations at large. He recognized no final
and rigid differences between the culture of his people and the culture of
other peoples. He found a natural harmony between them and, therefore, he
always strove for synthesis and not conflict. Gandhi served, in the words of
Ernest Barker, “as a bridge and reconciler”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:

was Gandhi’s image of Indian culture? He never subscribed to a narrow view in
this respect. The validity of an Indian culture was always cherished by him but
he refused to identify it with, what has come to be known in certain circles
as, Aryan or Hindu culture. It is worthwhile to recall his categorical
repudiation of this mythical species in his own words. Gandhi contended: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
concept of Indian culture, according to Gandhi, should be a blend or harmonious
composition of different elements in Indian life. Only a composite or
cosmopolitan culture could be entitled to represent the culture of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. As it
had ever been the accredited land of many races and groups from the beginning
of its recorded history, it would violate its own nature and defeat its
self-ordained purpose if it tried to lay stress exclusively on any one aspect
of its cultural heritage. Exclusiveness is the genesis of intolerance; and
cultural intolerance is the ultimate source of national disasters. Also, a
culture worth its name must inevitably learn to absorb and assimilate live
influences from other cultures; and habits of positive tolerance and active
sympathy are crucial for its survival and growth. “No culture can live” as
Gandhi proclaimed, “if it attempts to be exclusive.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
regards the viability of Indian culture, Gandhi believed that it “is in the
making.” It is still in the process of its formation because the clashes and
conflicts between several groups and peoples are not yet resolved to produce “a
blend of all the cultures”. He resolutely maintained that the various and
different systems and their respective cultures should be allowed to have their
full interplay in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
At the same time all care and concern should be exercised to find sources of
reconciliation and bonds of friendship. On the question of <i>lingua franca </i>for
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Gandhi commended neither Hindi nor any other language but a common mixture of
Hindi and Urdu languages, popularly known as <i>Hindustani. </i>In our <span
class=SpellE>endeavour</span> to evolve a national culture for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, an
incessant stress on points of divergence would only lead to distrust and
friction. It will certainly mean the end of diversity and its very existence.
What is more helpful is to find out ways and means of unity that ever exist
between different cultures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Holding
this broad perspective as he did, Gandhi’s attitude to different religions and
philosophies was one of neither simple acceptance <span class=GramE>nor</span>
of complete rejection. He responded to his own religion with characteristic
devotion. But his Hinduism was no sectarian principle, and he also chose to be
its foremost reformer when he was confronted with an unforgivable evil like
untouchability at its core. He challenged the sanction of Hinduism for this
practice and waged a heroic battle against the orthodox exponents of his
religion when they would support it. Again, when it was pointed out to Gandhi
that ‘Gita’, the central doctrinal source of Hinduism, preached violence, he
contested the authenticity of this view. He argued that it did not preach
violence but actually sanctioned non-violence; and he himself reinterpreted the
classic for this pre-eminent purpose. Gandhi was not a traditionalist in the
accepted sense of the term. He was willing to discard the traditions and
conventions if they did not conform to his highest truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
similar non-conformist method was discernible in Gandhi’s approach to other
religions like Christianity and Islam. His encounter with the Sermon on the
Mount at an early and impressionable age was recounted in a moving reference by
Gandhi himself in his Autobiography.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
His attachment to the Christian hymns was well known. But he disapproved of the
attempts of the Christian missionaries towards <span class=SpellE>proselytization</span>
and insisted on nobody’s conversion to any other’s religion. He claimed that
Jesus was a <span class=SpellE><i>Satyagrahi</i></span><i> </i>and rejected the
conventional inactivity of the Christian groups on the issue of pacifism and resistance
to war. Similarly, he remained the most invincible votary of Hindu-Muslim unity
and did not give up his faith in it till the end of his life. Indeed, it was
for the cause of Hindu-Muslim concord that Gandhi laid down his life. Gandhi
deduced the Gospel of Non-violence as freely from Koran as from the Gita. He
refused to believe that Islam sanctioned </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>violence and
passionately voiced his conviction that the great religion of the Prophet
proclaimed the lessons of compassion and peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will be seen that Gandhi did not remain an uncritical votary of any religious
faith. Much as he accepted a great deal of religion, he also took up the role
of a reformer and revolutionary if it was necessary. Gandhi’s reactions to
various religions could well be regarded, in the language of Arnold <span
class=SpellE>Toynbee</span>, as continuous alterations between response and
challenge. He responded to the call of agreement for his cause, but he
challenged the basis of opposition to his conviction. The resultant effect of
such a live process in Gandhi’s thought is obvious in the natural culmination
of a harmony and unity. As Gandhi himself stated, he stood for a “synthesis of
the different cultures that have come to stay in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, that have influenced Indian
life, and that, in their turn, have themselves been influenced by the spirit of
the soil”.<sup> 5</sup> Gandhi’s vision of Indian culture is as symbolic of the
genius of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as of the spirit of its culture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

culture, before it claims all nations, must be rooted in a nation. An
appreciation of the culture of other nations and peoples flows from a basic
understanding of the culture of one’s own. Without the foundation of a national
culture, an attempt to erect an international or world culture will be futile.
The freedom of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> is
indispensable in Gandhi’s view because that is the only basis for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s service
of humanity. Conflict between nationalism and internationalism did not arise in
the case of Gandhi who found an organic correlation between them.

nationalism. Gandhi says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was with this anguish for peace that Gandhi wrote his historic letter to Herr
Hitler on 23rd July 1939 when he implored him not to “reduce humanity to the
savage state” by waging a war. He condemned the conquest of Abyssinia by
Mussolini in emphatic terms, and urged the victims of aggression everywhere in <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> not to yield to physical force but resist it by <i>Satyagraha.
</i>His recipe was non-violent resistance against the aggressor, and he
commended this method to Indians and foreigners alike. The brave Poles and
Czechs, the Jews and the Negroes–and all members of the oppressed humanity
received the same counsel of heroic conduct amidst the crisis. Gandhi had
succeeded in <span class=SpellE>indentifying</span> himself with every one
anywhere in the world. During the fateful decade from 1930 to 1940, he found
himself an uncompromising champion of pacifism and internationalism. One of the
remarkable characteristics of his internationalist creed was that he desired to
further internationalism through the means of pacifism. Alternately, his
outspoken pacifism in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and abroad at this time was noteworthy for its increasing stress on
internationalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

internationalism was rooted in his pacifism. His love of mankind sprang from
his devotion to non-violence. And the sustaining force of his creed, universal
brotherhood, was derived from a synthesis of all religions. Gandhi was neither
just a Hindu nor a Christian. And he was certainly much more than an Indian. He
felt that he was as much an Englishman as he was an Indian. When Mr. Louis
Fischer met Gandhi for the first time in 1942 at <span class=SpellE>Sevagram</span>,
he noticed a decoration on the mud walls of his </span><span style='font-size:

Jesus was seen with the inscription “He is our Peace”. Mr. Fischer enquired
about it and reminded him that he was not a Christian. “I am a Christian, and a

world culture can function in the present circumstances only as a humanistic
culture. The most cardinal feature of it must be based on the integral nature
of man. Kant long ago stated that every man is an end in himself. Can we now
say the same thing in terms of a nation? We are still far away from the
position when we can believe that every nation is an end in itself. At a time
when the people everywhere are engaged in the reconstruction of the world order
and the experiments of World Government, the question about the place of a
nation and the nature of its culture is a pertinent one. Gandhi’s <i>weltanschauung
</i>of culture is much relevant in this context when the union of all nations
is being deliberated. While the unification of mankind must go on, no effort
must be spared to preserve the identity and culture of every nation. It will be
a grievous mistake if the unity of the world is reduced to the uniformity of
the world. Similarly, the anxiety of all nations and peoples to merge
themselves into a worth while world order will not be complete and successful
if the diversity of every group and nation is not scrupulously and willingly
maintained. An over-zealous sacrifice of the diversity of individual or nation
at the altar of a rigid uniformity is bound to be followed by regrettable
consequences. Diversity in unity and unity in diversity is a valid maxim for a
nation, and it is no less relevant for the world. The enemies of culture,
whether national or international, are the forces of divergence and uniformity
under whatever disguise they may function. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

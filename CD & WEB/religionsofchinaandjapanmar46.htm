mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Confucius was born in 551 B. C. in the little state
of Lu (China), in the province of Shan-tung. Of his early life nothing is
known. But he began teaching at the age of 22 and many pupils gathered round
him. He studied history, literature and ancient customs. While young, he
visited the capital of China and there had the opportunity of seeing the great
sacrifices to Heaven and Earth being performed. He saw the court and the
Emperor and had access to the archives and thus came into touch with the
ancient literature of China. At the age of fifty he was made a magistrate and
put the principles of administration into practice and made the city a model
town. He was then raised to the office of the Minister of Justice and became an
adviser to the duke or the governor. He resigned his office and took to
wandering from court to court, giving advice to princes and rulers. He died in
478 B. C. at the age of 73. He was as a matter of fact a contemporary of
Buddha, and little knew at the time that Buddhism would hold sway in his
country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It must be clearly understood that Confucius does
not stand to this religion in the same relation as Buddha does to Buddhism or
Muhammad to Muhammedanism. He was not the founder of a religion and not even a
reformer in the ordinary sense of the word. For twenty centuries in China,
however, he has been a great authority on religion, ethics and politics and the
whole education of China has been through the literature given by Confucius. He
was not a speculative thinker, discussing problems like the origin of the
universe, the nature of being, the one and the many, which exercised the minds
of the philosophers of Greece and India. His commonsense philosophy dealt exclusively
with the practical questions of ethics and politics. “To him God was
essentially the moral order of the world, an order energizing in the phenomena
of nature as well as in the course of history and the destiny of individual
lives.” This corresponds to the idea expressed by Keshub Chander Sen, who says
that we can see God’s hand working in nature, in human history and in the heart
of man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the ethics of Confucius, virtues like filial
piety occupy a high place. A son is required to obey his father while he lives
and to respect him when he is dead. Filial piety and fraternal love are the
root of benevolence according to Confucius. Benevolence must not, however,
transgress the limits of equity. “Requite injury with justice and kindness with
kindness,” was the teaching of Confucius. Men should deal with men as Heaven
deals with them according to their deserts, said he. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A fundamental doctrine of Confucian ethics is that
the nature of man is good. It is through faulty education and bad example that
man deteriorates. He must by his own effort develop a stable good character and
to achieve this he must have a strong will and a true ideal. The object of
Confucius was to produce the “Superior man,” the man who knew the right thing
and did it, a man of faultless virtues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Conflicting theories of ethics were enunciated by
the contemporaries of Confucius, some advocating pessimism and others radical
altruism. In the end Confucius got a supporter in Mencius, a disciple who
earned a place next in honour to the Master. He passed from city to city,
teaching his disciples, including the princes, the enlightened principles of
government on which the prosperity of states depended and giving sound advice
on the ethics of private life and on conduct of affairs, like the wandering
sophists among the Greeks. His works surpass even those of Confucius in logical
acumen and in systematic presentation and he followed the method of Socrates,
when he employed the dialogue form. A Chinese scholar who compares Mencius with
Confucius says: “Confucius spoke only of benevolence, but as soon as Mencius
opens his mouth, we hear of benevolence and righteousness. Confucius spoke of
the will or mind, but Mencius enlarged also on the cultivation of emotions.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The tomb of Confucius is one of the holiest places
in China and there are temples in every city, which are dedicated to him. They
are on the same general pattern with a series of courts leading to the central
hall known as the Hall of the Great Perfection. The orthodox religion of the
people of China and the religion of the State with all its officials and of the
whole literate class is commonly known as Confucianism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Confucian orthodoxy prevailed for many
centuries in China and the religion of China became stagnant. Its supremacy was
challenged by Taoism, founded by Lao-tse an older contemporary of Confucius.
Tao in the Chinese language literally means the ‘way’. In the Confucian
literature the word is used for the “Way of heaven”. The Taoist Scripture is
known as <i>Tao-teh-king</i>. The book is divided into two parts, the first
part being predominantly metaphysical and the second ethical and political.
Lao-tse was the first great thinker of China who tried to penetrate into the
ultimate reality behind the world of appearance, the one behind the many. His
discoveries correspond to the teachings of the Upanishads among the Hindus.
According to the teachings of this great sage, the Absolute in itself is
unknowable, but its operations in the phenomenal world are within men’s
knowledge. Lao-tse says, that intelligent observation discovers in these
operations a constant characteristic, a way or method, in which we can discern
a Being unnameable and for the sake of convenience we call him Tao or the Way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This method or norm of the universe is to serve as
a pattern for man’s conduct. The cosmic principle comes to be the ethical
principle or <i>teh</i>, virtue. Then man not only knows the Tao, who is
transcendent but has it in himself. The wise man is he who does not meddle with
the established order of the world, nor does he impede it. Taoism advocates
quietism and cultivates inaction, passivity and gentleness. Lao-tse says: “The
wise man does not accumulate. The more he expends for others the more does he
possess his own, the more he gives to others, the more does he have himself.”
Again he says, “As gentleness overcomes force and weakness strength, so evil is
overcome by good”. Unlike Confucius he holds that injury should be recompensed
with kindness. He thought that China suffered from over- government and so he
said that the best government was that which governed the least. He regarded
war as a great calamity and was opposed to capital punishment. He was for a
return to the state of nature, in which lay the salvation of the state as well
as the individual according to him. In short Taoism was a way to attain perfect
blessedness. When universal law is the law of one’s being, he is one with the
universe. There is a glow of mystic emotion noticeable in the teachings of
Lao-tse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Such philosophy, however, did not make much appeal
to the masses of men. Many speculative thinkers and mystically minded people or
contemplative recluses accepted Taoism at the time and are even now following
that faith. The Taoist holy men took to a hermit life and on the top of it came
the Buddhist example, which accentuated monasticism among the Chinese. The
Taoist monasteries and nunneries were modeled after the Buddhist pattern. These
monasteries have, however, now disappeared. There was a time when the Taoists
had their pontiff or pope who had not much authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Three foreign religions have in different ages
established themselves in China, Buddhism, Muhammedanism and Christianity. The
last two have remained foreign and have exerted very little influence on
Chinese thought, but Buddhism has been so naturalised that it is considered one
of the three religions of the country and has contributed much to its composite
faith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Chinese came into contact with the Buddhists in
the second century B. C. During the next three centuries Buddhism made gradual
progress in China, till in the fourth century A. D. many monasteries were
erected. The Buddhist literature was translated into Chinese by Indian scholars
and Chinese began to visit the places sacred to Buddha and studied the religion
in the place of its birth. The most famous of these pilgrims was Fah-hien who
traveled all over India for fourteen years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Chinese temperament had very little affinity with
the doctrine of Buddha which was based on profound pessimism, while the people
of China had a practical turn of mind. Buddha himself had put aside the
metaphysical questions and gave the way of individual salvation. The followers
were not satisfied and they filled the void by adoration of the Buddha and the
holy ones and popular gods of India and of the regions beyond. Even the
superstitions of the masses found their way into the new faith and a backdoor
was opened for the entrance of magic into Buddhism. Buddhism denied everything
worth having–life, wealth, children; it offered in exchange deliverance from
world misery, of which the Chinese people, simple as they were quite unaware.
They could not understand its metaphysic, and the idle, unsocial and uncivil
life of the monks had no appeal for them. The Chinese had been worshipping the
spirits of their ancestors and the Buddhist missionaries described in detail
the state of departed spirits, the blessedness of the good in heaven and the
torments of hell. This attracted them and then the temples, monasteries, and ceremonial
attracted those who had an emotional or aesthetic disposition. Again, Buddhism
was very accommodating in admitting the native gods and it awakened the soul of
the people in a manner that the old religion could not. Thus Buddhism spread
and spread till it put into shade both Confucianism and Taoism. But a reaction
set in and there was terrible persecution On the part of the state officials
and the followers of the original faiths of China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In China the common people go to temples where
images of gods made of wood or pottery are set up. Lighted sticks of incense
are set up and there are vases of flowers and a table for offerings. The gods
are also worshipped in the homes of the people. Pilgrimages procession,
festivals and ceremonies are resorted to. Images, pictures on the walls and
tablets of ancestors are worshipped in shrines as well as in homes. People are
ignorant and superstitious and have faith in magic and charms. The masses are
leavened with Buddhist ideas, but Taoism and Confucianism wield a strong
influence. The worship of ancestors has lost none of its importance in China.
The religion of the Chinese people is primitive and not based on the Chinese
classics and Christian missionaries meet with great difficulties when they give
them Christianity. In some parts of China, Islam has spread with wonderful
rapidity.</p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The old State religion of Japan is known as
Shintoism. Its palmy days extended from the seventh to the twelfth century A.
D. Shinto literally means the “Way of the gods.” The gods in the Shinto faith
are of two kinds (1) Nature-gods and (2) Man-gods, the first being the result
of personification and the second of definition. The Shinto gods belong mostly
to the second category and, according to some, Shintoism is mere ancestor
worship; but nature worship was common among the ancient Japanese. We find such
deities as Sun, Moon, Earth, Sea, Rain-storm, Fire and Thunder etc.,
corresponding to Vedic gods. Both categories of deities, Man and Nature have
again three sub-divisions as they are the deities of individuals, classes or
qualities. All these are exemplified in the Shinto faith. The Sun, which by the
way, is a goddess, represents an individual object. The god of Trees represents
a class and there is the god of Growth, which is an abstract quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

material objects or phenomena of nature are regarded as persons exactly in the
same way that Vedic gods are believed to have a spirit. Shintoism is therefore
a highly polytheistic faith and numbers its deities by hundred, but it has no
idols. The two kinds of Gods–Nature-gods and Man-gods are merged under the one
term <i>Kami </i>which means a god in the Japanese language. Almost any <i>Kami
</i>or god may send rain, bestow prosperity in trade, cure sickness etc.,
without much discrimination of function. So the Shinto gods are beneficent
gods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other countries, which shows that the human mind works almost in the same way
everywhere. The Japanese believe that the inanimate universe is instinct with
sentient life. To them the Sun and the wind and the Sea were gods who could
hear and answer prayers and exercise a providential care over mankind. But the
synthesis of these and other aspects of nature into one divine whole is
wanting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Japan, is the Principle of the divine right of kings. This survives even today
in Japan although Europe gave it up long ago. The Mikados or the Japanese
emperors derive their authority from their ancestor, the Sun-goddess, which has
been deified. The Imperial dynasty is also supposed to be descended from the
Storm-god, which accounts for the development of Japan as a great naval power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Shinto Pantheon and is described as the Ruler of Heaven and is unrivalled in
dignity. She wears royal insignia and is surrounded by a court. She is not an
autocrat, but has a council of the gods which decides important matters. The
moon deity is masculine, while stars are not given much importance. Of course
the Rain or Storm-god occupies the same place as Rudra does in the Vedic
Pantheon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

place in the Shinto Pantheon. Then there are the sea-gods and river-gods etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not clearly differentiated. The Department of Religion was like a Government
Bureau. The shrine and the palace have the same word in the Japanese language
and so the wood for Shinto festival corresponds to the word for government. The
Mikado or the Emperor is both the high priest as well as the sovereign the
nation. All Shinto priests are appointed by the government and the need not be
celebrates, nor need they wear any special sacerdotal costume. They only read
the litanies and sees to the repair of the shrines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

divine worship. It is only a sign of respect and reverence for the dead, which
is a common feature of all religions. It does not involve any superstitious
belief in supernatural power exercised by dead forefathers or heroes. In the
Shinto religion bowing is the common form of respect. It is the custom to bow
twice before and after making an offering. The Japanese do not prostrate
themselves before a shrine. Offerings made are also token of respect and are
not supposed to be eaten or worn by the deity. The object is to propitiate the
god or to expiate for sins. The shrines are tiny structures easily
transportable in a cart or in a wheel-barrow. There are thousands of such
shrines in Japan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

prayers. There are liturgies or official prayers known as <i>Norito </i>addressed
by the Mikado to various gods. These prayers take the form of petitions for
rain in time of drought, good harvests, preservation from fire, flood and
earthquake. In short, all prayers are for material blessings only. Pilgrimages
are also made to certain shrines. There is an elaborate ceremonial at certain
times of the year when the Emperor makes offerings to the gods. In many private
houses there is a god-shelf where a piece of wood from a big shrine like the
Ises and tickets with the names of any gods whom the household worships are
kept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Buddhism was introduced into Japan in the sixth
century, but it had very little influence on the nature religion. Two centuries
later the Buddhist missionaries did with Japan what they had done with China.
The true Shinto faith of ancient Japan was gradually absorbed by Buddhism. The
Emperors also became Buddhists and the Shinto ceremonies were either abandoned
or performed by Buddhist monks who took possession of the Shinto Shrines and
celebrated Buddhist rites in them. Attempts have been made to revive the
ancient Shinto faith but without any marked success. The reason is that higher
religious and mortal ideas of India and China and from civilised Europe of
today have come to stay in Japan. In the absence of a code of morals and an
efficient ecclesiastical organization and with little aid from the arts of
painting, sculpture and architecture and without a sacred literature, no
religion can flourish in our times, much less can purely national religion
survive the onslaughts of faiths which have elements of universality. Shintoism
in Japan is, therefore, doomed to extinction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

derived from a Chinese word meaning “Way of the gods” Shintoism is derived from
the native polytheistic nature and ancestor worship of the island. When Buddhism
was introduced into Japan in the Sixth Century B. C. its spread rivaled that of
Shinto, and led to religious faction, until at last the Buddhist priesthood
identified their gods with those of the Shinto Pantheon, developing the
intermediate faith known as Ryobu-Shinto. But in the last century Shintoism was
once more officially separated from Buddhism and proclaimed as the sole
religion of the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Shintoism is a household religion, and every
Japanese family has its small shrines or tablets inscribed with the names of
certain deities, kept on a shelf in one room of the house, to which votive
offerings are daily made. It is a cult rich in festivals–at blossoming time and
harvest, at the ingathering of the rice and the New Year and in honour of local
deities, who on these occasions are carried in processions, accompanied by
music and dancing. Besides the temple festivals, others are celebrated in the
sacred hall of the imperial palace where stands an altar to the Sun-goddess in
which the Emperor himself takes part. Shintoism is a relic of spirit worship,
and appears to be an atrophied form of that phase of the evolution of religion
in which the animistic spirit had as yet scarcely evolved into the God. (From
“Spirit of the East” by Ikbal Ali Shah).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

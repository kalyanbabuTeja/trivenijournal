mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Let us start from the point that the signs of change
are indeed there. With the energies liberated by independence, with the
conception of planning translated into five-year plans, with help received from
abroad after the war and fortunes made at home during it, governments,
businessmen and industrialists alike set to build an impressive structure of
industrial production for the country. In agriculture some progress was made,
but largely by engineers who started building woks of irrigation. There had
been Indian industrialists of vision like <span class=SpellE>Jamshedji</span>
rata, a pioneer in steel and electricity. After independence, a number of <span
class=GramE>hydro-electric</span> and thermal projects were planned, and today
the power generated is two and half times what it was in 1951. Electric grids
span the country, and the demand outruns the supply. Steel will soon be
produced in large quantities at the different steel mills in the establishment
of which <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> have helped. Industrial
production has increased several-fold in other ways. Thus, chemicals, cement
and paper are more than two times, sugar was just under two times, and machine
tools and other engineering parts as many as three times, their level of
production only nine years ago, i.e., at the beginning of the First Five-Year
Plan. There is an unmistakable air of prosperity among industrial workers, and
generally in towns and cities. In the countryside too where irrigation is
available or cash crops are grown or the food crops are surplus to requirements
there is agricultural prosperity. The cultivator, especially the one who owns
more than just a few acres of land, is on the whole better off than in the
past. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nor
is the progress merely quantitative. Industries have shown that they can adapt
themselves to new technical and managerial</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> techniques at all
levels. Skilled workers in factories and workshops have surprised competent
observers by the degree of craftsmanship which they have acquired within a
short period in lines with which they were unfamiliar only a few years ago. Nor
does this apply to the bigger industrial <span class=GramE>units</span>
only–textile, engineering or chemical–but to numerous medium and small concerns
which are rapidly being set up all over the country. One may visit any
exhibition of small industries in any part of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and be amazed at the number
of small manufacturers, working with improvised equipment, who have produced
marketable goods some of which are finding markets outside the country.
Educated young men, as well as the older ones who had previously worked with
British businessmen and manufacturers, have </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>proved themselves fit
to occupy posts of managerial and administrative responsibility. In the
State-managed departments and institutions, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>including corporations
which are in charge of the manufacture of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>aircraft, machine
tools, electrical goods and so forth, officials have </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not
<span class=GramE>been wanting</span> who have the highest capacity for
planning, execution and management. It might seem that here is a traditional
society </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which, given the opportunity, has not only
seized it but has made a success of adapting its own ways of life to the
requirements of a modern industrial context. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
yet in a sense the change is <i>not </i>there. The old ways persist, and there
is considerable maladjustment, perhaps best illustrated by comparison between
the urban and rural sectors. In the half a million villages of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> live 80
per cent of its people. Nearly all of them, as also a portion of the townsfolk,
make their living from the produce of the land and things made out of that
produce. Half the national income is derived from agriculture. Yet, even a
cursory visit to the villages will reveal that the prosperity of a few is
deceptive if it equated with even the reasonable well-being of all. Where
disparities existed, they have remained. The inequalities of caste persist. The
abolition of untouchability is statutory, not actual. It is easy enough for a
government or a local authority to make an impressive gesture here and there
and provide houses for a few Harijan families. It is quite a different matter
to ensure in practice that sections of population who have for centuries been
denied the bare necessities of life are rehabilitated socially and economically.
There is no reason to think that the under-privileged have benefited to any
appreciable extent. Indeed, a truer picture of reality can be had in the result
of a recent investigation in the Bombay State which showed that, out of 70
villages surveyed, in not even one had the Harijans been allowed to take water
from the common well. Even a more telling set of facts emerges from a survey of
rural credit which was made some years ago. Co-operative credit societies had
been established at the beginning of the century. The movement progressed. The
number of societies </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>grew steadily, and in order to finance <span
class=GramE>them</span> banks were set up at district headquarters and at the
capitals of the States. Members were every</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>where encouraged to
come together and guarantee one another’s </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>liabilities on lines
which <span class=SpellE>Raiffeisen</span> had found suitable for the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> of the
early nineteenth century. There was much administration and supervision which,
while indifferent in some States, was competent in others. Nevertheless, the
survey revealed that, for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a whole, the total loans which co-operatives gave to the farmers were 3 per
cent of the total borrowings from all sources. Indeed some 80 per cent of the
finance still came from moneylender, trader and landlord. Investigating the
reasons, the Committee came to an interesting conclusion about the social and
economic structure of rural <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
They said, in effect, that two major factors, one the operation of a colonial
economy for 150 years, and the second the implications of the centuries-old
institution of caste, had so affected this structure that the weak had become
very weak, and, in comparison, the strong very strong. In their words, “The
failure of co-operative credit is explicable in terms of the total
impracticability of any attempt to combine the very weak in competition with
the very strong, expecting them by themselves to create conditions, firstly for
their emancipation from the interests which oppose them, and secondly for their
social and economic development in the context of the severe disadvantages
historically imposed on them by a structure of the type described. The problem
is not so much one of <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span> of co-operative
credit as of the creation of new conditions in which it can operate effectively
and for the benefit of the weaker.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 2</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> The Committee added:
“The main causes [of the relative failure of co-operatives] are largely
socio-economic in character and are relatable to certain fundamental weaknesses
which have developed in the rural structure. Some of the factors making for
weakness, such as caste, have always been there; some of the weaknesses are
inherent in most agricultural economies, especially those which consist of
small units of operation together covering a vast area; but the features most
significant in this context are those which have emerged from the combined
impact of commercial colonialism, industrialization and urbanization on these
pre-existing conditions. As a result of all the three has been imposed for
nearly one hundred years, a powerful, urban and highly <span class=SpellE>monetized</span>
economy on a rural structure which had economically been self-sufficient and
which socially continued to be based on caste.”</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is no part of my task to explain, justify or condemn caste. While its
persistence, rigidity and ubiquity make the institution peculiar to India,
comparable divisions of society are of course not unknown in other countries,
especially of the east. The divisions are hereditary, often <span class=SpellE>specialise</span>
in some one occupation, and rarely marry outside the group. What distinguishes <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is that <i>all
</i>society can be so divided, that the divisions are numerous and that in
origin at any rate, if not in present operation, they can be fitted into one
integrated framework which is at once social, religious and traditional. It is
these divisions or “sub-castes” which should be studied in the context of a
transition from one set of social purposes and objectives to another. The study
would be fascinating. It would include an examination of the loyalties within
each sub-caste, the loyalties between sub-castes, in either case the duties and
obligations involved and the sanctions behind them, and finally the
forces–religious, social and economic–which fasten groups and individuals to, or
on occasion loosen them from, their special compartments in the framework as a
whole. All I can do here is to pick up a few strands and instances, and
illustrate my meaning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Each of them is an endogamous group with prohibitions not only against
inter-marriage (strictly), but also again inter-dining (not so strictly) with
members of other groups. These in a sense are the real castes, for their
classification into the four main occupational groups of Brahmin (priest), <span
class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> (warrior). <span class=SpellE>Vaishya</span>
(merchant) and <span class=SpellE>Sudra</span> (worker) is more a logical than
a sociological categorization. But taking the bigger group, say Brahmin, not in
terms of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>–for
that would be very unreal–but of a region in which one common language is
spoken, the sub-division into smaller endogamous groups or sub-castes is along
three specific lines: first sectarian, second territorial and third
occupational. We may consider the concrete instance of the Andhra Brahmin.
There is first a two-fold sectarian division into <span class=SpellE>Vaishnavites</span>
and <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Smarthas</span></span><span
class=GramE>, that</span> is, broadly speaking worshippers of Vishnu and Siva
respectively. Each of these can then be sub-divided in accordance with the
territory of origin. Thus the “<span class=SpellE>Venginadus</span>” among <span
class=SpellE>Smarthas</span> claim to have migrated from the Vengi country in
the State, whereas the “<span class=SpellE>Telanganyas</span>” give their
original home as the <span class=SpellE>Trilangam</span> country in the same
State, and so forth. Each of these, in turn, may be classed as either “<span
class=SpellE>Vaidikis</span>” (<span class=SpellE>i</span>. e., priests, the
word itself being derived from “Veda”), or “<span class=SpellE>Niyogis</span>”
(i.e., those who pursue secular professions being village accountants, revenue
officials, etc.). The final sub-caste thus consist of all those Telugu-speaking
Brahmins whose ancestors were priests (occupational), came from Vengi
(territorial), and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>were w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>orshippers of Siva
(sectarian). The attributes thus belong to one’s ancestors, not necessarily to
oneself. Nevertheless, the loyalties which </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>then took shape may
continue through generations, diminishing no doubt but not quite disappearing,
even though one may meanwhile have forgotten one’s place of origin, changed
one’s ancestral occupation and long ceased to worship either Vishnu or Siva. My
illustration concerns the <span class=SpellE>Brabmins</span>, but similar
examples can be cited of Kshatriyas, <span class=SpellE>Vaishyas</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Sudras</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is there any underlying principle which broadly integrates the innumerable
sub-groups and the four compendious main groups together? There can be no
simple answer. Indeed there must be many answers. But, in illustration of one
of these, I will cite the legend of <span class=SpellE>Kanyaka</span> <span
class=SpellE>Parameshwari</span> or the “Girl Goddess”. She is the presiding
deity of <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Komatis</span></span><span
class=GramE>, that</span> is the <span class=SpellE>Vaishyas</span> (merchants)
of Andhra Pradesh. The young girl, so runs the legend, was intensely religious,
treated Brahmins with reverence and every one with consideration. She was
remarkable in many ways, not least for beauty. The <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span>
king, a <span class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> called <span class=SpellE>Vishnuvardhana</span>,
wanted to marry her and was prepared to gain his wish by force. She said that
she would immolate herself than break the integrity of caste. Among the leaders
of the <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Komati</span></st1:place>
community some actively supported the stand taken by the young girl, some were
indifferent, while still others were afraid of the ruler. The legend goes on to
say that, before she threw herself into the fire, <span class=SpellE>Kanyaka</span>
<span class=SpellE>Parameshwari</span> divided all <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Komati</span></st1:place> families into the existing sub-castes
among them. This she did on the basis of those who helped her, those who had
remained neutral and those who had been found wanting in courage. She also gave
the <span class=SpellE>Komatis</span> a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>code of conduct
defining their duties towards Brahmins, their respect for other communities,

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>intercourse
which should govern the sub-groups <i>inter se</i>. To this day, the code
attributed to this deified young woman, <span class=SpellE>Kanyaka</span> <span

community of <span class=SpellE>Komatis</span> and regulates the conduct of the

complete the picture, one might consider the two begging sub-castes of “<span

live in the same part of the country. Much lower in the social hierarchy, they
are nevertheless attached by tradition in a very special manner to the <span
class=SpellE>Komatis</span>. Legend has it that these two sub-castes are descended
from the messengers whom <span class=SpellE>Kanyaka</span> <span class=SpellE>Parameshwari</span>
sent to protest to the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> ruler. The most interesting fact, however, is
that, at stated seasons of the year, coinciding with different festivals in <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> of the goddess, people of these begging castes visit
the houses of <span class=SpellE>Komatis</span> in different parts of the
State, carry images of the Goddess from house to house and sing traditional
songs in her praise. Their hereditary function, in other words, is to keep the
memory of the Goddess and, therefore, the essence of the tradition, alive in
such a manner that not only the educated men of the community, but also the
illiterate, the women and the children are periodically reminded of the
religious and traditional background. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Underlying the relationship between groups and sub-groups, castes and
sub-castes, is an integrating principle based on the religion and values of the
Hindus. Implicitly, if not explicitly, the social organization is knitted
together for the preservation of these objectives and values. The sanctions are
social and religious, while the values and the culture are reinforced by song,
dance, myth and legend, carried to the doors of every individual family within
each relevant division of the organization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>What are the
traditional values which may be regarded as generally or specifically Hindu?
Any attempt to set them out briefly must of course involve a large amount of
over-simplification. It would also raise the question whether the values are
shared by a large number of people, illiterate and educated, rural and urban.
It is very necessary to make one clarification at this stage. The values of the
religion and philosophy of the Hindus are far from being confined to a small
coterie, priestly, learned or other. Mass communication, which I have tried to
illustrate by a few examples, has operated through the centuries a throughout
the country. Indeed, the illiterate farmer in the village and the uneducated
grandmother in the family often <span class=GramE>knows</span> more about the
saints and their deeds, the philosophers and their concepts, than the educated
town-dweller or <span class=SpellE>westernised</span> businessman. Few who know
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will dispute the statement that some of the most abstruse schools of philosophy
such as <span class=SpellE>advaita</span> (non-dualism) are by no means
unfamiliar ground to the Indian villager. Moreover, whether villager or
townsman, the temperament of the Indian has throughout the ages responded
readily to saintliness of character. This does not of course mean that the
average Indian is either more spiritual or more ethical than the rest of the
world. A man may be no more moral than his neighbour, and indeed may be worse;
but when it comes to what moves him most, the answer might be not a successful
businessman, not a great commander, nor even a great politician, but one who
has renounced for the sake of helping others, This may be no more than a feature
of the temperament, but it is an important feature and has to be taken into
account in any assessment of the values held dear by Hindu society as a whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

emphasis is first of all on individual liberation (<span class=SpellE>mukti</span>).
Man is part of the same process as brought forth the universe. Being part of
the process he shares in some measure the nature of the creative force behind
creation, just as, being part of the result of the process, he partakes of the
nature of manifested creation. Far from being a stranger in a world he has not
made, he is himself the maker, himself the world. His religion teaches him that
progress involves not only a direction but a starting point. His starting point
is himself. He is what he is today because of his past. But he is infinitely
perfectible and perfection consists in that full development of his spiritual
faculties which will make him in some ineffable way once more a part of the
creative force of the universe. This is <span class=SpellE>mukti</span> which
is both his goal and his destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the starting point is <span class=GramE>himself</span> his religion depends on

will be the way of <span class=SpellE>bhakti</span>; if intellectual, the way
of <span class=SpellE>jnana</span>; and if given to works, the way of karma.
There is no need to go out and seek a formula of salvation; the sect or
religion in which he is born is good enough; all that is necessary is that he <span

to the utmost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

now at different points and have different <span class=GramE>handicaps, that</span>
is the result of the past. It is the past that has determined their caste,
their status and their individual equipment, spiritual, moral and intellectual.
One must be practical and build upon this the best way one can. Sometimes the
developed spirit breaks through all these, and a saint manifests himself
whatever the caste or the station. But that does not nullify either the fact or
the value of the hierarchy of caste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

or “duty” as it is loosely translated, has relation both to where one stands in
the universe and to the direction in which one has to proceed. It takes into
account the total environment of caste, parentage, inner qualities and so on.
But it is, nevertheless, in the final analysis, intensely individual. Granted
the reality of a spiritual goal, what should one do in a given situation so as
to proceed towards and not away from the goal? The milieu and the moment are no
less internal than external to man. These being given, what he ought to <span

station in life, such as courage if a <span class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span>, <span
class=SpellE>usterity</span> if a Brahmin, and so on. There are others which
are universal. Among the most important of these are tolerance, detachment and
loving-kindness. Since men are situated differently and are bound to progress
differently there must be tolerance for all. One has to act, but the results of
action are not important. One must be detached in one’s attitude towards
results. Since all men are united in origin and united in destination, one must
have an attitude of “equal-mindedness” (<span class=SpellE>samabuddhi</span>)
towards all. This applies not only to human beings but to all living things and
indeed to all created things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the implications of these attitudes, however noble or praiseworthy in
themselves, are not difficult to see. The tolerance can become mere passivity;
the detachment, indifference; and the loving-kindness, sentimentality. Most
important of all, the emphasis on individual development and liberation,
coupled with the small group within which social loyalties are exercised, may
result in the lack of a social purpose and a social philosophy, as
distinguished from the merely religious and ethical. It would seem that at
different stages in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
long history something like this had indeed happened. Equality at the
philosophical level has not meant social equality, much less the positive aim
of readjusting economic inequalities. It is also a comparatively new thing for
Indians to think in terms of economic objectives as worthwhile goals in <span
class=GramE>themselves</span>, not only for individuals but for society as a
whole. To work with one’s hands, to produce, to organize production for the
community, to take pride in increase in production: all these are values which
are only slowly being adopted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have here then the picture of a society hierarchical in structure. Each part of
the structure is fitted into the whole with what would seem an underlying purpose
basically connected with the objectives and values of Hindu religion. The
sanctions which preserve the structure and its individual parts are primarily
social and religious. It is this structure that has now to be geared to
socio-economic values It is the instead of purely religious ones. It is to be
actuated by new objectives, hitherto foreign to it, such as individual liberty,
economic welfare and social justice. There is no use slurring over the fact
that these are indeed new values and objectives for which the historical
development of the structure had not prepared it. At the same time, on the
credit side, it<i> </i>has to be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> that the
philosophical concepts of the tradition are in no sense and at no point
antagonistic to these values. Indeed, on their own plane they may be said to be
complementary to the new socio-economic objectives of plenitude and equality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
point may be mentioned. Hindu philosophy and religion are uniquely consistent
with the most modern trends in science. The Hindu need have no dichotomy of
mind, one of blind faith and the other of rational thought. He is brought up to
believe that the material and the spiritual grow out of one another and that he
himself partakes of nature of both. There is no specific formula which he is
asked to adopt as part of his belief. There is spiritual reality around him
even as there is physical reality. It is up to him to understand the laws of
both, and, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in conformity with those laws, strive for self-<span
class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>. Since the moral laws of development and the
physical laws of process are derived from the same reality, at no point of time
can there be an irreconcilable inconsistency between the two. Nor, in a
universe so integrated, can one, in being true to oneself, run the danger of
being false to some one else. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
even if one has Succeeded in discovering the moral or spiritual laws of
individual development (as in the principles of yoga), what about the
corresponding laws which govern society? Individual dharma may be all right,
but in a world of social groups may it not prove to be as notional as a point
in three-dimensional geometry? Is there no need in the modern world to pursue
the complementary line of enquiry and discipline which concerns social dharma
and institutional dharma as distinguished from individual dharma? And if the
spiritual world is worthy of study because the physical world is implicit in
it, is not the physical world as worthy of study because the spiritual world is
implicit in it? Briefly, the Hindu has yet to realise that the values of his
philosophy are in tune with only a part of the infinite; and that the parts to
which it is yet to be attuned are precisely the ones which the modern mind has
most explored, and to which modern development is most beholden, namely, the
relationship between man and the universe which has given rise to the physical
sciences, and the relationship between man and men which has given rise to the
social sciences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

trend I have illustrated was not only indigenous but represented the reaction
to something, viz., caste, which was internal to the structure itself. It is
necessary to consider another set of reactions, namely, those which originated

British brought with them to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the shape of western thought and literature and political forms. </span><span

four or five stages can, I think, be discerned in the reaction of Hindu society

of the dormant culture came back to awareness one after another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chronologically
the influence of the west was first felt in Bengal, for Calcutta was the
capital of India, and English education on a significant scale was earlier
organized there than elsewhere in the country. To start with, there was
complete absorption in the culture of the rulers. Educated Indians adopted and
imitated that culture in all its aspects: spiritual, literary and so forth.
This soon gave way to a positive reaction against the foreign culture. The
first awakening that took place was in what one might describe as the spiritual
layer of the country’s consciousness. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, <span class=SpellE>Devendranath</span>
Tagore and others exemplified this earliest phase of spiritual awakening of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s self.
Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and others continued and completed the process in

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile
the second phase of the reaction had already begun. Indians were no longer
content to imitate the literary forms of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> and write verses and novels
in a foreign language. The languages of the people, each of which had a rich
heritage behind it, began to assert themselves. The second phase of the
reaction was literary. Rabindranath Tagore was a good example of this phase. It
must be remembered that he wrote in Bengali: and the songs, many of them still <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third phase was social. Social reform became the slogan of the day. Questions
such as caste, untouchability, re-marriage of widows, pre-puberty marriage of
girls, and so forth assumed great importance. Educated Indians began to say
that they should first reform their own society before entertaining political
aspirations for responsible government. “Should social reform or political
reform come first?”–was a <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> topic for debate
in schools and colleges, and the answer usually was “social reform”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fourth phase of the reaction was definitely political. Tilak, Gandhi and those
who followed were typical of this phase. Without independence, it was asserted,
nothing could be achieved, not even social reform. Indians must be their own
masters, and from the self-respect thus created everything else would follow.
Yet, here again, as particularly under Gandhi, the political struggle took a
uniquely indigenous form: that is to say, a shape that was deliberately <span
class=SpellE>moulded</span> after the thoughts and aspirations of Hindus in
particular and of Indians generally. Intolerance for the foreign rule was to be
combined with tolerance for the foreigner. There was to be neither hatred nor
anger against him. Gandhi also </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>insisted on ahimsa and non-violence,
though this was perhaps a Buddhist or Jain idea rather than a specifically
Hindu one. The Gita teaches the pursuit of duty without desire for the fruits
of action. And in the Hindu context this pursuit might well be violent as in
the instance of Arjuna himself. It was Jainism and Buddhism that <span
class=SpellE>emphasised</span> non-violence as an absolute virtue. Thereafter
the ideal did get interwoven, though the strands still show here and there,
into the texture of Hindu thought and belief. Thus it was that Gandhi, deriving
inspiration from his own culture, and support from Christianity and Tolstoy,
put ahimsa in the forefront of his political struggle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the one which concerns the bulk of the population, will still remain, namely,
how the underfed and the underprivileged–the small cultivator in his millions
and the small industrialist in his hundreds of thousands–can be given the
know-how, the resources and the incentive to produce more. The know-how perhaps
presents the least difficulty. National Extension, Community Development, Small
Industries Service Institutes, all these have been fairly successful in
organizing and passing on the know-how, though it is true that a great deal has
yet to be done. In particular, it will be education itself, i.e., the
conversion of the illiterate into the educated–not the unskilled into the
skilled–that is the big task still to be completed. Along with this lack of
education, then, must be taken the other main impediments, which are lack of

one can observe trends and, however faint these may be for the moment, one can
try and pick up from among them such as seem significant for the future. One
may start with almost any of the aspects mentioned above. Caste, for example,
evokes different responses from different sets of people. There are those who
in effect exploit caste to gain temporary ends. Others ignore it or pretend it
does not exist. Still others believe it will vanish under impact of economic
forces. Lastly, there are those who realise both the strength and ubiquity of
caste divisions and seek to establish newer loyalties across, instead of along,

obvious example of exploitation of the existing divisions is what happens
during elections. The candidate may not always have willed it to be so, but it
is common knowledge that in most elections the voting tends to take place along
the lines of caste. In other words, caste, as one of the strongest existing
loyalties, is something which no electioneering agent is likely to lose sight
of. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of economic development, including <span class=SpellE>urbanisation</span>, are on
the whole hostile to caste. Broken up into individual elements, the loyalties
of caste, we have seen, are principally sectarian, territorial and
occupational. The hold of sectarian religion is getting less in the towns, but
not necessarily nor on any appreciable scale in the villages. Territorial
loyalty counts for less in the villages and much less in the towns than in the
past. But there is a vicious circle. Caste restricts the mobility of the
society; <span class=GramE>lack of mobility keeps people at home in their occupations;
and those who remain at home tend</span> to have a stronger territorial loyalty
than others. The same remarks apply to occupational loyalty. In all these
respects, therefore, the old loyalties of caste and sub-caste are only slowly

They read into the village community a social cohesion and <span class=GramE>a
common purpose which ought to be created, but which quite often are</span> not

lead the administration to impose schemes of welfare on the village in the
expectation that its leadership has the same interests at heart as the small
farmer, the landless <span class=SpellE>labourer</span> and the Harijan. Where
this is not the case, a well-meaning scheme may lead to greater exploitation

who before his death a few years ago succeeded in giving schools to the rural
area on a scale which neither Government nor school boards had achieved in the
past. What is more important, he was able to get Harijan and high caste boys to
live, work and study together. At a very early stage in the experiment, he
abandoned the idea of having separate hostels for Harijan boys. Ignoring the
divisions of caste, sub-caste and out-caste he postulated poverty as the line
of demarcation and said that every poor student in the countryside would be the
beneficiary of his scheme. He also insisted on the contribution of voluntary <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> by his students and maximum self-help on the part of
each particular area. In this way he built schools and hostels which for both
number and usefulness are today among the most significant institutions in <st1:place
w:st="on">Western India</st1:place>. In these institutions, which include about
200 primary schools and a dozen or more boarding houses, the experiment is
being successfully tried of students habitually and purposefully ignoring the
divisions of caste and recognizing the uniting factors of poverty and
self-help. This remarkable man was rooted in the soil, had an essentially
religious outlook, and renounced wealth in the best Indian tradition. Examples
can also be cited from other parts of the country of the attempt to organize
education as a unifying force. These attempts are usually not all-India. They
are indigenous to the area or the State and have done much to spread literacy
in the language of each particular region. And it must be remembered that for
each of the big States of India, as they exist today, its own language and
literature are great unifying forces which cut across the barriers of rank,
caste and occupation. </p>

class=SpellE>tradiitional</span> values, is the mission undertaken by <span
class=SpellE>Vinoba</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhave</span> to receive gifts of
land (‘<span class=SpellE>bhoodan</span>’) for distribution to the landless
and, if all the land of the village was gifted (‘<span class=SpellE>gramdan</span>’),
to place it under the management of the village council for the benefit of all.
The whole world is watching this experiment which, from the point of view here
set out, constitutes one of the most significant endeavours in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> for
bridging the differences of caste and class and community. It has not yet
touched the town and the city. The Saint’s appeal is to persons. In the
villages of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
today one still deals with persons. In cities and towns the individual is
merged in the impersonal masses. There is big business, not the individual
trader; big banks, and not moneylenders; and large ownership of capital, not
just a handful of landlords. Also people are much more hardened against the
traditional values of life. This perhaps explains why <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bhave</span> in his attempt to employ an essentially
religious technique for bringing about social and economic justice, has
hitherto avoided the cities of wealth and citadels of power, and confined his
mission to the village. Another observation may be made. The re-distribution of
lands, however motivated, is in the end a concrete administrative process. It
requires supporting legislation, administrative staff and legal documents in
which intentions are reduced to enforceable form as in any other administrative
measure, whether such measure emanates from a Saint or a Secretariat. Will <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> be able
to show that the Saint and the Secretariat can work together? The question is
still open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>My next
illustration is in fact taken from Government. It concerns the policy of State
partnership in co-operatives for the purpose of meeting the last of the
requirements I have mentioned, namely, resources or capital. Lacking these, the
village co-operative society, whether credit or marketing, is powerless against
the competition of landlord, moneylender and trader. Yet it must be rendered
strong in order that the small producer’s interests are looked after and
production as an aim is promoted. Lacking initial momentum the weak society
falls back to ground; there has to be a force which will help it to get into
orbit after breaking through a whole field of gravitation. In <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> the
experiment is being tried of supplying this initial force through State partnership.
The partnership is reversible; also it does not imply State interference. Since
the society starts strong, it is in a position to render service at the very
commencement; people will test it for a little while and then increasingly come
in and buy shares; this will in due course enable the society to buy off
Government’s shares. This has not only been the theory but the practice as
well. And, so far as one can judge, it appears to work. But the points I am
concerned to make are these. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has not chosen the path of liquidating the moneylender and the landlord in
order that their hold may disappear or competition cease. That would have been
wholly repugnant to temperament and tradition. Nor has it thought it right, on
the one side, that the State should run these institutions itself or, on the <span
class=GramE>other, that</span> the weak should be left to their own devices. My
illustration, then, concerns a joint attempt of the State and the people,
especially the weaker sections, to <span class=SpellE>institutionalise</span>
services of great importance for production, and to do so in a manner which
conforms both to the values of tradition and the principles of sound
organization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
other aspect remains to be noticed. Built on the basis of State partnership
there is a large number of producers’ co-operatives today–such as sugar
factories owned by the <span class=SpellE>canegrowers</span> or lift irrigation
societies run by the riparian farmers–which are infusing a new type of loyalty,
the loyalty of production, across the older stratification of caste. The
producers are of many castes; but they combine in order to increase their
production, or to process their produce for the market; they have no problem,
as in a credit society, of apportioning scarce resources (often along the lines
of caste or other extraneous loyalties); their status is purely that of
producers; it is as producers that they put forth a common effort, and it is as
producers that they derive a common benefit. <span class=GramE>This again is a
very significant way in which the newer co-operatives, with assistance from the
State, are helping to build bridges across the old divisions, and are</span>
doing so in the very context of <span class=SpellE>modernising</span> the
methods of production, processing and preparation for the market. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

without losing anything of value in her ancient traditions, adapt herself to
the modern context of efficient production, economic welfare and social
justice? The transition is taking place. It is largely uncharted. I am
conscious that in pointing to a current here and a current there I have given no
answer to the question itself. It seems permissible to doubt whether a
definitive answer can in fact be given. If there is no chart of the transition,
there can be no blue print of the future. But there is one thing which, in
accordance with one’s own predilections, it may be possible to indicate: and
that is the spirit in which <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
One feature of that tradition may be recalled. At widely different times, and
in widely different parts of the country, there have arisen religious leaders
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
whose aim was spiritual good, and whose <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> it
was to place within the reach of all the means of achieving such good. Each
such effort was non-violently conceived and non-violently conducted; it had the
appeal and motive force of a mission; and, not infrequently, its organisation
bore signs of careful forethought and attention. Essentially the same means,
employed in the pursuit of economic good, have perhaps this difference, that
they hold greater promise of attaining the object postulated. For one thing,
there is nothing yet in human history to disprove–just as there is nothing in
it yet to demonstrate–that economic welfare in its highest sense cannot be
achieved, even where it is most lacking, by the planned, deliberate and
organized effort of a Government, relentless as to purpose but not ruthless as
to means, provided the effort is not only emotionally impelled but is
scientifically guided. In this latter aspect, a whole apparatus of technique,
knowledge and research, comparatively recent and painstakingly accumulated, is
available to Governments, if only they will make use of it, through the
development of the social sciences of economics and sociology and of the
science no less than art of public administration.” </span><sup><span

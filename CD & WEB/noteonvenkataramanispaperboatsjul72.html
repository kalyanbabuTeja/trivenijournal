font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is perhaps only a commonplace statement that generally writers live in the
memory of the common reader only through a couple of their more important
works, and K. S. Venkataramani seems to be no exception. It is on <span
class=SpellE><i>Murugan</i></span><i> the Tiller </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Kandan</i></span><i>
the Patriot </i>that his reputation stands secure today. However, Venkataramani
has to his credit several other works which deserve to be better known, and his
very first work, <i>Paper Boats </i>(1921) is definitely one among them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
the title itself amply suggests, <i>Paper Boats </i>is a fleet of ten delightful
sketches mainly of rural life and characters. The most arresting feature of
these sketches is their simple but immensely impressive style: it is all along
scintillatingly light-hearted and effortlessly epigrammatic, and there is all
through a deep poetic note which successfully lends a kind of unity to the
pictures painted here. Each essay is a little well-wrought vignette, beautiful
by virtue of its very simplicity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Any
peg would do to hang the hat on” is a maxim which quite adequately holds water
so far as an essayist’s choice of topic is concerned. And the first paper boat
that Venkataramani sets assail has ‘the Indian Beggar’ as its occupant. The
subject is such that one would expect <span class=GramE>either an economist’s
grave concern for, and</span> his expert solutions to, the alarming problem of
beggary, or a pathetically elaborate enunciation of the manifold miseries of
our mendicants. But <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani’s</span> approach is
entirely different: his outlook towards the problem is essentially humanitarian
and poetic. He calls beggary a fine art, and, aided by his minute observation
of various beggars, he divides them into seven classes, and the whole essay
makes a refreshingly pleasant reading indeed. First we have ‘the beggar with
the bowl,’ ‘an orphan and a bachelor,’ and whose profession is ‘the most
ancient and least expensive form of begging.’ Then we have ‘the beggar with the
monkey and the dog’ who is ‘truly the demagogue of the polity of beggars’ and
is known for his nomadic instincts. Then comes ‘the beggar with the snake,’
grim and obdurate. And ‘the gypsy beggar’ combines in himself the dual
professions of begging and palm-reading. Other interesting variations of the
tribe are ‘the beggar with the bull,’ ‘the musical mendicant,’ and ‘the
nocturnal beggar.’ The essay gives the impression of being an apology for
beggars, and though, no doubt, economists might frown at it, it must be said to
the credit of the essayist that the strong currant of poetry that runs through
the essay successfully elevates the drab subject to a heightened dignity which
somehow reminds us of Charles Lamb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

considerable segment of Tamilian commonalty lives on angling, and it is with
understanding and sympathy that Venkataramani sketches their bold and toilsome
life in his second essay, ‘On Fishermen.’ Ever restless and always hopeful, the
fisherman is known for his dexterity at the rod. Extremely industrious, he is
endowed with a soul full of infinite patience. “He goes to his work very early
in the morning and toils in the sea till sunset with unequal fortune everyday,
and returns at dusk to partake of the meagre comforts of his home. In the worst
of troubles he is never given to whining. He grasps the cold hand of penury, if
he has to, with a courage and resignation that would do credit even to a more
cultured being. He ends as he begins, without a sigh.” Venkataramani tells us
also of the fishermen’s virtuous wives and their <span class=SpellE>timocratic</span>
government, their exciting marriage ceremonies and their religious festivals.
But what <span class=GramE>is</span> most touching is their unceasing devotion
to the rod, their stout heroism which never fears the storms of the sea, and
their resigned attitude to life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the ‘Village Cricket’ Venkataramani describes how cricket in an Indian village
is a cousin of that English game. It is, no doubt, true that it is a crude
version, but it is definitely ‘the sunniest of pastimes’ of the village boys,
and since there are no fastidious rules governing the game, it easily provides a
buoyant outlet for the brimming <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> and enthusiasm
of the rustic youth. And there is a delightful touch of romance that <span
class=SpellE>colours</span> the description of the game: “It has the wayward
buoyancy and mirth of the evening breeze. Under the shade of coconut palms, by
the side of the village tank, and the rippling laughter of girls carrying home
pails of water at the hip, leaning and glancing gently to the side, the game is
a glorious feast for the youth.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Never
allowing his usual simple style to degenerate into pompous verbiage,
Venkataramani distils into his next short sketch the charm and significance of
the several aspects of the ‘Hindu temple.’ Without resorting to any elaborate
architectural jargon, he vividly points out how the Hindu temple is an emblem
of the rich religious instinct of man in co-ordination with his love for beauty–or,
in short, it is “an architectural attraction as well as a spiritual solace.”
Again, without ever becoming pedantic, he reveals his keen power of
observation. For instance, the gloomy interior of a small Hindu temple is
exactly and admirably caught in a few words thus: “The minor gods are arranged <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in<i> </i></span>rows along the colonnades.
They come in only for the casual obeisance of the over-pious. A number of
glow-worm lamps, fed with oil and fixed artistically, illuminate with <span
class=GramE>a pale</span> effulgence the <span class=SpellE>sombre</span> idols
wrapped up in gracious slumber with a charming disregard for posture.” And there
are occasions when the author breaks forth into lyrical rapture even in the
small compass of a short sketch like this. For instance, it is difficult to
imagine a more poetic or eloquent adulation of the glory that is the temple car
than the following: “...the charming glory of the Hindu temple is the
celebrated car. It is a dream in timber which bridges Heaven and Earth. It is
the stateliest projection of the Hindu mind. It is the pillar of our pictorial
life. It is the rallying-point of all castes and creeds. It is the supreme
exponent of the oneness of man in the service of God, be he a <span
class=SpellE>Brahmana</span> or a Pariah. It is the symbol of united worship.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
next essay acquaints us with <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani’s</span>
unstinted admiration for ‘my little <span class=SpellE>Arunalam</span>,’ a
Pariah whose growth from cradle to the field is rapidly and respectfully
described. <span class=SpellE>Arunalam’s</span> first profession is that of a
cowherd, and there is perfect sympathy between him, the ruler, and the cattle, the
governed. As he grows up into a man, he is drafted as a farm-worker on <span
class=GramE>whom</span> depends the agricultural prosperity of his master. Hard
<span class=SpellE>labour</span> and pastoral life have made him a strong man: “In
stature stalwart, in bearing dignified, all brawn and muscle, the gift of daily
toil, he is easily Nature’s well-built child.” The key to <span class=SpellE>Arunalam’s</span>
success seems to be his toilsome routine and contentment with his lot. “His (<span
class=SpellE>Arunalam’s</span>) is always a message of Labour and Love to our
ancient land...Like the toiling wave between the land and the sea he is
restless and ever active... The raptures of his life are the verities of a
fixed orbit of <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, even as the diurnal rounds of
the earth.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then
we have a portrait of ‘the Hindu pilgrim,’ variously described as ‘a spiritual
monument of our race,’ ‘a step and an experiment in the realisation of an
ideal,’ and a restless wanderer, ‘as restless, as the Lingam which he worships
is immobile.’ He may be gullible and superstitious, but his faith is
unshakable. Though <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani’s</span> outlook towards
these pilgrims in general is reverential, he is mildly sarcastic when he
describes the periodic pilgrim whose motive behind the pilgrimage is not
altogether God-realisation. “He undertakes a pilgrimage only for purposes of
expiation or for the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>acquisition </span>of
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>extra </span>religious merit. <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>As a </span>successful worldly man, he is
always conscious of his sins of omission and commission...A pilgrimage to <span
class=SpellE>Benares</span> and <span class=SpellE>Rameshwar</span> will not
only promote the virtues of his seed, but is sure to give him a fresh and pure
start for his balance of years in the game of life. It quiets his conscience.
He returns to work from the holy shrines, and sacred waters, chastened with
more of faith and energy to face the subtle ways of the world. And his <span
class=SpellE>neighbour</span> attaches greater sanctity to his name. “This
periodic pilgrim takes with him not only his wife and children but also his
poor relations, not because he is generous, but because, “it is the injunction
of the <span class=SpellE>Smrithis</span> not to neglect poor relations”, and
(now another dig!) “<span class=GramE>they</span> may be helpful on the way.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Grandmother deals only partially with the grandma who is occasionally irascible
and always agile, who is, in short, ‘a benevolent despot.’ The essay is mainly <span
class=GramE>an</span> eulogy of the beneficence <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>the Hindu joint family of which, of course, the grandmother is
‘the mainspring...and its most efficient regulator.” It is difficult to imagine
a better, at any rate a more graphic, description of the advantages and glories
of the joint family than, this: “The Hindu family is the greatest conservative
tradition and reality of our civilisation. It is full of sweetness, even as the
honeycomb, its sweetness, as honey, separated, assimilated and deposited in
individual cells. It is the Rishi-made school for the Hindu from the cradle to the
grave. No generation wastes its sweetness in the Hindu joint family, but leaves
behind its experience and work for a richer harvest of tradition in succeeding
years.” Venkataramani is not unaware of the sociological fact that the joint,
family among Hindus is a fast-vanishing institution, and so he closes his essay
with a plaintive note: “It (the Hindu <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>joint<i>
</i></span>family) <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is<i> </i></span>the
most fragrant <i>champak </i>flower of Aryan culture. In the autumn dust and

are <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>falling </span>off. Ere long the
flower will be no more. May at least <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>its

age of seventeen, but rises from a clerk to Deputy <span class=SpellE>Tahsil</span>
in the British <span class=SpellE><i>Sircar</i></span><i> </i>by dint of honest
<span class=SpellE>labour</span>. But he is quite a docile creature at home
under the crushing spell of his wife, a splendid shrew who sours all the sweetness

penultimate essay, ‘The <span class=SpellE>Jagat</span> Guru’, is devoted to a faithful

yet enlightened Hinduism’, situated on the banks of <span class=SpellE>Cauvery</span>.
The rest of the essay is taken up by a passionate sketch of the <span

mankind, barring all distinctions of caste, creed, and social status. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

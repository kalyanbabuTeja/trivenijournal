<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
central principle of Frost’s poetic theory emphasizes the notion of a dramatic
necessity as fundamental to good and effective poetry. In the “Introduction” to
<i>A Way Out </i>(1917), Frost explained this theory in some detail: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
dramatic necessity goes deeper into the nature of a sentence. Sentences are not
different enough to hold the attention unless they are dramatic. No ingenuity
of varying structure will do. All that can save them is the speaking tone of voice
somehow entangled in the words and fastened to the page for the ear of imagination.
That is all that can save poetry from sing-song, all that can save poetry from
Itself. <sup>1</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By
this he meant that what constituted the drama in a poem was the tone of voice
of the speaker, but not merely the varying of structure in the sentences. He
once said, the only live sentence was one with the tone of voice caught in the
syntax, meaning and idiom of it. “What I have been after from first consciously
and unconsciously is tones of voice. I have wanted to write down certain brute
throat noises so that no one could miss them in my sentences.”<sup> 2</sup> He
further maintained that in his poetry he strove to make the lines expressive of
action-gestures by introducing into it various kinds of voice tones,
punch-words, word-play and other speech devices. “I have written poetry ever
since I was fifteen years old, and there came to be quite a number of people
who know how to take me in my <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>wry<i> </i></span>way,
in my twisted <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>way<i>, </i></span>with the
words cocked a little like a cocked hat, like a cocked feather. That is poetry.
The large strain of poetry is a little shifted from the straight out, a little
curved from the straight.”<sup>3</sup> He complained, “What bothers people in
my blank verse is that I have tried to see what I could do with the boasting
tones, and quizzical tones and shrugging tones (for they are such) and
forty-seven other tones. All I care a cent for is to catch sentence tones that
haven’t been brought to book.”<sup> 4</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
fact, right from the beginning of his poetical career Frost had resorted to the
method of speaking through the mouths of various people with the living voice
somehow caught in the syllables. He enjoyed reproducing the tones and
inflections of human speech even before he was ten years old. “I first heard
the voice from a printed page in a Virgilian eclogue and from Hamlet.” In a
letter he wrote to W. S. B. Braithwaite on March 22, 1915, he said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was under twenty when I deliberately put it to myself one night after good
conversation that there are moments when one actually touches in talk what the
best writing can only come near. The curse of our book language is not so much
that it keeps forever to the same set phrases...but that it sounds forever with
the same reading tone. We must go out into the vernacular for tones that haven’t
been brought to book. We must write with the ear on the speaking voice.<sup> 5</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Frost
often emphasized phrases like ‘audile imagination’, ‘images to the ear’, ‘vocal
gestures’, etc., and said, “you can’t read a single good sentence with the salt
in it unless you have previously heard it spoken. Neither can you with the help
of all the characters and diacritical marks pronounce a single word unless you
have previously heard it actually pronounced. Words exist in the mouth, not
books.”<sup>6</sup> In his own poetry recitations he so modulated his voice as
to allow” his poems to speak for themselves.” In 1935 he was quoted as saying,”
poetry has to do something to you with sound. I do not care about meaning
except as I use it to get meaning out of tones of voice...The tones of voice
can only be got by the context.” Again, in answer to the question “Why do you
write poems? “, he said, “To see if I can make them sound different.”
Commenting on his “Snow” he remarked: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have three characters speaking in one poem, and I was not satisfied with what
they said until I got them to speak so true to their own characters that to mistake

in front of what they said.<sup> 7</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Frost even words were “a kind of notation and writing down of the voice.” “When
literature comes alive, it begins to speak,” was the central canon of his Ars
Poetica. He came closest explaining his actual mode of poetic composition when
he said that he always began a poem by imagining “the tone of someone speaking.”

evaluations of Frost too have generally credited him with a talent for the
short poem, lyric or dramatic, and agreed that what is significant about the
poem is its distinctive tone of voice. Reviewing <i>A Boy’s Will </i>for <i>The
New Freewoman, </i>Ezra Pound has noted the tonal quality of the poetic lines: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>a book of people”, as Frost has called it, has received
extensive critical recognition, and nearly all the poems in it have been
singled out as instances of “natural spoken speech”, speeches of people who are
“distinctly real.” “His words are simple,” says Amy Lowell in her review of <i>North
of Boston, </i>“straight forward, direct, manly, and there is an elemental
quality in all he does which would surely be lost if he chose to pursue
niceties of phrase.” Though reviewers of Frost’s later collections have drifted
attention from analyses of his method of estimates of<i> </i>his contemporary
relevance, general evaluations of Frost that started coming out from the early
30’s onwards have emphasized the fact that he is the first to give the short
lyric or dramatic poem a greatly increased significance and that he has
achieved in it his most conspicuous successes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus,
Sidney Cox has remarked that in Frost “the sound is not only as important as
the meaning, and part of the meaning, but most of the meaning.”<sup>9</sup>
Reuben A. Brower ranks Frost with Yeats, Pound and Eliot as “one of the
renewers of the speaking voice in modern poetry. Frost’s own dissatisfaction
appears at about the time Yeats began revising his early <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lyrics<i> </i></span>in order to bring them
closer to the rhythms of speech.” Allen Angoff commends “Frost’s peculiar
talent to give to his most delicate utterance the air of a chance remark, never
to stress in his verse a note that would not be stressed in the context of ordinary
speech. Reginald Cook thinks that “what Burton, Sterne, Lamb, Twain and
Hemingway do with voice tones in prose, Frost does within the straits of
English meter.” British critic Lascelles Abercromble has observed that Frost
tried “to capture and hold within metrical patterns with the very tones of
speech, the rise and fall, the stress pauses and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>little<i> </i></span>hurries of spoken language”, and pointed out “novel
inflections of meter...designed to reproduce in verse the actual shape of the
sound of whole sentences.” Lawrence Thompson, Elizabeth Isaacs, Radcliffe
Squires too have commented on the poetic method of Frost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
spite of this wide acceptance of Frost’s poetic method, surprisingly no attempt
to examine the entire range of Frost’s poetry in terms of his aesthetics has
been made so far. John F. Lynen in his <i>The Pastoral Art of Robert Frost, </i>however,
categorizes Frost’s poetry under different heads as dramatic dialogues,
dramatic monologues, pastoral dialogues, philosophical dialogues and narrative
monologues, but he makes only a hurried assessment of the poems under each
group in terms of their pastoral content much more than their dramatic quality.
In trying to assess Frost’s poetry in the light of his aesthetics we must
remember that we are dealing with the <i>Speech </i>utterances of characters
who speak with distinctive tones of voice in specific action contexts and not
with narrative or lyrical utterances in general contexts. This action context
may mean literally the context of a person or character acting–not necessarily
in an outer plot situation, but in a situation that engages his energies and
prompts him to behave and reveal himself through the tone of his voice. In
other words, the action context is a situation that presents a character in an
engagement with himself or with other persons or circumstances and <i>behaves </i>in
a way as to reveal himself. We should also remember that any situation that provokes
this behaviour in a character is necessarily one that is particularized or
localized that is unique to the speech context, and not one that is general. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
emphasizing the tonal quality of the speech of a character, Frost was, in
effect, emphasizing the dramatic context of the speaker’s utterance. However,
this ‘dramatic’ context may not always mean the context of an agon or
confrontation, but a context to catch the changing moods or responses of a
lively character reacting to a vivid setting against which he is projected in
tell of the speaker’s own tone of voice. The speaker, thus is an individual
with a personal, identifiable voice, though he not be a full-fledged ‘dramatic’
character. What Frost has sought to do, and in a large measure succeeded in
doing, is to catch the tones of human voice within the context of a
character-situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Frost’s
method is to take up a situation, or a certain confrontation and try to analyse
its inner significance to the mind of the character. He thus works on single,
often simple but specific situations or moods, and exploits to the fullest
extent the psychology of a character as it reveals forth in the context of the
situation or the mood. The character is studied in shifting lights and shadows,
as a living microcosm, and his behaviour is caught in terms of language, stress
and intonation. In other words, he records a mind’s reaction to a moment of
experience, emphasizing every aspect of the nuances of behaviour. At times,
this moment is a moment of crisis in the life of the character, but usually it
is a moment when the character is self-aware and can explore the implications
of the context to himself or to others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Frost
thus often unfolds the drama of a thought process. In his dramatic monologues
and narrative poems which are often lengthy, there is an ‘incident’ or a ‘story’
unveiled, and the unfoldment is at times effected through a series of character
confrontations. In the short poems he takes up a single event, or action, or
thought, and works out its implications to himself or presents the idea
involved in it in the way he may explain it to himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
survey of Frost’s major poems <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will </span>reveal
that there are subtle differences of form and tone and varying degrees of
dramatic intensity. There are the dramatic monologues like <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>“A </span>Servant to Servants”, “The Pauper
Witch of Grafton”, “Build <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Soil”</span>,
which achieve the liveliness of an enactment. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>“A </span>Servant to Servants” is a moss thorough realization of the
drama of self- revelation The drama consists in the gradual unfoldment of the
personality and the thought process of the speaker. Here Frost handles a
situation close in nature to poems like Browining’s “Andhrra del Sarto.” “The
Pauper Witch of Grafton” too is a monologue with a situation reminiscent of some
of Browning’s best monologues. There are <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>also
</span>the poems which, despite their outward monologue form, are <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>only </span>instruments of discourse. Poems
like “The Lesson for Today” or “An Empty Threat”, despite the initial psychological
clash and the break with reality develop a narrative structure as they proceed.
Here too the voice of the speaker is felt, but it is more subdued and <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>less </span>articulate and is without the broad
dramatic gestures that the characters in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>“A
</span>Servant to Servants” or “The Smile” or “Meanding Wall” indulge in. We may
call such poems imperfect monologues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are then the dramatic dialogues, dialogues conducted entirely in terms of
character exchanges. Poems like <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>“Blue </span>Berries,”
“The Code,” “The Housekeeper,” “The Self-seeker” are cast in a dramatic frame
without the narrator intervening anywhere in the poem. The exchange of the
arguments by the characters becomes lively as they speak with their own peculiar
conversational tones, with the quirks and oddities, and the dramatic quality of
the argument itself is brought out <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>by </span>the
interspersion of casual remarks throughout the poem. “Home Burial,” “The Death
of the Hired Man,” “The Fear,” “The Snow,” “The Black Cottage” too, are
conducted in terms of character exchanges, but here the narrator also pops up
at places, either to set the scene or to hook up the conversation. That is, in
these poems we hear the voice of the narrator in addition to the voices of the
characters exchanging talk which invests the poem with the overall framework of
a narrative. However, these poems have a gripping situation, and the narrator
often acquires a life of his own, thus forming into another character. Such
dialogues we may call quasi-dramatic. In “Home Burial” Frost presents a crisis
situation wherein one of the protagonists has grown so desperate as to be mad.
She does not listen to the reasoning of her husband, and so persistently scolds
him for what she considers his lack of involvement in the crisis wrought on her
by the death of their son, that it ultimately leads to the rupture of their
domestic life. “Home Burial” is an intensely dramatic poem built round the idea
of social adjustment in human relationship. In “The Fear” and “The Snow” the
narrative parts are at a minimum, almost like stage directions, and the opening
narrative comment serves as the description of the scene in which the drama is
to begin. When the characters break into utterance against the stage
background, this speech gains in significance. The theme of action of “The
Fear” moves round the idea that mental uncertainty could be as terrible as a
calamity. The woman is afraid that the voice she has heard or the apparition
she has seen must be of someone waiting to ‘avenge’ her–her own husband. But
when the apparition does appear, i<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>t </span>turns
out to be not that of her husband or that of anyone “he’s sent to watch” on
her, but that of a “disinterested visitor.” Coming after all the suspense and
high tension the denouement has a crushing impact–it is more powerful than any
physical violence overtaking the woman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Frost
has discovered the true bent of his genius in the short ‘personative’ lyrics
many of which may be cited as striking cases of the speaking voice–cases where
a speaker’s response to a situation is presented in an unmistakable tone of
voice. The situation, that is as hardly needs to be, is used to reveal
character. Most frequently the scene or problem or idea and the main character are
those immediately present in the poem. That is, we hear the character who is
analysing himself, his mood or predicament, often in the physical limits of the
scene itself. At times, however, the speaker analyses the problem not relating
to himself, analyses other character or characters, or narrates in his own tone
of voice the star, of the idea or problem or significant action. Even here, the
mood and the character of the speaker are seldom of secondary interest. The
rhythms, tones and inflections vary according to the situation and the mood of
the speaker. Thus, the tone and posture of the speaker in “Stopping by Woods on
a Snowy Evening” are different from the tone and posture in “After Apple
Picking” or “Birches” or “Mowing” or “Come in.” There is the low meditative
tone of “The Wood Pile” or the indifferent voice of “The Sound of Trees.” There
are subtleties in tone and voice which signify sharp distinctions in gesture
and behaviour. That is why, in spite of the fact that a majority of Frost’s
poems are in the ‘personative’ form, most of them sustain our interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and of man, and is lyric in content. But the way in which the theme is rendered
is dramatic. The sudden shifts in the imagery and the warmth of the human
element in it give the poem a dramatic force and intensity. The theme of “Stopping
by Woods on a Snowy Evening” is simple. It is the description of the scene of
the woods and the circumstances under which the speaker has stopped there. But
behind the seeming simplicity there runs a meaning which is far-reaching in its
effects. This climax of responsibility is wrought in the poem by a crafty
adjustment of the tone of the speaker to the occasion. The voice is so calm and
simple, it is so clear in tone and movement, that it can be mistaken to be a
prose utterance. It indeed is, if we forget that it is in metrical form. But
the lines are neither to be read strictly in metrical rhythmic order nor as
ordinary speech. To understand the meaning of the poem, we must get at the tone
of the speaker by accommodation, adjustment between tones. Then the speech
becomes the living voice of a character–a dramatic speaker’s voice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the short poems, however, are descriptive in intent. A lyrical element is
often present in them which swallows up the voice and emotions of the speaker.
Poems like “A Live Storm,” “To ET,” “Spring Pool,” “Iris by Night” are more
subjective than dramatic. The speaker, instead of dramatizing experience,
narrates a story with himself as the chief participant. We might call these
poems descriptive lyrics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are then the narratives at times conducted wholly in terms of the narrator’s
own tone of voice and at times making extensive use of direct narration. In the
later type which we might call mixed, direct speech is used to enliven
narration within the narrative. The speaker quotes another man’s speech in the
latter’s own language and tone of voice. By this the reported speech is
rendered to us with immediacy. At times, we also hear the narrator mimicking
the other man’s tone of voice. The pure narratives like “The Gum Gatherer, “The
Bear,” “An Old Man’s Winter Night” have a gripping story and the narrator
punctuates his voice in the course of the narration in such a way as to bind
the readers’ interest to the central idea or character of his story. In “Brown’s
Descent,” of the mixed type, Frost studies a human character in lighter moods.
The narrator himself, like the happy-go-lucky Brown, is in a gay and vigorous
mood and allows his imagination to hop along lovely nature. The light, playful
tones of “Brown’s Descent” are in contrast to the grim and tragic notes of “The
Vanishing Red” where a Red Indian’s life is unfolded. The Red Indian, John’s
only mistake, if that were a mistake, was that he gave a “guttural exclamation
of surprise...in poking about the mill,” which the Miller took as an affront on
him particularly because it came from one “who had no right to be heard from.” And
with a casual “come, John,” the Miller leads the credulous John to his burial
ground. The poem is close-knit and most poignant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in recent times so much shook people out of their wits </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as
the Radio broadcast from Madras on the evening of 26th September 1966
announcing the collapse of Dr. C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
the National Liberal Club, London. To those who knew him very closely the shock
was greater because of the feeling that Dr. C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, who would
never own defeat in any of his encounters in life, should have, without a fight,
surrendered himself to the merciless foe, death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was something in C. P., which cannot be easily defined, that accounted for the
perennial glamour about him, not for one decade or two, nor for one generation
or two, but for successive periods extending to nearly sixty years, from the
time he entered the profession of law till he actually left us. As a matter of
fact, none at present living, among the oldest even, would remember when C. P.
was not a well-known figure in the public life of this country. Others who
started much later than he, as well as those who had earlier been in the public
eye, have all, one by<i> </i>one, left the scene. He alone remained,
encompassing a very extensive section of our history during times both stirring
and vicissitudinous. For it was the age of the Mahatma, whose appearance on the
Indian stage was later than the year of actual prominence for C. P., as an
intrepid fighter for a cause, namely, the Narayanaiah vs. Beasant case. In
spite of the fact the case was purely a legal one, the issues involved seemed
then very much bearing upon a public movement, the Theosophical Society, whose
influence was not favourably considered by a section of the public in Madras.
Needless now, at this distance of time, to go into the details of the
particular matter. Suffice it to point out that Mrs. Besant, whose great work
for the revival of Indian Culture and the Indian freedom fight were
incalculable, lost the fight against C. P. Mrs. Besant herself argued the case,
and one can imagine how much of self-confidence should have actuated the
younger person </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to measure his powers of eloquence and argument
against such an orator and international figure as Mrs. Besant. It is said (Dr.
Ramaswami Aiyar himself had confirmed it) that Mrs. Besant who showed generous
appreciation of talents and abilities in any one, and much more in this
instance in a younger person who opposed her without betraying any diffidence
or personal antagonism, held out her hand for a hearty shake, accompanying it
with a request to C. P. to join her in her Home-Rule agitation in politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a doting lady she turned to be on C. P.! Every bit of C. P.’s activities became
a subject for publicity in her paper the ‘New India’ which as an English Daily,
before the twenties of this century, touched the peak of circulation. Naturally
C. P. was a top man with, no doubt, intrinsic abilities of an impressive order.
In the legal arena he was no mean cross-examiner on the Original side of the
Madras High Court which then was enjoying a great reputation. It was the time
when some of the legal luminaries like K. Srinivasa Ayyengar, S. Srinivasa
Ayengar and Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar were displaying legal talents worthy of
any great Bar. He was not only capable of forensic debates but, outside the
court, was the <i>beau ideal </i>of students of colleges and members of
cultural bodies for addressing them on any topic germane to their interests.
Not that he was an artist to the finish, in speech, like the Rt. Hon. Mr.
Sastri, but he was none the less, facile of oratory and flow of ideas. He was
not a stickler for correct expression and idiom in English as Mr. Sastri,
though he was any day a much more enthusiastic performer on the dais,
especially when the audiences were large and varied in temper and outlook.
Again, more than points of contrast, the similarities between the two men in
their general acceptance by the public were born of their striking
personalities. In appearance, if Sastri was captivating in his long coat and
white turban and ever drew people by his lofty demeanour, C. P. possessed a
handsome face and a powerful voice which, when added to his polish of behaviour
and readiness of speech, proved irresistable to both the older and the younger
groups. Probably in their outlook on life and their divergent careers they
showed quite a mark contrast. If Sastri, from the outset of his public life,
courted renunciation and self-abnegation and sought only the higher virtues of
selfless devotion to causes like the Servants of India Society, C. P. was spurred
by legitimate ambitions at the Bar, in his earlier years, and by later
successes, one leading to another in his middle age, never culminating, but
ever opening out vistas for further laurels to be </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>won
and further conspicuousness to be gained in a widening field of activities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the Bar he was noticeable from his early days as a person of extraordinary
ability and accommodation to the claims of his clients and of the Bench. He
never fought with hardihood, though ever alert to secure the best for the
causes and clients whom he espoused. In short, as an advocate he was conscious
of his duties, as a member of the Bar unwilling to surrender his independence
or dignity, and as a senior, with a growing practice, always approachable by
his juniors and apprentices at law gathering in his chambers. With many an
important contest on the Original side, C. P.’s name was associated on one side
or the other, and if his venturesomeness in the circumscribed jurisdiction of
the High Court, as then constituted, has to be mentioned, he was almost the
first to file a writ of Certiorari–a direct method of seeking redress by
invoking the inherent powers of the High Court of the land to quash proceedings
pending before any Court below. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
who were dazzled by C. P.’s prominence hardly troubled themselves to find out
how his father, himself a lawyer of no small reputation, and later a Judge of
the City Civil Court, had been responsible in a way for the vigorous and varied
attempts at meeting life on many points that C. P. eminently disclosed
throughout his life. Sanskrit, no doubt, was taught to him as a lad by a
teacher specially to impart correct knowledge to him. French and Latin too, at
a time when in no other home of well-to-do parents, were given as part of<i> </i>the
instructions in the early years of a schoolboy, enriched C. P.’s linguistic
fervour. School and college imposed discipline en C. P. while young, but the
parental vigils over the only<i> </i>son’s progress in studies was not of the
kind ordinarily met with. If the pencil had to be sharpened, the father helped
the son in order to save both time and distraction from studies. Still, games
and amusements were not eschewed; why, C. P. was even a tournament player in
tennis and brought credit to the college team in football. There was an inborn
desire in C. P. to learn everything worth trying one’s hand at, and also to
strive not to be the second best in anything he employed his mind or his skill
to succeed in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
were the expectations when C. P. stood for the election, contesting for the
Legislative Council in the city of Madras, under the Montford Reforms which had
been worked in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1920. But no sooner his flush of success in a
hard-won election fight could subside than came to him offer of office from the
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Government to become the Advocate-General of Madras–a post </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which
had a line of antecedent occupants, the like of whom no other country could
have had in such superb succession. Bhashyam Ayyengar, Sankaran Nair, Sivaswami
Aiyar, K. Srinivaaa Ayyengar, S. Srinivasa Ayyengar are not names which can
ever be surpassed for either their legal acumen or their thorough study of
problems requiring solutions for legislative proposals. C. P. succeeded such a
galaxy of intellects; but before, in the new office, he had served the Government
for three years, there was another opportunity, in a higher sphere as Member of
the Executive Council of the Government of Madras, he had to function. It was
all a drama of action for him. Every scene of it was one of sensation. There
was not a day passing without his standing before the footlights in their full
glare. He seemed then possessed by a fiendish spirit to travel the entire
Presidency of Madras from corner to corner, breadthwise and lengthwise, by
train and car, in order to inspect and assess the needs and requirement of the
country, through personal knowledge. Every railway station waited with
garlands; every public place, he was scheduled to visit, anxiously organised
meetings and welcomes to the honoured guest. Speaking at more than one place in
a day became the normal programme of his. The Pykara Electric Scheme originated
under his initiative. The Mettur Dam emerged under his direction from the blue
print; Canals in Tanjore Delta for carrying extra water to the fields during
the watering season for the crops were planned and started for execution in his
regime, despite a foreign Government’s lukewarmness and unreadiness</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>all
showed remarkable strides taken, as in no previous period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
retirement from Government service was only auguring <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>the advent of more beneficient activities in other fields and in
other places. If as an adviser to the many ruling princes, both in the north
south of India, he had to exert himself constantly in their then ambiguous
relations with the British Crown, he was no less active in preparing himself to
become the Dewan of Travancore, which under its young ruler just then emerging
from the Regent Rani’s care, sought most of his ungrudging advice and
cooperation. Perhaps in the annals of no other Dewanship of the Native States
of India was there a greater variety of achievement and brighter record of
useful work for improving conditions of the subjects in Native States than </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
Travancore. Along with Sir T. Madhava Rao and Sir Seshadri Aiyer, his name will
be ever cherished as the most dynamic one that ever planned and succeeded in a
great measure in placing a Native State of the extent of Travancore on the map
of India. Every industry with natural resources of raw materials available
within the State was started, improved and set on its wheels for unimpeded
movement. Every cultural activity was encouraged, to become a model for other
States to follow. Drama, museum, parks, care of wild life, picture gallery–not
one of the symbols of advance and civilization was left uncared for. There was
an all round Welfare State, responsibility shouldered, and work finished, with
record speed and efficiency. The crowning stroke of his genius was apparent
when the Temple Proclamation was declared by the Maharajah, thereby taking a lead,
before the Mahatma and his followers were able to bring almost a change of
outlook in the caste Hindus, concerning the untouchable problem, and their
reclamation from the attempts at conversion by other religionists. Through the
corridors of time the paens of his fame will ring as of no others, and for long
will India recognise the most benevolent of administrations in his Dewanship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still
as everything amazingly successful too, may have another side to it, his
Dewanship of splendid achievements created ill-will </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
disaffection in some quarters and groups. They waited for their opportunity to
create vicious propaganda and reaction against him. There was one act of C. P.,
which however laudable from his sense of loyalty to the Ruler of Travancore,
was not quite in consonance with the spirit of the times–a spirit which at the
dawn of Freedom for the entire country strove for unity and strength as a
requisite preparation for an Akhila Bharat–one in dream and action. His
opposing the Post-Independent move for the consolidation of the New Bharat, by
bringing in all the States then under different rulers under one single
administration, was fraught with risk to himself and his reputation. He was,
only that instance, below the usual mark of shrewdness and alertness, or
perhaps he was feeling the conditions existing in the country were not quite
propitious for an India with a really new hope and programme. Whatever might
have been his motive, he was solely tried in his pursuit of a path that
ultimately showed he was not, as usual, right and wise in his step. There was
for a short time a shadow of defeat cast on his generally successful life. But
as innate spirit and capacity for adventure always carried him aloft as one who
wings to the azure skies, he regained himself in no time, which meant he was
cheerful and steady in his progressive strides of encompassing, within his
range, educational institutions. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To Benares he went as
the Vice-Chancellor of the Hindu University; to Annamalai University he
hastened to leave the impress of his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>personality on its
affairs. More than once in high level commissions set up by the Union
Government under Nehruji he acted as a member, sharing in the voluminous
reports that were prepared as a result of the labours of those Bodies. Everywhere
he was listened to with attention; his wisdom and persuasive manner of approach
to problems were welcome to persons not having had the same richness of his
experience. To China as India’s Envoy he was asked to go leading a delegation.
He was the earliest to warn people of their living in smug complacency and of
the enormous work done in China and their unprecedented advance in methods of
warfare. His public exhortation to wake up from the torpor was not heeded to by
authorities then with any sense of realities. He showed no rancour or
disappointment against persons in authority for their indifference. If at all, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
remained to the last without any grouse against a Government which seemed
totally oblivious of the great storehouse of executive </span><span

place. His cosy study, not to speak of his taste and orderliness in presenting
an inviting place to all, are standing monuments to his elegant taste and
methodical life. His ambition not to eschew anything worthwhile acquiring stood
him in good stead. He was not an epicurian but an aesthete; his range of

purchasing the latest editions of any new literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

carelessness in the general conduct of oneself were certainly alien to his

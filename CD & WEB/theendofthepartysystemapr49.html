style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>PARTY
politics is an institution proper to a ruling class which owes its predominance
to wealth. This is the view of Burnham, and it seems to be true. Subject to the
kind of reservations usually necessary with such broad generalisations, it can
be defended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two-party system can work, and therefore persist, only if the parties refrain
from pushing their differences beyond the limit set by the interests which they
have in common. The necessary awareness of common interests, and the
self-restraint necessary to bow to them in spite of the passions of political
conflict, come naturally to a ruling class, but are unlikely to be attained by
an electorate as broad as a whole nation unless its education and traditions
are specially favourable. Futher, a ruling class whose members are satisfied
with their economic and social position is interested in the limitation of
state power, whereas a nation-wide electorate can always hope for advantages
from state action. With this wide electorate therefore, the political contest
tends to degenerate into a reckless competition in promising benefits. The
powers of the state moreover tend to increase, its possession becomes a more
tempting prize, the abuse of those powers becomes ever easier, and
self-restraint becomes ever more difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The facts are in accordance with this
generalisation. In nearly all countries the vote was confined to the propertied
classes until about fifty years ago. Since then it has been extended to the whole
adult population, and after a short time-lag, the party system has given way to
the one-party system. This however is not party politics at all. The party has
ceased to be a part: it has become the whole. The election, the essential
feature of genuine politics, has become a useless and ridiculous formality, but
it continues to cost money and is bound eventually to be dropped. Ultimately,
it may be, politics as we know it will be replaced by a purely administrative
system such as that proposed by the Technocrats. But this is to look some way
ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are some exceptions to these statements. Party politics is still in favour in
America. But there the whole electorate is still convinced of the advantages of
a non-interfering, limited state, and this situation favours the two-party
system. The Presidential Election of 1948 may however mark a change. The public
has voted in a time of prosperity for a New Deal policy, that is a broad policy
of state intervention in economic affairs in the interests of the poorer
classes. This is a big departure, a shedding of the traditional distrust of
politics and the state. The American parties, with their spoils system, have
always been nearer the one-party type than European parties of the old era. The
attachment to party politics is of course very strong, but we can say that it
has begun to break down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
Europe its decay has gone much farther. It resists change most in small,
prosperous and highly educated countries, which saw their best days under the
two-party system and are therefore strongly attached to it. The Labour Party
regime in Britain is putting an unwonted strain on it, and in a country less
firmly bound by tradition it might be in danger. In France the old politics
seems clearly to be doomed, unless it is rescued by Western Union. It is not
certain however that even Western Union will save the party system. If a common
government for these countries is eventually set up, the pooling of their
political life which that implies will produce a situation so novel that
prediction is impossible. It may well be that advantage will be taken of this
drastic departure to dispense with what are now widely felt to be the tiresome
conventions of the old political game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is therefore a resonably broad-based generalisation that the party system is an
institution of the bourgeois era, and will disappear with it. In the era which
is to succeed it, the productive system is likely to be more or less completely
fused with the state. Power then will depend upon control of the key positions
in the state and its economic apparatus, and in such a system party seems to
have no place. Possible exceptions to the generalisation are on the one hand
the small advanced countries in which the party system is deeply rooted, where
it may persist for some lime; and on the other some of the backward countries,
which are only now developing a modern political life. In these countries it is
possible that the party system may persist, because they will for some time be
led by what can be called a ruling class, though it will not be predominantly a
bourgeois class. In such countries the educated class is very definitely marked
off from the uneducated majority, so that it may be regarded as a ruling class;
and the existence of a distinct ruling class is one of the conditions which
made possible the two-party system of the bourgeois era. On the other hand,
this class will be largely composed of state employees, and this is a condition
very unfavourable to party politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
far are these general statements exemplified in India? The propertied class
still plays a considerable part, but it can hardly be considered the ruling
class: it is a part, but not the dominant part, of the ruling class. It is
listened to in Delhi, but evidently it does not get entirely its own way. The
ruling class is a broader group including officials, technicians, journalists,
indeed potentially all the educated class, and most obvious of all the
politicians. The great political leaders do not hold power as representing any interest:
they hold it in their right, by virtue of commanding the allegiance of the
party, and still more of the masses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
theoretical convictions of this educated class as a whole, and in particular of
its most powerful group, the politicians, are ostensibly in favour of the
two-party system. Yet it can hardly be said that system prevails. The Mahasabha
and the Communist Party have been and will be prevented–doubtless for excellent
reasons–from as constitutional parties. The Socialist Party is tolerated, in
principle, but its existence is not enough to make party politics a reality.
When it broke away from the Congress a year ago it failed to carry with it a
great number of congressmen whose support it had counted on, and the reaction
in political circles and the press was discouraging. Since then discontent with
the Congress governments has grown considerably, but this apparently has not
led to large numbers of the politically-minded public going over to support of
the Socialist Party. It leads rather to fear of a total collapse, and a
reluctant rally to the Congress. Thus both within the Congress and outside it
there is in practice a wide, if generally un-formulated, belief in the
one-party system as a practical necessity. Moreover the tolerance extended to
the Socialist Party by the governments is circumscribed. Its members are
subject to arbitrary arrest, especially when elections are just ahead. At
elections improper methods are adopted to ensure its candidates’ defeat. If its
leaders had not opposed the threatened railway strike last month, its position
as a tolerated opposition party would have been in immediate danger. It may be
said without excessive cynicism that the Socialist Party is not yet strong
enough to make party politics a reality; it shows no signs of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>growth
to the necessary extent; and if it began to grow so strong as to threaten the
ruling party, that party would use the state power to forestall it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
general the two-party system is preferable to the one-party system. Political
life sets the tone to a considerable extent for other public activities, so
that where free discussion and respect for truth are preserved in politics they
will be preserved in other departments of thought, whereas if they are
suppressed in politics they tend to disappear elsewhere. In all the
totalitarian states we notice a lowering of the intellectual and moral level of
public life: propaganda dominates everything. The two-party system therefore,
though its effect is mainly indirect, is favourable to culture, and it is the
most effective safeguard of the civil liberties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
two-party system in India would certainly be preferable to a one-party system.
Nevertheless the conditions most congenial to the two-party system do not exist
here, so that even if that system is established it will be in some measure
artificial. The country cannot expect therefore to enjoy the full benefits of
the system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no deep conviction about such tolerance as is extended to opposition: it
hovers on the verge of suppression, and may well be completely suppressed if it
becomes powerful. This situation is not favourable to freedom of thought, and
it can be said that public life generally, journalism, literature, the cinema,
even the academic world, are still half-slave and half-free. The country has
not yet felt the full benefit, in other spheres, of its national freedom. Many
have been puzzled by the indifference of the public, their failure to celebrate
their freedom with the expected outburst of creative energy. Here is part, at least,
of the explanation: people do not feel free.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
lack of freedom is not a matter merely of a transition period until the new
state is stabilised. It is inherent in the situation. Power is not in the hands
of the capitalists: that might conduce to freedom. Power is mainly in the hands
of officials and politicians, that is the state machine. The potential ruling
class is not broad enough to challenge this power monopoly. The opposition
parties are manned by members of this class, the educated class, but they have
to address their appeals to an uneducated electorate, suffering from more or
less acute poverty and other disabilities. This can only result–if the
opposition have any serious hope of winning majorities in the legislatures–in a
competition in demagogy. Such competition may perhaps be better than no
discussion at all, but it can hardly be an elevating influence. Moreover it
would inevitably provoke disorder, and lead to the suppression of the
opposition. There is no room for parliamentary politics in our public life, and
the freedom which would flow from it cannot be expected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
parliamentary era is at an end, then, and this is true of India too. It is
necessary therefore to think out new forms and methods whereby the things we
value, culture, liberty, and the spirit of democracy, can be preserved. For the
present, while our institutions remain parliamentary in form, they can be used
only if not pressed too far. The monopoly of the ruling party cannot be
threatened, and it would be wise of the opposition parties to refrain from any
attempt to threaten it. But small opposition parties can play a useful part as
critics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
the present the method of the opposition parties, and their main function, must
be intellectual. They are part of the new ruling class, which is essentially an
intellectual class: it is moved as much by ideas as by interests. Rational
discussion and propaganda are still permitted, and will remain so if freedom is
not abused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

public life is to stagnate in the anomalous and undesirable form of the

prophesied in detail, but it may be said with confidence that democracy in a
backward but increasingly equalitarian society will have to concern itself with
the quality of its citizens as much as with the forms of their organisation.
Nineteenth-century democracy was concerned primarily with forms. It assumed
that the quality of its citizens was adequate, and it worked effectively only
when the franchise was so restricted that the quality of the voters was high.
As soon as the suffrage was extended it began to break down. The totalitarian
societies met the difficulty with coercion and indoctrination. A democracy
cannot adopt those methods, or it ceases to be a democracy; but it must </span><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A democracy cannot dispense with coercion, that is
it cannot remain a democracy, unless a high proportion of its citizens are
responsible, hard-working and honest. The essential long-term task of those who
favour democracy is to develop those qualities. The necessity confronts us at
every turn. Consider corruption. This causes so great a loss of efficiency, and
so much discontent, that it can be a serious danger to political stability. To
corruption is ascribed the main responsibility for the collapse of the Chinese
Republic. Administrative measures have been tried, but have done little to
improve matters. Obviously nothing will root it out except a change in the
public mind.</p>

necessary changes all point the same way. Democracy cannot work, the country
cannot be fed, the country cannot be saved from a regime of terror, except by a
change in the national consciousness, a moral change. The Westerner thinks of
the great moral reform which swept over Europe four hundred years ago, and made
possible, among other things, the industrial revolution and democracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

task of bringing about such a change in India should be greatly facilitated by
the fact that Mahatma Gandhi spent his life preaching it. If we put aside his
antiquated economics and his cranky dietetics we see that what he was driving
at, all the way through, was the cultivation of this post-reformation
personality-type: hard-working, punctual, thrifty, honest, responsible,
co-operative, public-spirited. His special symbol, the charka, stands more than
anything else for hard work. Perhaps the most fundamental task of free India is
to cultivate this personality-type. One can venture to say that this, rather
than constitutions and programmes, ought to be the subject-matter of post-party
democracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

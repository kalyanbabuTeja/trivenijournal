mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is a big event, every year, the School Day at
our Girls’ Middle School. Preparations begin as soon as the school doors open
after the summer recess and the children troop in. The person who is afflicted
with headache earlier than all others is, of course, the Music Teacher, for,
she has to select the play. Modern prose plays are too short and too drab for
mofussil audiences. Besides, like processions before mosques, they avoid music.
(And, they revel in widows. No girl dare play that role in our town, as
elsewhere.) An up-country stage without a harmonium to raise a curtain of
accompany for the play to break through, will attract only as many fans as a naphthalene
ball can gather ants! So, the story has to be pre Kailasam,<sup>1</sup>
preferably <i>puranic</i>. Even then, the choice is severely ringed by the
devious laws of politics and sociology. They are tough critics, the elders of
our place, and their skins are of the stuff of gossamer. Some plays, for them,
are too ungodly and others too erotic. Harischandra is too Gandhian and
Prahlada too revolutionary. Mudrarakshasa is pro-Brahmin, Parasurama is anti-
Kshatriya; Sadarama is anti-Vaisya; Uttararama Charita is anti Sudra(ka)
Sakuntala introduces fishermen; Lava-Kusa traduces washermen; Krishna Leela
elevates cowherds and Choodamani sanctifies monkeys! Aswamedha goes against the
grain of the half dozen jutkawallahs of our town. The choice, last year,
therefore fell on Rajasuya. This play had another argument in its favour; its
cast was so numerous that every single girl in the school could be thrown in,
somewhere. This was an important consideration, for, if any tot, was dropped,
her parents would go to pieces and prevent the Music Teacher from raising her
voice in the town, again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>For some years now, the tradition has taken root in
our town that some girls shall appear as some characters in the school play,
whatever the theme. Doddapapanna’s daughter is a hardy annual as Krishna. The
audience cannot escape her and her only song, <i>Nagumomu</i>. Break that
unwritten law and you start a fusillade of irresponsible, anonymous missiles
against all responsible. Rajasuya had, thank God, Krishna in the regular cast.
The Post-Master’s daughter had on her the stamp of the heroine, and who but the
Police Sub-Inspector’s daughter had the make up of the hero? The daughter of
the Ration Officer was a born Bhima; the temple priest contributed a Bhishma; a
jutkawallah’s family contained the needed Aswathama....About thirty girls who
were ‘extras’ could assist as Rishis on the occasion of the great sacrifice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Rehearsals were held every evening till the sun
went down, for over six months, in the school gymnasium. Every word and note
was drilled into the children. The townsmen put up with all that noise, hoping
that a decent show would finally emerge. Many of them stealthily peeped through
the window bars and learnt the lilts and the cliches and made them the property
of the public. You could hear even elderly men, at their desks in the shops,
discuss the <i>samgita </i>and the <i>sahitya </i>with their customers and
pompously prognosticate the finale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>At last, a President was secured and the date
fixed. Subscription lists went round and came back. The pandal rose up proudly
in the school compound, with its fringe of green mango leaves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The drama was definitely not a ‘failure’! Indeed,
it could well have been worse, as many remarked, considering the talents of
those who trained the girls. The criticism of others was moderated by the
thought that the children were young and they could only do their best. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Before the curtain fell, the President, no less a
person than the <i>Amildar </i>of the Taluk, scrambled on to the stage and made
a speech. That speech and the distribution of prizes that came later marked the
beginning of the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The speech conformed strictly to standard. The
President began by confessing that he was utterly incompetent to preside over
the function, for the obvious reason that he had never attended a Girls’
School. He then elaborated, for the benefit of a restless and gradually
emptying house, the basic principles of education (especially female), the
burdens of parenthood (especially male) and the mysteries of Divine
Dispensation. While distributing prizes, the <i>Amildar </i>melted somewhat. He
condescended to stroke some winners on the head, smiled equinely on others and
sought to educe the names of a few. He was a young man who had been turned out
of the University but a few years ago, and he had a habit of grinning blandly
at all and sundry. He congratulated Bhishma with the words, “Your beard is
quite natural”; he complimented the Head-mistress on her twins; he said it was
unlucky that the Harmonist could not be seen by the audience and that the Music
Teacher deserved a long rest. He asked all the actors to give up the Stage and
take to the Silver Screen. When, finally, he dangled silver medal before
Sisupala, he stood up in his shoes and spouted three complex sentences, full of
adjectival clauses, praising her vituperative venom and, believe it or not, her
musical voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>After he left the town, we reaped the whirlwind.
The girls whom he stroked and to whom he spoke became so swell-headed that they
taunted the others into unrighteous indignation. All the noses of the school
were either up in the Appleton layer or down under the teakwood desks. Those
who did not get the prizes attributed their fate to ignorance, partiality or
communal prejudice. They refused to attend a school in which they were insulted
and others prized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

giggling crowd, and her prospective groom cancelled the marriage, for, as he
said, “Her cheek was astounding”! This news alarmed other parents and many
marriageables withdrew from school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But, it was Sisupala’s mother, the Second
Assistant, who suffered the worst. People wondered in whispers why the <i>Amildar
</i>had dilated so fulsomely on her daughter’s meagre accomplishments. The
silver medal too was a surprise, pulled out of the President’s packet at the
last moment, by his own tainted hand. Constant repetition made even the
waverers accept the stories as authentic. Whiff of suspicion from the main
cloud cast ominous shadows, even on the other Mistresses and the Music Teacher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affairs, branded the entire bunch as undesirable, and led a delegation to the
higher regions of Government. The Inspector of Schools attempted to assuage the
fury, which only added another chapter to the adventures of scandal. Finally,
the teachers were all transferred to other institutions, but no one dared take
their places, under the pitiless floodlight of small talk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

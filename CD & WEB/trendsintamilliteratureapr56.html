<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the last decade, Tamil Nad has been going
through a fast change of outlook. People’s minds are obsessed by the democratic
idea and the spirit of Socialism. The conservative belief in certain moral
standards as part of building up a society in which we have had our living and
moving, no longer holds us. The raging madness for linguistic areas and
boundary demarcations has ushered in noticeably a false set of values.
Universal suffrage guaranteed under the Constitution in some measure and the
breaking up of social barriers have made inroads into age-long notions of
respect for upper classes. With the infiltration of communistic ideologies,
there is a steady accentuation of feeling that none can be superior to any
other in any matter. The dire result happens to be a startling
matter-of-factness born of too great a tendency to ignore spiritual values in a
country where a rare tradition has attached the utmost significance to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cheap Tamil press, in the shape of a plethora of periodicals of all
conceivable. varieties and prices, has flooded the country with ready made
opinions on all matters affecting the happy co-existence of persons belonging
to many grades and types of society. As competition forces these dailies to
greater licence of language, there is a perceptible lowering of standards in
taste and authentic reporting. Some of these organs of popular will are merely
born for spreading communal hatreds and keeping alive class conflicts through
communication of cheap and often vulgar indictments against well-established
reputations as well as sensational headline news of abnormalities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

innocent and the unsophisticated among the readers, however small they may be,
get into a mood of feverish mutual recrimination and intolerance, resulting
sometimes in frantic demonstrations and disfigurations of street walls with
anti-social slogans. Propaganda of every type when engineered by political
adventurers becomes responsible for a virulent poison getting injected into the
hearts of men and women of even distant villages, hitherto in comparative
security from social conflicts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again
a group calling itself ‘Progressive Writers’ has started sowing seeds of doubt among
the indiscriminate readers that what hitherto they enjoyed as literature could
any longer comfort them. This doubt happens to be the result of a hallucination
that they are creating a more serious literature than those who were keeping
old men and women from their corners by telling them mere tales of love. It
insists on the subject matter of the novel or the short story or the play being
intended for the making of a better world by means of criticism of the existing
order. In brief, it tries to give an impetus to the theory that art has a
mission for describing something more intimate with actual life than stories of
heroism and love. According to it when the very existence of man is jeopardized
by the presence of acute economic difficulties creating problems of the day
like the condition of labour and the urgent need for distribution of employment
to all, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>no more can mere love themes call up the
sympathy of the reader at large. Modernity is absolutely necessary in
everything and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>concept of youth itself, according to it,
is a new cry forgetting as it does that the revolt of youth is as old as Angada
in the </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless
we know that however much changes take place on the surface, down below in the
depths everything remains the same. Otherwise the appeal of the Classics
universally cannot be possible. One of the witty writers of the West remarked
that the more the world changed the more it remained the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
the desire to achieve freedom of expression, fiction in any shape would easily
draw the literary novice, as it has the advantage of conveying truth in as
convenient manner as possible. It can say things with precision without seeming
so much as tending to say it. But the art of the novel and the short story are
both not so easy to handle as many seem to imagine. In order to make it all
look probable and the characters live in the pages, the novelist has to press
into service a series of incidents and facts that are not by themselves so
interesting, though highly significant for the development of the story.
Nevertheless the novel may also degenerate into one of sheer story or plot
interest satisfying the craving for clever turns and surprises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>An artist has to remember certain things if really
he cares to remain an artist first and last. Even though, for the sake of
realism, he has to draw upon the raw material of life, he has to eschew a good
many details in order to achieve his aesthetic end. He is not a photographer
but a painter. While the one is a pure mechanical process, the other makes a
totally different attempt, depending upon so many superior aids as proportion,
perspective, colour sense and imagination. In a painting a good deal has to be
omitted in order to make the portrait all-absorbing. In similar manner, we find
even in the most realistic fiction so much of omission compared to what we get
in actual life. Literature, we may conclude, is like the cream which comes up
after the churning of the milk of experience. A true artist only introduces
what strikes him as the kernel of his observation of life. Thus in a good novel
we prefer expectation to surprise. Shocks and surprises are the stock-in-trade
of the melodrama. “Literature does what life does not–it eliminates the
unessential”, wrote a modern English critic. It certainly sums up everything
that could be said of a good effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Creativity
cannot partake of things unreal. Our modern mind, itself a hasty tourist, in
its breakneck speed over superficialities ransacks the markets of cheap
sensations. This is the net result of its innate sensitivity to life getting
dullened by constant preoccupations of a distracting kind. The literature it
produces seems sometimes like investigating into the bizarre, the
out-of-the-way and the abnormal. It has to rack its resources in order to be
striking. It elaborates mere changes in style as in modern millinery and the
outcome, we find, is a mere polish of the metal, not the bloom of the rose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
danger of resorting to abnormality in order to be original has to be guarded
against. A great artist expresses his feeling, which is usual, in an original
manner and never in an out-of-the-way or abnormal milieu. Rabindranath Tagore
says in his </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“I
have read modern writing in which the coming out of the stars in the evening
sky is described as the sudden eruption in the bloated body of darkness. The
writer seems afraid to own the feeling of cool purity in the star-spangled
night, which is usual, lest he should be found out as common-place. From the
point of view of realism the image may not be wholly inappropriate and may be
considered as outrageously virile in its unshrinking incivility. But this is
not art; this is a jerky shriek, something like the convulsive advertisement of
the modern market that exploits mob psychology against its inattention. To be
tempted to create an illusion of forcefulness through an over-emphasis of
abnormality is a sign of anesthesia. It is the waning vigour of imagination
which employs desperate dexterity in the present day art for reproducing shocks.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hardly
will it be necessary for me to add to what has been so vividly expressed by the
poet. Only I may be pardoned for saying that there is nowadays a tendency among
the writers of novel and short-story here to exhibit morbidity and seek
abnormality for appearing fresh. Some have even mistaken the purpose of art to
be a censorship of conservatism and of the conventional in life and thought.
The sex theme is often therefore indulged in by some whose purpose requires
external aids to sustain interest in literature. The absorption of the writer
in mere sexual life </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of man is bound to be sterile of literary
matter. No doubt there is nothing that can draw the curiosity of the adolescent
more </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>effectively than the theme of sex and there is no kind, of
curiosity </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that provides less food for the Imagination. If
questioned as to how best to preserve the true from the false type in
literature, it </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>may be difficult to answer. All that can be
guaranteed is that delicacy of taste of one type or other is as much necessary
to the a</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rts as it is to preserve society from
disintegration. Perhaps without such wholesome restraints, the arts too may
tend to become monotonous trivialities. Valmiki, Kalidasa, Kamban and Bharati
knew a great deal more than any of us about lower life and the bogs and mires
of human imagination, yet they never portrayed all that confronted their sight,
taking care to be ultimately artists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have explained, perhaps at greater length than needed, why art sometimes
degrades itself if writers lose themselves in mere realism. If today the stream
of imagination in Tamil Nad has more often to carry mere turbidity and current,
we may have to attribute it to the nature of the freshes when they first emerge
from the hills and course down in rapids. Experience and time, like banks, will
control the rush of writings from spreading into an inundation and spoiling
cultivated tastes and standards around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
word more while dwelling on fiction. Tamil Nad has in the recent paid produced
only short story in great quantity, principally because of the incessant demand
on writers from the journals for only the story, to the exclusion of any other
form of writing, even the novel appearing in serial. One can now say without
fear of contradiction that, more than the novel, the short story produced here
has impressed the literary world outside. Perfection in the art of short story
in some manner is within reach of the absorbed wooer, unlike the novel which
demands of its votary </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>qualities of more than one type to
sustain its appeal. We are already perceiving a healthy reaction to the
enormous output of short story. Informed minds there are nowadays who evince
visible disapproval of stories which can at best only entertain or divert the
reader, but not hold him in their grip for long by their thought-content. With
all that, there is no gainsaying the fact that surer discipline of the pen is
more perceptible with the growth in the number of periodicals, Another
important result of the incentive to writing given by journals is the quick
addition to the number of women writers. A score of them have demonstrated the
capacity for serious thinking and profundity of expression in contrast to men
writers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the new endeavour of publishing translations of works from other regional languages
like Bengali, Marathi, Hindi, a select group of authors have distinguished
themselves by the advantage gained in knowing more than one language. But as
yet, beyond fiction, other works of modern writers in the other languages have
hardly gained favour with this group. Russian, French, Polish and American
stories have also found their way into Tamil language by reason of the interest
evinced by publishers who know the trick of making best sellers out of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

drama has yet to find a steady welcome from us. Save for the very limited
instances of this form of literary craftsmanship, we may have to deplore the
barrenness in this field. Thanks to the early enthusiasm of Pammal Sambanda
Mudaliar, we have a number of presentable stage-plays, but to christen them as
literature may perhaps require temerity. The staging of Tamil plays is of
course on the increase since very recent times, partly due to the individual
talents of certain actors of merit as also due to the desire of some
playwrights who, through the stage and the screen, are doing propaganda for<i> </i>certain
political views getting disseminated among the masses. The immediate outcome of
such motives is visible no doubt in the declamatory speeches put in the mouths
of characters supposed to be engaged in dialogues, and the veiled themes
suggesting hotly contested questions of the hour in the public mind. Beyond
satisfying crowds of indifferent levels, they do not convince art-lovers of any
sustaining literary experience. The drama, we know, is not so easy to create.
So many elements of human knowledge and arts should go to create it. That is
perhaps the reason why old Alankarikas in Sanskrit always referred to it as the
high water mark of literary excellence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

nobility of purpose and stamina for endeavour were to be forthcoming, the
biographical section of our literature can in no time be filled with exemplary
life studies. Appreciation is a faculty which is as much a stimulus for

lack of this quality which has been responsible for the attenuated supply of
books in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

serious essay and the light skit have no attraction for the moderns. The very
import of essay writing no longer appeals to people who exert themselves only
to get entertained and never to be moved deeply by anything they read. It
cannot be said, that one cause alone is responsible for the absence of the
essay form of writing. The reader as well as the writer are both accountable
for mutual reactions on the type of book production, especially when most

making available to our readers the precious results of the scientific

timely, when we as a new nation want to grow with other nations and take a part
in the deliberations of an United Nations Organisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

classics have drawn the modern scholars, who have the advantage of Western
models, for presentation of old themes in new forms. Thus many a votary of the
immortal poems of Kamban and Ilango have sought, not in vain, to create fresh
enthusiasm in the young of the land by editing highsouled texts from ancient
lore, replete with lessons for good conduct and noble living. Perhaps the last
five years have seen many more books and articles on some of these classics as
in no other period within our ken. The greater scope for Tamil studies in our
Universities is in a great measure accountable for some of these authors also
flourishing. One striking feature arrests our eye in almost all these modern
attempts at reinterpreting old books. They are written in simple understandable
prose, unlike their predecessors of a few decades back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

litterateur, his <i>bhaktas </i>and followers like Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajaji

they have supplied in the shape of books of lasting merit. Rajaji as a Tamil
prose writer can for long retain his hold on minds that are prone to receive
edification from his thoughts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

coming to the field of poetry, let me touch upon the individual and institutional
agencies responsible for a widespread recognition of Tamil literature and its
growth in recent decades. ‘T. K. C.’ as an individual had, by his overpowering
love for Tamil, lighted a lamp the oil of which has had frequent feeding from a
host of others. The ‘Kalaimagal’ and the ‘Kalai Vlarch Kazhagam’ have advanced,
by their award of prizes of substantial amounts, the increasing zest for
creative work. Other smaller groups are also serving in the same way to keep up
the spirit for talented persons to do sustaining work in the field. Some of the
well-known Mutts have also come forward in the same direction with ample
bounties for religious literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

poetry in verse form has had no<i> </i>mean order of votaries starting from
Kavimani Desika Vinayakam Pillai to the latest schoolboy who writes off a few
lines for children’s magazines. The variety and range of levels of mastery of
poetry is of a bewildering kind. Not many of them are poets but merely
stanza-composers. A few have originality and still fewer vision. Music
composers too are in their midst and a lot of indifferent lines get attuned to
music. Whether metrical quality has been fully explored or whether the ear for
symphony has been completely satisfied in them, one thing is sure, that every journal
worth the name publishes something in the nature of verses, thereby giving a
fillip to writers specialising in the field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me close now. To survey Tamil literature during the present juncture is no easy
task, fraught as it is with so many handicaps. In the first place one is so
close to the times when these writers exist that he is denied the correct
perspective to judge. Again the space of an article is so short that one cannot
bring in everything he wants into it. Further, the impossibility of clear
demarcation between imaginative and other types of writing makes the attempt
difficult. More than everything else, embarrassment and a sense of unripeness
of judgment upon writers who are contemporaries, have prevented my furnishing
concrete examples and names of many for whom I would love to find a place in
any account of Tamil writing. I hope, my endeavour to show what way trends in
literary writing are pointing will enable the reader to gather a sustaining
harvest of impressions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

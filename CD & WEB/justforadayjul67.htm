that she was a disciple of Gandhiji’s ideal of simplicity, would perhaps be led
to think she was a witch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

return-deeds and in these she saw the merciful God. She was not clever enough

took a steady and firm grip on the hammer. Her face clenched with determination
and the veins of her hands stood out. Iron clashed with stone. The stone
disintegrated and chunks flew apart. She gathered the stone-pieces, some weighing
as much as five to ten seers and put them in the brick-layer’s trough. She
tried to lift it but it didn’t budge. Her breath came spasmodically. Her
drooping body was a fire. Nagda was watching from a distance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

re-commenced smashing the stones. A chunk of stone which she had wedged in
between two boulders flew at the stoke of the hammer and pierced the feet of
the child who was seated at a distance. The child shrieked in pain. The other
labourers in the midst of the noise of crunching stones didn’t hear the child’s
cry. The old woman tore a piece from her tattered saree and prepared a crude
bandage. She spit in the wound to stop it from bleeding. Fortunately the injury
was not serious but the child, weak from hunger, whimpered from pain. She asked
the child to sit at a distance. The wheel of work moved on. She could not stand
the strain. Her mind was dazed and tongue parched. Will water quench hunger?
Only one question obsessed her now: When will the sun set? When will the work
end? When will my hungry eyes feed on a piece of bread that my eight anna wages
will earn? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

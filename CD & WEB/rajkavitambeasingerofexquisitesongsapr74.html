font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Two
poets belonging to the earlier era of Modern Marathi poetry, who could be
credited with having a large following and a ‘School’, are ‘Keshavsut’
(1866-1905) and Bhasker Ramachandra Tambe (1874-1941), whose birth centenary is
being observed in Maharashtra and the Marathi-speaking areas outside it. There
was a generation gap between the two. If Keshavsut was the pioneer of modern
Marathi poetry, Tambe too was a new trend-setter. Each was a stalwart in his
own right and influenced generations of poets. Keshavsut–the “poets poet” was
an exponent of progressivism. His was the poetry of revolt-both literary and
social. He had blown his ‘Trumpet’ (‘Tutari’) ‘to bury the old and bring in the
new’ and called himself ‘a soldier of the new age’, while Tambe was mainly
preoccupied with love, chivalric romance and philosophy. To some critics, his
poetry, “after Keshavsut and his kind appeared to be a relapse into escapism.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
was, it is said, because Tambe, living in Madhyabharat, remained isolated from
the main-stream of Maharashtrian life which in a state of political and social
ferment. But actually the difference between the two poets was rather
‘temperamental’ than environmental. They differed in their approach to poetry.
To Keshavsut–poetry had an agitational role; while Tambe did not approve of
using the muse as a vehicle of reform or propaganda. Both have written on the
sufferings of Hindu widows. But Keshavsut’s these and other widely-acclaimed
poems–like ‘Tutari’ and ‘Zapurza’ appeared to Tambe as “Sermons.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Born
in April 1974 at Mugawali (in Gwalior State) where his father was holding a
small government post, Tambe spent his entire life in various princely states
of Madhyabharat. It was during the reign of the third Peshwa that his ancestors
were brought from Konkan to Jhansi for administrative help. He was distantly
related to Rani Laxmibai, the daughter of Morapant Tambe. After a chequered
career, he entered into the state service of Dewas and later moved from one
State to another. He started writing poetry in his teens and was ‘discovered’
while at Indore, by some of his literary friends who compiled his poems. His
poetry was thus introduced to Maharashtra first by poet Maydeo in 1920 and then
in detail by Madhav Julien, a leading light of Ravi Kiran Mandal–a group of
poets. Its effect was instantaneous. Tributes came thick and fast. But the best
form of tribute was general invitation. Tambe is considered to have influenced
the poetry of Borker, Madhav Julien, Kusumagraj to some extent, and Pandit,
Kalele, Zokarker, Kant up to Padgaonker. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The phenomenon of his
great popularity could be explained in several ways. Firstly, Keshavsut, the
radicalist, was long dead. So were the other major poets of literary
Renaissance of 1885-1920–Rev. Tilak, ‘Vinayak,’ ‘Govindagraj’ and ‘Balkavi.’
With them the first wave of literary fervour had cooled down. Secondly, he was
taller than any of the poets of ‘Ravi Kiran Mandal’ which was then making
headway. Thirdly, his poetry had struck quite a different note. His lyrics were
chaste and refined, the, had musical quality, sensuousness of style, and a
philosophical strain. He introduced many new patterns of verse-rhythm, wrote excellent
love lyrics and dramatic lyrics hitherto unknown to Marathi poetry. The
feudal-romantic setting of some of his poems had an exotic appeal, while his
traditional imagery evoked an easy response. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Several influences, both
Western and Indian, went into the making of Tambe, the poet. In his early years
he was deeply affected by Marathi and Hindi Saint poetry. Later, he studied
Sanskrit poets and Indian poetics. In his college days he became acquainted
with Shakespeare and the poets of Romantic Revival. But Tennyson and Browning
were his special favourites. The musical quality of his poetry and his
experiments in prosody were due to his love of music, in which he had taken
lessons from some State musicians. His thought was moulded by Indian Philosophy
in which he had deep interest, which is reflected In his poetry, especially of
the later period. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“This is a remarkable
feature of my poetry that it has grown with my life”, he says in a letter to
Maydeo, (dated 24-4-33), “it babbled like a child when I was below fifteen. It
was licenscious in my early youth…….It dwelt upon love after wedding till
children sprang up round me. Then it sang of children. Reconciliation to the
realities of life brought in a fresh crop of love poetry deeper in note and
more universal in character.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tambe’s poetry for
children consists of songs ‘for’ children and songs on children. Many of his
songs for children were written for the popular children’s magazine ‘Anand’,
edited by W. G. Apte who was his friend, whiles others were written for the
young princes of Dewas, whose tutor he was. He also translated Browning’s ‘Pied
Piper’ for them. This poetry was noted for its psychological portrayal. In the
words of Prof. W. G. Patwardhan, a fastidious and famous critic of those days, “these
songs are as simple, pure and sweet as children.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like Browning, Tambe
unsuccessfully tried his hand at play-writing and then took to Dramatic lyrics.
As<i> </i>Browning himself had explained, these lyrics “though often lyric in
expression, always dramatic in principle, are so many utterances of so many
imaginery persons, not mine.” Obviously drawing inspiration from Browning,
Tambe wrote dramatic lyrics on a variety of themes. “Rajkanya va Tichi Dasi”
(‘The Princess and her maid’), ‘Pannas Varshanter’ (‘Fifty years after ‘),
‘Dole he julmi Gade’ (‘Your naughty eyes’), ‘Naditiri Ubhi Tee’ (‘She stands on
the river-bank’), ‘Ka re jashi maj Tyajuni?’ (Why do you desert me?), these and
many others are Tambe’s special contributions to Marathi poetry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tambe’s multi-faceted
poetry consists of several hues. But Love is the predominant one in which he is
at his best. Some of his exquisite lyrics were a crase in those days. These
love-lyrics are not addressed to any ‘beloved’ as is commonly understood, but
to his ‘wife’ in whose love he found fulfilment (But then this was the only
kind of love that came to the lot of the poets of that age!). His wife to Tambe
was like Indumati to Aja–a beloved friend, partner and guide. Sometimes he
compares her to a Goddess who, he says “sweeps his house, while Gods above envy
his lot.” “My songs bloom in the lake of your eyes!” he says, “From your love
spring my<i> </i>tunes!” With age this love ripens, becomes hallowed and turns
from sensual into spiritual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In later life, Tambe
became preoccupied with the Ideas of ‘Death’. Most of his mystic poetry belongs
to this period. His eyes are turned towards the “Home left far away”. Like
owning who said of<i> </i>death as “one fight more, the best and the last”,
Tambe says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

finery, anxiously waiting to be united with her divine lover. In another poem
he cried like Tennyson: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But it would be unfair
to dub Tambe as “an artistic and philosophic dreamer” and his poetry as
‘escapist,’ as some critics have done. It would also be wrong to presume that
because he spent his life in the native states he was anti-reformist and
reactionary. On the contrary, perhaps the feudal atmosphere in the princely
states made him more sensitive to the prevailing economic inequality, slavery
of the common man and immense miseries of the poor. His poetry is replete with
references to these things. He denounced the palaces as “Abodes of evil”,
“palaces steeped in stinking blood”, “where sinful desires do a mad dance,”
“where riches flaunt and happiness flies away”. He laments over the lot of the
poor “who sell their children for a handful of corn” during famines. His poems
on widows depict their sorrows and sacrifices His patriotic poetry (howsoever
slender, in volume) was inspired by contemporary events which shook the
country. His early patriotic poems were written when the country was agitating
against the partition of Bengal, Jalianwalabagh massacre, the repressive
Rowlatt Act and the Russian Revolution were responsible for Tambe’s outburst in
his famous poem “Invocation to Rudra–the Lord of Destruction.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tambe wrote an elegy on Tilak. Next two years saw him come under Gandhi’s
spell, when he wrote his “Gandhian quintet”. Gandhi’s “Young India” was his
favourite journal. He saw, in Gandhi’s non-co-operation movement seeds of a
revolution ‘unique’ in the world. But by 1927, his fervour for Gandhism appears
to have subsided when he saw the movement fail due to its own weaknesses. This
disappointment is reflected in his poem “Watele Nath Ho!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“Ghatotkacha Maya,” “Samrajyawadi” examples of a biting satire, speak of subtle
economic exploitation of India by the British. But in ‘Trinache Patey’ (Blades
of grass) he warns the rulers who crush masses under their feet that it was
from them that incarnations of Vamana and Narasimha arose to kill the
oppressors! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though this patriotic
poetry does not form a major part of Tambe’s output, it goes to show that Tambe
was not a poet living in his ‘ivory tower,’ and did go with the times. His
contribution to Marathi poetry is not mean. After the front-rank poets of<i> </i>Marathi
Renaissance were dead, and Marathi poetry had degenerated into sentimentalism
and popularization; Tambe set the ideal of<i> </i>artistic perfection. His
poetry was similar to Tennyson’s ‘perfect music set into noble words.’ Prof<i>.
</i>R. S. Jog compared his songs to Jayadeva’s ‘Ashtapadi.’ In celebrating his
centenary, Maharashtra is paying homage to a poet laureate who was a great
singer or exquisite songs! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

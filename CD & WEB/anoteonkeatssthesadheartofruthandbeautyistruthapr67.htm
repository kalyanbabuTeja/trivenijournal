lines from the <i>Ode to Nightingale </i>are said to refer to the Bible story

as the Bible Ruth. It is just possible that Keats’s fancy kidnapped Ruth not

Ruth is sad, sick for home, in tears, amid the alien corn. The Bible Ruth is
neither sad nor sick for home nor in tears though amid the alien corn nor is
there a mention of nightingale in the <i>Book of Ruth. </i>The Moabitess clave
to Naomi unlike Orpah and became a citizen, naturalized in Bethlehem. She
marries Boaz and is bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. As far as the Bible
story goes, even ‘alien corn’ is inapplicable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
story of Ruth is one of the loveliest and most elevating in the <i>Old</i> <i>Testament.
</i>The sentiments expressed by Ruth remind a Hindu reader of similar
expressions in Samskrit literature. The husband’s household is the
daughter-in-law’s home and the parental house is ‘alien corn’. In a play of
Bhasa the father says that his daughter came of age to serve her father-in-law
and mother-in-law; he does not say that she came of age to be married. Ruth’s
following Naomi, her mother-in-law, is a noble turn of the blood: Bethlehem can
be your native place as much as Moab may be the place of your birth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Barnes has this very fine appreciation of Ruth: <i>The Book of Ruth </i>is
exquisite in its simplicity and grace; Goethe described it as the loveliest
little idyll that tradition has handed down to us. The story moves forward
easily and naturally; it is filled with the spirit of kindliness...Early or
late it deserves to be immortal. Contrast the fierce nationalism of Esther with
the words of Ruth the Moabitess to the Israelite widow: Whither thou goest, I
will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people,
and thy god my God. With such affection the daughter of Moab came to Bethlehem.
Half the world now turns with like love to the Judaen village. <i>(The Outline
of Literature, p. 92) </i>The story is touchingly illustrated by P. H. Calderon
in the picture ‘Ruth and Naomi’ in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
should be very clear now that the Bible Ruth cannot be Keats’s Ruth. Then who
is this Ruth? My suggestion is that this is Wordsworth’s Ruth. Wordsworth has a
poem, <i>Ruth or The Influence of Nature. </i>Of course there is no mention of
the nightingale in this poem too. But Ruth abandoned by her lover from the
green savannahs is in tears, amid alien corn and so sad that she becomes mad.
She is imprisoned and escapes and lives under the woodland tree soothed by
nature. I think this fits like a glove Keats’s lines; the very title of
Wordsworth’s poem strengthens my suggestion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
context also seems to support this suggestion. The nightingale is immortal.
(Sapient critics like Bridges and Garrod, as if scoring a point against Keats,
say: How is the bird immortal? There is no logical fallacy at all for the
simple reason that poetry is not logic. What the imagination seizes as beauty
is truth to the poet. Poetry is full of truths felt in the blood, not discovered
in the pia-mater.) Its song, which Keats listens to, should have been heard by
emperor and clown in ancient times. Nature’s riches, unlike the cinema shows,
are for the poor and rich alike. And coming down to later times the song should
have solaced Ruth too. The word ‘perhaps’ is significant; Keats is not sure of
his facts. Keats imagines that, because the nightingale’s song filled him with
a drowsy numbness, it should have given similar happiness to the emperor if
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, (Perhaps Keats is referring to Hans
Anderson’s story of the Chinese Emperor and the Nightingale.) to the clown
suffering from looped and windowed raggedness, to Ruth in tears in a foreign
country, to a princess pining away in a magic palace beyond the perilous seas.
Whether it is in far-away countries or far-off times, the immortal bird is
there with its full-throated ease. Keats cannot imagine a starved and songless
nightingale or a song which tells of far-off unhappy things and battles long
ago. The bird is happy; its song is happy; the poet is happy till the world
‘Forlorn’ plunges him again in the weariness, the fever and the fret. The poet
is disillusioned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
nightingale’s song or the Grecian Urn is a fraud: they cannot be relied upon
for long. For sometime they are like an opiate. You forget the leaden-eyed
despairs. And then comes reality like a killing frost. It is just like coming
out of an air-conditioned room; the moment you step out, the comfort too is
gone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is what Keats states in these two odes. They are twins with the same soul or
content. The nightingale’s ecstasy becomes a plaintive anthem the unravished
bride of quietness becomes a cold pastoral. Fancy cannot cheat for long; you do
not know if you are awake or asleep. You do not know if it is a vision or
reverie. In other words, is it a revelation or a shortlived ecstasy of humbug?
In the world of commonsense the nightingale’s song i</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>s
neither plaintive anthem nor ecstasy. These are, poetic imaginings like the bird’s
immortality. It is neither Eliot’s Jug, jug to </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dirty ears’ nor
Milton’s (most musical, most melancholy.’ The nightingale’s song is plaintive
not because of the Greek story of Philomela ‘by the barbarous king so rudely
forced’ but because of its ineffectiveness in drugging Keats into permanent
happiness. The song is a stimulant–that is all: like Huxley’s mescalin or the
boozers’ gin or everybody’s coffee. At the height of ecstasy the poet desires
to cease upon the midnight with no pain just as Othello turns to his fair
warrior and says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

insensibility to the heart-break and misery induced by the brede of marble or
the nightingale’s song cannot be a permanent succedaneum if you are living clay
and not a sod. One of the wisest remarks of Keats is that the afflictions of
Man are as native to the world as man himself; one cannot dream away these
afflictions. “Suppose a rose to have sensation; it blooms on a beautiful
morning; it enjoys itself; but then comes a cold wind, a hot sun. It cannot
escape destroy its annoyances–they are as native to the world as itself, No
more can man be happy...” The happiness induced by the song is so unreal,
insecure and fragile that a mere word ‘Forlorn’ dissolves it. That is strange!
How ridiculous! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a way the Ode is verbally, in addition to being ideationally stitched. The
‘full-throated’ in the 1st stanza takes us to the ‘vintage’ of the 2nd. ‘Away’
in the last line wafts us to the ‘away’ in the 3rd and the ‘aways’ in the 4th,
‘No light’ of the 4th connects with ‘I cannot see’ of the 5th and ‘darkling’ of
the 6th. ‘Rich to die’ of the 6th takes us to the ‘immortal’ of the 7th. And
‘forlorn’ of the 7th is just one step to the ‘forlorn’ of the 8th–and the
forlornness of Keats and the hopelessness of the shadow of a great rock in a

is interesting to note in all the Odes traces or echoes of the same poetic
vocabulary as if a lecturer should ring variations on the same lecture intended
for more than one class. The ‘drowsy numbness’ of <i>Nightingale </i>is echoed
in ‘drowsily’ of <i>Melancholy </i>and Lethe figures in <i>Nightingale </i>and <i>Melanchory;
</i>‘rich to die’ shows itself in ‘rich anger’. ‘Beauty cannot keep her
lustrous eyes’ is equated by ‘Beauty that must die’. <i>Nightingale </i>and <i>Psyche
</i>have ‘forest dim’ and ‘in a forest’. Moss-lain dryads are matched by
light-winged dryad, Bacchus rushes back to the <i>Sorrow </i>ode as the
sacrifice in the <i>Urn </i>goes back to <i>Endymion. </i>The bird is immortal:
‘she’ cannot fade. Hungry generations is repeated in ‘When old age shall this
generation waste’. There are casements in <i>Psyche and Nightingale. </i>‘Many
a mused rhyme’ is in ‘our rhyme’. The ecstasy of the <i>Nightingale </i>becomes
‘wild’ in the <i>Urn. </i>Spring in the <i>Urn </i>is questioned in <i>Autumn: </i>Where
are the songs of spring? The <i>Urn </i>as a whole reminds one of <i>Indolence </i>ode.
‘Did I dream or see?’ is a repetition of ‘Do I wake or sleep?’ ‘Their lips
touched not but had not bade adieu’ is a recasting of ‘Never canst thou kiss’.
‘Happy’ is plural in <i>Psyche </i>and <i>Urn. </i>‘Midnight hours’ of <i>Psyche
</i>is in <i>Nightingale </i>‘cease upon the midnight’. Pipes and forest boughs
are in <i>Psyche </i>and <i>Urn. </i>The bees in <i>Autumn </i>are the
murmurous haunt of flies in <i>Nightingale. Psyche, </i>the loveliest vision,
is mournful in <i>Melancholy. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

where but to think is to be full of sorrow. And happiness eludes the poet. In
the <i>Nightingale </i>he realizes Fancy cannot cheat so well; in the <i>Urn </i>the
silent form teases him out of thought; even in the <i>Autumn </i>the question
is raised: Where are the songs of Spring? ‘Thou hast thy music too’ is like the

critics give us an album of snaps of Keats’s spiritual development. They start
with a puny and sensual Keats of slippery blisses and sidelong looks of love.
Next we have the photo of a mere artist untroubled by a soul. At the third
stage Keats is one of flint and iron, not a milksop as pictured by Shelley.
Hence <i>Adonais </i>may be great as an elegy; as a picture of Keats it is
negligible. Keats’s poetry is a triumph of character. When we consider that the
tradition was in decline, the family ineffective, his education inadequate, and
the contemporaries uncomprehending we cannot but admire his toughness. Cut up
by reviews, separated from George, bereaved of Tom, financially lamed by a
loophole in the will, devoured by love, struck down by galloping consumption
any other would have collapsed; Keats composed his odes; he is the Alexander of
song. The fourth snap reveals Keats as the embodiment of Ripeness is all.
Shakesperian vision and comprehension are ascribed to him. Arnold’s He is with
Shakespeare, Bradley’s He is of the tribe of Shakespeare, Murry’s Ripeness is
all–fill out this picture. Next Wasserman makes out a metaphysical Keats. A
plea is made for supplementing the study of Keats’s poetry by a study of his <i>Letters.
</i>The <i>Letters </i>are to an understanding of Keats what the <i>Prelude </i>is
to an understanding of Wordsworth. But why should we allow ourselves, protest
some, to be influenced by the <i>Letters </i>when we discuss the Poems? As we
close the album, we are told that in the last analysis Keats’s poetry is
unsatisfying. And readers’ interest shifts from magic casements to None can
enter here, from elfin grot to the granary floor, from beaded bubbles to globed
peonies, from honied indolence to Beauty is truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the odes Keats is shuffling off the dreams and the phantoms. He is discovering
himself. Poetry is no longer a drug; it is a deed; a cockney becomes a classic;
Spenser is subsumed in Shakespeare; Flora and Pan give way to a nobler life,
the agony and strife of human hearts. The earlier Keats is poetical; the later
Keats is a poet. Hence his remark that poetry should be great and unobtrusive,
a thing which enters one’s soul and does not startle it or amaze it with itself
but with its subject. Eliot’s well-known statement that the greatest poetry is
that which goes behind poetry is partly derived from Keats. In the Odes Keats
is trying to steady himself about Art and Life, Beauty and Truth, Change and
Permanence, the Actual and the Ideal, Sensation and Thought, the Practical and
the Visionary, the Eternal and the Temporal. Keats’s poetical Odessey was from
Spenser to Shakespeare, from <i>Endymion </i>to the <i>Odes. </i>Who fished the
murex up? The coarse-bred son of a livery stable keeper. Who wrote the <i>Hyperion?
</i>The poet of <i>Endymion. </i>Both the facts are astonishing and tease us
out of thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Odes are a great lake. They are richly meditative; Hamlet might have written
them, says Ian Jack. Here Keats has no master and he leaves no disciple. Out of
the song and the Sonnet he has fashioned a galleon-like stanza which moves slow
because of consonantal density and strength (as Mr. Bate has analysed).
Shelley’s poetry leans forward eagerly (as Dr. Leavis put it excellently) and
Keats’s stays put; it is unhasting and unresting; it does not sprint; like a
snake which has swallowed a rat it moves slow. Keats believes in loading every
rift with ore. Denotative elaboration, always a sign of an amateur, gives way
to the economy of suggestion. Gone is the drowsy richness, the voluptuous
enchantment, the hot-house heaviness, the dreamy vagueness, the misted
opulence, the vapoury dimness though, of course, even in the <i>Urn </i>the
repetition of ‘happy’ is a damnable iteration. The Greek spirit tightens the
odes; personal suffering makes them meditative; English strength pervades them.
Minor talent flowers into a genius of the first order and a versifying pet lamb
is something of a philosopher. It is harder, says a critic, to write a great
ode than a great drama. We find here <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Psyche </i>is an allegory of love and the purification of the human soul. It
celebrates cosmic nuptials and is agonizingly alive. <i>Melanchory </i>is
Poesque and revises our traditional opinion of melancholy. <i>Autumn </i>is
bursting with tumescence and is regarded as the greatest and completest of them
all. The personification in the second strophe is said to be the greatest and
we forget hey are words at all in this ode. But the two veriest glories are the
<i>Nightingale </i>and the <i>Urn. </i>The <i>Nightingale </i>is said to be the
most richly representative, a <i>cri de coeur, </i>deeply charged with human
feeling: ‘distillation’ is Pettet’s word. But to Blackstone the poem is
crippled right at the start and to Wasserman forces contend wildly in the poem
not only without any resolution but without any hope of resolution. It is not
Keats but Wasserman that bewilders us. The ode to Nightingale can as well be an
ode to Death which is life’s high mead and absolute felicity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
undoubtedly the most provocative is the Urn. The poem like the silent form
teases us out of thought; it is a Hamlet among Keats’s odes. It is the Holy
Grail or the Tarpeian Rock of Keatsian criticism. The Urn has nothing to do
with Lord Holland just as the Nightingale has nothing to do with Hampstead. The
ode is an ode to an imagined Grecian Urn a fragment of auto-biography, a tract
on aesthetics, a paper on creative process, a debate on life and art, a
discussion of poetry and other arts, an explanation of the poetry of
suggestion, a critique on the Timeless and Time, an essay on realism and art
for art’s sake. And to state that Nightingale and Urn are ‘escapist’ poetry is
to be ourselves ‘escapist’ from criticism and interpretation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Beauty = Truth equation is a commonplace to
some, to others a New Testament of Dantesque grandeur. According to Bridges the
lines save the poem; according to Eliot they spoil the poem. To Quiller Couch
they are the reflection of an amateur; to Prof. Bowra they are the last word on
a type of creative activity. Some say that with that precision, which great
poetry affords, Keats has epitomized in 5 words the doctrine of aesthetics just
as in ‘magic casements’ he has expressed the quintessence of romance. It is a
pseudo-statement to Richards and meaningless twaddle to others, a commonplace
from Plato downwards or is to be found elsewhere in Keats. To some the Urn is a
central poem; it gathers to itself all other resonances, urns, pots, jars,
vases, concavities, sea grottos, mountain caves; it is the image of the womb, a
centre of power, of healing and wisdom. Dr. Leavis debunks this that it need
not raise metaphysical tremors of excitement or illumination. No wonder the ode
is the most familiar, the richest in texture, the most obscure. </p>

ode which had led critics of stature to contradict one another should have its
argument put down carefully in ordinary prose for the sake of clarity. Keats
sees on an urn maidens struggling to escape from a mad pursuit, pipes and
timbrels play-struggling under the trees. He then muses: the trees will not
lose their freshness, the youth cannot leave his song, the lover cannot kiss,
she cannot fade. He sees another scene–the scene of the sacrifice and muses:
the streets of the town will ever be silent and none to tell us why the town is
desolate or uninhabited. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘For ever wilt thou love and she be fair’–is pleasant; ‘Never canst thou
kiss’–not pleasant; a desolate and silent town also is not pleasant. In art
nothing grows and decays; we welcome this power of art. But art confers
eternity on unpleasant things too. Iago is as undying as Desdemona and Caliban
is as alive as Miranda. Then the last stanza bristles like a porcupine with
difficulties and scares away the critic. The urn is addressed as attic shape,
fair attitude, silent form, cold pastoral. The first two do not trouble us;
‘silent form’ also does not tease us out of thought. The poet seems to say:
Well, I have been imagining all these things about the urn and the figures on
the urn but the urn itself is silent. It baffles us like eternity. The meaning
of the urn is intriguing like the smile of <i>Mona Lisa </i>or the face of the

this text is interpreted as the Bible of Keatsian Aesthetic. On the other hand
Keats seems to debunk it. It is a cold pastoral, no longer a sylvan historian;
the nightingale’s song cools off into a plaintive anthem. Hopes are dupes and
fears are <i>not </i>liars. Art gives only temporary respite from the woes of
life; art is not a permanent solution or anodyne. Merely to say: This is all ye
know and all ye need to know–sounds rather ridiculously pompous and all
knowing, if we bear in mind Keats’s negative capability or the power of
presenting uncertainties, mysteries and doubts without an irritable reaching
after fact and reason. This is not all we know; we know something more and some
of us do not know this. This is not all we need to know; we need other types of
knowledge–for instance the knowledge of cooking. Art means selection, selection
means exclusion. How then can we say: Beauty is truth...? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Poet’s truth is not the only truth; there is the scientist’s truth, the
philosopher’s truth, the prophet’s truth, the bricklayer’s truth, the
bomb-thrower’s truth. Shakespeare is the largest truth and beauty we have in
art. But even a bardolater has to admit that life is larger than Shakespeare
and more various. Keats with his ineffable common sense recognizes this higher
truth and hence rejects the Urn and its inadequate message announced so
pompously, so fanatically, so un-Keatsianly. Did not Keats say: Man should not
dispute and assert, but whisper results to his neighbour? (Letter, 19 Feb.

follows ‘cold pastoral’ cannot be regarded as the highest reach of Keats’s
thought. There is disillusionment in the <i>Nightingale </i>ode; there is
disillusionment in the <i>Urn. </i>Can appreciation of art be the be-all and
end-all of existence? Can the mad pursuit and the sacrifice solace suffering
humanity? Thou shall remain a friend to man in the next generation too<i>, </i>says
the poet. You have been our friend, you will be the friend of the next
generation too to whom you pass on the same unconvincing and dispiriting
message of beauty is truth. Is it not silly and cruel to talk about beauty to
groaning man, now or in future? What a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for
certainties in this life! Just<i> </i>as the bird is imagined as immortal, the
Urn is imagined as eternal. The bird is no more immortal than the urn is

Parthenon. What accident short of a world cataclysm could destroy the Odessey,

Miraculous Birth of Language, </i>p. 184) Language effects the marriage of
Parmenides and Heraclitus. The longevity of Tithonus was useless to Aurora; the
eternality of the Urn is ineffectual to man. The poet has no doubt that people
will take refuge in art but the solace is sawdust and ashes. The Urn is Job’s
comforter. Or does the poet exhort the urn to remain a friend to man? After all
art is something, if not all. Whether the message is all-sufficing or not,
posterity will lean on art. Is the Urn worthy to remain a friend? Is it a
pretension on its part? To pose as a friend. In life too many remain as

rest in art is to deny life and to pull out aesthetic rabbits out of these
lines is far-fetched ingenuity. Bridges’ statement that the poem postulates the
superiority of ideal art to nature goes overboard and the interpretations of
various critics that here Keats says the last infallible word on art walk the
plank. Keats is not the poet to escape the realities of life and seek happiness
in a stimulant. He writes Beauty is truth...only to reject it. If at all he
approves of beauty it is beauty coupled with truth as explained by Shakespeare
in 54th sonnet: Beauty of face is not enough; the goodness of the heart is
needed. The young man of the sonnets is affiicted by–economy of the closed
heart. The dog rose has as rich a dye as the natural rose but the fragrance of
truth is not there. Hence selfish beauty dies to itself. The beauty of the Clod
is superior to the beauty of the Pebble. Maugham states roundly: For art, if it
is to be reckoned as one of the great values of life, must teach men humility,
tolerance, wisdom, and magnanimity. The value of art is not beauty but right
action. (<i>The Summing Up. </i>p.187) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a note on Keats’s Ruth we have gone to Keats’s Beauty is truth. Both are
central to an interpretation of Keats. You can relate the <i>Nightingale, </i>writes
a critic, to other odes, to the rest of his poetry, to the Romantics, to
Spenser, and Shakespeare or to itself. The song of the nightingale might have
‘happied’ Ruth–only for a short time as it ‘happied’ Keats; the imaginative
participation in the ecstasy of the song is of short duration. The wave of
reality destroys the sand castle of happiness. Similarly the warmth of art in the
urn cools off. And when we are vexed and harried by woes, is the urn a friend
to man? And is not its message a cold pastoral? Is that all we need to know in
this strange and changing world that something made static by art is an
all-sufficing truth? Does the poet have less common sense than we? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has to compare this with Rupert Brooke’s <i>The Great Lover. </i>It is Keats’s
religion that the first in beauty shall be first in might. He is attached to
the Principle of Beauty, the memory of Great Men, and the Eternal Being. What
the imagination seizes as beauty is truth to him. What shocks the virtuous
philosopher delights the chameleon poet. He hovers over fine phrases like a
lover. He knows that poetry is joy in beauty, that beauty is joy in truth (not
philosophical or metaphysical or scientific but poetic), that truth is joy in
goodness (not ethical goodness but the unending diversity of god’s creation). O
for a life of sensations rather than of thoughts, he cries. He is not convinced
of the truth of anything unless the holiness of heart’s affections tells him
so. His snail-horn perception of beauty dislikes poetry that has a palpable
design on us. He disliked being bullied into a philosophy by Wordsworth’s
egotistical sublime. A poet is the most unpoetical of all creatures. All these
seminal remarks fill out the image of Keats the aesthete. But he wanted to be
of some help to his fellow men. Scenery is fine, he said, but human nature is
finer. He would make the miseries of the world his misery and do good to the
world through his poetry: the dreamer and the poet are distinct. If such are
Keats’s views is it just to have him, ‘cribbed, cabined and confined’ to mere
aesthetic doctrine spun out of his lines? We do him injustice if we think of
him as a Happy Prince of silken phrases and silver sentences in the Ivory Tower
of Aestheticism <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
link between the true artist and the mystic is well known, yet it seems
pre-eminently necessary to recognize the importance in both of the reality of a
different order. Both exhibit the same disregard for the things of this world,
but the artist uses for his own creative purposes much that the mystic
instinctively rejects. It is because the great creative artist has fluidity,
called by Keats ‘Negative Capability’, which enables him to enter imaginatively
into whatever immediately takes possession of his imaginative power. Thus Keats
wrote: “If <span class=GramE>a sparrow come</span> before my window, I take
part in its existence and pick about the gravel.” The mystic is not much
concerned with goodness, with the good life, as life in its entirety, but for
the great artist, there can scarcely be any aspect of life which cannot serve
as a production of his creative genius. In this sense, his work is analogous to
an alchemist’s transmutation of a <span class=SpellE>specialised</span> kind–he
transforms the material of common experience into various forms of art. To
perform this delicate office, it is sometimes necessary for him to sacrifice
happiness–even his life–and everything that makes life worth living for the common
man. In this process, the artist is indeed eager to lose his ego just as <span
class=GramE>the</span> mystic is; his life is of self-forgetfulness or even
self-effacements on one level and of self-finding on another. “Not I but God <span
class=SpellE>liveth</span> in me” is the mystic’s joyful cry; “Not I but the
wind of the spirit <span class=SpellE>bloweth</span> through me, “is the
artist’s self-abandoning affirmation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>’s
classic study, <i>Mysticism, </i>holds that “the mystic is a curious and
definite type of personality with the passion for a spiritual and intangible
quest.” This is also quite true of the artist though with him the end of the
quest is tangible issuing in art forms the beauty and truth of which can be
shared by all men; whereas the end of the mystic’s quest is union with God, and
therefore cannot be shared and remains intangible. But if the personality of
the mystic develops during his quest so much as to influence every one with
whom he comes in contact, his quest can also be said to be tangible. The
artist’s personality, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>curiously enough, is often an “offence”
to the ordinary man, and his very appearance seems to be disruptive to society.
So it is that he is more feared than disliked; and fear leads to abuse,
persecution, and sometimes even crucifixion. And yet because his personality
has strangeness of its own, it is powerfully attractive. Of Shelley, was it not
said that he had a spirit’s volatile speed, a quality in his presence not easy
to explain in other than spiritual terms? Similarly, was it not said of the
beauty and strangeness of the German poet, <span class=SpellE>Holdervor</span>,
in his youth that when he entered a room, “it was as if the God Apollo were
striding in?” And George Sand’s daughter, <span class=SpellE>Solange</span>,
was convinced that Chopin “was not a man, but an angel.” Denis <span
class=SpellE>Saurat</span> says, “The poets rarely <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
what they are. They are spirits who have lost much memory in contacting matter
and have forgotten that they are angels.” Though such evidence of the strange
supernatural quality of the great artist’s personality is very universal and
convincing, the contemporary concentrated conspiracy of the materialists tends
to reduce him to the status of a common man, because death-philosophy of the
materialistic age has so much spread throughout the world like a fatal
infection that there is little understanding of, or reverence for, greatness in
any form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
personality of the mystic also tends to waken such reactions as cannot be
easily explained–and this is of course natural–since both the mystic and the
artist live by certain inelastic rules and inexplicable values and in such
dimensions of experience as are beyond the understanding of the average man.
Take for instance <span class=SpellE>Emilia</span> <span class=SpellE>Viviani</span>,
<span class=SpellE>immortalised</span> in Shelley’s poem, <span class=SpellE><i>Epipsychidin</i></span><i>,
</i>has a real existence for him in what is called by Blake “Spiritual form.”
There is a sense in which everything deeply and vividly experienced has a quite
real existence, as Plato also knew well. It is not the “human image” of <span
class=SpellE>Emilia</span> but the inner self, her personality that inspires
the poet. For him she wears the shadow of the soul by which he lives. The
vision of the poet has seen a reality which indeed does exist, though not in
the dimension we commonly know or understand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the creative artist such a heavy burden, or so deep an obligation, is laid that
there is no wonder if he sometimes seems to stagger under its weight. Still
this immense burden, this deep obligation, does not let him fight shy of the
common burdens of everyday life. As person he has to live in the world and face
the music of life like any other man. But as artist he carries an additional
burden of his mission in life, for which he lives in the world–especial work
assigned to him by Providence to achieve which he came into the world, and the
knowledge of which gives him a peculiar, a strange, reaction to every aspect of
life. And the nature of his mission is such that he cannot live or see life in
the same perspective as any other man does in the world. He cannot but rebel
and carry on unceasing war against conditions so diametrically opposed to his
vision, and therefore he must court unpopularity. So it is that his proposals
and remedies are invariably unacceptable to the average man. Since he is a seer
gifted with a prophetic vision, he points the way to future development, but
his ideas are not well received by the people at the time he suggests them,
though they turn out to be true afterwards; and this makes his lot inevitably
uncomfortable in his lifetime. Shelley and <span class=SpellE>Kierkegaard</span>
are the two outstanding examples of victims to such a fate. How <span
class=GramE>might not our present calamitous situation</span> be ameliorated if
even one of Blake’s dictums alone was accepted: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is that the artist, despite these unflagging attempts to annihilate and

disregarding the conflict between good and evil going on in the outer world

world–where moods are framed, actions determined, and where in fact all that
eventually manifests in the visible world is conceived. The reason is that
“Such men carry the fire. All things grow warm to them” as Browning says. And

than exists in Western philosophic thought. One is to live life merely for the
sake of living without men experiencing the ordinary round of day-to-day
events, without any radical change taking place in them–in other words, the
facts and events of life that occur every day are not experienced by the
majority of people without anything being created within as a result of what
has happened; while in the other plane of being the same events, the same facts
are experienced and recreated by the mysterious imaginative power of artist.
For him the most trivial event is pregnant with tremendous experience and
becomes charged with creative significance and therefore it is immediately
transferred to the plane of creative imagination. So, it is that all the great
confusion and general disastrous understanding of the personality and mission

I have already pointed out, these different planes of being are better
understood in the East than in the West. Modern psychology, with all its
undoubted impulses and urges during the last forty years or so, has been able
to touch only the fringe of the complex problem of human personality and failed
to probe to the depths of the mind, the soul, the spirit, the heart, the
“Invisible” past of man, which can range the whole world in a flash to find out
how vast and complex that inner life is. And in the last analysis it is the
only life that should matter because from it all bliss, all tragedy, derives
and emanates. It is this life that conditions every external action and only
the artist is gifted to project it in some form of his creative art through his
imagination. This in itself distinguishes him from all other men. The artist or
the <span class=GramE>mystic,</span> lives in a dimension quite apart from the
dimension of ordinary living. He lives in a country, native only to his class,
whose ways, laws and problems are very different to those of the common world
of action and day-to-day <span class=GramE>affairs,</span> and therefore quite
unacceptable in the external world. It is the business of the artist to interpret
all those laws by which he inevitably lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

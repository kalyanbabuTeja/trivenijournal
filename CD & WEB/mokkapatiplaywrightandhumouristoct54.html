new movements in Telugu literature of the second decade of the century were
conspicuously <span class=SpellE>personalistic</span> and lyrical. The writers
of the time wore an amulet of lyrical anguish or pined after a mysterious
spirit which successfully eluded their grasp, thereby leaving them in an
intense subjective sentimentalism. Though they were able to offer a rich<i> </i>harvest,
it was one that only the reflective elite could enjoy. A rigorous objectivity
was lacking in them. They could not look at life dispassionately and
rationally; nor could they <span class=SpellE>rationalise</span> their
imaginative <span class=SpellE>fervour</span>. To achieve this end the writer <span
class=GramE>must needs</span> have a sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
which should not be confused with the comic or with the ludicrous. Such a
spirit of <span class=SpellE>humour</span> was ushered into the Telugu
literature of the period by <span class=SpellE>Mokkapati</span> <span
class=SpellE>Narasimna</span> Sastri.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has written many plays, short stories and essays besides his great work
‘Barrister <span class=SpellE>Parvatisam</span>’, though his name is
interlinked with <span class=SpellE>Parvatisam</span>. <span class=SpellE>Parvatisam</span>
is a <span class=GramE>character</span> that has acquired great celebrity
throughout the Andhra area along with <span class=SpellE>Girisam</span> who was
sponsored by <span class=SpellE>Gurazada</span> <span class=SpellE>Appa</span>
Rao. These two characters form a family relationship with <span class=SpellE>Falstaff</span>
and Don Quixote. <span class=GramE>Only the first part of ‘Barrister <span

country-bred innocent braggart, on his way to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

is the spirit of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, in fact, that pervades the
entire work of Sastri. There are six plays of his collected in one volume. Some
of them bear traces of European descent though all have gained the distinct touch
of Sastri. ‘<span class=SpellE>Mrokkubadi</span>’ is a short one act play based
on the belief that one can overcome any illness or danger by solemnly taking a
vow to please the deity <span class=SpellE>Venkateswara</span> by offering to
him everything possible. This traditional belief is based on genuine faith 8and
<span class=SpellE>devotiIon</span><i>. </i>But the sophisticated modern youth
is an egotist who rebels against all ideas of faith and devotion. Woman is by
nature a conservative, a traditionalist, while man is ego-centric. The union of
these two is bound to issue in a serious conflict. The vanity, arrogance and <span
class=SpellE>scepticism</span> of man assume the garb of rationalism, only to
crumble down in a moment of crisis. This is too familiar a theme to evoke and
sustain dramatic interest. <span class=GramE>And when the action.</span> <span
class=GramE>proceeds</span> like the lines of a geometer, there is bound to be
some monotony hovering round the play. The whole play turns melodramatic in the
middle and it is rounded off by dialogue of a semi-serious tone. As a problem
play it pleads for faith, faith in something or other if only to avoid the
cankerous mood of <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>focussing</span> our attention on the conflict between humanism
which insists on values and the scientific craze for destructive weapons which
annihilates conscience and negates all values. This play was composed in 1940
and the Great War provided the necessary impetus. The sister of the scientist
goes to the extent of shooting down her own brother, thinking that thereby she
is preventing the new scientific invention from seeing the light of day. It is
of course debatable whether a humanist can go to that extent. But she had lost
her husband and child on the battle-field; and this may be her only
justification. From the point of view of stage-craft this is a better play than
the preceding one. It </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The ‘elder uncle’ of the entire village is an indispensable institution.
Without him nothing can take place in that village. No one can think or act by
himself. All are his wards. As a guardian he looks after them. He has absolute
rights even in settling marriages and the terms of these marriages. As one
opposed to the system of dowry he proposes successfully a marriage alliance
between two families. The father of the girl pleads his inability to pay five
thousand rupees. He can go up to a couple of thousands only. But the uncle
refuses to agree even to the two thousands. And when the uncle is away, the
marriage is somehow celebrated, since he alone should not know the amount given
as dowry. But at the nick of the moment the uncle returns. And every one is
busy in detaining </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the uncle at the gate till the marriage is over.
He is impatient to enter. And he enters at last to bless the married couple.
The situation is humorous enough. It is portrayed in a masterly fashion, and
the sure hand of the artist is visible at every step. The situation of the
uncle evokes <span class=SpellE>humour</span>; but he is really in a tragic
situation. It was not he that was being deceived, but the protagonists. The
humorist is as usual isolated from the static institution. As an individualist
he pines for setting things right, for the time is out of joint. But the static
society cannot tolerate a dynamic humorist. Society decays and becomes a victim
of self-deception, since it refuses to see the real nature of things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

humorous is the ‘<span class=SpellE>Asadharana</span> <span class=SpellE>Samavesamu</span>’
(the extraordinary meeting). This too is a social satire breathing light <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> and portraying the typical modern associations that
dream of doing great things. An enthusiastic young man brings together a few
persons and they <span class=SpellE>organise</span> an All-India Association
which is ostensibly devoted to the supreme task of improving the lot of the
people in all affairs and in all directions. He is duly elected as its first
secretary. He wants to do something and so convenes an extraordinary meeting of
the association. Slowly the members assemble. Each member is interested in his
own gossip, and every one indulges in self-praise and in abusing others. The
meeting finally stands shelved. This typical characteristic of our countrymen
finds a humorous portrayal. It is developed deliberately while the secretary
stands flabbergasted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dissatisfaction with what one <span class=GramE>has,</span> goads the young <span

has acquired a huge fortune. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarao</span> must have all
that wealth, here and now, without any effort or struggle on his part. The

troubles of a young man brought upon modern lines. He finds his wife too
traditional and conservative. She cannot move like the modem society girl; and
his hunger for modernity drives him to flirt with another and to ill-treat his
own wife. Here is the conflict between the western and oriental <span

on the problem of the relation between the sexes. This serious problem
effectively treated in the lighter vein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all these, we have a fine play of <span class=SpellE>humour</span> along with
intense imaginative activity. Sastri takes pains to be true to the poetic
heritage inherent in the language of the masses. This is a rich and living
language which presents reality in a natural and comprehensive manner. We do
not have here an intellectual drama, though the dramatist is busy with the modern
social problems. The wildly superb reality comes before us putting us into a
trance. Every speech is <span class=SpellE>flavoured</span>; and every problem
yields, before the touch of the dramatist, all its tender, magnificent and
fiery spirit. The local life, as winnowed by the imaginative <span

collected his short stories in two small volumes under the title ‘<span

heard). Again the emphasis is on realism. These sixteen stories deal with
social, communal, political and cultural problems. Some of them are short
dissertations without a plot; they are more like a series of mental ramblings.
In most of these the substance is intensely tragic, and this tragic mood
invariably takes its awakening in these stories in a mood of <span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>‘<span class=SpellE>Nenu</span> ma <span
class=SpellE>Avidanu</span>’ is a reflective essay narrating the inexplicable
and inscrutable mystery of human life. The husband is a simpleton who believes
that he is great because people respect him and praise him to his face in the
market and elsewhere. But his wife does not find any greatness in him. On the
other hand, she takes him to be a fool and a victim of public fraud. He feels
grossly insulted; and her indifference pains him deeply. In his reflective mood
he asks whether women deserve so much freedom as he has given. The <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> here lies in the conclusion and in the selection of
the incidents. While provoking <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, the hus<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>band himself feels gloomy and depressed at his
wife’s <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>‘Banda <span class=SpellE>Subbadu</span>’ is a light
and successful satire on all those who run after medicines to get their weight
increased or decreased. A stout fellow takes to medicines and becomes as light
as a feather; and to avoid flying in the air, he has a suit prepared specially
for him. The suit grows under the weight of the bottles attached to it and
keeps him to the ground. ‘<span class=SpellE>Janma</span> <span class=SpellE>nakshatra</span>
<span class=SpellE>phalam</span>’ takes us again to a nagging wife of the
unfortunate <span class=SpellE>Kurmayya</span>. Whatever he does is subject to
severe criticism. When he saves a drowning child, his wife praises the unknown <span
class=SpellE>saviour</span> and ridicules her husband as being unfit to do even
one good act; and as she finds out the identity of the <span class=SpellE>saviour</span>,
she abuses him for <span class=SpellE>harbouring</span> thoughts of dying and
deserting her! In and out of context he must be the victim of abuse. He must
only thank his stars for his fate. ‘<span class=SpellE>Labhasati</span> <span
class=SpellE>Beralu</span>’ is replete with cynical <span class=SpellE>humour</span>.
The whiskers of an arrogant and showy gentleman are purchased because of a
discussion on betting and bargaining. The bargain was executed only when the
gentleman was on his way to a musical concert. Even then only half the whiskers
were taken out; and he was told that the other half would be taken later on. To
get rid of such a customer, he had to pay double the amount he received for his
whiskers. This appalling triviality has a good deal to say regarding the little
vanities and ironies of human life.</p>

  class=SpellE>Rajkot</span></st1:place></st1:City> in the middle, the
pseudo-Gandhi too leaves the families of the bride and the bridegroom to settle
their dispute about the dowry amongst themselves. Equally topical is ‘<span
class=SpellE>Akasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Saudhalu</span>’, written at a
time when Rajaji was introducing the sales-tax, entertainment tax and other
taxes. In this reflective skit Sastri offers novel schemes of taxation. Walking
on the marina after young ladies, stoutness, possessing whiskers and beards, <span
class=SpellE>westernised</span> dress of women, and many more things can easily
be taxed to yield great revenue to the State. At every step the author provides
valuable exceptions which remind us of the activities of the Congress. <span
class=GramE>Beards are to be taxed; but never those of the Muslims.</span>
Stout people must pay fines; but never actresses, poets and artists. To the
humorist the activities of our politicians appear crazy and immethodical. He
sees that these activities are directed towards a set of false values that
negate humanism. He has very little concern for parties and groups. He cares
more for the value and integrity of the individual. This insistence is again
the theme of ‘Ma <span class=SpellE>Bava</span> <span class=SpellE>maradi</span>
<span class=SpellE>Pelli</span>’ (The marriage of our brother-in-law). Marriage
as a social institution has become a force for chaos in the countryside. Large
numbers move to the house of the bride; and by the time the marriage is over,
the bride’s father turns bankrupt. <span class=GramE>Yet every one <span
class=SpellE>cpntinues</span> to <span class=SpellE>harbour</span> complaints
against the unfortunate father of the girl.</span> If you add a troupe of
dancing folk to these occasions, it is definite that no one will care to know </span><span

<span class=SpellE>Rattayya</span>’ is the story of a young man who reluctantly
becomes an actor and thereafter dreams of making the stage an effective and
realistic institution. He cultivates the conventional stage formalism even in
ordinary life. He behaves like an actor to his wife, children and friends. This
inevitably makes people take him to be a madcap. Life becomes unbearable to his
wife. Stage formalism is too static to withstand the dynamism of life; and the
humorist who has a vision of this dynamism laughs serenely at the
stumbling-block universe of rigid formalism which refuses to change with the
times. ‘<span class=SpellE>Ade</span> <span class=SpellE>Modatisari</span>’
(That was the First Occasion) is a light humorous skit on a vainglorious young
man who claims intimacy with the film studios and who is to take the author to
one of the studios at the time of shooting a picture. ‘<span class=SpellE>Anukoni</span>
<span class=SpellE>Avantaram</span>’ (Unexpected Happening) is an account of a
film director’s plea for realism on the screen. This cost him the flight of his
hero and heroine, who feel that in an intense realistic state of love they
cannot speak anything. Their elopement compels the director to close down his
studio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

more mature art appears in the six stories collected in the second volume. ‘Ma <span
class=SpellE>Padma</span>’ is a moving tragedy of a young married girl who was
ill-treated by the parents of her husband. The tragedy is too poignant and
bitter for words or even tears. For once Sastri reveals himself as a master
tragedian. ‘<span class=SpellE>Nyayam</span>’ is another deeply moving tragedy
of a <span class=SpellE>rickshawalla</span> who has to suffer imprisonment
because he cannot allow an Anglo-Indian or a Canadian or anyone to seduce his
wife. But the law does not <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> his marriage;
nor does it believe that a man with a white skin is capable of committing
heinous crimes. The law is for the privileged classes, not for the poor and the
downtrodden. ‘<span class=SpellE>Akharu</span> </span><span style='font-size:

story on the massacres enacted in the streets of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

League’s Direct Action Day. It is as realistic as it is bitter and humiliating.
Here too Sastri focuses our attention on the loss of values that has unleashed
this ghastly spectacle. ‘<span class=SpellE>Jagannathuni</span> <span
class=SpellE>ratham</span>’ is another tragic account of a young maiden, the
wife of a low-paid worker. She dreams of a variety of comforts which her
husband cannot afford. Slowly she comes into the clutches of a notorious
brothel-keeper, who is a member of <span class=GramE>a vigilance</span>,
committee set up to root out brothels and corruption. She is taken away from
her husband, made to lead the life of a prostitute, and is kept aloof. She has
no friends and those who visit her by night feign to be ignorant of her by day.
She was prepared to leave this wretched life. But a moral wretch in his passion
strangles her. This is a tale which is not unfamiliar to those who see misery
and immorality forced on many an innocent maid because of the lure she has for
the false formalism of the modern urban vanities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this collection. This story is woven round the Brahman-baiting prevalent in the
country. The Brahman is hounded out of society, only because he is a Brahman.
He is even to be killed. He should have no place to live in. His customs and
manners cannot be tolerated. And so he must leave his hearth and lands in the
village, and migrate to some other place as the Jews have done recently. All
this is done by the leading <span class=SpellE>polticians</span> of the
villages. The ghastly murder of a social worker coming from the Brahman
community is movingly told in this short story. It is a murder that is
motivated by a motiveless malignity. Yet the murderers are counted among the
rulers and progressive intellectuals and statesmen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

brief survey of the major work of <span class=SpellE>Narasimha</span> Sastri
clearly shows the new atmosphere he brought into modem Telugu Literature. He
has made literature an objective statement of certain universal experiences.
This objectivity was achieved through a spirit of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
which has been foreign hither to the literature of the country. Self-control,
personal identity, rationality, sympathetic insight and awareness of the tragic
depths of human life are the essential ingredients of this <span class=SpellE>humour</span>.
Through this <span class=SpellE>humour</span> he has been able to <span
class=SpellE>emphasise</span> the value and dignity of the individual, and the
essentially human values. His <span class=SpellE>humour</span> avoids the
incongruous and the improper which have no place in the aesthetic world. It
sets things in their true perspective. It sets up thinking. In this <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> we dissociate the individual from his supposed
static context and observe the naked fact as such. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
fact or reality, when it is made objective, makes us <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
what man in reality is. Thus is initiated a self-examination which <span
class=SpellE>developes</span> into a self-ridicule when it is pushed to its
logical conclusion. Then humility takes the place of fear and respect. In </span><span

<span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> work tells us that all intellectualist

man does not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

smile. It is laughter that takes us to the human level where sorrows and joys </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>are
intertwined; and if <span class=SpellE>humour</span> is valuable to us, it is
because of its realism its poignancy, and its rich and intense criticism of
life conveyed through sympathy. Sastri takes us through this <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> even when he is offering penetrating studies of the
tragic in life. Starting from the national institution called <span
class=SpellE>Parvatisam</span>, Sastri has been developing the various phases
of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, always keeping his eye fixed on the
individual and on the values. His characters evoke sympathy in us and draw us
closer to humanity. Their follies and frailties are intertwined with simplicity
and a common humanity. They enable us to give up, at least for the time being,
our dogmas and prejudices for the sake of the higher light of truth and wisdom.
While dance is the spirit of beauty, <span class=SpellE>humour</span> is the
spirit of truth. And truth and beauty make life real and therefore significant,
by making it spiritual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

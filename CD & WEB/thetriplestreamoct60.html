<h3>Preparing for 1962 </h3>

<h1><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h1>

<h1 style='text-indent:.5in'>All political activity in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> today is
tinged with the desire to achieve success at the General Election of 1962. Every
political party, including the Congress which is in power, is busy massing its
forces in preparation for the great event. Thirteen years of uninterrupted
power, at the Centre and in most of the States, have inevitably created for the
ruling party certain problems of organisation which have an important bearing
on its administrative wing. In State after State, particularly in Andhra, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City> and Uttar Pradesh,
the question which agitates the party chiefs is the composition of the State
Committee that will recommend the party candidates for election to Parliament
and the State Legislatures. It seems to be taken for granted that anyhow the
Congress will win by large majorities and once again occupy the <span
class=GramE>seats</span> of power. But the bother is as regards the group or
sub-group within the Congress which will succeed in returning its own
candidates. The position is complicated by the fact that the Chief Minister who
is also the leader of the Congress Legislature Party of the State does not
always command the confidence of the Pradesh Congress Committee. Where the
Chief Minister and the President of the Pradesh Congress Committee belong to
the same group, the effort of rival group is to dislodge at least one of them
by moving a vote of no-confidence. And there are endless confabulations,
repeated visits to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
to consult the High Command, and conflicting statements to the Press. To the
average citizen who is not particularly interested in group politics within the
Congress, the unedifying performances of the leaders of the party in different
States, whether Ministers or aspirants to <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Ministership</span></span><span
class=GramE>,</span> are a perpetual source of irritation and amazement. In
Andhra there is an open rift even within the Cabinet, and the Congress High
Command is seeking to restore harmony. </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is usual for the “man in the street” to complain that idealism is at a discount
among Congressmen, that the lure of wealth and power has corrupted them, that
they no longer deserve to be the representatives of the people. The truth is
that the generation of Congressmen who led the freedom fight is fast
disappearing and new men have to step into their places. Most of these are not
swayed by noble impulses like their elders. And yet, the party organisation has
to be kept alive, and men must be found to fill the Congress Committees and the
Legislatures. Obviously Congressmen cannot lay a perpetual claim to the rewards
of martyrdom, nor can they always go about with a halo round their heads. They
must face the electorate like the members of any other party and convince the
voters about their personal probity as well as the integrity of their party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>From time to time, the top leaders of the Congress
send out fervent appeals to their party men all over <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to re-order their lives and
to render unselfish and efficient service to the nation in their respective
spheres. In particular, they are admonished not to interfere in the day-to-day
administration of the country-side by bringing pressure to bear on local
officials in the interest of their henchmen. When the elections to Congress
Committees and to the party-controlled local bodies are over, a good number of
Congressmen turn their attention to the settling of old scores against members
of rival parties, or against men of their own party who belong to a rival group.
Despite the many earnest attempts to achieve unity among Congressmen, the
atmosphere in many towns and villages is contaminated by the perpetual wrangles
of Congressmen and by their efforts to <span class=SpellE>utilise</span> the
State power for their personal advancement. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question arises, “Are the Communists any better?” Their rule in Kerala was
something of a nightmare, and their accession to power in other States is not
calculated to lead to beneficial results. The promotion of class-war, the
‘liquidation’ of large sections of the community, and the spread of
international Communism are fraught with evil for the future of the country,
and no peaceful and law-abiding citizen can contemplate the prospect with
equanimity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

opinion is veering round to the view that, between now and the General Election
of 1962, the ever-growing section of countrymen who are genuinely opposed to
the Congress concept of Democratic Socialism as well as to the revolutionary
programme of the Communists should <span class=SpellE>organise</span>
themselves into a powerful party and fight the next election on the issue of
individual freedom and initiative in the many common concerns of life against
the threatened encroachment of the State power. It is necessary to place the
Congress on the defensive and compel it to justify its programmes, <span
class=GramE>Whichever</span> party happens to win, there must always be a
well-informed, effective opposition. Real democracy can function only when
well-<span class=SpellE>organised</span> democratic parties seek the suffrage
of the nation for the implementation of their programmes, and are prepared to
quit office when they suffer defeat at the polls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
the Congress Party should quit office even before the election is an
interesting point. The <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party has thrown up
a suggestion that for six months prior to the date of the election President’s
rule should prevail throughout the Indian Union, so as to give a fair chance to
all parties at the election. The Congress is not likely to oblige its opponents
by accepting this novel suggestion. But it can at least refrain from misusing
its power to <span class=SpellE>favour</span> its party candidates. A party in
office can offer many inducements to the electorate, and it can collect funds
on a large scale for election purposes. But even a vague suspicion that it is
so employing its power will impel large numbers of uncommitted voters to vote
against the Government of the day. So, election time is a time of test for
political parties. The party in power has to exercise extra care and keep
itself above suspicion. That is the correct democratic <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>,
the life-breath of democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was a great day in the history of the United
Nations Organisation when the Prime Minister of India, representing the point
of view of the ‘unaligned’ nations, urged the General Assembly to ‘Build the
World without War’ and quoted the magnificent words of Lord Buddha: “The only
real victory is the one in which all are equally victorious, and there is
defeat for no one.” As a first urgent step in this adventure of peace, he
sponsored, along with the leaders of four other nations, a resolution
requesting the President of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region>
and the Premier of the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> to resume
their broken contacts and pave the way to disarmament and world peace.
Eventually the resolution had to be withdrawn after what is described as a
‘procedural wrangle’ over the correct interpretation of the voting on the
Argentine demand for the substitution of the countries–U. S. A. and the Soviet
Union–in place of the Heads of States. Sri Nehru rightly pointed out that, as there
had been no break in diplomatic contacts between the two countries, there was <span
class=GramE>no</span> meaning in asking them to renew such contacts. He and his
fellow-sponsors were concerned solely to bring about a renewal of contacts
between the President and the Premier which had actually been broken. This was
necessary for the restoration of a climate of peace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Neither
Sri Nehru nor his friends of the Afro-Asian group at the U. N. hoped for a
spectacular victory leading to immediate results. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
is obviously waiting for the election of a new President of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region> That
might make it easier for her Premier to deal with some one other than the
present President. But the moral effect of Sri Nehru’s presence at the U. N.
and his impassioned plea for peace was obviously very profound. In spite of a
momentary feeling of disappointment, Sri Nehru would not be led into throwing
his weight on the side of a ‘third bloc’ nor would he support the Russian
demand for the resignation of the Secretary-General of the U. N. In a situation
of great difficulty and complexity, he managed to preserve friendly relations
with the leaders of the many nations assembled at the U.N. Some day the world
will <span class=SpellE>realise</span> the importance of the part played by the
Indian Prime Minister at a crucial moment, when everyone’s nerves were frayed
by the hectoring, bullying speeches of the Soviet Premier, and when the
insensate rivalry of two great Powers seemed to lead the U. N. into a blind
alley with no way out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has been announced that a Bill will be introduced in Parliament before the end
of this year to give statutory sanction to the Presidential directive regarding
the official language of the Indian Union. An important concession to public
opinion in the non-Hindi regions was made by the Prime Minister some months ago
when he stated categorically in Parliament that, even after 1965, English will
continue to be used as an ‘associate language’ along with Hindi, till such time
as the people of the non-Hindi regions voluntarily agree to the employment of
Hindi as the sole official language for all-India purposes. This found a place
in the Preamble to the Presidential directive but not in the text. All doubts
have however been set at rest by the recent statement of the Home Minister that
the Prime Minister’s assurance will be incorporated in the Bill. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One night when I sat deep in meditation,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life, the Lily Maiden, came to me– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life, the Lily Maiden,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With streaks of roses on her cheeks,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Led by the light-aspiring guide</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rejected by the maidens seven of heaven,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For he had dared them all to test his love</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When they had wished him one from them to choose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And Life, the Lily Maiden, stood before me</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the guide waited silent at the door</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And I, with bated breath,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asked her why thus she stood revealed in glory</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When aeons of prayer kept her still concealed:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereunto the Lily Maiden answered;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I am the beloved you loved, oh! lover! </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am the destination and the guide!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You loved my rainbow colours and my flowers,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And worshipped all my gold of morn and eve,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You treasured up the saffron robes I wore</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And hugged the rose-red prints of crimson feet. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then did I whisper to myself: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Will not he love me who has loved what’s mine?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will not he set the crown upon my head,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crown inset with cressets of bright stars, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crown of his soul-flame, of sweet consent?’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And unto you I fled like the sun-beam</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That, crystal-clear, enfolds the rainbow-colours."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And unto her I spoke all quivering,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And said: "Oh! Lily Maiden! now I know</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You as the moon that moulded all my dreams.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will dare all you bid me, set the crown</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of my consent upon your head and be</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your second self to you; but tell me, maid,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that your only quest and dear desire?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And unto this the Maiden answered, saying:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am the beloved you loved, oh! lover!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am the destination and the guide!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But to this day my birth has been a riddle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In whose laps I lay, and in whose womb</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I felt the stir of being, is all surmise. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But you have traced all matter to the root</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And bathed amid the springs of being. Mankind</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lays bare its prodigies before your eyes</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And yet its millions vanquish not your thirst!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You, who can read into the hearts of men</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And find what star will glow above their heads,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can well reveal to me whose daughter I am</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And kiss my forehead as you crown my head."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At which I wondered to myself</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether I could imagine or divine</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her mystery. The light-aspiring guide</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well knew my mind and spoke in solemn tones:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Oh! youth! whose hand has held the jewelled crown</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of this enchanted maiden, listen to me! </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The goldsmith who has known his metal, designs</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Out of the same, a hundred patterns of gold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wind makes branches meet in many curves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And one who knows the springs of being can fashion</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things wondrous-wise. Thus to have fashioned them</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is to have known the secret of all things."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that I rose and seated the Lily Maiden,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And crowned her with the crown of all my stars,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And said, kissing her forehead: "Live with me</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And be the inspiration of my song,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Queen of my home and friend of my desires,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My enemy on the field, god of my fane,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadness and mirth and sorrow and joy by turn,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The weariness of life, its spring and summer– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I crown you with the crown of all my stars!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And to have lived thus measures half the truth."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so the Lily Maiden came to me;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so I crowned her queen of all my being;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so the light-aspiring guide retraced</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His steps towards the maidens seven of heaven.</P></DIR>

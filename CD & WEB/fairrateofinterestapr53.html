<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
do not now remember why I went to the village M...but happened to go, and as
soon as I reached the place I came unexpectedly upon V. R., my friend of
boyhood days, who took me to his house straight. Meeting after a long interval,
we were recollecting with pleasure and reminding each other of those happy days
of early life, and then he<i> </i>burst upon us. I remember distinctly how he
literally burst upon us. It is indelibly impressed on my mind, how he opened
the door slowly, cautiously advanced his right leg beyond the threshold
tentatively, almost stealthily, and peered into the room all round, holding
fast to the bundle in his hand. Then inclining his head slightly to one side,
in a queer pose of ultra-seriousness, holding the bundle very carefully with
both the hands, he advanced slowly and deliberately, step by step, to my friend
and handed over the precious bundle with the words “Here’s the money.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
friend was evidently startled. A shadow passed across his countenance at the
very sight of the intruder. All the cheerfulness vanished, but with a distinct
note of seriousness in his tone responded warmly, receiving the bundle
carefully, “You are one in a million, Surayya, a man of your word, always.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stranger was obviously pleased with the compliment, but without allowing the
least trace of any satisfaction to appear on his countenance, he snapped:
“Enough with compliments. Borrowing is easy. But you have to remember, the
amount has to be returned together with the interest accruing on it within a
month. You know the usual rate of interest. I charge only the fair and legal
rate of Re. 1-8-0 per hundred per month. You do not know how hard put to it I
have been to find the money. I had to strain and stretch my resources to the
limit to oblige an old friend like you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Don’t
you fear, Surayya, you will have your money back in your hands, within the
month,” my friend assured him. But Surayya continued: “No good merely promising
at the time of borrowing. You must keep your word at the time fixed for the
repayment. You know I am contemplating an expensive function. Besides, need for
money may arise any moment unexpectedly and I hate to resort to law for
recovering loans from my debtors.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“What
is it you say, Surayya! Is this the first time for me to borrow or for you to
lend me? Was there ever any difficulty or delay in recovering a loan from me?”
expostulated my friend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“That
is all right,” again Surayya snapped up, “count the money first. All hard coin;
a little small change too. Remember you have to pay back in coin only. I have
no use for your new-fangled paper money.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“No
need to tell me. I know your ways, as an old customer should,” said my friend
and untied the precious bundle. I was shocked when I noticed the contents. I
could not make head or tail of the transaction. The bundle contained only
stones, several big pieces of road metal and a few small pieces of gravel. I
scrutinised my friend’s face for a clue to the mystery. But he did not appear
to notice any mystery at all in the transaction. He was carefully counting the
stones, as though they were regular gold coins or precious stones, in all
seriousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
looked at the stranger, for a change. His attention was concentrated on the
stones my friend was counting, his head still inclined at the same angle as
when he first entered. My friend persisted in counting and exclaimed, “Quite
correct, Surayya, as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>usual.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Of course, quite correct–now. But remember it is
the 20th of April. On the 20th of May exactly, nor a day later I should find
the amount, together with the interest accruing on it,” he reminded and finally
left only after extracting from my friend his solemn word of honour, thrice
repeated, that he should repay the amount, together with the interest accruing,
at the fair and legal rate of Re. 1-8-0 per hundred per month, exactly on the
20th of May.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
was eagerly awaiting his departure, so that I might seek of my friend the
significance of the mysterious transaction I had witnessed; and the moment the
door closed behind him, I turned to my friend. But<i> </i>he warded off my
query before it was uttered, with an impatient gesture pointing his hand to the
door. As I followed the movement of his hand, with my eyes to the door, I saw
Surayya again bursting in. Now he was not merely solemn and serious, as at the
time of his first entrance, but his eyes were burning fiercely. He was
trembling from head to foot with some explicable excitement. He was breathing
hard, as one in mortal agony. Only in one respect there was no change. His head
was inclined to one side at the same angle as before. He paused for just one
moment at the threshold and then rushed straight upon my friend, bawling out,
“Where is my money? How long has it been overdue? Is it fair to put me off day
by day in this manner, so that I am obliged to run after you and go round your
house everyday like a shameless despicable dog? Have you no sense of decency
and good manners even? Is it rice you eat or dirt?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
was horrified at the language he used, no less than by the accusation it
implied. I felt indignant at the wanton insult to my friend. But my friend
remained unperturbed. He took it, insult and all lying down, coolly, like a bad
debtor unable to repay at the time fixed. He was polite, obsequious, in spite
of the insults. “Here, Surayya, is your money; is it proper for a gentleman of
your stamp to descend to such abusive language for a small amount, and after
all only for a little delay?” So speaking, in assuaging tone and words, he
handed back to the stranger the bundle of stones, which was ready to his hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Surayya was not altogether appeased. “Where is the interest?” he flared up.
“Did you take it that I lent you the money because I had no use for it, or
because I was unable to guard it, or unwilling to keep it on my hands? Or did I
owe the money to your ‘grandfather? No. No. YOU must pay back all the amount
due, principal as well as interest, and complete the transaction today. I will
not let you go till then. I cannot allow you to move an inch.” And he actually
laid hands on my friend as though to prevent him from escaping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“But
you must let go your hold of my body, Surayya,” pleaded my friend meekly, “even
to enable me to get the money from the iron safe.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Get
it at once and don’t try to fool me,” said Surayya as he pushed my friend off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
friend saved himself, with great difficulty, from a violent fall, went towards
the wall, picked up a few stones from the side and placed them, in all
seriousness, in the hands of Surayya. Surayya counted them solemnly, and
without another word turned his heel, right about, reached the door with his
head inclined at the same angle, and passed out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

friend heaved a sigh of relief and, without any need for a query from me again;
began, of his own accord, “What a ‘sad change! This Surayya was once the most
prominent banker in this village. Now he has turned mad and is reduced to this
miserable condition.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
friend began narrating the story of Surayya’s madness. “It was his father that
was responsible for this tragedy in Surayya’s life. His father was a very fine
gentleman with a remarkably soft heart. But even so, he was primarily
responsible for the moral ruin of his son.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Let
me, explain. It was because he was so good, he soon lost his property, all of
it, with his indiscriminate charities and standing surety for friends. Reduced
to poverty, he died a miserable death, with no one to help him in his hour of
need or look after him in his old age. Is it surprising that Surayya, who had
witnessed the vicissitudes of his father’s career with his own eyes, cultivated
an attitude of misanthropy? He conceived a grievance against society and nursed
an inveterate hatred against it.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Surayya
set about deliberately hardening his heart, and, ever since he took over the
management of the family property, concentrated all his efforts on making money
unscrupulously and heartlessly, utterly regardless of any human considerations,
converted into money the remaining few acres of his patrimony and set up as a
banker. He severed all human ties and recognised only one bond between himself
and society, the bond of money. He was born to lend money for interest, and
they to borrow and pay him interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
became an expert in extortionate usury and in a few years developed into the
most flourishing banker of the locality, draining away the very life-blood of
the poor peasants who happened to fall into his clutches. Even after he became
rich and no longer needed any more money for his comfort or security, he
persisted in the same methods, for they had grown into his nature by long
habit. He would not spare a morsel to the most pitiable beggar; he would not
forego a pie of his dues under any circumstances. He would put his debtors to
all possible inconvenience and difficulties and squeeze out of them all his
dues without any mercy. In his restless pursuit of wealth he did not spare even
a thought for the ruined careers of devastated families left along the trail.
His heart was never moved to pity for the victims of his avarice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he piled up wealth, but along with the wealth the ill-will and hatred of the
people towards him also mounted high. Everyone in the village feared him, but
none had any goodwill towards him. In his reckless attitude of hostility
towards society, he deemed this unpopularity and social isolation an additional
advantage. Why should he worry that he was unpopular? He aimed at their money
and he got it. He never wanted their goodwill; but then an event occurred which

was a peasant in the village, Chandrayya by name. He had borrowed from Surayya
arid eventually an amount of two hundred rupees was due from him to the banker.
This Chandrayya was a comparatively poor peasant, but he had business dealings
with the people in the neighbouring town and therefore somewhat advanced in his
views. He had no fear of lawyers, and he hated the rich as a class. Instead of
feeling grateful to Surayya for having obliged him with the loan when he was in
need of money, he entertained a grievance against him on the ground that he was
extorting money from him. Surayya was also aware of the mentality and outlook
of this debtor, though he had been tempted by the high rate of interest
offered; but ever since, he was doubting the possibility of recovering the
debt, and was often pressing him for repayment. One day, according to his usual
procedure, he laid hands on the debtor in the market-place and insisted on
immediate repayment of the loan. In his anxiety for recovering the loan he
worked himself up into a violent temper and began to use somewhat discourteous
language in pressing his demand. At last the smouldering resentment in the
heart of Chandrayya burst into flame. He too lost his temper, flatly refused to
repay, and defied the banker to do his worst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

silence. Chandrayya was encouraged by this immediate effect of his defiance,
and he insisted on Surayya taking his hands off his body. Surayya was now
thoroughly roused and sought to recover his injured pride. Me remonstrated with
the debtor for his impolite language and threatened him with the legal
consequences of his refusal and defiance, Chandrayya felt exasperated. He
abused Surayya outright and literally kicked him off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At last he reached home, dined in a hurry, tightened
his spare cloth round his loins, took up his umbrella and started for the town.
But he still entertained a lingering hope that he may be spared the unpleasant
necessity of taking the law. He paced up and down the road by the side of
Chandrayya’s house, and informed all passers-by in loud tones–but really for
the benefit of the inmates of Chandrayya’s house–that he was proceeding to the
town on important business. Chandrayya was in the house and heard the words. At
once, he retorted, “You may go to town or to the God who created you. You will
not get the money, nor are you destined to breathe the air of this place any
longer.”</p>

could be no turning back now. All retreat was practically cut off. The prospect
before him was threatening and ominous, but how to forego the money? And how to
swallow the insult? With an effort he silenced his fears, mustered courage,
proceeded to the town, consulted his lawyer and instructed him to serve a registered
notice on Chandrayya. But now that the irrevocable step had been taken he was
feeling worried and anxious at heart, and his anxiety and worry increased every
minute. In his anxiety he loitered in the town, wandering here and there
aimlessly. By the time he started for home it was getting dark. You know one
has to step off the road and trudge a mile along the foot-path to reach our
village. By the time he reached the foot-path it was quite dark. The foot-path
leads only to this village and therefore after dark there will be very few
passengers on it. On that day too there was no other human being on the
foot-path within the ken of Surayya. Besides, the path-way is bordered on
either side by stout trees with bushy growth, and on the whole it was a very disconcerting
situation for Surayya in his present frame of mind to<i> </i>be walking alone
along it. He recollected the long prayer to Hanuman, the monkey-god, usually
resorted to on such occasions by the pious, and repeating it aloud to hearten
himself, he proceeded a few steps along the path. Did you notice the big banyan
tree half-way along the foot-path?<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As he approached it he heard the sound of foot-steps
in the bushes by the side, and he came to a dead-stop. His legs refused to
move. Even the prayer to the monkey-god sank in his throat. Chandrayya’s men,
waiting for him in the bushes, now sprang upon him, surrounded him on all sides
and belaboured him. They felled him to the ground and thrashed him mercilessly.
Chandrayya pounced upon him and rifled his pockets in which he found twenty
rupees. He pocketed the amount with exultation exclaiming, “Have you filed a
legal complaint against me? This will come in handy for my expenses in
connection with the suit.” So saying he kicked him with his foot and insulted him
to his heart’s content. Then they all went home leaving the victim on the spot.

locality called on him to condole with him. Surayya sat steeped in his own
thoughts. The banker friends at last came out with a suggestion: “Surayya, this
is an outrage which should not be tolerated. You must file a criminal complaint
against the villains and fight them to the finish.” But there was no response
from him. He kept quiet, revolving his own thoughts. His friends were
disappointed, and mistaking his silence for fear, tried to encourage him. “You
need not have any doubt of success, Surayya, we are sure to win this time.” Now
Surayya turned his eyes upon them and gazed at them steadily for a moment. At
last he responded, “All right, let us all subscribe towards the expenses and
embark upon the litigation.” His friends were obviously puzzled and stared at
one another in confusion. “What is it you say, Surayya. We do not quite follow
your idea. You were assaulted most unjustly, and you have to file a complaint
and teach the villains a lesson. Why should we all subscribe towards the
expenses? Where do we come into the picture?” Surayya affected surprise and
indignation. “How can you say they assaulted and thereby insulted me only?
Their attack was upon my money. Their envy and hostility are directed against
all of you, all the moneyed people, especially all the bankers who lend money
at interest. If I had been the sole object of their attack, only Chandrayya
should have assaulted me. Why should all the others join him as they did? No,
no, it was an attack by the borrowers and poor men as a class on the bankers
and rich men as a class, whom they look upon as exploiters and therefore their
enemies. Through me, in this instance, they have insulted the entire business
community and the banking system. They have used physical force against us,
because that is their strong point in which they have an advantage over us. We
can spare money; that is our strong point in which we enjoy an advantage over
them. We can afford to take the law against them and ruin them. Let us all
contribute to the expenses, drag them to the courts of law, ruin them and
uphold the prestige and honour of our class, so that hereafter they will think
twice before attacking or insulting any creditor. Let us teach them a lesson,
and all of us stand to profit by it.” The friends did not choose to follow his
arguments. They came to the more comfortable conclusion that Surayya had been beaten
out of his wits. They slipped away, one after another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

moneyed folk? I am not such a fool to burn my fingers for these cowards.” He
persisted in this attitude in spite of his desire for revenge. His very avarice

that Surayya, the rich banker, was defied and belaboured, by his debtor, and he
took the insult lying down without even an attempt to retaliate in my manner,
they began to despise him. All these days they had some regard for him and his
wealth. Though they hated him for his avarice and hard-heartedness, they feared
him and respected him for his wealth. Now that they realised that his wealth
could not afford him any protection against insult and injury, he fell headlong
in their esteem. From that day onwards he was the victim of incessant public
ignominy and wanton insult at the hands of everyone in the village, rich and
poor, young and old. Wherever he went, he was followed by a crowd of urchins
chanting behind him in derision, “the fair rate of interest of Surayya, the
hard blows of insult of Chandrayya.” When he approached his debtors for
repayment of the sums due to him, they faced him boldly with the query. “Do you
want to be thrashed again?” Some of them counted out on his head with their
knuckles the amounts of principal and interest due to him, separately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

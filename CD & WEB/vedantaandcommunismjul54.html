and Vedanta are poles apart, nay so antithetical, that a comparison between
them appears inconceivable. One is regarded as a godless ideology and the other
an intensely monistic creed; one is scientific and material and the other
mystical and spiritual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
seeming gulf between the two is due to the cleavage in their philosophic bases,
between dialectical materialism on the one hand, and spiritual <span
class=SpellE>endeavour</span> on the other. But modern science has bridged the
gulf. Matter has ceased to be, in the ultimate analysis, a final permanent
entity; it is just a form of energy. In spite of the vast progress in human
knowledge, we are today acutely conscious of our appalling ignorance of the
processes of the Universe, which impress us with their mysteriousness. The pure
scientist is increasingly tending to be a mystic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the same time, from the practical standpoint, there is nothing inherently
incompatible between Communism and the spiritual outlook. The Red Dean of Canterbury
is <span class=GramE>a</span> fervent Communist without ceasing to be a devout
Christian. Nor are </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mysticism and the scientific outlook
mutually incompatible. Sri Aurobindo was deeply spiritual and yet scientific. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, on closer observation, we would find a certain identity in the objectives
of Communism and Vedanta. The former aims at establishing an <span
class=SpellE>egaltarian</span> society. Inequality arises from unequal
distribution of wealth, leading to a class ridden society of haves and
have-nots, and exploitation. This it seeks to eliminate, <i>immediately, </i>by
<span class=SpellE>collectivising</span> the ownership and control of the means
of production and eventually by <span class=SpellE>organising</span> society on
the principle: “To each according to his need and from each according to his
capacity.” This necessarily implies a submerging of individual personality in
the mass consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vedanta,
on the other hand, <span class=SpellE>emphasises</span> the oneness of all
life, animate as well as inanimate. It <span class=SpellE>emphasises</span> the
ephemeral character and the consequent unreality of individual personality.
Based on this philosophy of unity of existence, it inculcates </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>an
active morality of seeking in the good of all one’s own good, in feeling
sympathetic pain in another’s suffering. By emphasizing the unreality of the
material world, it arouses the consciousness of the futility of accumulating
temporal goods, and cultivates detachment. Psychologically the cause of
unhappiness is non-fulfillment of desires, collectively designated as <span
class=SpellE><i>trishna</i></span><i>. </i>Vedanta seeks to cure it by teaching
renunciation and the having of as few desires as possible. Possessed with this
outlook, the <span class=SpellE>Vedantist</span> has no self-consciousness or
ego; he is just an <span class=SpellE><i>amsa</i></span><i> </i>or part of the
Universal Consciousness like any other individual or entity. To take according
to his bare minimum needs and to give according to his capacity is an article
of faith with him. He is incapable of exploiting anyone because he cannot be
actuated by any profit motive inasmuch as, for him, there is neither any
enduring self to enjoy nor any enduring gain to be obtained. The suffering inherent
in exploitation is bound to pain him and arouse his compassion, as the
exploited is no other than his own self. Inequality of wealth cannot arise
because it is against his grain to accumulate wealth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
would be evident from the foregoing that Communism seeks to find a solution of
the world’s ills through a reconstruction of the economic structure of society
without attempting </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to change the individual, who will
continue to be no less fiercely acquisitive and selfish than a member of the
capitalist set-up. It </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is not a part of his creed that he should
voluntarily surrender his acquisitions, even when in excess of his needs, for
the benefit of fellow human beings. He is not taught to limit the range of his
desires. On the other hand, his ideal is to attain a better standard of living
through satisfaction of a maximum number of desires, for which possession of
material means is indispensable. Only, society is to be so <span class=SpellE>organised</span>
as to prevent the individual from gaining control of the means of production
and thereby exploiting others. There is thus in a Communist society a lack of
harmony between the selfish purposes of the individual and the social purposes
of the group. There is invariably a conflict between the State and the citizen,
between the collective interests of society and the selfish interests of its
units. The inevitable consequence is a constant state of tension and distrust
and instability, which necessitates the use of force and violence by the State
to curb selfish activity. That explains why the <span class=SpellE>collectivisation</span>
of agriculture in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had to be carried out in blood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
important problem arising out of the cleavage between the social philosophy of
the Communist group–from each according to his capacity and to each according
to his needs–and the selfish and material outlook of its individuals arising
from the lack of belief in the spiritual unity of life, is that of incentives.
While wants are infinite, capacity is limited. So long as man continues to be
selfish, to consider himself as distinct from his fellow beings, he will not do
any <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, the fruits of which would be enjoyed by
someone else, particularly when “much necessary work must always remain
disagreeable or at least painfully monotonous.”<sup>1</sup> The Communists <span
class=SpellE>recognise</span> that even the wage system of equal pay for
nominally equal work–which is distinctly short of the ideal of remuneration
according to needs–was one of the main causes of low productivity of <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> in the First Five Year Plan of<i> </i>Russia. It
bred inefficiency as it failed to distinguish between the good and the bad
worker. The principle of differential remuneration depending on the quality and
quantity of work done had to be accepted in the Second Five Year Plan as the
indispensable incentive to productivity. And when each individual is guaranteed
or assured by the State a distribution of wealth according to his needs,
disinclination to <span class=SpellE>labour</span> in excess of the quantum
necessary to escape the wrath of<i> </i>the State would be reinforced and the
spur of self-interest would be weakened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Marx
had also predicted that when all class distinctions had been abolished, the
State will wither away. If this were realized in the absence of external
coercive authority and inner discipline, the tendency to shirk work and to
appropriate the maximum for oneself will become more pronounced and threaten
the foundations of the Communist Society. Rigid control of individual conduct
becomes an unavoidable necessity if the instincts for power and possession are
not sublimated. That is why we see the paradox of the State in a
communistically <span class=SpellE>organised</span> society becoming highly <span
class=SpellE>centralised</span> and powerful, and the hope that “the individual
will become free if the State became the sole capitalist” ever remaining
unfulfilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Vedantist</span>, however, seeks to achieve his ends by a
reconstruction of society through reconstruction of the individual. Here is
perfect identity in the interests of the group and its units. In all his
activity, the individual is buoyed up by<i> </i>the belief that, in serving
others, he is serving himself. There is no conflict between wants and capacity
because his needs are severely limited, while, at the same time, it is a
cardinal principle with him to put forth his maximum effort, of his own
volition. This automatically secures harmony between society and its units.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ineffectiveness
of spiritual beliefs among large masses of men, in spite of the fact that they
zealously profess their religion, is a glaring fact. Vast numbers of men
profess to be good Christians, Buddhists or Hindus, and yet, in their conduct
towards their fellow beings, the professions are thrown to the winds. It must
be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> that human passions, the desire for
power, the acquisitive instinct and, above all, human selfishness, are so
powerful that even those most deeply imbued with the <span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span>
faith fall prey to them. That is why the Buddha considered Ego as the greatest
enemy against which he so vehemently and relentlessly discoursed. It is,
therefore, desirable that society should be so <span class=SpellE>organised</span>
as to serve as an insurance against men falling away from their path, or
unscrupulous individuals flourishing at the expense of true <span class=SpellE>Vedantists</span>.
In this context, the economic <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span> of
society on Communist lines–collective ownership of the means of production–is
necessary. Communism without a philosophic discipline would, therefore, prove
an unstable organisation given to violence and lacking the zealous support of
its members. Likewise, a ‘<span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span> Society’ without <span
class=SpellE>favourable</span> economic milieu, is likely to prove inane and sure
to wither away by the blasts of deep rooted human selfishness. Salvation lies
only in the integration of the two–of Communist economic organisation with <span
class=SpellE>Vedantic</span> philosophy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

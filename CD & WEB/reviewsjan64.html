style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
citizen play–of which the domestic drama is a segment–belongs properly to the
native tradition in British drama, and <span class=SpellE>Dekker</span>,
Heywood and Ben <span class=SpellE>Jonson</span> were among its most consistent
practitioners. The word ‘citizen’ was a technical name given to a special group
of people, who acquired their ‘freedom’ from the city after seven years of hard
apprenticeship and it was these people that formed the so-called middle class
of Elizabethan or Jacobean England. The purpose of the three dramatists–<span
class=SpellE>Dekker</span>, Heywood and <span class=SpellE>Jonson</span>–was to
present the life of this class in vivid detail, although their angles of vision
and consequently their treatment varied. Broadly speaking, <span class=SpellE>Dekker</span>
and Heywood belong to the romantic stream, while <span class=SpellE>Jonson</span>
was the protagonist of the satiric type. The ‘citizen’, however, is as much
present in <span class=SpellE>Jonson’s</span> <i>Bartholomew Fair </i>as in <span
class=SpellE>Dekker’s</span> <i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday, </i>and one can ill
afford to omit a play like <i>Edward IV </i>when one talks about domestic drama
with <i>A Woman Killed With Kindness </i>in mind. But, of course, critical
categories are largely devices of <span class=GramE>convenience</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Heywood
was a ‘journeyman-dramatist’ with a miscellaneous career. He veered between
play-acting and play-patching for quite some time, and it was in 1596 that
there was the first mention of a ‘<span class=SpellE>bocke</span>’ by him. He
claimed to be the author of as many as two hundred and twenty plays, and tried
his hand at diverse dramatic types: classical plays and chronicle plays,
domestic plays and romantic plays, plays on current events and pageants for the
Lord Mayor’s Shows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Professor
Rama <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span>, however, makes it clear in the
introductory chapter that he is concerned only with a few ‘indisputable plays’
of Heywood and his aim is to show the affinity between Shakespeare and the
prose Shakespeare–as Lamb called Heywood–in ‘some of the dramatic practices’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the second chapter, the author discusses the nature and origin of the domestic
drama, with its stress on the normal life of<i> </i>the ordinary people, as
against the tragedy with its ‘horrors’ and the comedy with its ‘types’. The
common theme is family <span class=SpellE>honour</span>. The husband suddenly
discovers horns on his head, and how is he to deal with the guilty? The time-<span
class=SpellE>honoured</span> solution is, of course, murder, but it is here
that the domestic drama differs from the usual pattern and constitutes an
‘unquestioned contribution of the English stage.’ The guilty are treated with
sympathy and given </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a chance to repent. This moral
earnestness pervades the whole </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the domestic drama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third chapter is addressed to an examination of the domestic plays of Heywood.
The author examines <i>A Woman Killed <span class=GramE>With</span> Kindness</i>,
<i>The English <span class=SpellE>Traveller</span></i>, <i>The Wise Woman of <span
class=SpellE>Hogsdon</span> </i>and <i>The Fair Maid of the West</i>: domestic
discord is presented in varying intensities in the first two, the third deals
with superstition, and in the last there are quite a few ‘domestic’ scenes,
although the play is a blend of romance and realism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
<i>Woman Killed <span class=GramE>With</span> Kindness </i>is Heywood’s
undoubted masterpiece, and so the fourth chapter is appropriately devoted to
this single play. The author convincingly argues that the main plot and the
sub-plot are ably dove-tailed and that they actually run on <span class=SpellE>parellel</span>
lines. Having thus met the usual critical opinion about the construction of the
play, the author proceeds to say that Heywood handles the theme of illicit love
with ‘sensitiveness, understanding and even sympathy.’ He then discusses the
seduction scene from the theological point of view, in terms of the conflict
between free will and predestination. The moral earnestness of Heywood is
unmistakable–his Mrs. Frankford could easily be a Francois <span class=SpellE>Mauriac</span>
heroine–but one wonders whether the scene should be necessarily viewed
theologically. The conflict can as well be psychological, and what is called
predestination may actually be passion superseding reason. Even this view does
not detract from the value of the character, since her final penitence anyway
redeems Mrs. Frankford. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fifth chapter is a study of <i>A Woman and Othello</i>. It is quite likely, as
the author <span class=GramE>suggests,</span> that the one might have lent the
cue for the other. The sixth chapter again is a discussion of <i>Othello</i>, <i>A
Woman </i>and <i>Love’s sacrifice</i>. While Shakespeare is in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of romantic love, Ford presents love without
‘degree’ and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>deals with ‘abnormal sex cravings and incestuous
relationships’. Heywood, finally, is a moralist and the essential peace of
domestic life is his concern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the seventh chapter, the author proceeds to discuss the homiletic tradition in
Heywood’s plays. ‘Order’ is <span class=SpellE>honoured</span> and family relationships
are respected. The quality of mercy is never strained and even lust–as in the
case of Susan and Sir Francis in <span class=GramE><i>A</i></span><i> Woman</i>–is
transformed into love. Even such a ‘white devil’ as Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Wincott</span>
in <i>The English <span class=SpellE>Traveller</span> </i>finally qualifies for
grace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
eighth and ninth chapters are devoted to a study of the scenes of recognition
and <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span> respectively in Shakespeare and
Heywood. Although, in both these respects, Shakespeare gets an easy walk-over,
Professor <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span> tries to show that Heywood exhibits a
keen and sympathetic understanding of human nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rama <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span> has packed a good <span class=SpellE>deel</span>
of scholarship and perceptive criticism into a relatively slender volume. His
powers of argument and analysis are excellent, and he does not cumber his point
with needless documentation. The style too is effective and has a gusto all its
own. The book brings into perspective an important aspect of Heywood’s work and
illumines a facet of Jacobean drama, and deserves the careful attention of all
students of English drama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the 98th verse the poet makes an offering of the whole poem to the Lord as one
who offers his daughter in marriage to the bridegroom he has chosen. The poem
is conceived as a young girl with all good ornaments. The word for ornaments in
Sanskrit is “<span class=SpellE>Alankara</span>” which also means figures of
speech. The girl has a graceful gait for which term in<i> </i>Sanskrit is ‘<span
class=SpellE>pada</span>’; and ‘<span class=SpellE>pada</span>’ has also the
meaning of words. Therefore, in regard to the poem, it means that the poem
consists of several words. The bride is of a very good character. The word “<span
class=SpellE>Vritta</span>” in Sanskrit also means meters; and in respect of
the poem, it means “good meters”. In this way, he has used in the poem apposite
words denoting the characteristics of a good poem and also of a daughter. This
description of the poem given by <span class=GramE>himself</span> will be
appreciated by all as a true and faithful description of the poem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is illustrated by that of the needle to the magnet and the conscious
cultivation of the love to the Lord is exemplified by the love of the chaste
woman to her husband. The yearning for God as a support to man is illustrated
by the support given by the tree to the creeper and the inevitable necessity of
man seeking union with God is very aptly portrayed by the illustration given of
the river which runs to the ocean and merges its name and form in<i> </i>the
ocean itself. The whole of the content of Bhakti and its inherent nature and
its goal have been very beautifully portrayed in this one verse. And then <span
class=SpellE>Shankara</span> proceeds in the 63rd verse to show that Bhakti and
Bhakti alone is required by the Lord to bestow His grace upon his devotee and
not any other qualification such as learning, caste, creed or sex. For this, he
has given the famous example of Saint <span class=SpellE>Kannappar</span> who
he says is the foremost among the devotees of Shiva. <span class=SpellE>Kannappar</span>
was a wild hunter who worshipped the Lord in his own crude way with the utmost
sincerity and devotion which went even to the extent of his taking out his eyes
and fixing them on the image of the Lord. The greatness of worship, he
illustrates by referring to the fact that the putting of the sandals on the
head of the Lord’s image was regarded by the Lord as if the sacred <span
class=SpellE>Kusa</span> grass was put as part of the ritual. The water blown
out of the mouth by the hunter was considered by the Lord as if it was purified
water poured as <span class=SpellE>Abhisheka</span> and the meat tasted by him
and offered by him to the Lord was considered by him as a sacred <span
class=SpellE>Prasada</span> offering. <span class=SpellE>Shankara</span> <span
class=SpellE>emphasises</span> in this way that the formalities of the ritual
are not <span class=GramE>so</span> essential as the spirit behind them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the philosophy of <span class=SpellE>Shankara</span> expounds the <span
class=SpellE>qualityless</span> Brahman as the Ultimate Reality, still he has
at the same time <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span> the necessity for
devotion and the operation of the Lord’s grace. As a practical <span
class=SpellE>Advaitin</span>, he laid stress on the necessity for the right
method to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> this Ultimate Reality. And even the
personality of the Lord is, according to him, an efficacious method of
obtaining the Lord’s grace, and through that, of <span class=SpellE>realising</span>
the truth of<i> </i>the Ultimate Reality behind the universe. To him, as it was
to Sri Ramakrishna <span class=SpellE>Paramahamsa</span>, God to the devotee is
both personal and impersonal–impersonal in the highest plane of consciousness
and personal in the other lower plane. The method we adopt is to rise from the
lower plane to the higher by devotion to a personal God and by the illumination
he gets by His grace. This is the underlying principle in his beautiful hymns
to the various aspects of God that are worshipped in the Hindu tradition,
namely, Shiva, <span class=SpellE>Narayana</span>, <span class=SpellE>Shakti</span>,

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Rig Veda, the earliest recorded literature of the Aryans in India, is not a
mere pastoral as many Western scholars are prone to believe. It is a
combination of art and literature with religion, science and philosophy. Its
poetry is however mixed up with a lot of symbolism, mysticism and rituals and
it requires a lot of skill and scholarship to get behind the apparent
symbolisms to find out the philosophical truths sought to be conveyed. The late
Dr. <span class=SpellE>Kunhan</span> Raja, who was a Visiting Professor in
Sanskrit at Tehran University for some time, and later was associated with the
Andhra University, brings in a lot of clarity and originality to bear in this,
probably his last, work on the poet-philosophers of the Rig Veda. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
author explodes many popular myths sedulously propagated by Western historians
to the effect that the Vedas represent the literature of a Nomadic Tribe and
that the Iranian and Greek civilizations were anterior to the civilization of
the Vedas. With much internal evidence, Dr. Raja points out that there must
have been a great and developing civilization with a high class literature
prior to the Vedas in India. The authors of the Vedas considered themselves as
heirs to a rich, longstanding and progressive civilization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
author has described only a few of the great poets of the Rig Veda–<span
class=SpellE>Dirghatamas</span> (for whose poetry the author has personal
admiration), <span class=SpellE>Brihaspati</span> (“a great teacher in
religion” and at the same time “the originator of the most materialistic way of
thinking about the problems of life”) <span class=SpellE>Sunassepha</span> (to
whom the author attributes the starting of the later-day Bhakti cult), <span
class=SpellE>Yama</span> (who proves, according to the author, that Truth, and
never a personality, dominated the minds of the people), Manu (the law-giver)
and <span class=SpellE>Angiras</span>. He is all admiration for the combination
of wisdom (represented by poetry) with power which has been our ideal in the
Vedic Times. (“It is the condemnation of power that resulted in the downfall of
the country. And such a condemnation arose out of the opponents of the Vedic
ideals” p. 188). The author also gives an account of the theories in the Rig
Veda concerning the origin and evolution of the world<i>. </i>The later day </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>philosophies–<span
class=SpellE>Sankhya</span> and Vedanta can be traced to the divergent views<i>

and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>from Brahman described in the <span class=SpellE>Purusha</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sukta</span>. The author does not fail to draw the moral
from the prevalence of these divergent views. It shows the widespread spirit of
tolerance and <span class=SpellE>catholicism</span> that has always marked the
character and genius of the Indian people. The author closes his illuminating
study with a chapter on a poem of <span class=SpellE>Samvahana</span> praying
for harmony and unity on earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the introductory chapter, the author devotes himself to the enunciation of

history of the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span>, the origin and development of
Telugu language and the influence of Kannada, Tamil and Samskrit on Telugu

into his service almost all the important research material published <span
class=SpellE>upto</span> the time of publication of this work and we are sure
he will refer to the views expressed by later research scholars in the second
edition of this book. In these chapters, the author gives us a picture of the
personality of the poet and his times. He discusses the sources of the contents
of the work and the deviations effected by the poet, and the method of
translation, if it is one. Points of literary appreciation and linguistic
peculiarities are thoroughly illustrated b</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Even <span class=SpellE>metres</span> and <span class=SpellE>yatis</span> do
not escape the attention of the author, though one wishes he had illustrated
these </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>also and quoted from the original works also,
especially from the <i>Mahabharata </i>while<i> </i>comparing the translations
with the originals, though sparingly, to make this work self-sufficient. Poets
are compared to each other wherever necessary. Some of the vexed problems like
the authorship of <span class=SpellE><i>Ranganatha</i></span><i> Ramayana </i>and
<span class=SpellE><i>Bhaskara</i></span><i> Ramayana </i>are also discussed.
The author, after mustering sufficient internal and external evidence,
concludes that <span class=SpellE>Ranganatha</span> and <span class=SpellE>Hulakki</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bhaskara</span> are the authors of the two works
respectively. <span class=SpellE>Balasaraswati</span> but not <span
class=SpellE>Nannaya</span>, the author declares, is the author of <i>Andhra <span
class=SpellE>Sabda</span> <span class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>. </i>One may
differ from him in some of the arguments advanced by him here and there but his
views are worth considering and carry conviction and weight. The comparison of <span
class=SpellE>Nannaya</span> and <span class=SpellE>Tikkana</span> and the
chapter on <span class=SpellE>Nannechoda</span> are simply superb, though one
wishes? he had devoted some more space to clarify with illustrations some
points on <span class=SpellE>Nannaya’s</span> poetry like <span class=SpellE><i>Prasanna</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Katka</span> <span class=SpellE>Kalitardhayukti</span> </i>etc.
In short, every chapter is almost an illuminating treatise on Telugu poets and
their works and nothing important and desirable is left out. The value of the
work is enhanced by the addition of six appendices dealing with works on <span
class=SpellE>Sastras</span>, Prosody and Poetics, <span class=SpellE>Satakas</span>,
lost works, and Samskrit works written by <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> of
this particular period and a bibliography at the end. It is highly commendable
that a project which naturally falls among the objectives of the Andhra
University, specially intended for promoting the study of Telugu culture and
literature, has been taken up by the Madras University. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

but none of us is without it. Before true greatness we bow almost in primitive
wonderment. And Ranade is among the truly great. Let us try and live with him
for a day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As Sakti to Siva, Ramabai to Ranade. They were in
holy wedlock–a happy instance of happily married life. Ramabai was Ranade’s
second wife. When they married there was a yawning gulf of age and educational
equipment between the couple. Ranade was a tall, heavy man of thirty-two,
already a Judge of the lower court, a highly respected patriot, and, above all,
a mature, gifted man of rare elevation and detachment. Ramabai was a short little
child of eleven, unlettered and uses to softness at home. The poor, frightened,
homesick, little eleven-year-old bride, sundered from her mother for the first
time in her life, found herself thrown into a group of domineering, chattering,
inquisitive, elderly women. Her father had delivered to her a sort of
convocation address and enjoined on her the utmost self-control and endurance.
He had exhorted her not to repeat tales to her husband, for malicious
whisperings have been the ruin of kingdoms, not to speak of families. The
bewildered little girl should have failed to adjust herself to her new
environment, had not her lord, with a due sense of her difficulties, lavished
on her tenderness and love which leaped all bounds. Ranade taught his wife Marathi
and English, much to the annoyance of the older women of the household, who
spent their fury on Ramabai in Ranade’s absence. She took great care not to let
her husband know her grief. But sometimes he used to notice her tear-stained
and pitiful face, and ask her, “Has anyone said anything? I fear you have been
crying;” Loth to spoil their truly happy and peaceful hours with unpleasant
narrations, she would put him off by evasive replies. Ranade knew the sort of
women they had in the family, and Ramabai was comforted by the thought that he
knew it all. She has recorded that it was a marvel that, as she climbed the
stairs in the evening to their rooms and was in her lord’s presence, all her
troubles vanished in an instant. A few quiet and affectionate words from him
transformed her into the most happy of women. It is against the background of
this growing mutual love and understanding which helped Ranade to endure the
lack of harmony in his home, of which he seldom spoke but was always aware,
that we should set his daily life, and see the ordered beauty and
purposefulness of his activities. He who would pay a tribute to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rishi </i>Ranade must not omit to pay his
homage to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rishipatni.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Ranade rose early in the morning, at three or half
past three. He insisted on his wife waking up too at the same hour. Unlike her
master, Mrs. Ranade was a heavy sleeper. It was a distress to her to wake up at
so early an hour, but the wish of her lord could not be resisted. She lighted
the lamp and read with Ranade his favourite poems and hymns. He had a deep
power of concentration and could easily lose himself in meditation. He would
repeat over and over some lovely poem of Namdev or a hymn of Tukaram, eyes
closed, his whole frame swaying to the rhythm, his being alone with God. Sometimes
he would clap his hands as he chanted the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bhajan.
</i>At times his throat would constrict, tears would roll down his cheeks, and,
overcome with religious emotion, he would fall silent. Blessed was Ranade’s
soul, and marvellous his simple faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To Mrs. Ranade the early morning hours were
hallowed. In the lovely light of the first streaks of dawn, she beheld her
lord’s serene countenance filled with worship, and her own heart overflowed
with love and worship of him. When alone, she might be filled with thoughts of
him in their human relations; but in those hours of the dawn she was in a
spiritual presence and she saw her master almost as a superhuman being. She
truly felt God’s presence in him and could worship at the feet of her lord and
guru. Mrs. Ranade tells us of a charming experience of hers, when the feeling
of the superhuman collapsed before the insurgence of the human. Once, on the
point of telling him of her sacred feelings, she lifted her eyes at the very
instant he turned his to hers, and in the splendour of that mutual experience
she became mute with love and joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The early morning hours were not without their
lighter side. Ranade had no ear for music, and Ramabai used sometimes to laugh
at his attempts at singing the hymns. He bore the teasing pleasantly, but
always solemnly assured her that God understood and forgave. Absorbed in his
own chanting, he failed to keep the rhyme accurately. He would use a line from
one poem, and then a line from another. He would chant stray phrases from memory,
as they harmonised with his mood. Sometimes Ramabai would jest with him and
say, “You had better collect together all these new poems.” His reply was that
he was a simple soul, who knew nothing about tunes and metres. “God, for whom I
am singing, knows all about it. He is not going to notice all these other
things.” There was a part of Ranade that was always serene and above the stress
of life. This godly part of him seems to have had the fullest expression in the
early morning hours of his prayer and meditation. All their lives together,
says Ramabai, those morning hours made the deepest impression on her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>At about half past five, he left his bed for his
early morning ablutions which occupied the half hour till six o’clock. Then he
took a little walk and on returning from it, he sat down on a couch in the
dining room, and after hearing his wife do a lesson or two he began the day’s
work. First he read the daily newspaper very carefully. Sometimes he had the
paper read to him by his wife, or a clerk, a devoted disciple like Gokhale. It
might be that the newspaper had some praise of Ranade, but he would skip over
it. If, however, there was any adverse criticism of his views or conduct, he
would read the passage or have it read to him very carefully, quite unperturbed
by any harsh statements and trying to see if he could profit by the criticism.
It is, however, wrong to think that he made of his study of newspapers an
entirely grim occupation. Mrs. Ranade tells us that he used to take an amused
interest in gossipy items in the papers about royalty and other high-placed
people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>After reading the paper he looked through his and
then devoted his attention to some serious study. He had the habit of becoming
absorbed in his work, and sitting for long periods writing steadily, with bent
head. At half past nine he went for his bath. Then dinner followed, which was
no hurried or silent affair. When the cook served, he insisted on his wife
eating with him. He was a good eater, and liked very peppery food and plenty of
vegetables. Ramabai says it was a pleasure to cook for him. While he relished
good food and ate it heartily, he did not ever complain of ill-prepared dishes.
If the food was especially well-prepared, then he would jest a little with Aba,
his favourite child; for, though they had no children of their own, they made
up for the deficiency by bringing up other people’s children. Sometimes he
said, “Why, Aba! you are now gulping your vegetable with relish, while last
meal you did not take any vegetable, even though there were two kinds.” Aba
said, “What vegetable, one was tasteless, the other sour!” Ranade would then
laughingly reply, “It won’t do for you to be so very attentive to your palate.
A student’s attention should be devoted to other things than to salt and
pepper. One should eat without grumbling, whatever one gets. Do you hear me
complain?” If a visitor ate with him, he would ply him with questions about the
economic conditions of his place and thus derive much information from his
guest that he could use in his endless papers and addresses. If a dear friend
happened to eat with him, then dinner time would be particularly lively. On one
occasion Pandurang Pandit, a very dear friend, was dining with him. Pandit was
ill and sad over his personal affairs. He ate next to nothing and Ranade
pressed him to take some food. Pandit, desiring to make the company lively, at
once said, “Let no one blame me for telling the truth. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>kosambari </i>is sour: the vegetables have no taste; the cakes are too
greasy; the curry has too little onion in it. So why should I eat?” Ranade
picked it up at this point and said, “You<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>forgot to say that the salt has no savour and the pepper has no heat.
However, even you can’t blame the cook about the milk. So have some of it.” And
so Pandit drank the milk and every one enjoyed the fun. If on any day he had
heard some annoying news before dinner, he ate in silence. Silence was his only
refuge in anger. In deep anger he would sit in silence and look grieved. Small
things did not rouse his anger; but when something serious angered him, it
lasted along time. But he would not say a word. His was not the anger of those
who shout and swear and forget their temper soon. It was a sort of deep but
silent disapproval. Dinner time was, however, almost always merry and noisy. He
loved then to indulge in teasing and jesting. I wish to bring this fact to
notice, because it has been said that Ranade was always serious and that he
wholly lacked a sense of humour. It is true that Ranade was no Dickens as a writer,
or A. P. Herbert as a speaker. He was serious, eloquent, transcendentally and
tirelessly sublime, but he had a genuine sense of humour in daily life, which,
in that context, is only another name for tolerance and understanding and a
readiness to please and be pleased. It was not an easy task for him to make his
household happy and contented, but he succeeded in making them happy. It was
his view that when the members of the family were unhappy, it indicated that
the head of the house had somehow failed. Likewise, Ramabai held that if the
mistress of the house is an affectionate, devout and actively busy person, all
the members of the family will be dutiful and happy and consider their home a
heaven on earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>After dinner Ranade took fresh fruits and nuts and
sat chatting for about fifteen minutes with his sister and step-mother whom he
treated as his own mother. Then he left for court where he worked from eleven
to five, except for the luncheon recess. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Leaving court at five, he had his carriage follow
him as he walked two or three miles for exercise. Reaching home at six, he sat
conversing with the members of the family or friends who came to see him for
half an hour. Then he answered the letters of the day, and he made it a
definite habit to reply letters on the very day of their receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>On holidays, and occasionally in the afternoons,
friends came in large numbers to see Ranade. He questioned them about several
things, thereby gathering data for his addresses. Important people of orthodox
groups came to him and he always treated them with great respect. In discussing
the doings of groups or of persons, he had a way of extolling something of
universal value they had done, and inspired them to fresh activities by warm
and judicious praise. He took care to plant in people’s minds large ideas of
beneficent and high minded activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In his camps, too, he had a big crowd to see him in
the evenings. Then, after the day’s hard work, he laid aside his pen and record
books and sat with his visitors talking. Sometimes he would take the visitors
for a walk, but they found it difficult to keep pace with Ranade who was a
rapid, steady walker. As he talked with them, he tried to gather many kinds of
information. He asked what was the rate of taxation and how the people stood
it; which crops yielded the best harvest in the area; how heavy the crop was
likely to be; what use the villagers made of their leisure time; what their
best trade was and how it prospered; what the chief god of the village was and
whether the god had any permanent endowments, whether the villagers, weary with
their daily toil, assembled in the evening together for sport and pastime; and
whether the schools were well maintained and well-established. Such was his
love<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>of the people of the land and
such his way of obtaining information day by day from the open books–the living
man and women. From even the meanest of the mean he was prepared to derive
knowledge and instruction. On one occasion, while he was having his shave in
Calcutta, he read aloud to the barber, asking him to pronounce some Bengali
words and to explain their meaning. Mrs. Ranade looked in and saw the strange
scene. When the barber had gone, she twitted her lord saying, “If anyone asks
me to make a list of our gurus, I shall have to top the list with the barber.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>If the evening happened to be one on which he had
to deliver a sermon to the Prarthana Samaj, Mrs. Ranade accompanied him to the
Samaj, for Ranade liked always to associate his wife with his activities. These
meetings were the soul of his life. The Prarthana Samaj held his intense
loyalty, and he led the devotions even at short notice though he was ill or
over worked. His meetings were so full of spiritual meaning, so devout and so
solemn that the listeners felt a benediction. It was as though the whole body
directly spoke with God. Ranade’s attitude was one of such serene peace that
there was a rare glow in his countenance that compelled the eye and subdued the
heart. To the end of his life, his intense devotion and simple humility in
worship were the secrets of his power over people<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

services at the Samaj.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>On his return in the carriage after the service, he
would ask Ramabai to give him the substance of what he had lectured. If she did
well, he would say, “Then today’s meeting was all right.” If she could not give
a good summary, he would say, “Apparently I failed today. I have one rule by
which to judge my performances. If you understand it, then it is good. If you
don’t, then it is not good, it is too difficult.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the earlier hours of the night before supper,
Ranade would spend some time examining the students who were educated and fed
by him. Then he would read with his wife some book. It might be that they were
reading <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tara </i>by Meadows Taylor and
they had reached the part where Tara’s widowhood is described. Ramabai would be
deeply touched and reduced to tears. Ranade would say “Ram Ram” as he always
did to, cover up distress. When Ramabai had recovered, they would stop the
reading and talk about the sad and pathetic condition of widows generally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

routine was thoroughly upset. He would undertake some important piece of
writing or lecturing work. He would order a huge box of books from the Royal
Asiatic Society, outline schedule of work or two or three hours each morning
and evening in addition to his usual work, He would be so lost in his work that
he became careless of rest, food and exercise. If his wife remonstrated, he
would laughingly reply, “All right, woman! You would have me sit idly, waiting
for food to be prepared and then eat it, would you?” He would add, “I am a busy
man, and when I become absorbed in some effort, I can’t afford to stop until I
finish.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One Sunday afternoon Ranade was writing
assiduously, and Ramabai went up to him to ask if she could bring tea. Without
raising his eyes he said, “Don’t say a word to me. When I have finished, I will
call for you.” After an hour he called his wife to bring the tea. That night he
got ill and Ramabai accused him of carelessness. But smilingly he replied,
“Don’t be silly. Listen! If it chanced that by a little effort you saved a
life, would you not endure a lot of trouble for that purpose?” He explained
that in an important case he had a difference with his colleagues, who felt
that certain accused should be hanged. While working on that case he did not
wish to be interrupted, lest his thought become disorganized and illegal. In
spite of the night’s fever he attended the court as usual, and reported that
evening, “Well, two men’s lives were spared today.” That was Judge Ranade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Let us just have a glimpse of one of Ranade’s days.
He was only on this side of sixty, but his heart grew increasingly weak and he
knew he was a dying man. Before he knew the truth, he had anxious consultations
with eminent doctors. Now for him all anxiety was over and he was all calm of
mind. He concealed his suffering and displayed a mind at peace with itself. He
would not hear of rest, and kept himself occupied. If any one asked how he
felt, he said, “Oh! it is about the same, sometimes better, sometimes worse.
One’s body is always a nuisance.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the last year of his life, in spite of illness,
he spent endless hours in boiling down material for an address on Vasishta and
Viswamitra which he was to deliver at the Social Conference at Lahore. But when
the time for the Conference came, he grew worse and Gokhale decided, on the
doctor’s advice, that he was not to go. It was a bitter pill for him to
swallow, and the tears were in his eyes as he prepared a telegram to the
Committee. His voice trembled as he said, “This is the first time in eighteen years
that there has been a break in my attendance.” That is Patriot Ranade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

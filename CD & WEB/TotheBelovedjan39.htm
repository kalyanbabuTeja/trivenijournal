</I><P>O friend of my soul, come to me:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall keep you within my heart. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">O my friend, he who lives at a certain place knows the glory of that place. How can one know who does not live there?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So come into my heart and therein abide.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had you been "Kajal,"<SUP>l</SUP> I would have sheltered you in my eyes; had you been a jewel or a pearl, I would have woven you into a garland round my neck: but you are neither.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would give you a flute wrapped up in gold; I would give you a heart embedded in love, O beloved!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I long to give up my life to you and so to die.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One who has loved knows no rest; the fire in her mind bums day and night; it knows not to be extinct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the stars follow the moon and are bound to her, so my heart is bound to you, O my love!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Says Govindadas: eyes pour forth love; they are embalmed by sight of the beloved; and they lose lustre when the beloved is out of sight.</P></DIR>

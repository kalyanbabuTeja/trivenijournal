<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
considering the Report of the States Re-organisation Commission, it is
necessary to have at the outset a clear idea of the circumstances under which
the Commission was appointed and the primary purpose for which it was
constituted. The importance of the Report cannot be appreciated unless the
distinction between its primary and secondary purposes is kept in mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:34.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
sometime before its appointment there was in the country an insistent and
almost fanatical demand for redrawing the whole map on the basis of unilingual
States. It was a demand which was considered by Pandit Nehru to be most
unreasonable and highly injurious to the fundamental and long-period interests
of the country. This was why, though he often repeated the view that the
creation of the Andhra State was less contentious than the creation of other
linguistic States, he was not prepared to take the necessary action on the
lines of this view. But the martyrdom of Potti Sriramulu in the case of the
Andhra State, and the violence of the disorders that followed it, made Pandit
Nehru yield to the demand of the Andhras, and the Andhra State was formed in
October 1953. This naturally gave a fresh momentum to the demand for other
linguistic States–Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra etc. Pandit Nehru’s Government
was then </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>placed in a dilemma. If the demand for these
States was not conceded there was the danger of wide-scale sabotage and even </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>anarchy
bordering on an undeclared civil war. Such a danger could be suppressed only by
the use of totalitarian methods and even then there was no complete guarantee
of success. But if the demand was conceded there was the fear that each
linguistic State, with its autonomy under the Constitution, would become the
focus of a sub-national loyalty and that this loyalty would gradually grow in
strength at the expense of loyalty to the whole country. It was not an
imaginary fear. The fear had its root in the course which Indian history took
in the past, when every empire was overthrown by the growth of regional
loyalties. And the danger is all the greater today than in the past, because
the loyalty is not to an absolute ruler but to an emotion-charged group. Here
is an observation in the Commission’s Report </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bearing on this
phenomenon: “It has been most distressing to us to witness, during the course
of our enquiry, a kind of border </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>warfare in certain
areas in which old comrades-in-arms in the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>battle for freedom
have been pitted against one another in acrimonious controversy, showing little
appreciation of the fact that the States are but limbs of the same body-politic
and that territorial readjustments between them should not assume the form of
disputes between alien powers.” It was to discover a way out of this dilemma
that Pandit Nehru’s Government appointed the three man States Re-organisation
Commission. The problem to the solution of which the Commission was called upon
to address itself was the problem of whether to redraw the map of India on the basis
of “one language, one State”. All other questions considered by the Commission
are either intimately related to this, or are of a non-controversial and
subsidiary character. The nature and value of the Commission’s recommendations
are to be judged primarily on What they say about linguistic States and the
problems which they give birth to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
this is the standpoint from which the work of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Commission
is to be judged is also borne out by the public reaction in the weeks following
the publication of its report. There </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>have not been any
comments of a noteworthy character on the recommendations made by it in regard
to the removal of distinctions between Part A, Part B and Part C States, and
the merger of Part C States in the neighbouring larger states. Even before the
appointment of the Commission all sections of public opinion were agreed on the
abolition of the institution of Rajpramukhs in Part B States, and on the repeal
of Article 371 of the Constitution which gave to the Centre a kind of Control over
Part B States which it did not have over Part A States. There was also
substantial agreement on the view that Part C States like Bhopal, Coorg and
Kutch were too small, and financially too weak to preserve their separate
existence, and that the best course would be to merge them in the neighbouring
bigger States. The Commission bas only endorsed these non-controversial views
by recommending that, (a) the existing constitutional disparity between the
different Constituent units of the Indian Union should disappear; (b) Part B
States should be equated with Part A States by omitting Article 371 of the
Constitution and by abolishing Rajpramukhs; (c) the existing Part C States
should be merged in the adjoining larger States; and (d) such of the existing
Part C States as cannot be merged in the adjoining areas for security and other
imperative considerations should be administered by the Centre, not as ‘States’
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>but as ‘territories’. The result of these recommendations is
that, when they are given effect to, the component parts of the Indian Union
would consist of two categories</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(a) States forming
primary federating units, and (b) territories centrally-administered. It would
mean the reduction of the total number of States from twenty-seven to eighteen.
There are those who are of the view that the reduction in the number of States
is desirable in itself, but who are under a misconception that it can be
brought about by the reorganisation of States on a linguistic basis. Several of
them have welcomed the Commission’s recommendations on linguistic States for
this reason. They should however know that, even if the Commission had stopped
with their recommendations on Part B and Part C States, the number of States
would have been reduced to eighteen–only two more than the number resulting
from reorganisation on a linguistic basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
kind of guidance which the Commission has given to Pandit Nehru’s Government on
the crucial question of linguistic States may now be considered. The position
taken by the Commission in regard to this issue is rather peculiar. It has
throughout the Report argued against the theory and the principle of organising
States on a linguistic basis, but it has in the end recommended the
constitution of such States with only one important exception. There is thus an
incongruity between the theory which it has enunciated and the practice which
it has recommended. It is this incongruity that stands out as the most
prominent feature of the Report.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Theoretically
the Commission has argued that in creating a new State various factors have to
be considered, and language is only one of them. Among the other factors are,
(1) Administrative Convenience; (2) Financial Viability, and (c) the
requirements of the national developmental plans–the Second Five-year Plan and
the Plans which will subsequently follow. Over and above all these is the
factor of the preservation and strengthening of national unity and security.
The bearing of each one of these factors, on the proposals for reorganisation
has been fully examined in the Report and the Commission came to the conclusion
that “It is neither possible nor desirable to re-organise States on the basis
of the single test of either language or culture, but that a balanced approach
to the whole problem is necessary in the interests of our national unity.” It
went further in elaboration of this thesis and stated that “such a balanced
approach would appear to be: </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

theory of ‘one language, one State’, which is neither justified on grounds of
linguistic homogeneity, because there can be more than one State speaking the

extent that the realisation of unilingualism at State level would tend to breed
a particularist feeling, to counterbalance that feeling by positive measures
calculated to give a deeper content to Indian nationalism; to promote greater
interplay of different regional cultures, and inter-State co-operation and
accord; and to reinforce the links between the Centre and the State in order to
secure the greater co-ordinated working of national policies and programmes.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
long quotation from the Report makes it clear that the Commission is dead
against the principle of ‘one language, one State’, and the concept of
‘home-land’ which always goes along with it. The principle breeds
particularistic feelings. It creates the problem of linguistic minorities.
Composite States are to be preferred on the whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unfortunately
however the Commission completely departed from this position when it had to
make the practical recommendations to serve as a guide. It could have adhered
to the principles which it had the courage and wisdom to formulate and told
Pandit Nehru and his Government that the only kind of re-organisation that was
needed was merger of Part C States in-the larger </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>neighbouring
units and the abolition of the distinction between. Part A and Part B States.
Instead of this it has recommended the creation of a number of new States, all
based on linguism with one exception–Bombay. Those who have been agitating for
linguistic States are more than satisfied. They are not scholars interested in
political theory. They are not in any way perturbed by the elaborate arguments
put forward by the Commission against linguistic States. It is the end result
in which they are interested. And almost all of them got the States they
demanded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Constitution of India recognises fourteen languages
as the major languages of the country. Of these Sanskrit is not a spoken
language and there is no question of a ‘Sanskrit’ State (although there is an
appreciable volume of opinion in favor of making Sanskrit the official language
of the whole country instead of Hindi). Urdu is spoken by millions of Muslims,
but as they are not concentrated in anyone geographical area, it is not
practicable to organise an Urdu State. Every one of the remaining twelve
languages–Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam,
Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Te1ugu–with the exception of Gujarati, gets
as it were a State or States of its own, a home-land for its people with the
implied right to look on other Indians living there as strangers enjoying in
practice (whatever the Constitution may say) only a second-class citizenship.
This incongruity between the theory enunciated by the Commission and the
practice which it recommended for adoption, can only be explained in one way.
The Commission must have felt that the emotion among the masses of people
behind the demand for linguistic States is so strong and so fanatical that the
consequence of not conceding the demand–however unreasonable the demand may
be–will be more serious than the consequences of conceding it. It was the
pressure of circumstances that compelled Pandit Nehru to concede the demand for
the Andhra State; and it is the fear of the growth of similar pressure that is
responsible for the recommendation made by the Commission that the States of
Kerala, Karnataka, Vidarbha and Hyderabad should be formed. One is therefore at
a loss to know why the Commission took so much trouble to examine the theory of
linguistic States and repudiate it, though academic students of the subject
will find all this to be of the greatest value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is one other element of incongruity in the recommendations of the Commission.
It is its failure to concede the demand for the division of Bombay into a
Maharashtra and a Gujarati </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>State. The grounds on which it defended
the continuance of Bombay as a bilingual State are not quite convincing. (1)
One such ground is that the demand for a Maha Gujarat is not pressing. By and
large the Gujarati-speaking people are content to remain in the composite State
of Bombay. The question thus is one of pressure and the contentment of the
Gujarati-speaking people is considered to be more important than that of the
Marathi-speaking people of the State. The Commission says: “We are conscious of
the fact that opinion in the northern and southern Maharashtra districts in
general seems to be in favour of the creation of the United Maharashtra State.
At the same time we cannot ignore the fact that important sections of public
opinion in the Marathi-speaking districts of Madhya Pradesh do not subscribe to
the ideal of Samyukta Maharashtra.” The position here is more or less similar
to that created by the demand for Visalandhra and Samyukta Karnataka. In both
these cases the Commission recommended the formation of linguistic States. Because
it found the opinion among the Andhras of Telengana not very much favourable to
the formation of Visalandhra, it did not re-commend the continuance of the
composite State of Hyderabad but the creation of a second Andhra State. In the
case of Karnataka it did not attach sufficient weight to the opinion in favour
of two Karnatakas, but all the same it adhered to the principle of linguism. It
should have followed a similar course in regard to the Maharashtra as in the
case of Visalandhra. If opinion in Vidarbha was very much adverse to Samyukta
Maharashtra (as opinion in Telengana was adverse to Visalandhra) it should have
recommended the formation of two Maratha States. The sub-national sentiment is
far stronger among the Marathas of Bombay than even among the Karnatakas. Their
experience of a separate statehood is more recent; and they are a people who
made their domination felt over a large part of the country. Is it safe to
ignore the feelings of such a linguistic group and attach greater weight to the
Gujarati-speaking people of the Bombay State? It is possible that out of
respect for Pandit Nehru the Pradesh Congress Committee of Maharashtra might
not resort to violent agitation. This will only make the Pradesh Congress
Organisation more unpopular than what it is already. One should not forget in
this connection that not only in Maharashtra but also in almost every other
State of India the Congress organisation has no inherent strength, and that
whatever hold it has on the people is due to the respect and affection which
people have for Pandit Nehru and the confidence in his leadership. The only
result therefore of any directive from the Congress High Command that the
Congress </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in Maharashtra should not agitate for a separate
State will be to drive discontent underground, to give opportunities for other
political parties to assume leadership and create a revolutionary situation
later. Even a level-headed academician like Prof. D. R. Gadgil accused the
Commission, so far as the particular issue was concerned, of having been
influenced by Gujarati capitalists. (2) Another ground put forward in favour of
Bombay continuing as a composite State is the problem of the city of Bombay
over which both the Maharashtrians and Gujaratis have claims. There is no space
here to examine the whole issue about the city. It may however be relevant to
point out that the Commission, which always quoted the views of the Dar
Commission with approval, didn’t care to attach weight to the view of that body
that Bombay city should be a centrally administered State. One argument brought
forward against this view was that if Bombay city was separated the resulting
Maharashtra and Gujarati States would be deficit States and there would be no
way of diverting to them the surplus revenues of Bombay city. But this is not a
convincing argument. Some of the States recommended by the Commission–Kerala
for instance–are deficit States. The Central Government has to pay subsidies to
them out of its general revenues. There will be no practical difficulty in the
Central Government administering Bombay city, collecting its surplus revenues
and distributing them between the neighbouring deficit States; Grants-in-aid
are a normal feature of every federal </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

may therefore be concluded that the incongruity in the Commission not
recommending the linguistic division of the Bombay State has to be removed. The
case for a separate Maharashtra State is as strong as that for a Karnataka or a
Kerala State. And when such a State is formed there will inevitably be a
separate Gujarati State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is one other point to which reference has to be made. Punjabi is one of the
fourteen languages recognised by the Constitution but it appears as if the
Commission had not recommeded a Punjabi-speaking State. What it has done is to
create a State to be made up of the present East Punjab, PEPSU and Himachal
Pradesh. Strong arguments have been put forward by Mr. Fazl Ali, the Chairman
of the Commission, against the merger of Himachal Pradesh in the new State.
Some of these arguments bear on the strategy of the Himalayan border. It looks
therefore desirable that this State should continue to be administered by the
Centre</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:27.0pt;

of Punjab will consist of the present East Punjab and PEPSU. Can this be regarded
as a Punjabi-speaking State? From the data supplied in the Report it is not
easy to answer this question. There is the view of the Commission that, “there
is no real language problem in the State of Punjab as at present constituted.
This is so because the Punjabi and Hindi languages as spoken in the Punjab are
akin to each other and are both well understood by all sections of the people
of the State.” The difference arises out of the agitation of the Sikhs that the
Punjabi language should be written only in Gurumukhi script while the Hindus
are opposed to it. The fight therefore seems to be between two scripts and not
between two languages, though as a consequence of this fight large sections of
the Hindu community repudiated the Punjabi language as their mother-tongue even
though it is in fact their mother-tongue. The situation in the Punjab is thus a
confused one. And if the Commission has not recommended a pure Punjabi-speaking
State, it is due to the existence of this communal tension between the Sikhs
and the Hindus and to the fact that the Punjab State demanded by the Sikhs is
one where they can have a large majority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reorganise India into a number of linguistic States. The battle for such States
may be said to have come to an end. The next issue will be the sharing of the

need not be repeated that the battle in which victory was won is the battle
between the advocates of multi-lingual States and of unilingual States. It is
the latter that have won it. The two world wars have made us familiar with the
doctrine of ‘un-conditional surrender’. The unilingualists are not satisfied
with a general victory for their principle but want that it should be applied
to every matter of detail. There are three issues in this application. One
relates to the delimitation of the boundaries of the States to be re-organised
on the linguistic basis; another to whether more than one State may be formed
from the area inhabited by a single linguistic group; and the third is the
position of the minority groups in the States. Each linguistic State has
claimed that there are in the neighbouring states some regions–villages,
taluks, districts–inhabited by those who speak its language and that wherever
they are in a majority the particular region must be included within its
limits. It is on this issue that disputes have arisen between Orissa on one
side and Andhra, Bihar and Bengal on the other; between Bengal and Bihar;
between Assam and Bengal; between Andhra on one side, Madras and Mysore on the
other; between Madras and Travancore-Cochin; between Bombay and Rajasthan.
There is a formidable list of these disputes and a fierce battle has been going
on in regard to the settlement of these disputes. Some of them are
long-standing; some are more recent. But every linguistic State wants that each
one of its neighbours should unconditionally surrender to it the territories in
dispute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

regard to the settlement of such disputes the Commission observed thus: “In our
scheme of re-organisation, we have adopted the district as the basic unit for
making territorial re-adjustments. This is because we feel that districts have
developed an organic and administrative unity and an economic life of their
own, and any adjustments below the district level, therefore, should normally
be avoided. If any such adjustments are considered necessary, they should be
made only by mutual agreement. We have departed from this rule only when, for
ensuring geographical contiguity or for some other important administrative or
economic considerations, detachment of a part a district has become
imperative.” Of course, districts also have been made and unmade. They do not
have the kind of organic unity which the Commission attributes to them. But all
the same there should be some recognised principle on the basis of which
disputes like these are to be settled, and the principle enunciated by the
Commission is as satisfactory as any other alternative principle that can be
thought of. The principle is also elastic because the Commission has departed
from it when such a departure was found imperative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this basis it has determined which of the disputed areas should be taken away
from a particular State and included in another neighbouring State. No purpose
is served by going into everyone of these disputes and examining whether
another kind of settlement–other than what the Commission has proposed–would be
more just and appropriate. In cases like these it is only a sort of rough and
ready justice that is possible. Even where law is written and where there are
judicial tribunals manned by persons known for their impartiality, judgments
delivered by them on disputes arising in everyday life do not satisfy all the
parties concerned. There is, however, the feeling that the case was properly
heard, that consideration was given to all the issues raised by either party
and that the judges took all the trouble necessary to give a well-considered
judgement. It is with this feeling that the affected linguistic groups should
look at the way in which the Commission settled the border disputes or laid
down the principles according to which they should be settled. There should be
a finality in matters like these. It is, therefore, not proposed here to
discuss whether Kolar should remain in Mysore or be included in Andhra, whether
Madras should get the Deviculam and Peeramede taluks and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the principle of unilingual States is condemned, one of the reasons for such
condemnation is the permanence of the bitterness between one linguistic State
and another due to continuous agitation over border disputes previously
settled. There is thus mutual bitterness between Andhras and Utkals, Andhras
and Karnatakas, Biharis and Bengalees, each looking on the other as its sworn
enemy. And this has its repercussions on the government of the whole country,
the work done in the Union Cabinet, in the Union Parliament, and in every one
of the Central institutions where citizens of India coming from different
linguistic States have to work together in a spirit of loyalty to the country
as a whole. There are so many causes of dissension in the country weakening it
in a variety of ways. Communalism and casteism are very powerful disruptive
factors. It will be a tragedy if to these is added the linguistic antagonism
which will be the inevitable outcome of carrying on the struggle for disputed
border areas for all time. If each linguistic group accepts as final the
settlement recommended by the Commission, it will be a great step in the
preservation of<i> </i>the country’s unity. The second best thing will be–in
case the Commission’s settlement is not accepted–to make peaceful
representations to the authorities who will have to decide<span

once the legislation for re-organising the<i> </i>States is enacted and their

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be
noted first that, so far as Hindi is concerned, all the Hindi speaking people
have not been constituted into one State. There are today a number of Hindi
States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh etc., and
there is no agitation in favour of constituting all of them into one State. (2)
The Commission has discussed the pros anal cons of smaller <i>versus </i>larger
States and though it is inclined more towards larger States it has observed:
“In a matter like this, it would<i> </i>be unwise to be dogmatic or to rule out
exceptions. When it is suggested that the weight of argument is in favour of
large, rather than small states, the objective is that every State should have
adequate resources to assume the responsibility devolving on a full-fledged
constituent unit of the Union. This, however, does not mean that units should
be so unwieldy as to be without any intrinsic life of their own or to defeat
the very purpose for which larger units are suggested, that is, administrative
efficiency and co-ordination of economic development and welfare activity.” At
a time when we have started on the experiment of democracy which is entirely a
new system of government for us, it is best to have comparatively small and
compact States, and there will be nothing reaction</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ary
if out of a single linguistic area more than one State is created. (3) It is
also necessary to devise a remedy for the possibility of sub-national loyalties
growing at the expense of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>national loyalty. National sentiment is
not yet deep-rooted among our people. The tendency is much more in the
direction of emphasising the achievements of sub-nationalities like the Andhra,
the Dravida, the Bengalee etc. Literature that has been coming into existence
in recent years sings the praises of particular regions and the people in them.
Very few think of India as a whole. All this may be regrettable but that is the
truth and the bare truth. Linguistic States are sure to strengthen these
tendencies. There must be something very powerful and effective to counteract
them until national sentiment becomes as deeprooted and as alive as that, say,
in Britain, France or Germany. One effective way in which these tendencies can
be counteracted is by having, wherever it is practicable, more than one State
for each linguistic group. The Maharashtra States–one with Poona as capital and
the other with Nagpur as capital–are better from this point of view than a
Samyuktha Maharashtra. Two Andhra States as recommended by the Commission are
better. Similarly two Karnataka States–Mysore and Karnataka–should be welcome.
No serious objection need be taken if Vidarbha does not want to be included in
Maharashtra, or Telengana in Visalandhra, or Mysore in Karnataka. All this will
be unpalatable to the protagonists of linguism. But if linguistic States are
not to become the instruments of<i> </i>India’s disintegration, the
re-organisation of States on these lines is necessary.<span

is against this background that the note of Sardar Panikkar proposing the
partition of the State of Uttar Pradesh deserves consideration at the hands of
all intelligent citizens of the country. As he put it, it is “essential for the
successful working of a federation that the units should be fairly evenly
balanced. Too great a disparity is likely to create not only suspicion and
resentment but generate forces likely to undermine the federal structure itself
and thereby be a danger to the unity of the country.” It is not merely Uttar
Pradesh that requires to be partitioned. The same applies to the proposed
composite Bombay State with<i> </i>the Marathwada districts of Hyderabad,
Saurashtra and Kutch added to it. Where will States like Kerala be by the side
of such monsters? It is better when the map of the country is proposed to be
completely redrawn that steps are taken to bring about the territorial balance
advocated by Sardar Panikkar. It is on these grounds that the Commission’s
recommendation to create the big State of Madhya Pradesh consisting of the
Hindi-speaking districts of the present Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Bharat and
Vindhya is objectionable. This State will have an area of 171, 200 square miles
and will be the biggest in the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

question of re-organisation of States creates a number of problems of
transition. There is a fundamental difference between what was involved when a
single State like Andhra was formed and what is involved when the entire map of
the country is proposed to be redrawn. Everything is now being thrown into the
melting pot in the hope that a better-planned system of States will emerge from
it. The Report of the Commission is only the first step in this process. Several
other steps have to be taken before the necessary legislation is enacted by
Parliament. But even then the work will not be completed. It is in implementing
the various legislative enactments that numerous problems will<i> </i>arise.
When districts which formed part of one State are transferred to another State,
there will arise the question of the application of the laws of this State to
the new districts in matters like land tenure, prohibition etc. The unification
of laws takes time and difficulties will have to be experienced by both the
administrators and the people in the interval. Then again there is the problem
of integrating the service personnel belonging to one State (say Hyderabad)
with the personnel of another State (say Bombay) which would mean introduction
of unified pay scales, refixation of cadres, redetermination of relative
seniority in the different services etc. After the Kerala State is formed,
should all Malayalees now in the service of Madras be sent to Kerala; should
all Tamil public servants from Kerala be transferred </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Madras?
Then there is also the question of the distribution of assets and liabilities
and of rearrangements for ensuring the orderly progress of irrigation and power
projects previously started. The question of the aid to be given to the new
States has also to be decided. There is no end to problems like these. Every
State will have to be busy with these transitional arrangements and the Central
Government will have to divert much of its attention for the same purpose.
Things are sure to be unsettled for a number of years. Will it be possible to
carry out the Second Five-year Plan effectively under circumstances like these?
Let it be clearly understood that those who feel that the re-organisation of
States on a linguistic basis is of the greatest urgency should be prepared to
see that planned economic progress is bound to be delayed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may also be worthwhile for the Central Government to consider what the problems
of transition are likely to be and create a machinery to tackle them. Though
legislation for the formation of new States may be enacted by August 1956,<i> </i>the
date on which the legislation is to take effect may be left to the discretion
of the President. He may start the functioning of one State at one time and
another at another. The integration, for instance, of Malabar into
Travancore-Cochin may create fewer transitional problems than the integration
of Karnataka or the formation of a Gujarati State. The tribunals set up may
suggest measures for uniform legislation, for integration of services etc., in
respect of each State to be formed, and the State may start functioning after

Report of the States Re-organisation Commission is a document of fundamental
importance. It gives a clear analysis of the forces that are at work in our
country in shaping public opinion on political issues, the kind of political
issues in which the leaders of the people are interested, the need to satisfy
the public even on matters where their judgment is not sound, and the steps
that have to be taken if the political integrity of the country is to be
maintained and strengthened. It is not to a narrow question of the mere
re-organisation of States that the Commission addressed itself. It has taken a
more comprehensive view of its work and has given an illuminating account of
the real problems with which we are faced today and the spirit in which we
should try to solve them. The key to the whole report lies in the passage which
runs thus: “It is the Union of India that is the basis of our nationality. It
is in that Union that our hopes for the future are centred. The States are but
the limbs of the Union, and while we recognise that the limbs must be healthy
and strong and any element of weakness in them should be eradicated, it is the
strength and the stability of the Union and its capacity to develop and evolve
that should be the governing consideration of all changes in the country.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

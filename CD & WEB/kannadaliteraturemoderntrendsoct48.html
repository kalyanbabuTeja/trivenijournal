mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>KANNADA LITERATURE had flowed in an unbroken stream
from the 9th century A.D. down to the 19th century, passing successively
through various epochs–the Jaina, the Veerasaiva, and the Romantic. During the
entire 19th century, however, the springs of Kannada literature seem to have
dried up, excepting for a little trickling here and there. The cause for this
is not far to seek. British power in India had been well and truly consolidated
in that century, and the intelligentsia of our land had begun to look to
English, not as a language of thought and culture, which could be used to
enrich our own languages, but as a means of securing our daily bread. Our
languages, including Sanskrit, fell into disfavour, and those learned in them
slid into unblissful quietude. Kannada was probably the hardest hit in this
manner, because in addition to this general demoralising effect, the Kannada
country itself was broken up into more than a dozen fragments and put under as
many different administrations–a state of affairs existing even to this day.
But it is darkest before dawn, and the dawn of the 20th century saw a new
burgeoning of the spirit of Kannada literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This was mainly due to two forces at work. One was
the vision of few far-sighted the first decade of this century, who with a
missionary zeal, sought to bring about re-unification of Karnataka at least in
the domain of Art, Literature, and Culture. This vision took tangible shape in
the establishment of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat in 1915 with its headquarters
at Bangalore. This All Karnataka Institution has been, ever since then, the
rallying point for the literary, artistic, and cultural pursuits of all
Kannadigas, be they of Mangalore or Mysore, of Karwar or Dharwar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The second force–a, much greater force–responsible
for the new spirit in Kannada, was, of course, the impact of English thought
and culture on the educated youth of Karnataka, the very impact under which
Kannada had reeled only in the previous century. Down the ages, Sanskrit and
its thought and literature had been the sole fountain-head of inspiration for
all our poets and writers, who had drawn upon it freely with never ending
variations. But, as we have just seen, this inspiration had burnt itself out in
the 19th century as far as Kannada was concerned. Only the life-giving waters
of a new stream of thought, as great and sweeping in its scope as Sanskrit had
been till then, could give life to the drooping spirit of Kannada literature.
And this new life-giving stream came with full force from English literature
and thought in our present century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And that is why we find that all the makers of our
Kannada literature during the past four decades have been precisely those who
have drunk deep at the springs of Western thought and culture, either through
our Universities or otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>And that is why, also, all the modern trends in
Kannada literature are precisely those trends with which we are familiar in the
literatures of the West today. The short story, the lyrical poem, free verse,
the social play, the essay, the novel, the satire, biography, humour, criticism
etc., are the predominant forms in which our creative artists have expressed
themselves. Their writing has been less and less objective, and more and more
subjective. Their themes have been mainly concerned with the life of the common
man and the interplay of his emotions. Even if the great names or incidents in
classic literature or of the past are utilised, it is more with the intention
of giving them a new orientation in the light of the present, or of stressing
an emotion which is still predominantly playing its part in our lives today.
Their form of expression, whether it be in poetry or in prose, has been shorn
of all traditional conceits and incrustations, and has been simple and direct,
pellucid yet forceful. The literature that has been produced in Kannada during
the last four decades is in fact, the literature of Realism–a natural successor
to the Romantic literature of the previous age. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The harbinger of the new mood was Muddana’s <i>Ramashwamedha</i>,
a magnificent work, which appeared in the dawn of this century. The author was
unknown, and Muddana was obviously his pseudonym. This work, garbed as it was
in old style Kannada prose, appeared to be an ancient classic, and got
published as such. But it bore a refreshing originality and modernity of
treatment, possible only for a 20th century author. The bold and telling
imagery, the glowing spirit of love and romance, and the rollicking humour in
its interludes made this work a masterpiece and a classic in no time. It was
only after the death of one Nandalike Lakshminarnappayya, an inconspicuous
drill-master in a High School at Udipi, that the public came to know that it
was he who was the author of this magnificent work, which critics had been
feverishly, and with much argument, trying to place somewhere in the 14th or
15th century A.D.!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The fact that even in this century an outstanding
work of the stature of the <i>Ramashwamedha </i>could be written made a great
impression on the young educated men of the time. It quickened their creative
literary impulses and inspired them with an irresistible desire to create a new
era in Kannada literature, an era, greater and more glorious, if possible, than
all the previous ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The output, however, came in a shy and halting
manner at first. No doubt, mediocre translations of novels from Bengali and
Marathi came in with unabashed frequency. But the short story, the lyric, and
the personal essay began to appear only slowly and hesitatingly. The output for
a time was hardly of a quantity or a quality to sustain the dream of a new era
in Kannada literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But all at once the flowering came. It came with
the intensity and, the suddenness of a cloud-burst. Authors and poets arose,
almost in unison, from all parts of Karnataka, and bore with them a rich
harvest of song and poetry, drama and fiction, to be laid at the altar of
Kannada literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The short story and the lyrical poem were the first
to take the field. Masti Venkatesa Iyengar became famous overnight with his
charming and impeccable <i>Rangappana Dipavali </i>and other stories. Although
he had soon a large number of followers and imitators, he remains to this day
the supreme master of the short story in Kannada. The output of short stories
during the last forty years has been naturally prodigious. While most of them
are of necessity of the ‘boy-meets-girl’ type, a great many are marked by a
rare artistry, sincerity, and imagination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Side by side with the short story, lyrical poetry
has held the field for long. But unlike the short story, whose quality has been
rather uneven, excepting in the hands of a few master artists, the lyric has
risen to unprecedented heights in the hands of quite a large number of our
poets. Bendre of Dharwar, for instance, plays upon our heart-strings as on a
harp, evoking whatever emotion he wants. Masti Venkatesa Iyengar’s poetry
possesses a wealth of feeling and warmth of heart, of which only he is capable.
V. Sitaramiah’s lyrics are delicately sensitive and exquisitely beautiful.
Govinda Pai’s poems are in the grand manner and are characterised by great
depth of thought and feeling. D. V. Gundappa’s poems are full of charm and
impeccable beauty. K. V. Puttappa plucks the stars from the firmament and
offers them to his Muse. Prof. Gokak’s poetry is earnest, sensitive, and
thoughtful. G. P. Rajaratnam’s ‘Songs of the Drunkard Ratna’ are unique in any
literature of the world, compelling our admiration and homage by the sheer
boldness of their thought, expression, and structure. The late Panje Mangesh
Rao’s lyrics, though few, have an immortal quality about them. And these are
not all our poets; and, neither does our modern poetry consist of lyrics only:
free verse and blank verse of great beauty and power has also been written. At
this moment, a host of younger and newer poets like P. T. Narasimhachar, K. S.
Narasimhaswamy and others are tugging at our heart-strings, enthralling us by
the freshness of their imagery, expression, and execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the field of the Drama, the name of the late T.
P. Kailasam stands supreme. He revolutionised the Kannada drama of our times by
taking up our everyday common life on to the stage and making us see for
ourselves what we really are. His deep insight into the character of men and
women, his irrepressible sense of humour, and withal a boundless sympathy
outgoing to them from an overflowing heart, have made his plays bristle with
men and women we meet in the home, in the office, in the club, or in the
street. We are afraid to laugh at the characters or the situations in his
plays, lest we should be laughing at ourselves. And too often, while our
laughter is on our lips, a tear invariable glistens in our eyes. Such is the
consummate artistry of this master dramatist, who has been rightly called the
Father of the Modern Kannada Drama. Prof. R. V. Jahgirdar of Dharwar is another
of our well-known dramatists. His plays are characterised by clever,
quick-firing dialogues, trenchant humour and a keen analysis of human motives
and action. K. Shivaram Karanth of Mangalore is still another of our great
dramatists. His dramatic genius has-flowered in many ways. In a number of his
One-Act plays he is a powerful realist, but in most of his full length plays he
combines high idealism with a vein of satire. He is unique among our dramatists
in that he has written a number of operatic plays–operatic, not in, the Indian
sense, but in the Western one. And these<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>are not all our dramatists. The One-Act play, in both its prose and
verse forms, has been a prominent and a supple instrument in the hands of quite
a large number of our literary artists, too numerous to mention. Among the
longer plays, the late B. M. Srikantia’s <i>Ashwatthaman, </i>modelled on the
Greek tragic plays, was a landmark in our dramatic literature when it was first
published. And so was C. K. Venkataramiah’s classic, <i>Mandodari</i>.
Kannadised versions of English and French farces are also largely coming in
now-a-days to serve our dramatic literature on its lower levels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the field of Fiction, the outlook was rather
bleak in the beginning of this century, the works published being mainly
translations of novels from other languages. However, Shivaram Karanth’s
remarkable novel <i>Chomana Dudi </i>(The Drum of the Pariah) and another
equally good one, although in the satiric vein, called <i>Devadootaru </i>(The
Messengers of Gods), were early exceptions to this state of affairs. But the
ground has been broken anew. K. V. Puttappa has given us his <i>magnum opus</i>,
<i>Kanur Subbamma Heggadthi</i>, a novel with ‘Malenad’ life as its background.
A. N. Krishna Rao’s brilliant novels of the middle class social life are highly
idealistic in outlook and deeply emotional in content. Shivaram Karanth himself
has turned again to fiction, and has given us some superb novels of life in
South Kanara. Novels dealing with our struggle for freedom as the main theme
are also fast coming into vogue. But novels of deep psychological insight into
affairs of men and things are yet to make their way into our literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The serious Essay has not yet taken root in Kannada
literature, probably because the quick tempo of our 20th century life is hardly
conducive to the growth of the leisurely essay. But light, humorous sketches
have taken deep root, in the soil. Humour in our ancient classics, although
scanty, has always been of a high order. But humour in the prolific manner is a
distinctive product of the 20th century, and Kannada has not lagged behind. Dr.
Shivaram, N. Kasturi, Gorur, and a host of younger writers are keeping us in
our proper moods today by their sparkling perpetration’s in this field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>On the non-creative side, literary criticism of a
high order has been largely fostered by our leading writers. C. K.
Venkataramiah and G. P, Rajaratnam have given us historical biographies, and
the latter also an autobiography, the first of its kind in Kannada. A. N.
Krishna Rao has specialised in Veerasaiva literature, and G. P. Rajaratnam in
Buddhistic literature, based on which he has given us some outstanding works in
Kannada. Other religious and devotional literature also has largely come into
existence. Folklore has been revived, and a large amount of a delightful
‘Literature for Children’ has been written, chiefly by the late Panje Mangesh
Rao and by G. P. Rajaratnam and Hoysala Shivaram Karanth himself has given us
single-handed a magnificent Encyclopedia for Children, called <i>Bala Prapancha</i>,
probably the first of its kind in any Indian Language. Political literature
also is fast making its way into Kannada. Popular books on Science are slowly
trickling in, but we are still at the beginning in this field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>These, in brief, are the main trends in modern
Kannada Literature trends which have been caused, as one of our writers has
graphically put it, by the intermingling of the waters of the Kannada Kaveri
and the Sanskrit Bhagirathi with those of the English Thames. The cry every
where now is for ‘Progressive Literature’, but the term is a misnomer, for no
literature deserves to be called literature unless it is progressive. And most
of the literature produced in Kannada during the last forty years is definitely
of a progressive kind. The river of literature flows on. Its course may be
smooth or ruffled, wide or narrow, straight or meandering. Its water may be fed
at various points by powerful tributaries, and the scenery on its banks may
progressively change. But it is still the same literature coursing down the
ages, changing and progressing according to the dictates of the Time Spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

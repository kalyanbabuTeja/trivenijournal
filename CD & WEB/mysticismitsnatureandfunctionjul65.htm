style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is mysticism? It is religion in the most acute, intense, and living sense. It
is an immediate awareness, a direct and intimate consciousness, of God. It is
religious experience, neither theological knowledge nor metaphysical
perspicacity. It is first hand knowledge, and not information derived second
hand. It is not a relational type of knowledge. It is the restful and living
contemplation of the Divine. It is ineffable. It is a <span class=SpellE>bonafide</span>
discovery of the ground of Reality and the goal of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mysticism
is latent in the depths of the world’s sub-consciousness. It has developed
under the shade of every great religion, sometimes outside the church and at
times inside the church. It has a long and respectable intellectual ancestry in
the East as well as the West. In the East all the philosophical systems are the
results of the spiritual experience of the sages who propounded them. In the
West, on the contrary, many philosophers have refused to pass beyond the
frontiers of the mind. They look with suspicion at those systems that base
their <span class=GramE>doctrines</span> on spiritual experience. The dominance
of the rational is the chief note in Western thought. In the words of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span>, the Western tradition stands for <i>critical
intelligence </i>and the East for <i>creative intuition. </i>Some thinkers,
however, argue that Indian philosophers have accepted unreasoned intuition and
thus mixed up philosophy and religion. Students of the Indian system of
philosophy who have looked into the philosophical classics and the polemical
tracts know how much of subtle reasoning is present in the systems. The logical
acuteness present in the <span class=GramE>works,</span> regales the most
ardent lover of logic and baffles the inexpert. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mysticism,
in the first place, is realization. It is not mere knowing <i>Brahman </i>but
being <i>Brahman. </i>It is trans-intellectual and trans-relational.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is also self-evident. It cannot be
faithfully and adequately expressed in terms of human language. Only symbols
are to be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>employed. The Upanishad declares that mind and
speech return without comprehending it. The height is <span class=SpellE>unscalable</span>.
Another Upanishad compares it to lightning. Plato in the Seventh Epistle says:
“There is no writing of mine on this subject, nor ever shall be. It is not
capable of expression like other branches of study. If I thought these things
could be adequately written down and stated to the World, what finer occupation
could I have had in life than to write what would be of great service to
mankind?” <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. Thomas</st1:place></st1:City>
wrote till he got the vision; after the vision he refused to dip his pen in the
ink. The fourteenth century author of <i>The Cloud of Unknowing </i>declared:
“The high and the best way thither <span class=GramE>is</span> run by desire
and not by the pace of feet.” The conscious mind and intellect of man <span
class=GramE>are</span> merely the superficies of the Self. Man needs the <i>(<span
class=SpellE>divyacakshus</span></i>) divine vision. “For He may be loved, but
not thought. By love <span class=GramE>may</span> He be begotten and <span
class=SpellE>holden</span>; but by thought never.” The Bible says, “Be still
and know.” <i>“Santa <span class=SpellE>Upasita</span>”, </i>says the
Upanishad. To secure that experience, the author of <i>The Cloud of Unknowing </i>says:
“Look that nothing lives in thy working mind but a naked intent stretching” <i>(<span
class=SpellE>ananyabhakti</span>). </i>“Smite upon the thick cloud of unknowing
with a sharp dart of Longing Love.” <span class=SpellE>Boehme</span> states
that the wheels of imagination must be stopped ‘. Thought, convention,
self-interest, priggishness, lust, etc., smear the windows of the senses. They
drape the panes. So Blake observes: “If the doors of perception are cleansed,
everything will appear to man as it is–infinite. For man has closed himself up,
till he sees all things through the narrow chinks or his cavern.” <span
class=SpellE>Dionysius</span> the <span class=SpellE>Areopagite</span> writes:
“If anyone saw God and understood what he saw, then it was not God that he saw,
but something that belongs to him.” The Upanishads again and again describe the
Ultimate Reality as ‘not this, not this’, ‘not this which is before you, which
you worship’. The negative description is clinched in the <span class=SpellE>Mandukya</span>
verse: “It is unseen by the sense organs (<span class=SpellE><i>adrstam</i></span><i>).
</i>It is unrelated to the things of the world <i>(<span class=SpellE>avyavaharyam</span>.)
</i>It is incomprehensible by mind <i>(<span class=SpellE>agrahyam</span>). </i>It
is indefinable <i>(<span class=SpellE>alakshanam</span>). </i>It is unthinkable
<i>(<span class=SpellE>acintyam</span>)</i>. It is indescribable <i>(<span
class=SpellE>avapadesyam</span>). </i>At the same time, it is essentially of
the nature of consciousness which constitutes the character of the Self of man <i>(<span
class=SpellE>ekatmapratyayasaram</span>). </i>It is the negation of the world <i>(<span
class=SpellE>prspancopasamam</span>). </i>It is the tranquil, the blissful, and
the non-dual <i>(<span class=SpellE>santam</span>, <span class=SpellE>sivam</span>,
<span class=SpellE>advaitam</span>). </i>It is the reality of the Real <i>(<span
class=SpellE>satyaya</span> <span class=SpellE>satyam</span>)</i>.” Though the
ultimate category is absolutely indeterminable, it is not ultimately
unrealizable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rejects all the forms of external authority common to denominational, dogmatic,
and exclusive theologies, <span class=SpellE>i</span>. e., belief in an
infallible revelation or book, or an infallible church or prophet. It shifts
the <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of gravity in religion from authority to
experience. This makes mysticism place religion on an objective, empirical and
scientific basis. It is the bold and experimental approach to religion. This
insistence on experience as the ultimate testimony makes it rational. <span

puzzles. It is not opposed to science or reason. It is not contingent on any
event past or future. No scientific criticism or historical discovery can
refute it, as it is not dependent on any impossible miracles or unique
historical revelations. Its only apologetic is the testimony of spiritual
experience. It is not committed to the authenticity of any documents or truth
of any stories about the beginning of the world or prophecies of its end.” </p>

the popular mind, mysticism is identified with and believed to consist in

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mysticism
takes up the contemporary challenge to Religion, posed by Naturalism.
Naturalism regards the methods of religion as dogmatic and not scientific. The
mystic takes his stand on experience and not a mere dogma. Mysticism is based
on the experimental realization A Reality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

enemy of spiritual religion is the dogmatic theologian. He claims exclusive,
total and special disclosure of divinity to him with the result, each prophet
abrogates the truths of the creeds other than his own. Each says, “Thou <span
class=SpellE>shalt</span> have no other God but mine, no prophet but me.” A
sharply defined and fully described anthropomorphism is inconsistent with any <span
class=SpellE>catholocity</span> of outlook. It does not tolerate any rival. No
other approach is approved. This leads to wars, proselytisms, conflicts, and
persecution. Enthusiasm is <span class=SpellE>mis</span>-spent in <span
class=SpellE>rivalling</span> one another in the art of competitive indoctrination.
“It brutalizes men by its rites and <span class=SpellE>shrivelling</span>
terrors of superstition” and the practical record of its misdeeds is
depressing. Fundamentalism, intolerance, fanaticism, and bigotry are the
results of closed theologies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
spiritual religion of mystics avoids the pitfall of dogmatic theologies because
the Transcendent Reality cannot be described in any one form completely. It is
described differently by different men. The different pictures of God are the
different intellectual formulations of one indescribable Reality. None of them
is the exclusive picture of Reality. All are different attempts to represent
the one from different perspectives. Such a view promotes fellowship of faiths.
It makes for peace and makes impossible the cruelty <span class=SpellE>practised</span>
in the name of religion. The God of one religion does not conflict with the God
of another religion. There is no need for proselytism or persecution. Tolstoy
in his <i>Confession </i>writes: “I read and studied these books of traditional
religion and theology, and here is the feeling I have carried away from that
study. If I had not been <i>led by life </i>to the inevitable necessity of
faith; and if I had not seen that this faith formed the foundation of the life
of men; if this feeling, shattered by life, had not been strengthened anew in
my heart….if there were within me only the faith of which theology speaks, I,
after reading these books, not only would have turned atheist, but should have
become the malignant enemy of every faith, because I found in these doctrines
not only nonsense, but the conscious life of men who had chosen the faith as
the means for obtaining certain ends.” Elsewhere he writes, “I intended to go
to God and found my way into a stinking bog.” To the theologians he cries: “Go <span
class=GramE>yourselves</span> to your father, the devil….You are not speaking
of God, but of something else. The God of religion is not the God of dogmatic
theology.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the Upanishads and the Gita are the only scriptures that declare that “by
scripture alone we cannot attain <span class=SpellE><i>Moksha</i></span><i>.” </i>.The
final authority is experience. “This Self-cannot be known by the study of the
Vedas, nor by intellect, <span class=GramE>nor</span> even by much hearing the

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mysticism is not, as
some think, a mere way of feelings. It is not a matter of emotions or the
subject of psychology. It is not the experience of people who are highly
suggestible and have a disordered mind and an intemperate imagination. It is
not ‘the distressing appearance of entirely sophisticated and reflective
persons <span class=SpellE>cudgelling</span> themselves into an attitude of
lisping childishness.” Freud described religious experience as “an illusion and
as a mental comfort and rest, based on an infantile part of our nature. It is a
regress, a stepping back to the attitude of little children coming up against
the problems of life and death.” All these lines of attack are elaborations of
the criticism that mysticism is a subjective state of feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The mystics of the world exhibit a striking
unanimity in their confessions. “They form an invariable brotherhood scattered
through all lands and times. Though separated by space and time, they reach
hands to each other and agree in saying that God and man are separated only in
outer appearance, both are indissolubly one.” Dean <span class=SpellE>Inge</span>
writes that “mysticism is singularly uniform in all times and places. The
communion of the soul with God has found much the same expression whether the
mystic is a Neo-Platonic Philosopher like <span class=SpellE>Plotinus</span>,
or a <span class=SpellE>Mohammadan</span> Sufi, or a Catholic Monk, or a
Quaker. Mysticism which is the living heart of religion springs from a deeper
level than the differences which divide the churches, the cultural changes
which divide the ages of history.” </p>

is not purely subjective. It is the genuine discovery of an object and is not

knowledge. It is the concentration of all faculties, will, intellect and

not the mere reason.” “The human mind,” says <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Macarius</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> “is the throne of Godhead.”
The Cambridge Platonist, <span class=SpellE>Whichcote</span>, writes to <span
class=SpellE>Tweckney</span>: “I oppose not rational to the spiritual. The
spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.” The author of the Gita asks us to

mystic’s knowledge has none of the limitations of sense or rational knowledge.
It transcends them. It is not ‘<span class=SpellE>contrological</span>’. It is

“Mysticism is reverent thought and not unrestrained feeling.” It is true
integral knowledge. It transforms men into little Gods and makes them work hard
for the establishment of the world-community. The mystics possess greater power
than </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

criticism is that the mystics are an indolent lot and lazy. We can see that
this is not true when we consider the great work of the active mystics, the
crusaders of God. They incorporate and incarnate the values of religion in the
life and the institutions of men. They build the new social order in the image
of honesty, truth, and love. They are not escapists. They realize the
experience and spread the light in every age. They suffer martyrdom and bear
witness to their experience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tenets of mysticism are two: The unity of all existence. In order to know God,
man must be the partaker of the Divine. ‘What we are, that we behold’, and
‘what we behold, that we are’. We are consubstantial with the uncreated ground
of the deity. <span class=SpellE>Plotinus</span> said that “Every man is a
double,” meaning that one side of his soul is in contact with the intelligible,
the other with the sensible, world. It is in His light we see the light. Though
we are made in the image of God, our likeness to God only exists potentially.
God is not wholly other to man. <span class=SpellE>Spinoza</span> declared: “We
feel and know that we are eternal.” Man is not an irremediably fallen creature
of sin, tied down to a body of lust, with no glimmer of divinity in him. He is
‘imprisoned <span class=SpellE>splendour</span>’, in the words of Browning. The
Kingdom of God is not hither or thither, it is in us. It can be realized here
and now, in the mortal frame, not at some distant date after death. It is the
birthright of all without any distinction. The mystics affirm the dignity and
divinity of man. It is humanism par excellence. The mystics affirm the unity of
God and man. They do not admit any barrier in between the two. Man does not
need any intermediary between him and God. “Such as men themselves are, such
will God Himself seem to them to be.” He is closer to us than breathing, and
nearer than hands and feet. St. Paul writes that ‘God hath sealed in us and has
given us the earnest of the spirit in our heart.’ If God is not found in man,
He is <span class=SpellE>unfindable</span>. “All things that are yonder are
also here.” We need not search for His footprints in nature, when we can behold
His face in ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said
St. Augustine. It is impossible, to love God and do bad to men. It is hypocrisy
to take the name of the Lord in vain. Good life is indispensable for godly
life. The mystic gives up all those activities that forbid unity. Without
holiness no man can see God. “Blessed” are the pure in heart for they shall see
God.” “One who has not desisted from bad conduct, whose senses are not under
control, whose mind is not concentrated, whose mind is not free from anxiety,
cannot attain this Self through knowledge.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mystics have sunny confidence in the ultimate triumph of Good. They seek not <span
class=SpellE><i>atmakalyana</i></span><i> </i>but the good of society. Some
think that Eastern mysticism is world-negating and not life affirming. Eastern
mystics regard the world as an illusion and the only thing we can do with it is
to wake up from it. They do not dominate life but try to escape from it. Theirs
is a personality destroying mysticism. Some critics hold that Buddhist and
Hindu ethics are not born from a feeling of compassion but from the idea of
keeping undefiled by the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

truth is that the mystic outlook combines in fine and proper proportion, the <i>executive
</i>and <i>reflective </i>aspects of life. The two centralities of religion are
<i>energy </i>and <i>vision. </i>The exclusive domination of one leads to
savagery and the domination of the other leads to dwelling in cloud land. The
Gita paradox of ‘action in inaction’ is resolved in the personality of the
mystic who combines the vision of the Yogi and the executive ability of the
commissar, the bow of <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span> and the grace of
Krishna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mystic experience is the common path of religious light. It is the steel frame
behind all types of religious structures. The skeleton is the same, the flesh
covering it varies in texture and the skin above the flesh varies in <span
class=SpellE>colour</span>. They express themselves in symbols. Some regard God
as a personality, others as spirit. The human mind resorts to symbols to
express its experience. Thomas Aquinas says that all language about God must
necessarily be analogical. Professor A. N. Whitehead writes: “Mankind, it seems,
has to find a symbol in order to express itself. Indeed expression itself is
symbolism…..Symbolism is no mere idle fancy or corrupt degeneration; it is
inherent in the very texture of human life. Language is itself symbolism.”
Symbols suggest but do not express. They provide support for experience which
lies beyond the power of words. <span class=SpellE>Berdyaer</span> writes in a
his book </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spirit and Reality: </span></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“We
cannot dispense with symbolism in language, and thought, but we can do without
it in the primary consciousness. In describing spiritual and mystical
experience man will have recourse to spatial symbols such as height and depth,
to symbols of this or another world. But in real spiritual experience these
disappear, there are not symbols of height and depth, of this or another world.
The primal creative act is realistic and non-symbolic; it is free from
conceptual elaboration.” Religious Experience is, in the words of <span
class=SpellE>Bergson</span>, “the <span class=SpellE>crystalization</span>
brought about by the scientific process of cooling what mysticism had poured
white hot into the soul of man. Through religion all men can get what a few
privileged souls possessed in full.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

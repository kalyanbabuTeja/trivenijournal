style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
attempt the history of Tamil literature briefly is not an easy task. For, Tamil
Nad has not yet produced any authoritative literary history. When the other
Dravidian languages like Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam have their literary
histories written by really eminent persons, Tamil has not had any writer of
accredited position in the world of scholarship to produce a connected
narrative of even the landmarks of Tamil literature. No doubt there have been
contributions on the topic in journals, and scrappy information containing,
very often, exploded theories regarding dates and events in the lives of poets
and writers. My attempt here will be mostly based upon what the two scholars,
Sri K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, Retired Professor of<i> </i>History, University of
Madras, and Rao Bahadur S. Vyapuri Pillai, Retired Reader in Tamil and the
Editor of<i> </i>the Tamil Lexicon, have given us as the results of their
research in the fields of South Indian history and Tamil literature respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
start with, what we now possess as the earliest literary writers belong to the
Sangam Age which may be roughly placed between the 2nd century and the 6th
century A.D. The Sangam literature may be divided into two parts, the early and
the later sangams. The early Sangam’s literary activity was mainly between the
2nd century and the 3rd century A.D. The later Sangam can be said to have
lasted from 450 to 600 A. D. Again the wrtings of the earlier and later periods
are said to have been compiled in the 5th and the 7th centuries respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
poems of the Sangam Age may be classified as what are known as lyrics in
English literature. Love, heroism etc., are some of the main themes which
inspired poets of those times to write with feeling. Apart from poetic quality,
their writings posses indications of the full life lived by the writers of the
poems. One significant feature of these poems is that they do not speak of
either God or of any higher power ruling our lives. Literary has divided the
content of the Sangam literature into two conventional divisions viz., ‘aham’
(interior) depicting subjective reactions to love and to amorous episode’s
between lovers; and ‘puram’ (exterior) depicting, objectively, activities like
battles and great occasions of valour. Within these two main heads there are
many sub-divisions which we need not go into in this brief survey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
poems, on a comprehensive view, may be said to preserve simplicity, clarity,
brevity and directness. We may even say that these qualities should have been
inborn and expressed with natural ease by the early Tamils. On the whole the
above characteristics have a bearing chiefly on the productivity of the early
Sangam Age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
later Sangam literature impresses us by the musical quality of some of the
lines composed as well as the perceptible tendency to invoke the grace of God.
For the purpose of illustrating the above remarks let us take the collection
called ‘Perumpanarrupadai’. We have here descriptions of the instrument ‘Yazh’
and get information as to how such musical instruments were<i> </i>employed as
accompaniments for music by Bards known as ‘Panar’. But it is not clear what
exact type of songs was sung by these wandering minstrels. Again with regard to
the tendency to invoke God’s grace in some of the later poems, we have in the
collections called ‘Parippadal’ references to ‘Murugavel.’ To prove the
influence of fresh ideas from outside, there are indications and signs of newer
forms taken by the new kind of verses. There is clear evidence of the influence
of music in a greater measure in the ‘Parippadal’ than in the ‘Kalittogai.’
There are delightful stanzas, remarkable for their comprehension of life as
well as naivete of expression, ascribed to the poetess Avvai. Tradition gives
room to the conjecture that there should have been more than one poetess of
that name. Anyhow one thing seems certain, that these also belonged to a period
before 650 A. D.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next great epoch in Tamil literature extending to A. D. 850 was marked by an
increasing inflow of Sanskrit influences as well as religious ideas consequent
upon the spread of Jainism in South India. From what was a mere invocation to
God, there slowly developed a great flood of Bhakti which in the later
centuries infused saints and poets with high spiritual longings seeking relief
in their outpourings of which we have some of the most exquisite lines in
poetry. With the spread of Jainism there was the reaction followed by a strong
current of Hindu religious feeling which too the turn of a great movement led
by the Saiva Nayanmars and the Vaishnava Alvars. Kings and chieftains began to
espouse seriously the various religious causes, and temples enshrining the God
and Goddesses of the various religious folds began to rise everywhere. At these
great temples the sacred and popular writers gathered, and most of their
didactical works, composed early in the period, were grouped together under the
title ‘Padinenkilkkanakku’ (the eighteen treatises in short metres).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
these perhaps the earliest and certainly the most famous is the ‘Kural’ of
Tiruvalluvar, dealing with the different aspirations of life like Dharma, Artha
and Kama. One finds, upon a thorough study of the ‘Kural’, how much the author
had been influenced by Manu, Kautilya and Vatsyayana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Bhakti movement resulted in the production of poems which are called by the
name of ‘Devaram’, ‘Tiruvasagam.’ ‘Nalayiram’ etc. They can be roughly placed
between 600 and 900 A.D. Much variety in metres and poetic forms came into
vogue only in this fruitful period. Smaller poems were also a feature of this
age; The ‘Devarams’ began to be sung by all devotees at temples, at religious
gatherings, and at congregations at temples. The result may be said to be a
widespread habit of singing hymns set to music. Moreover new types in literary
form began to emerge from out of the devotional writers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Jains also were writing books expatiating upon morals and ethics. They may be
said even to have had a parallel progress along with the Bhakti outpourings of
saints. The ‘Tirukkural’ of which mention has been made already, can be
ascribed to this period of literary productivity, though at the same time we
can place it as the earliest of this category of writings, even as it is also
the first to rank in quality among them. As a matter of fact, if in our ancient
works it is spoken of in the same breath of pride and reverence for qualities
of epigrammatic terseness and high-class finish in literary craftsmanship along
with the ‘Ramayana’ of Kamban, there is no tinge of exaggeration in such a
comparison. Again the ‘Tirukkural’ bears ample testimony to the high water-mark
of Tamil culture and civilisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
come next to the great work of ‘Tolkappiyam’ whose author was one belonging to
the Jaina religion. He may be placed after 150 A. D., owing to internal
evidences in the work itself, of his having received the benefit of Patanjali’s
commentary, called the ‘Mahabhashya’ upon Panini’s immortal treatise on
grammar. This book can be placed as the earliest among works dealing with Tamil
grammar and poetics. Moreover it can speak to the religious labours of some of
the early Jain writers to make the Tamil language living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Jain writers did not spare themselves in the
propagation of the ideas of their great Teachers or Tirthankaras. Their
enthusiasm began to evince itself in inventing fables and stories propagating
their ideas of religion. Their activity in the literary line can be said to
have flourished between 700 and 1000 A.D. Owing to the fact that there was
another later efflorescence in classical writings, these Jain writers may be
confined to the earlier classical age. One remarkable product of this period is
the book called ‘Sillappadiharam’ which has earned the tributes of not only
poets and writers of the past but also of one who till recently was with us and
wrote like an angel–the late Subrahmanya Bharati. This great work is supposed
to contain the elements of the drama, apart from the natural interest of the
plot as well as the poetic exuberance marking it. The author of this work,
Illango-Adigal, (the young princely-saint) is unsurpassed in his vivid
portraiture of character and fine metrical effects of composition. In spite of
the introduction of supernatural elements in the course of this poem, the human
episode narrated here is a moving one, told with all the power of conceit and
prodigality of description.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
‘Manimekalai’ (the jewel-belt) is a sister poem which can be said to belong to
the same period, though its quality as a poem of merit lacks both the art of
graphic description and character delineation. Further the Buddhistic religious
obsession betray in a long exposition of the fallacies in logic makes it
somewhat jejune. Still, as a narrative poem, its popularity is amply justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As this juncture the Hindu religious revival,
already indicated as having had its expression in a large volume of devotional
hymns, began to receive the attention of compilers of the 10th and early 11th
centuries. The Saiva canon ‘Tirumurai’ was started and the reign of Raja Raja
I, and the first seven books in it are taken up by the three foremost saints
Gnanasambandar, Appar and Sundaramurti. They are together termed as ‘Devaram’
or the Garland of God. The canon reached its final form in the middle of the
12th century when ‘Sekkilar’ ushered in his deservedly famous work called
‘Periapuranam’, containing material about the sixty-three Nayanmars or saints
of South India. Of the intervening books, Manikkavasagar’s ‘Tiruvasagam’ easily
takes the top rank, as the mystical and soulful utterance of a great saint
whose main preoccupation in life was service to God and humanity. The Vaishnava
devotees did not lag behind in the matter of their outpourings in strains of
melody and mysticism. For instance, of the twelve Alvars, Tirumangai and
Nammalvar themselves contributed over a thousand sacred verses each, and are
appreciated, the for<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>mer for his rare
diction and the latter for his reach and range of philosophical interpretations
of life. Periyalvar and his daughter </span>Andal as well as Kulasekhara, a
Chera king, were the other celebrated ones of the group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the period of religious revival in the fields of didactic and devotional songs
as well as the expression of the God-intoxicated soul in newer and newer
art-forms, there was another period presaging fresh achievements in classical
output between 1200 and 1400 A. D. No doubt there were many literary pieces
based upon the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the other Puranas. Still, it can
be said without any fear of contradiction that none of these writings can ever
equal or even approach the excellence of that masterpiece ‘Kambaramayana’.
Kamban’s great merit does not suffer by his being influenced by Sanskrit
culture. In fact his language gains rare richness in euphony by his employing
Sanskrit words appositely. Though in his style he conforms to the simplicity
and directness of the earlier masters of the Sangam age, he also maintains a
perfect conformity with the later classical writers by enlarging his repertoire
of felicitous diction from them. He employs a great variety of metres and
produces, out of the inexhaustible gold mine of Valmiki, newer and newer forms
in beauty of thought and character which have marked his individuality in an
immeasurable degree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimed as an eventful epoch in the history of Tamil literature. But before
that, one important work ‘Jivakachintamani’ of the Jain ascetic
Tiruttakkadevar, composed early in the 10th century, showed enormous
potentiality for absorbing Sanskrit originals of the late ninth century. But
for the indefatigable efforts of the late Dr. V. Swaminatha Aiyar the work
would not have seen the light of day in a properly edited form. There are
indications of great poetry in this work. Many philosophical treatises,
scholarly commentaries, Purana compilations and Prabandha collections appeared
only during this period. The creativity of Tamil writers is at a low ebb in

some of the famous Mutts and temples can be gratefully mentioned here for
having fostered Tamil learning and scholarship undiminished during this period.
The anthology ‘Purattirattu’, said to have been compiled about this period, is
a good collection of verses from various sources including Kamba-Ramayana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

those few taken from a work now lost, ‘Muttolayiram’ are really enjoyable for
both their natural grace of expression and highly-wrought poetic imagination.
They indicate by their style their debt to earlier writings. The themes are
often about love and the longings of lovers. No doubt generally in that period
real literary matter was not forthcoming. What little was produced betrayed
only poverty of imagination and paucity of inventive genius. But the
‘Kutralak-Kuravanji’ as well as the ‘Mukkudar-pallu’ are the two exceptions in
this otherwise barren period. The former is a temple-drama of exquisite
metrical composition and delineation of <i>rasas.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

the advent of Western contact, since 1600 A.D. creativity in Tamil literature,
along with every other indigenous art and craft, became neglected, though after
1800 the new spirit of the times gradually infused Tamil writers with a desire
to express themselves forcibly. The impact of science and scientific inventions
upon our civilisation prepared the way for a new culture, receiving its power
and vision from the mixture of cultures of the West and the East. One important
work called ‘Chaturaaharadi’ (quadruple dictionary) of father Beschi, a Jesuit
missionary working in the Tamil Nad, gave a scientific turn to the knowledge of
words in the language. Before we come to the modern age in Tamil literature,
one other name <i>viz</i>., that of Arunachalakkavirayar must be noted. His
‘Rama Natakam’ in colourful Tamil verses set to music, showed immense
possibilities for writers in Tamil to re-create literary forms out of old
themes, in spite of the contact with the West hindering original literary
writing. Mention must also be made of the Padams of Kavi-Kunjaram, dealing with
songs of love, truly portraying a high level of literary achievement and
musical quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

necessary backward glance at this stage, at our past literature before the dawn
of the 18th century, can sum up for us what exact shapes the trends of culture
in Tamil Nad assumed from time to time. In the beginning, life was steeped in
material comforts and worldly affairs. Then owing to the inflow of ideas reg</span><span

Becoming more prone to religious ideas born of the Vedic influences, the Tamils
also slowly devoted their attention to thoughts of the other world. This became
the precursor to the Bhakti movement which gradually engulfed them in a great
enthusiasm for mystic outpouring. The Bhakti cult gave room in the hearts of
the Tamils for a growing fondness for stories of wonder that grew up round the
lives of numerous saints and devotees, teeming with happenings and miracles
that are impossible to the modern mind. The fancy and desire for religious lore
got the hand soon and the consequence was a huge output in the realms of
philosophical interpretations and religious literature. The ability shown in
unravelling the subtle points of philosophy, encouraged them to more and more
advanced thinking in the realms of abstract philosophy. With the birth of great
intellects like Sankara and Ramanuja, the Tamils’ claim to superiority in
metaphysics and pure thought was founded on a sure basis. There was
nevertheless thereafter the starting of the downward curve, which expressed
itself in the slow disintegration as well as disenchantment of their ideas
regarding religion. For this reason also, literary works of this period showed
more and more attenuated imagination and poetic insight. But still there was the
compensation for it in the gradual spread of printing owing to our contact with
the West. English literature as well as other foreign </span><span

establishment of settled government under the British rule, and the spread of
printing at the beginning of the 19th century led to the development of a class
of persons educated on modern Western lines. Hence, the shaping of the literary
activity also began to partake of ideas from the West, especially from the
English literature. No doubt these factors equally influenced the rest of the
South Indian languages as well. Scholars in Tamil took to publication of the
classics in the form of printed books and this made it easy for more people to<i>

proper to single out the name without also referring to two other names,
Arumuga Navalar and Ramalinga Swamigal spoken of already. Navalar was a very
learned man, while Ramalinga Swami was also a justly famous poet. From the
‘Life of Minakshisundararn Pillai’ written by Dr. V. Swaminatha Aiyar, we are
able to form an idea of the well-merited recognition this scholar achieved in
the literary world by his numerous writings. Other names like Damodaram Pillai
and Kanakasabai Pillai easily come to our recollection. Damodaram Pillai was a
native of Ceylon having been born in Jaffna. Though he was attached to English
literature from the beginning on account of his having graduated from the
Madras University as a Bachelor of<i> </i>Arts, still his love of Tamil and the
immense literature enshrined in it kept him steadily working for the mother
tongue. He edited many books in a very commendable manner and therefore earned
the gratitude of scholars working in the field of Tamil language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mayavaram, Poondi Ranganatha Mudaliar, and Rajam Iyer, author of the famous

Modern writers have largely inherited their directness of language and forceful
descriptive powers from this literary star of the first magnitude. We all know
how much the national movement and the impact of world affairs on our politics
gave rise to new experiments in poetry. Bharati was the leader of the renascent
thought in Tamil Nad. His influence, even after three decades of his death, is
still fresh. His songs, stirring as they do the national spirit in us, are not
devoid of fine poetic merit. But before he could display that maturity of
thought and power of vision, which would have ranked him with poets of the
universal order, he passed away. He was about forty years of age when he died.

become more and more the medium of instruction in both school and college; and
the politician and public speaker have combined together to enlighten vast
audiences by speaking only in Tamil. Journals containing all the features of
modern journalistic flair, have done not a little to improve facility of
expression of even the most difficult ideas in Tamil. Short stories in plenty,
humorous essays and skits, not to speak of one-act plays and dialogues, are
filling the pages of Tamil journals in an increasing measure. Some of our short

pledged to secure for Tamil a high place in the national consciousness and the
recent starting of a Tamil Encyclopedia augurs well in that direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

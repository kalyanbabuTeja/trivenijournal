remembered those old days much more than Vasantrao. But he wished to forget
them. He had spent the last two years fighting with the memories of those days.
He often thought he had buried them. But they sprang up in his mind again, and
again, sometimes with a reason, but often unreasonably. And when the memories
came crowding upon him, he was so distressed that he almost lost his mind. He
walked through the streets, unaware of the crowd and the traffic. Today, for
instance, he had noticed a huge poster on a high wall, and as he looked at the
picture of a young woman with a child in her arms, old memories came rushing in
his mind–memories of two years ago...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He had seen his daughter Sulochana painted on a big
poster in a riot of colours, on this very wall, and in this very square. The
poster had stood there for weeks after weeks, only the slips, which the numbers
of each new week were printed in red, being taken off and pasted. How his heart
had swelled with pride to know that Sulochana’s very first picture had hit a
high mark...His wife had disapproved of Sulochana working in a film. Friends
and well-wishers had warned him against making his daughter a film actress. He
too had known the dangers and the pit-falls of a screen career. But he had
believed that a woman could avoid them by the integrity and purity of her own
character, and attain success by dint of talent and industry. He had inwardly
feared if his gamble would go wrong. But Sulochana had done well indeed. He had
been proved right. The big poster in the square was an emblem of Sulochana’s
triumph, which was in a way his own triumph.</p>

this is only the beginning, he used to tell himself whenever he halted in the
square to have a look at Sulochana’s poster. There would come even greater
successes, he thought. Sulochana would become a more accomplished<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>singer and dancer. She was no longer the
daughter of a middle-class father. She was now a highly paid actress. She could
afford to spend any amount of money and become a great artist. But...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pictures! The golden key to success! I’ve got hold of the best music director

Sulochana had fallen in love with a dancer, called Sekharan, and wanted to
marry him. Keshavrao tried to bring her to her senses, speaking to her in
affectionate words, asking her to think of her career, warning her not to be
led away by foolish passion. He also talked to Sekharan, scolding him, and
asking him to leave Sulochana alone. But the fellow pretended to be innocent
and helpless. “Why do you suppose that I’m urging Sulochana to worry me? It is
she who is urging me. ‘You Should talk to her, not to me.” Then Keshavrao
scolded Sulochana. He had expected her to listen to him submissively. But he
discovered that a young girl ceases to be meek when she loses her head over a
lover. Instead of being cowed down by his show of anger, she went into a fit of
anger herself. She returned his hot words with hot words. “Is this Sulochana?”
Keshavrao could not help wondering, “and is she speaking to me, her father? No!
This is not Sulochana, but some mad girl possessed by the devil!” It was no use

the third day after this she disappeared. God alone knew where she had run away
with Sekharan…..Keshavrao had no news of her except a few bits. She had gone
about with Sekharan from place to place, giving dancing concerts. She had a
child–a boy. After that Sekharan had deserted her. But she had not returned
home. Her whereabouts were unknown. There were rumours, of course. But they
were dim. Keshavrao sometimes thought of tracing her exact address and asking
her to come back. But his wish dried up whenever he looked at the palm of his
right hand. It was with this hand that he had slapped her! “I shed all
affection as a tree drops its leaves in winter,” he thought. “My heart is now
like the leafless tree. And what I did was right. She’s as good as dead for me.
I don’t care where she is. Let her go away.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

leaves fell from the trees in tremulous showers, and birds deserted the
leafless boughs. It seemed as though the trees had become leafless for ever,

<h2>Although we know that Khrushchev, Nikita <span class=SpellE>Sergeyevich</span>,
was born on April 17, 1894, in a mine-worker’s family in the Village of <span
class=SpellE>Kalinovka</span> in the <span class=SpellE>Kursk</span> province
and that he worked, when he was only a child, as a herdsman and then as a metal
worker in the factories and mines of the <span class=SpellE>Donbass</span>, our
knowledge of the details about his family background, childhood and early youth
is all still in a state of flux. Contrary to the position in the rest of the
world, in the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> the future is
certain, shaped by plans and governed by “inevitable” laws of development,
while the past is most uncertain. </h2>

task of the biographers of Soviet leaders is often similar in a way to that of
archaeological researchers. Soviet public life is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>absolutely
<span class=SpellE>depersonalised</span> in the sense that the private life of
public figures is taboo. According to Marxist principles subjective and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>personal
<span class=GramE>aspects</span> are of no consequence. None of Stalin’s
marriages, for instance, were ever reported in the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place>. The Soviet press and radio never mention the family life,
hobbies and idiosyncrasies of public figures. Until Khrushchev’s visit to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
serious students of Soviet affairs refrained from writing anything definitive
about his marriages and his children. On the eve of his departure, the foreign
journalists in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
reported that he was married for the first time in 1920, 1921, <span
class=GramE>1922</span> and for the second time in 1938. On September, 1959, in
Washington Mme Nina <span class=SpellE>Petrovna</span> <span class=SpellE>Khrushcheva</span>
gave a press conference and in a revolutionary departure from Soviet practice,
revealed that Khrushchev’s first wife died “during the famine,” and that she
herself married him in 1924, when his two children by his first wife were six
and eight years old. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> public figures exist only in
their official political capacities. The provincial newspapers also naturally
respect this rule. The local party secretary exists on their pages as party
secretary and nothing else. One could say that the function is everything and
the human being behind the function is nothing–as far as the public eye is
concerned. The biographer has to read hundreds or thousands of newspaper
articles, conference reports, speeches and interviews in order to establish a
few “personal and private facts” which could be obtained in five minutes about
the public figures of the outside world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this strangely <span class=SpellE>depersonalised</span> and <span class=SpellE>dehumanised</span>
world men start to be visible when, and as far as, they act out their public
functions. Hence the Khrushchev-story has to begin with his “Party-birth”, with
the time when he was chosen to become a member of Stalin’s apparatus. From then
on there is increasingly more circumstantial material, and later more and more
direct evidence, for tracing the development of this almost anthropologically
different human species–the Communist <i>apparatchik. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Khrushchev’s rise in the hierarchy had been
uncommonly, unbelievably swift. He was then forty years old but as to the
all-important “Party-age” he was much younger. He had joined the party only in
1918, when he was twenty-four, and had stepped on to the lowest rung of the
hierarchical ladder of the party apparatus as late as 1925, when thirty-one
years old. In 1934 he reached the uppermost region of Soviet power by becoming
first secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee. On the anniversary of the
revolution he stood there on the top of the Lenin Mausoleum in <st1:place
w:st="on">Red Square</st1:place>, among the “great leaders” of the party and
Government headed by Stalin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Khrushchev represented a new type among the Soviet
leaders. He was entirely a product of Stalin’s apparatus. Although only four
years younger than Molotov and roughly of the same generation as many of the
“old” Bolsheviks who took part in the <span class=SpellE>conspiratory</span>
struggles before the revolution, Khrushchev was, not one of the fathers but, a
child of the Bolshevik revolution. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The fathers of the revolution, Lenin, Trotsky, <span
class=SpellE>Bukharin</span> and the others, were European revolutionary
intellectuals, shaped by the revolutionary heritage of the nineteenth century.
They are fully comprehensible even to people unfamiliar with the Soviet system.
Stalin’s personality was already shaped partly by the party monolith created by
Lenin and perfected by <span class=GramE>himself</span>. Yet large regions of
Stalin’s personality are immediately comprehensible to the external world.
Khrushchev, who was a semi-literate peasant worker and an adult when he joined
the party, had nothing of intellectual-emotional background of the fathers of
the revolution. He learnt to think from the party and knew no other system than
the Soviet one. His personality is just as enigmatic as the Soviet world.
Khrushchev, the functionary, grew up together with the party apparatus. His
personality is only comprehensible through the story of his incredibly
dangerous climb up the ladder of Communist hierarchy. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Khrushchev, as a member of the Communist Party, did
not belong to the class of intellectuals who had the interest and the
will-power to go on reading and learning. He was certainly not of this type.
The cultured intellectual, after embracing Marxism, had to relinquish, often
through a very painful process, his old habit of thinking, discussing and
arguing. The possibility that the opponent of Marxism can be right in the least
little detail is firmly excluded. A Marxist must be immune to outside argument.
Marxism, as the supreme science of human society, and Marxist dialectics, the
method for every science, are infallible. And <span class=SpellE>Krushchev</span>,
an uneducated and a roughly-going man, had no intellectual habits to give up.
His complete acceptance of Marxist theory was not hindered by a previous
cultural background. He knew no science, no other system of thought, no other
philosophy, to other economic theory but the Marxist one. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Marxists whom Khrushchev met were immensely sure
of themselves. They could, according to his impression, calmly and simply
refute and annihilate any counter-arguments. For a really good Marxist the
world with all its puzzles is not a terribly complicated, incalculable and
unknowable thing, but something easy to understand and explain. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Thoughts are simple tools if you are taught how to
use them. And if you have learnt thinking (that is: Marxism), then it is of
little importance how cultured you are. Marxism teaches you what makes the
human world and the world of nature tick. Marxism gives the simple worker
immense superiority over the confused intellectuals, over the aristocrats and
millionaires of the mind. The revolution gives all this intellectual
superiority to the workers. Lenin’s remark that Marxist theory is a terribly
strong weapon is quite correct. </p>

activity is governed by scientific laws. These are like the laws ordered by the
Tsar or by the police except that they are stronger laws, because no human

was to learn words and sentences explaining the scientific laws, by heart. He
was to learn by heart: “It is not the consciousness of men that determines
their being, but on the contrary, their social being that determines their
consciousness.” He was also to cram: “The activity of the Bolshevik Party must
not be based on the good wishes of ‘outstanding individuals’, not on the
dictates of ‘reason’, ‘universal morals’ etc., but on the </span><span

one of the sensations of this period of the <span class=GramE>great war</span>.

Khrushchev had a chance to blacken his enemies as Stalinist and award the halo

Columbia Broadcasting System on June 2, 1957, stated: “With regard to the
ideology of capitalist and socialist countries, we have never concealed that
there will be a struggle in this field, an ideological struggle……Some people
reproach me for allegedly changing my point of view, since I once said that if

on the real situation of the present world and not on dogmatic <span

He fully understands that nuclear warfare by its very nature is exceedingly
dangerous, particularly for dictatorships. If A– or H– bombs were dropped on
the principal cities of the Soviet and Satellite Empire, thereby cutting off or
annihilating central direction of the organs of repression, MVD, KGB, police,
etc., popular revolts could break out everywhere. All his experience since
Stalin’s death has shown to Khrushchev and the apparatus that populations,
armies, students, workers, even communists “are not to be trusted”. Wherever
the system of oppression appeared to be weakened, small and large-scale revolts
followed. The general disorder and <span class=SpellE>disorganisation</span>
following a nuclear attack would not turn the British or American population
against their regimes. “Nuclear war would entail for the free world many
dangers, but not the danger of revolts again the British or American “systems”.
In Soviet Russia the regime itself would be in the greatest of dangers.” A
regime, which in the last analysis depends on the party apparatus (less than
half a per cent of the population) and its secret police–cannot risk breaks in
the “monolithic unity” and strength of the entire machinery of oppression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the USSR. Rebutting the view that the recent events in the Caribbean were a

individualism; belief in the basic human rights; belief in absolute moral
principles; the right to strike, the right to disagree; the non-acceptance of
an exclusive political dogma; and a non-militarized society. And his socialism
comprises, not only the Marxian values like economic equality, democratic and
free society, and dignity of human <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, but it
also maintains the democratic values such as the freedom of expression, the
right to differ, and faith in basic human rights, and absolute moral

values have been adopted by the Western Democracies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his way to the top, he struggles now with tremendous problems. Dogma-bound, he
is emotionally guided by the petrifaction of Marx’s genuine anger at the social

collective self- hypnosis of communist leaders, seek to justify tyranny and
hatred of freedom and individualism by peopling the free world with the ghosts
of bygone ages. His peasant common sense and pragmatism pull him towards

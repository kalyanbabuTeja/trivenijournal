style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Forty years back, nationalist political agitation
in Bengal started over the issue of partitioning the Province, and brought in
its train nationalist awakening in Bengal and in India. At that time nationalist
India was against partition which was sought to be imposed by the alien ruler.
Nationalism fought over the issue and won. Partition was rescinded–“a settled
fact was unsettled.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Today–forty years after–nationalism has just
emerged triumphantly from a battle, against heavy odds, for effecting the
partition of Bengal. All the stalwarts of the Indian National Congress,
Bengalees as well as non-Bengalees, this time vigorously fought against the
idea of an undivided Bengal, unlike forty years back when they fought for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>How does one explain this anomaly? All the
arguments that were then used against partition could now be used against it
with equal force,–why not? The Muslim Leaguer whose interest it was now, before
anybody else’s, to advocate unity could very well repeat the arguments of the
1905 anti-partitionist. Yet the lineal descendant, as it were, of that
anti-partitionist was now vigorously opposing all those arguments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>May we not then conclude that the ‘unity of Bengal’
has no absolute sanctity about it? It is the circumstances in which partition
was once resisted and was later favoured, that really matter and not the
spirituality of Bengali unity. Unity of Bengal, geographical, racial or
otherwise has no special sanctity of its own. The real issue lay deeper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In 1905 those who resisted partition of Bengal did
so because, by its means, the alien ruler sought to nurture a privileged child
and carve out an area for its special preserve, while proportionately weakening
its opponent by reducing and restricting its field for pasturage. Nationalism
realised this and rightly resisted it. Our alien ruler had to retrace his steps
in order to come to terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But what nationalism failed to realise then, and
perhaps realises now, is that what the alien ruler failed to achieve in one way
he achieved in another. True, in 1911 the King of England came and rescinded
the geographical partitioning of Bengal, but the community-wise partitioning,
for what else is the meaning of separate representation which was introduced as
early as 1909,–remained where it was. Nationalism fought stoutly against
geographical partitioning, but failed to fight with equal determination against
community-wise partitioning. Anti-partitionists were not fully so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Nationalism swears by the name of democracy. I have
thought and thought but could by no means reconcile this religio-communal
discrimination in political and constitutional arrangements with the democratic
principle. To my mind, the two are irreconcilable. Yet the Congress ‘nationalist’
did not seem to hold the same view then, nor does he seem to do so now. The
result is that Congress ‘nationalism’ was, from its very infancy, been infected
with a communal virus. That communal virus might not have appeared to be so
harmful at that early stage, but it has now revealed itself in its true colours
and has caused an abnormal rise of temperature in the body politic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“To protect a minority,” “to promote the welfare of
a backward community”–these are seemingly beautiful phrases and now almost
common-place axioms. But anybody who once stopped to enquire into the meaning
and assess the worth of these principles could not fail to find out their
worthlessness. What is “protecting a minority”? If by a minority you mean a
religious community, it is enough protection to guarantee unrestricted
observance of its religious practices. In order to protect it, it is quite
uncalled for to allot seats, and a disproportionate number of seats, in the
legislature to its members; such a course is not only uncalled for, it is
positively harmful to the interests of another community and is, therefore,
inimical to democracy. “To ameliorate the condition of a backward community,”
is a dubious proposition. What is a ‘backward’ community? The Muslims of India,
it is said, are or were fifty years back, a backward community. But there are
Muslims quite as rich as the richest Hindu. All Muslims are not in the same
condition. Neither are all Hindus, or Christians, or Buddhists, or Jains, or
Sikhs. If the intention is to improve the lot of the poor and the un- educated,
it is proper not to speak in terms of communities at all. If you want to
promote the education and economic welfare of the poor, you must do so
irrespective of community. If you bring in the question of communities, you are
at once favouring a member of one religious community and discriminating
against members of other communities and ignoring the claims of poverty and
illiteracy. Supposing that 95 per cent of the Muslims are un- educated while of
the Hindus only 85 per cent are so, it is not justifiable to help with State
funds the education of a Muslim boy while a Hindu boy who is worse off is
neglected. It is poor consolation to the 90 per cent of poorer Muslims that
their well-to-do co-religionist gets a lucrative government job or a profitable
government contract in preference to a Hindi of the same status. And this
depriving the well to-do Hindu would also matter little to the poor Hindu whose
problem is somehow to get two square meals in a day. “To raise a backward
community,” in this particular sense, is, therefore, a grossly unjust and
anomalous proposition. It is inimical to democracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>What the British Government really intended by
‘protecting a minority’ was to give special privilege to the members of a
particular religious community and thus create a ‘native’ class interested in
the continuation of alien rule. The policy of favouring the Muslims in the
matter of seats in the legislature, jobs in the administration, educational
grants and even trade facilities is, in its essence, a re-introduction of
Aurangzeb’s Jezya (Poll-tax on non-Muhammadans). Strangely enough, the new
Jezya of the twentieth century was introduced and administered not by a
fanatical Sunni emperor but by an alien ‘infidel’ ruler, himself a ‘Zimmi’
(unbeliever) in Islamic nomenclature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The most unfortunate part of it was that Congress
nationalism in India was taken in by this seemingly pious phraseology of
“protection of a minority” and “backward community”. In the philosophy of modern
democracy, only citizenship of a State is recognised and membership of a
religious community is not a factor to be counted. This is plain enough. Yet
the Congress nationalist was not aware of this. The anti-partitionist of 1905
opposed geographical partitioning but not community-wise partitioning in civic,
political and constitutional arrangements. This policy of community-wise
partitioning could thus be easily pursued by the British Government in India to
their incalculable advantage. In 1905 Curzon wanted only East Bengal to be
partitioned off and made into a special preserve of the privileged Muslim
gentry, and was opposed. Bengal remained undivided. But by 1937, because of
community-wise partitioning: in the body politic and special weightage granted
to the Muslim gentry (I should not say community), the whole of Bengal was won
over by Curzon’s successor for a special preserve of his “favourite wife”. The
last decade, particularly the last few years or months, brought home to
nationalism the consequences of this development, and nationalism at last
became very bitter about it. Nationalism at last demanded partition; in other
words, it demanded at least West Bengal to be partitioned off and delivered
from the grip of this privileged Muslim gentry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The essence of the matter was, therefore, that
whether Bengal should be administered from one centre or two was a matter of
little consequence, and the partition question would not have assumed the
importance it did, if Bengal’s body politic had not been infected with the
communal virus. It is this latter, which was all-important. In political and
constitutional arrangements, religio-communal considerations should have no
place. In order not to appear ‘communalistic’ Congress nationalism has time and
again conceded to Muslim communalism. True democratic nationalism has never
been planted on the Indian soil, thanks to the dubious game of the British.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I have often wondered why it should be a matter of
dispute whether a Province should be administered from one centre or two. It
was so because there was a stake somewhere. It was this stake that mattered. If
a truly democratic constitution had been planted in Bengal, it would have been
a matter of administrative importance only whether Bengal was one or two. Since
no such truly democratic constitution was in operation or in vision, the
partition question became a political, and not simply an administrative, bone
of contention. A truly democratic and powerful nationalistic movement, which
will not give any quarter to communal separatism, should evolve in this land of
our birth. In the absence of such a development, the prospect is very dark
indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

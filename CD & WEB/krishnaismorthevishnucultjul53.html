is the most important god in the Pantheon of popular Hinduism. He is also the
major source of inspiration in Indian literatures. Numberless epics (<i>Puranas</i>)
have been written in Sanskrit and other Indian languages to propagate the power
and benevolence of this god. In addition to these great literary adventures,
there are millions of little devotional songs and lyrics in all these languages
dedicated to this deity and daily sung and recited by vast masses of people.

has the glory of being the chief source of the modern Science of Comparative
Religion as weft as comparative linguistic, philosophical and mythological
studies. Here we see the various strata of human spiritual evolution, the steps
in man’s quest of metaphysical, spiritual and ethical verities revealed in
literatures of superb beauty and of great historical value. We see in them how
the Aryan Man progressed gradually from the worship of the phenomenon to
conceiving the Noumenon behind, from the many gods to the One Great behind them
all, and then later in the Upanishads from the form to the formless and from
the external to the Reality that is inside us as well as outside. And then came
great Gautama, the Buddha, who turned man’s attention for the first time in
human history from the futilities of mere external rites to the purity of our
minds and to good, unselfish conduct as the only form of worship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But we find to our great astonishment that the next
picture after this is the vast Hindu Pantheon, full of gods and goddesses. This
anti-climax in the history of religious practices and speculations in India
cannot be easily explained. These Vishnus, Sivas, Ganeshas and Kalis are
unknown in the Vedas, the very fountainhead of the Sanatana or eternal
religion. With the emergence of these multifarious divinities in the racial
mind of India, we observe two striking departures from indigenous spiritual
currents. One was the anthropomorphic conception of God or gods, the other, the
hypothesis of Grace resulting in the now universal Bhakti <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>cult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
is the one country in the world which has ever conceived of the Divine Power as
Law or as Creative Principle. In other religions God is a magnified human
being. He sits somewhere high above and commands, rewards and punishes. His
habitat is the promised Paradise where only those who have obeyed Him or His
agents are permitted to enter and enjoy the glorified earthly pleasures as well
as His companionship. The original Indo-Aryan theistic speculations were vastly
superior to such conceptions of God where He is a magnified, autocratic tribal
leader. Even in the dimly distant Vedic times, the Indian never worshipped
stocks and stones; in fact he did not ‘worship’ any thing, in the popular
acceptation of the term. The ‘yagna’ of the Vedic Indian was a sort of harvest
festival, a thanksgiving ceremony for the gifts of Heaven, a sharing of the
joys of earth with the Bright Ones. The Vedic hymns are poetic reactions to the
marvels of Nature rather than cringing appeals to any outside Authority for
Grace, favour and redemption. That was a very natural religion, considering the
pastoral background of the Vedic Indo-Aryan. But, through centuries of
intellectual progress, the Indo-Aryan gradually grew out of that primitive
level and came to the brilliant and revolutionary speculations of the Vedanta
and Buddhism, which astonishingly anticipate the modern theories of science
regarding Reality, Creation, Matter and Energy. The Indian had at last come to
the conclusion that God is nothing but Energy which perpetually moves on in
vast, unending cycles of creation, sustenance and destruction. The Indo-Aryan
Seers never so narrowed their speculations as to limit their hypotheses only to
Homo Sapiens and shape out a God that was just a glorified chief or king. In
all their speculations there was no place for<i> </i>Grace–the idea of a kind,
benevolent God bestowing boons in answer to prayers or of his own accord. If
God is Law, then things like Prayer and Grace become irrelevant and illogical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
these conceptions of a human God and of Grace stand pre-eminently symbolised in
Krishna and his cult. His career is a succession of miracles which provide
little norm to be followed<i> </i>in our day to day life. But he is deified in
the mass mind in India as the grand Philosopher, as he reveals himself in the
Bhagavata and the Bhagavad-Gita. That philosophy is largely one of Grace. But
as in other religions where this hypothesis of Grace is preached, here too
Krishna proclaims his divinity and asks for devotion to himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Krishna
is believed to be an Avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, by far the most dominant
deity of the Hindu Pantheon. Indologists have traced this God Vishnu to the
Sun-God of the Vedas. Etymologically, Vishnu is ‘one that Covers or spreads
over all.’ This is a most apt expression in respect of the Sun whose rays cover
both earth and heaven in their entirety. And from the natural phenomenon of the
Sun drawing water vapours from the earth, the idea of Krishna drawing sixteen
thousand Gopis for sport could be an explicable allegory. The combination of
the dark Krishna with the fair Radha might have been imagined out of Nature’s
daily worked masterpiece of the golden Dawn spreading herself against the
dark-grey morning sky. And the other natural phenomenon of the Sun sending back
the vapours as the life-giving rain might be the origin of the hypothesis of
Grace in answer to prayers or devotion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Krishna-legend could thus be explained by reference to the Sun and its actions
and influences. Perhaps it is merely an allegory. The emergence of a human God,
demanding devotion and promising Grace, in the religious world of India round
about the 9th or 10th century still remains mysterious, and has naturally
invited the tendentious suggestions from non-Hindu scholars of the silent
workings of Christianity or Islam or Hinduism. And parallelisms between
Krishnaism and Christianity are so many as to make one naturally suspect that
either the Bhagavata or the Gospels have plagiarised from the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the very unique feature of the Vaishnavic concept of Divinity disproves any
foreign influence on the Krishna or Vishnu cults. The plagiarism might have
occurred the other way round.) In no other religion is God conceived as a
blissful pair of cosmic lovers. That the Hindu also knows and believes in Divinity
as One, only prejudiced critics will dare deny. But the monotheists forget the
simple fact that Divinity can be and is, as a matter of fact, manifested as
Many. And as an allegory of the cosmic law of pairs of elemental opposites of
which this creation is made, this Hindu conception of Divinity as the
combination of the male and female energies of Nature, of the positive and
negative forces in matter, looks much more scientific and realistic than either
the dogmatically metaphysical conception of God as One, or the happy but
illogical notion of that One holding a Court somewhere up in the skies and,
like a capricious king, rewarding his praise-singers and punishing the rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
romantic concept of Divinity in cosmic wedlock is uniquely Indian and originated
on this soil. I believe, from the brilliant speculations of Kapila who in his
Sankhya philosophy ignores a personal creator and propounds, instead, the
theory of Purusha and Prakriti as the eternally co-eval twin origins of this
universe. Sankhya, undoubtedly, is the earliest, and yet a most daring, system
of thought in the entire history of mankind. It has had a most profound
influence on all subsequent Brahmanical and Buddhist religious thought. The
concept of Divinity as a pair of male and female that we meet with in
Vaishnavism, Saivism, and also in the later developments of Mahayana Buddhism,
is perhaps nothing but the shadow of that distant speculative discovery of
Kapila,–the couple of Purusha and Prakriti as the eternal originators of the
universe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
I believe, Krishnaism or the Cult of Krishna, or the Cult of Vishnu in general,
so deeply eastablished and so widely spread in Indian thought, is an
imaginative mixture of the Solar allegory and the Sankhya speculations. It has
had a historic growth. There is no eternality about it. It has come out of some
highly poetic mind and is a very interesting spiritual allegory. In the
Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna is supposed to be the incarnate World-soul. Arjuna’s
questionings certainly do not cover all the problems that trouble a thinking
man, nor do Krishna’s answers solve them completely. The Gita is nevertheless a
great Book. It contains some profound truths. In my humble reading of it, I
find that the Book comprises two distinct parts, one thoroughly rational and
the other highly emotional. And while profound truths flash out like priceless
gems, their qualities are sadly compromised by the emotional portions,–those
where the teacher Krishna preaches to and expects his disciples to worship and
pray to him to get his Grace. In the rational part of the Gita, God is indeed
Law and questions of Worship and prayer are irrelevant. It is in the emotional
part that Law deteriorates into a human person preaching worship and grace and
redemption. The two parts contradict each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
essence of the Gita is the clarion call for vigorous though detached Action.
Vishnu is essentially a dynamic deity. Each of his Avataras is a story of
mighty actions, resulting in the progress of humanity through the overthrowing
of the evil forces. This also was the message of Lord Buddha who preached only<i>
</i>the Law, and obedience to it through inner goodness and outer compassion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
would like that the citizens of free and republican India should now look at
their old gods with new eyes. Our ancestors discovered the most scientific and
rational concepts about Divinity and Religion. Theirs was no organised Church,
no departmentalisation or commercialisation of God. To them religion was the
Way of life. That Way was the way of rational and dynamic action, of faith in
man’s own endeavour, in the ultimate prosperity of this earth of ours. There is
no point in worshipping and hoping for Grace from gods innumerable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me Krishnaism or the cult of Vishnu, therefore, is not the worship of an imaginary

virtues that the Teacher of that name has preached, and looking upon his story
as a combination of a poetic allegory of Nature and of metaphysical
speculations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

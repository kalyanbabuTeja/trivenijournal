<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The establishment of the
Communist regime in China, and the news that Russia is manufacturing large
numbers of atom bombs and that the United States has begun the manufacture of
the Hydrogen bomb, are the outstanding events of the quarter. The world
situation has consequently become much more critical now than what it was three
or four months ago. The gulf separating the Soviet from the United States has
become wider. Almost every country is faced with new problems of security and
defence. Fear has taken a deeper root in the minds of men and the feeling of
uncertainty is more widespread.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The establishment of the
Communist regime in China is perhaps a much more epoch-making event than even the
Bolshevik revolution in Soviet Russia in 1917. This is due to the fact that
China has a population of more than four hundred millions. Her natural resources
are vast and they have not been so far exploited. She possesses a lengthy coast
line and numerous sea-ports and harbours. These by themselves would not have
had any significance, for, these advantages China possessed at all times. There
is, however, one important feature in the new situation which is sure to affect
the future of the World. It is the treaty of friendship that the Communist
government of China has concluded with Soviet. Russia. At one time it was thought
that no such alliance would be possible as the Chinese are intensely nationalist
and bitterly hate all outsiders. It was even prophesied that the dictator of
China would become another Tito and follow a line of policy quite independent
of Soviet Russia. But these anticipations and prophesies have been proved to be
false. A thirty years treaty is now concluded between the two leading Communist
states. It provides for mutual military and other support and assistance in the
event of either party being attacked by Japan or States in alliance with it. In
the context of world politics today, America is the most important of these
States. In return for this promise of Chinese support Russia has agreed to give
up her control over the Manchurian railway and over Port Arthur and Port Dalny
within two years, to return to China the Japanese economic assets and lend her
about 300 million dollars to buy capital goods. The economic aid is not much
but all these terms have a political and prestige value of a substantial
character. In her turn China has recognised the independence of outer Mongolia.
The real importance of the treaty lies not so much in these specific terms as
in the possibilities which lie latent in it, of one of the most extensive
ideological empires coming into existence and leading to unprecedented external
wars and internal revolutions. The treaty is a great diplomatic triumph for
Russia. In the cold war which she has been waging with the United States this
is a decisive victory. She has secured two special advantages as a consequence
of this. The man-power of China is now at her disposal. Millions of Chinese can
now be taken to Russia to work in factories and agricultural farms, and in transport
industries. And Chinese labour is proverbially cheap. In addition to this she
will have five to ten million Chinese soldiers ready to fight her battles in
the Far East while she is busy conquering Western Europe in any future war. This
is a distinct military advantage. Besides this there <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>is the whole coast of China. For the last two hundred and fifty years
Russia has been in search of ice-free ports which would give her access to all
the oceans. Now that China has become her ally, her objective is gained. For a
long time to come the alliance between Russia and China is bound to be an
alliance between unequal partners. China has to depend on Russia for technical
equipment and skill. Her economy will have to be complementary to that of Russia
and the latter can, therefore, be sure of obtaining naval supremacy in the Western
Pacific. One should not forget in this connection that all this area from the Baltic
to the Pacific is one single land mass within which armies can move freely. It
is said that the United States invested two billion dollars with a view to
bolster up Chiang-Kai-Shek and strengthen her influence over China. All this
has been wasted. And Russia has been able to secure her triumph without
expending anything, either in the shape of men or of materials. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This treaty is of great
significance from another standpoint also. Communism is the most militant force
in the world today, and Soviet Russia is as enthusiastic in spreading it over
the whole world as the French revolutionaries of the late eighteenth century
were in spreading their doctrines of liberty, equality and fraternity. It was
on the basis of these slogans that Napolean conquered nearly the whole of Europe
and this is just what Stalin is attempting to do at present. The only difference
is that while Napoleon’s ambition was restricted to Europe and certain portions
of Asia and Africa, it is the objective of Stalin to conquer the whole world.
There were masses of people in European countries who welcomed Napoleon as the
messenger of liberty and equality. The same is what is taking place in several
parts of the world. And in this process of world conquest for Communism, Russia
is now sure of getting the active help of China. This help is invaluable to her
in the immediate future as it would enable her to dominate the whole of
South-East Asia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All the world is now
focussing its attention on the countries in this region–on Indonesia, Siam,
Malaya and Burma. This is an area where the masses of people suffer from acute
poverty. Their standard of life is low. But this had not been their lot at all
times. They remember that in an earlier age they were highly prosperous and
that it is only with the coming of the Europeans in the sixteenth century that all
their prosperity was lost. To them Communism makes a powerful emotional appeal.
Any attempt, therefore, on the part of the new Chinese government, now under
the influence of Soviet Russia to extend Communism into these countries is sure
to receive a welcome at the hands of the people. Besides this it has to be
noted that in very many of these countries–especially Siam and Malaya–there is
a large Chinese population. Much of the trade and business is in their hands.
Though they have been residents of these countries for several generations,
they continue to look upon China as their Fatherland they are naturally
interested in seeing that these countries are brought into the sphere of
Sino-Soviet influence. Most of the communist cells in this area are dominated
by the Chinese and this makes them all the more dangerous. One should also
remember that in this part of the world the people are carrying on a struggle
for national freedom against European Colonial powers like France, Britain and
Holland. The Chinese government will take advantage of this and intervene–if it
wants to intervene–as a liberator of dependent people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The first step in this direction
was taken when Soviet Russia, China and the Communist States of Central and
Eastern Europe recognized recently the government of Ho-Chi-Minh in Vietnam in opposition
to that of the ex-emperor Bao-dai who has been set up by the French. Chinese
military help to Ho-Chi Minh is sure to intensify the civil war in Indo-China.
The Russians do not seem to mind this. It is just what they want. This is the
reason why they paid no heed whatever to the French protests in the matter of
recognition, even though France and Russia have a treaty of alliance between
them. As a reply to Soviet recognition of Ho-Chi-Minh, Britain and the United States
have recognised the government of Bao-dai. There has been a conference at
Bangkok, the capital of Siam, of all the diplomats of the United States in
South-East Asia under the direction of Dr. Jessup, the personal envoy of President
Truman–a conference at which there was a stock-taking of the international
situation in this part of the world. From the various statements made by Dr.
Jessup and also by President Truman and Dean Acheson, there appears to be a
re-orientation in the foreign policy of the United States. There is now a talk
of concentrating the American fleet in the Asiatic side of the Pacific. The
United States is also more favourably disposed towards extending economic as
well as military aid to the non-Communist governments in South-East Asia,
although one can see that the American statesmen have not finally and
completely made up their mind in this matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those who have been
observing the treads of American foreign policy have noted that this is the one
serious defect with that policy. Her authoritative spokesmen do not seem to know
their own mind. They speak with more than one voice. They look like novices in
the art of diplomacy. Outsiders find it hard to know exactly what they propose
to do. Unless they abandon this attitude of hesitation and wavering and adopt a
policy which is thoroughly positive and definite–however risky it might be–there
will be no chance whatever of South-East Asia achieving political and economic
stability under American leadership. It looks as if the Americans are unwilling
give up their tradition of isolation. If in the field of diplomacy the British
and Russians are able to achieve much, it is primarily due to the clearness
with which they have been able to define their objectives and the determination
with which they pursue them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The establishment of
Communism in China has been responsible for the transfer of power by the Dutch
to the Indonesian Republic. The struggle that had been going on for four years
came to an end. If the Dutch had seen the wisdom of this transfer three years ago
and if the Americans had adopted a more straightforward policy in this matter
and brought earlier their influence to bear on the Dutch in the direction of
Indonesian freedom, the Republic would have achieved stability by this time and
this would have strengthened considerably the forces opposed to Communism in
this area. One should now console oneself with the idea that it is better late than
never. Indonesia with its seventy million people has at last become free. The
three hundred years rule of the Dutch has come to an end. And although there
are still some matters at issue between the Dutch and the Indonesian Republic,
and although they may lead to friction there is now no longer any danger of
Dutch imperialism being re-established in this area. If at all there is a
conflict it will be a conflict between the national government based on liberal
democracy as led by Dr. Hatta, and the Communist and other fanatical sections
of the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The meeting of the Commonwealth
Foreign Ministers at Colombo in January is also to be attributed to the
establishment of the Communist regime in China. It would, however, be a mistake
to look at the conference as one convened only to arrest Communism in South- East
Asia. Its aims were far more comprehensive. To all the members of the Commonwealth,
stability in South-East Asia is a matter of primary interest. It is of interest
not only to India, Ceylon and Pakistan, which are in the immediate
neighbourhood of this area, but also to Australia and New Zealand and England.
Any unrest of a serious character here will interfere with communications
between England on one side and Australia and New Zealand on the other. Concerted
action, therefore, on the part of the Commonwealth States to put an end to
unrest and create conditions of stability in this region is a matter of
paramount importance. And it was for mutual consultation on this subject that
the conference was held. There was a frank and free discussion on all the
connected issues. Pandit Nehru made it clear that stability in South-East Asia
could not be achieved merely by improving the economic condition of the people
there, although this was an essential step. According to him it would be
necessary to put an end to Colonial rule and grant freedom to the various
nationalities in the area. Unless Indo-China and Malaya became free the unrest
there would continue. This is the question that has to be immediately solved.
As long as it is left unsolved the revolutionary forces inside these countries
would look to China or Russia for help. If this is to be averted, European
imperialism in Asia should come to an end. The conference was not intended to arrive
at any clear-cut decisions. But all the States of the Commonwealth understood
each other’s point of view, and there is a fair prospect of some concerted
action being taken to put an end to the unrest in this part of the world. The
Australian proposal to set up a permanent committee at Canberra for more
frequent consultation was welcomed. And some of the member States agreed to
lend economic to Burma with a view to have peace and order completely re-established
in that State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both at the time of the
Colombo Conference and subsequently the question has been asked what, after
all, is the nature, purpose and utility of the Commonwealth, and it must be
confessed that no satisfactory answer is forthcoming for it. To some it looks
like a regional Pact like the Pan-American Union and the Arab League. To others
it is merely an arrangement under which some of the independent States of the
world consult each other on various questions of the day without undertaking
any responsibilities or commitments. Though there is no doubt that
international conferences do occasionally serve some useful purpose, the time
has come for us all to squarely face the question whether this Commonwealth has
in present form (or lack of form) any use at all and whether anything will be
lost by its being wound up. This question becomes all the more urgent and
important when it is found that inside the Commonwealth the relations between some
members like India and Pakistan are on the verge of war and those between South
Africa and India are nearly so. It is, therefore, incumbent on Indian leaders
to clear up these issues. One should be in a position to know definitely the
implications of India's membership of the Commonwealth are, the obligations it
creates and the rights which it confers. If it is argued that members are sovereign
states and, therefore, they are not under any special obligations except those
which they voluntarily assume, it only shows that the Commonwealth has no
utility and nobody will be the loser if it is scrapped. If Australia and New Zealand
continue to look more to the United States for help in maintaining their defence
and security, and if South Africa declares herself to be a Republic and pursues
its narrow racial policies, the Commonwealth will become a mere shadowy entity.
Of the Holy Roman Empire it used to be said that it was neither Holy, nor Roman,
nor Empire. And if there is not much in common between members of Commonwealth–common
in the shape of rights or obligations–either something of substance in common
has to be created or the organisation dissolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The issues with which
the world will be faced in consequence of the awakening of China and the close
alliance between China and Soviet Russia are of a highly momentous and
complicated character It looks as if the White Australia policy will be put to
a severe test in the near future. The Chinese have always <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>been overflowing into the neighbouring lands.
Will they allow the Australian continent to remain vacant? The period of
European asscendancy is over. Asia is entering on a new epoch of her history.
There is bound to be a new movement of peoples on a large scale. This is sure
to result in a new clash for the vacant spaces of the earth–claims like those
set up by the small racial minority of the whites in South Africa, or the whites
of Australia, will be put to severe test. There is no knowing what the outcome
of this all will be. If really the idea of One World is to become a reality,
distinctions based on race and colour are bouud to disappear. A new humanity is
destined to be born out of a mixture of all the races of the world. What
happened in South America when the white Spanish and Portuguese colonists
Intermarried with the indigenous peoples is destined to happen in other parts
of the world also. Whether all this will come about peacefully or through a
clash of arms, is the only question which the future has to face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Looking at the course of
events today one will have no hesitation in saying that the clash of arms is
the method which is being attempted by the so-called great powers–the United States
and Soviet Russia. The former has announced that it is producing the Hydrogen
bomb whose powers of destruction are incalculable. There has also been an announcement
that Russia is now producing large numbers of atom bombs. Pacifists are calling
upon the two countries to come to an amicable understanding regarding the
production and use of the new weapons of destruction. But have men in power
ever listened to idealists? Pacifism has been preached for ages. All the great
prophets spoke of peace, and in terms of peace. They have not, however, succeeded
in converting men in power to their view. And it doesn’t look likely that they
will succeed now in a matter in regard to which all their greater predecessors
had failed. President Truman has his own views regarding international control
of atomic energy. Premier Stalin has his own views of it. There is no common
ground between them Each is attempting to strengthen himself with a view to destroy
the other and establish his own point of view over the whole world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This is what is being
done for instance in countries like Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria under the
influence of Soviet Russia. The last three months have seen a number of
political trials in these countries. Several have been punished on charges of
treason and espionage. This is being done with a view to eliminate all
opposition to Communism which, in practice, means all opposition to Soviet
Russia. It is now the deliberate policy of the Russian leaders to cut off all
connection between these satellite States and the Western world, to make the
iron curtain still more of a reality than what it was all along. The outside world
should know nothing of what is taking place behind the curtain, and the people
here should rely only on Soviet leaders for light and guidance and should not think
of learning anything from the rest of humanity. A Russian becomes the commander
of Polish armies. Bulgaria compels the United States to break all diplomatic
relations with her. Hungary extorts confessions from British citizens residing
within its jurisdiction and sentences them to long terms of imprisonment on
charges of espionage. Soviet Russia renews the blockade of Berlin. There is no
prospect of the foreign ministers holding a conference to settle the terms of
treaty with Austria. Because Russia is not disposed to evacuate the territory
in her occupation, the other powers are unwilling to withdraw their forces. The
war is among the cats, but it is the mice that suffer. The smaller nations are
becoming more and more the pawns in the game which two bigger powers are playing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The answer of the United
States to the Soviet moves is to enter into military pacts with the west
European powers. As a result of this she has agreed to import into the
countries of Western Europe–England, France, Holland and Belgium etc.–millions
of dollars worth of arms. France is to get the largest share in them. The Marshall
Plan, which started originally for extending economic aid to West Europe, has
now become transformed into a plan for military aid. There is of course,
nothing surprising in this in a world where disputes between States have to be
settled ultimately by resort to war. West Europe is becoming a vast armed camp.
It is now the belief in American circles that it is only by gaining and
maintaining their superiority in arms that they will be in a position to put an
end to aggressive designs of Russia and maintain world peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During this quarter
three important general elections have been fought. In New Zealand, in
Australia as well as in Britain, there was a straight fight between Labour and
other parties. In the first two countries Labour has lost its majorities while
in Britain the election resulted in practically a sort of stalemate. The only
inference that can be drawn from these elections is that even the working classes
in these countries are not completely in favour of immediate socialisation.
They want their governments to proceed a little more slowly and cautiously in
these matters. It is one thing to argue intellectually and philosophically in
favour of Socialism and Communism. The logic behind the argument may even be
flawless. But it doesn’t mean that what is logically sound is also practicable,
that everything that is intellectually grasped can become a workable proposition.
Progress therefore, has to come about by slow and evolutionary means.
Revolution brings its own evils. It is the middle course that appears to be the
wisest course, although there is no guarantee that man, imperfect as he is,
will follow the wisest course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

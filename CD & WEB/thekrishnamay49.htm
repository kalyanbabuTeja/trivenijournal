extent to which each great river has influenced the vagaries of history may
perhaps be better left to the historian. But the millions residing on the banks
of a particular river are bound to be somewhat parochial and zealously defend
its superior merits against a neighbour’s claims in favour of another river.
Being born and bred up on the banks of the Krishna, I could never accept my
river being second in importance to any other river. By tradition and
sentiment, we identify our existence with the river on whose banks we live. If
the Godavari is supposed to flow in unison with the melody of the raga
Sankarabharana, the Krishna enchants me as the magic flute of Lord Krishna, to
the music of which all living things danced in rhythm and in joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

picturesque Western Ghats around Mahabaleshwar in the Bombay Province, about 40
miles from the Arabian Sea, form the lap from which a murmuring stream breaks
into a mighty river, extending over 800 miles to the Bay of Bengal. The start
is unassuming as is the case with all big rivers. But soon the river gathers
strength when she is joined by Koyna and Varna, two tributaries from the
Western Ghats. Later, another small river Panchaganga by name, merges in waters
with those of the young Krishna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

meandering for full three hundred miles in the Bombay Presidency, the river
enters the Hyderabad State where her waters flow over a rocky bed. Later when
Bhima from the Ahmednagar area and Tungabhadra from Mysore join the river, it
is said that ‘in time of flood a mighty volume of water rushes with a great
roar over a succession of broken ledges of granite dashing up a lofty column of
spray.’ It is after the confluence with Tungabhadra that the river strikes the
Madras Presidency again and forms for a considerable distance the boundary
between the eastern portion of Hyderabad and the Kurnool and Guntur districts
of Madras.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

total length of the river within and along the state of Hyderabad is about 400
miles. The course of the river through the Nallamalai forests is described as
one of the most picturesque in the world, being a perpetual source of delight
and wonder to the tourists. In these forests live the ‘Koyas’ an aboriginal
tribe with their quaint ways still unvarnished by the impact of the modern
world. They are said to be a very artistic race–great lovers of beauty: and
their folk-songs and folk dances are quite unique.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

river then flows through Palnad, a place of heroic traditions. It is said that
mere drinking of the Krishna water in Palnad converts cowards into warriors. It
was here that a warrior lady, single-handed, held undisputed sway over a
thousands of her countrymen. Nagamma was at once a clever and a brave leader.
Her diplomacy was unrivalled. Telugu folk-lore is replete with her
Machiavellian deeds, which are off-set by the heroism of the boy-warrior,
Balachandra and his noble father. Palnad also produced the famous Andhra poet
Srinadha, who is reputed to have lived in true epicurean style at the court of
Vema Reddi. The river Krishna, however, was not kind to the poet laureate who
seems to have launched a big scheme of cultivation near a village Boddupalli on
the banks of the river Krishna. The entire crop was inundated by unexpected
floods and Srinadha was reduced to very dire straits, unable even to pay the
kist. In utter despair the great poet </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At one spot in Palnad, near Ganikonda, river Krishna
altering the hitherto easternly or southernly course, flows northwards for a
mile or so–Uttaravahini as they say, Ganikonda is only eighty miles distant from
the sea, but strangely enough, owing to a rocky barrier here, the river needs
must take the opposite direction and pursue a tortuous course of full two
hundred miles before she reaches the sea.</p>

and its environs are of great historic antiquity and although much valuable
material has been destroyed, there is enough to show that here at some distant
past there flourished a wonderful seat of learning and an abode of exquisite
sculpture, depicting not only scenes in the life of the Buddha but also various
aspects of everyday life of nearly two thousand years ago. Amaravati has been
identified as the Chinese traveller Hsuan Tsang’s Tonakieesakia and the Rahmi
of Arab geographers. It would be of interest to note that the Krishna River
Basin was at one time the centre of intense diamond mining. Marco Polo, the
Venetian traveller of the 13th Century and Nicolo Conti, a traveller of the
15th Century speak of these mines, but the Earliest authentic account of the
diamond mines here is by Jean Bapitiste Tavernier who made six journeys to
India between 1635 and 1689 to purchase precious stones. According to Tavernier
there were as many as sixty-thousand persons working in the mines situated on
the banks of the river Krishna. Tavernier also speaks of a huge gem of 900
carats weight which was picked up at a place called Kollur and presented to the
Moghul Emperor Aurangazeb by the Ruler of Golconda. It is believed that the
Kollur Gem is the same as the world famous Kobinoor which now adorns the crown
of the King of England–the term Kohinoor being a Urdu version of the Telugu
Kollur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cultural importance of Vijayawada has been enhanced by the recent inauguration
of a Broadcasting Centre there. Various industries have been started in the
greater Vijayawada area and it is to be expected that with more abundant supply
of electrical energy, as contemplated, these will grow rapidly and aid in the

various structures. Ghantasala now a large inland village was a commercial
centre in the centuries, between the first to the 13th. Ptolemy, the Greek
traveller, mentions of the trade that was carried on between Rome and
Kantakalsala,–which has been identified with the present Ghantasala. It was a
port of no mean importance, from where country craft sailed in all directions.
It is interesting to note however that river Krishna has since receded quite
some miles from Ghantasala.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

account of the river Krishna cannot be complete without a mention of
Masulipatam or Machilipatnamu, the second town in the District. It is at the
tail-end of the chief navigational canal fed by the Krishna. Masula was at one
time a great seaport. A Dutch despatch of about 1,600 states “Masula is a city
seated near a large river, where the English and the Dutch have their
factories. It is a great concourse of merchants from Camboja, Surate and other
places under the jurisdiction of the Great Mogul.” This early commercial
importance of the town gradually faded away, but with the beginning of the
present century Machilipatnam acquired a new importance inasmuch as it became
the virtual seat of the renaissance movement in Andhra. It was from
Machilipatnam that the present Andhra movement originated during the years 1908
to 1912 and great pioneer work in the shape of national education and intense
political awakening was directed from this place. Kopalle Hanumantha Rao, the
founder of the Jateeya Kalasala and Mutnuri Krishna Rao of <i>Krishna Patrika</i>–one<i>
</i>of the greatest journalists the Andhra country has produced, had each a
coterie of young and enthusiastic idealists who later played their part in the
wider national awakening that has resulted in the achievement of our Swaraj. It
was in the Jateeya Kalasala also that the Andhra School of Art was developed
under the guidance of the talented master Promode kumar Chatterjee whose
students have since acquired well-merited fame in India and abroad. Citizens of
Masulipatam may perhaps, quite justifiably be proud of the fact that Dr. B.
Pattabhi Seetaramiah himself hails from their town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Andhras, particularly those on the banks of the Krishna, are an emotional race
and love to live in the past. Their enthusiasm and fervour for their past glory
has even led their well-wishers to regard them as impracticable idealists. But
their love of their culture is ardent and sincere. One of the leaders of the
renaissance movement in Telugu literature, in an excusable flight of poetic
fancy visualizes a glorious future when once again great ships from many a
foreign port shall ride majestically on the proud waters of the Krishna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

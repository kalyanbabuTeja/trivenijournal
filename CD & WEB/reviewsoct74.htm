<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tagore and Radhakrishnan
have both almost in the same way influenced philosophical minds, in spite of
the fact that one is a widely acknowledged poet and the other a celebrated
philosopher. The fact that Man is the only basis of study and research for
ultimate knowledge of Truth make it all the more reasons for deep contemplation
of his nature and his evolution reaching the Infinite. Hence the meaning of
Man, his purpose and his future become closely linked together in a thorough
investigation of the subject. In a country like ours, with a long tradition of
thought, poetry and philosophy or poetry and religion have never been
compartmentalized and dealt with separately. Our greatest sages and thinkers
such as Valmlki, Vyasa and Kalidasa have invariably touched the highest peak of
philosophy while dealing with the most human aspects of life. Indeed poetry and
philosophy are one except for the purpose of analysis and ratiocination when
philosophy would appear as dry and poetry as mere dreaming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The concept of Man in
these two contemporary thinkers is a very engaging subject for any student of their
writings. If Dr Reddy has chosen these two eminent sources of fruitful
investigation of the real nature of Man, it is praiseworthy indeed evrn as an
effort. Doubtless in these pages, we find collected important thoughts given
expression to in their writings. In many a passage of significant utterance,
the poet has made it clear that Man has infinite possibilities of becoming
greater than he is by dint of striving for perfection both as an individual and
as an indivisible member of society. Dr Radhakrishnan equally bases his
conclusions upon the divinity of Man. Each has reached his irreversible
understanding of the true nature of Man as destined to become identifiable with
God, provided he is led to this goal by chastening himself. The divinity of Man
manifests itself according to the extent of his realisation of his humanity or
in other words, his oneness with fellow beings. The universal aspect of Man is
thus emphasised almost similarly, save in different languages of poetry and
philosophy. In imagery and song the poet draws our attention to the superior
designation of Man in this universe, while the philosopher does it through
metaphysical approach. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tagore’s invitation to
us to follow him through the green meadow of poetry and not by the beaten path of
logic and argumentation, has only been met with by Radhakrishnan’s assurance of
his guidance to us along the secure road of epistemology and reason. We get
discussions of the many systems of philosophy of our land as well as of the
West during the engaging treatment here of the two world figures. The
appendices containing comparitive notes of eminent thinkers of both the past
and the present add to the value of a good book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is a difficult job to
prove that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was a systematic political thinker. Nehru’s
mental make-up was such that he could never imprison himself into a water-tight
political system. Besides, he was ever overwhelmed by things happening to him.
Frequently, he had to act first and think later! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However, his aim for
establishing an ideal society void of economic and social disparities is an
ever-present theme in his works. His deep humanism and his whole-hearted
concern for individual liberty and national development do call for a depth
study of his views. Dr Girija Mookerjee’s book deals with four facets of
Nehru’s intellectual make-up. Firstly, Nehru’s conception of social justice.
Marxism gave him many guidelines though as a humanist he eschewed its method of
compulsion, thus giving scope to Frank Moraes’ conclusion: “Nehru represents a
type unique in the history of his time–a Marxist theorist wedded to democratic
practices.” Dr Mookerjee wonders whether such an idea was not merely an utopian
concept. At the same time, he is in no hurry to condemn Nehru as an idle
dreamer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As for the individual in
the modern world, though himself a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru did not
subscribe to Gandhi’s “simple peasant life.” Like the problem of social
justice, here too he was caught in a dilemma. Should India be industrialised to
give its mass a better deal? But then, how about the evils of
industrialisation? He encouraged the Five-Year Plans and committed the country
to an era of intense industrialisation. At the same time he resisted the
supremacy of the state and wanted every individual to have “full opportunity to
grow according to his worth and ability.” The same fate awaited his concept of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Panchsheel towards international harmony, which
floundered on the rocks of the Chinese invasion of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally, how does
Nehru’s humanism differ from Gandhi’s? Gandhi’s concept of non-violence itself
carried seeds of revolutionary violence. Nehru’s humanism abhorred any type of
violence and he was not favourable to Gandhi’s views. But he compromised his
ideals for the sake of national unity, as Gandhi’s leadership was indispensable
to the national effort. Dr Mookerjee’s essay on this subject turns out to be a
triangular view of Gandhi, Subhas Bose and Nehru. Gandhi and Bose had many bonds
to unite them and many characteristics in common. Nehru, by his up-bringing and
intellectual make-up was somewhat of an ‘outsider’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But his “intellectual integrity” and “human
excellence” made him a natural heir to Gandhi. Today Nehru continues to shine
as one of the few great men produced by the twentieth century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr (Miss) G. R. Banerjee
is one of the pioneers of social work, teaching and practice in India. After
serving as a teacher in the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Bombay, for
about three decades, she retired in the year 1972. It is heartening to see that
as a mark of respect for her and appreciation of her services to the profession
of social work, the Institute has brought out this volume of collected papers
written by her from time to time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr (Miss) Banerjee has
been responsible for starting the medical and psychiatric social work in this
country. She taught and practised case work in a number of settings. It is
therefore natural that most or the papers have a direct bearing on case work
practice. The papers cover a wide range–from philosophy and practice of social
work to the problems of the profession in India. Sanskrit scholar as she is, Dr
(Miss) Banerjee tried to relate the philosophy and concepts of social work to
the Indian tradition with special reference to the Gita. It is her conviction
that <i>Nishkama Karma, </i>duty consciousness and love for humanity are the
cardinal principles of social work. The social worker should have “as much
power of detachment as of attachment.” She points out that “the concept of
social conscience which is at the root of modern social work is related to the
concept of social self and has been well developed in ancient Indian
literature.” Discussing the theory of <i>Karma, </i>she says that the feeling
among the case workers that the belief in <i>Karma </i>does not create a desire
in the client to bring about a change in his social situation is erroneous. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Generally there is a
misconception that professional social workers are least concerned with social
action and structural changes. This misconception is derived from the social
work as it is generally practised in the U. S. A. Dr (Miss) Banerjee,
therefore, correctly says that “in most of the Asian countries where poverty,
disease, illiteracy and low level of living are normal, it would seem that
training for social case work should emphasise social forces acting upon the individual
from without and the need for fundamental changes in the socio-economic
structure of<i> </i>the society and the steps being taken or contemplated to
bring about these changes. The idea is to prepare future social workers for
social action and social change.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr (Miss) Banerjee
discusses the practice of social work in general and social case work in
particular in the context of students, psychiatric patients, physically
handicapped, working mothers, juvenile delinquents, prostitutes, etc. Herself
being a teacher and an active field-work supervisor with rich experience in
working with maladjusted individuals and groups she writes with authority as to
the qualities required of a social work teacher and field-work supervisor. In a
modern society where a professional has a major role to play, his character and
role-model have definitely their impact on the student as well as on the
client. The social worker as “a person who is at the service of<i> </i>human
beings in order to help them to self-realization and development” should
internalise the needed qualities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Acharya Dhulekar spent a
major part of his life in active politics. But he could find time to study
Vedas, Upanishads, all philosophical works and Puranas, digest the essence
thereof, and present the results of his study in 189 discourses arranged
systematically, and divided into 48 chapters, in a non-polemical and easily
assimmilable manner, in this volume of about 1100 pages. Vedas, Upanishads and
Bhagavad Gita, according to the author, are the three pillars of Vedanta. Vedas
contain all knowledge including that of modern sciences. Vedanta which kills
the fear of death is a science which can be tested, experimented upon, studied
and practised in the spiritual laboratory of our living body. Bhagavad Gita is
Vedanta in practice. In the first 168 discourses all the eighteen chapters of
Bhagavad Gita are explained with the help of all the texts the author has
studied and from which he has profusely quoted. Jeeva Jagat and Brahman are
one. Re-birth and cow protection are two of the fundamentals of Hinduism. Cow
is considered as mother earth. There is no sanction for animal killing in
Yagnas. Image worship is accepted in Hinduism. The last few discourses deal with
subjects like Yagna, Bondage and Liberation, <i>Jivanmukti</i> and <i>Dahara</i>
<i>Vidya</i>. These discourses vibrating with verve and vigour and containing
about 2000 textual quotations are really a mine of information and serve as a
master guide to the study of Vedanta. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

review is a comprehensive account, of the new philosophic movement in the West
that goes under the name of <i>Existentialism. </i>It is a powerful challenge
to Marxism and all the forms of totalitaranism and authority. Its stress is on <i>existence
</i>than on <i>essence, </i>on the concrete individual, and not the abstract
universal concept Man. It is anti-speculative and is interested in the problems
of man’s existence, particularly his inner life. The movement stands for the
individual’s freedom, and is opposed to all the forms of collectivist ethics.
The Existentialists do not regard that reason can know all things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our learned author
compares the writings of several existentialists, e.g., Soren Kirekegaard, Jean
Paul Sartre, Martin Buber and Karl Jaspar, some of them atheists and others
theists. What is common to the thinkers is sifted and what is useful, to
fashion the authentic individual’s is stated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The implication of the
existentialist position for education is worked out. They seek to create an
authentic person, who will grow up into a creative being. The educational
theories of the thinkers are worked out in full and analyzed and the material
is collected. The object is to produce a plan of life to make men lead a
meaningful life. The services of the existentialist philosophy towards this
goal is admirably brought out by the author. Existentialist Philosophy is a powerful
democratic alternative, in a world that is half communist already. Reading the
book is both spiritual and liberal education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

deals with the nature and character of Desya element and the role of Desya
element in Prakrit and Apabhramsa in general and Pushpadanta’s works in
particular. The authoress pointed out that the term Desi has been used in the
earlier Sanskrit and Prakrit literature mainly in three different senses, viz.,
(1) a local spoken dialect (2) a type of Prakrit, (3) and as equivalent to
Apabhramsa. The interpretations of the word Desi as given by Hemachandra and
modern scholars are also given in detail. The authoress comes to the conclusion
that most of the modern scholars agree that “Desya or Desi is a very loose
label applied by early grammarians and lexicographers to a section of Middle
Indo-Aryan laxical material of a heterogeneous character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

important one, the learned Doctor has collected 1430 words and divided them

(4) items that have correspondents only in late Samskrit (5) onometopoetic
words (6) foreign loans and (7) pure Desi words. Critical and comparative notes
on their meanings and interpretations, with corroborating passages from
original texts are also given here and they evidence the high scholarly labours
of the authoress. We cannot, but respect the words of Dr H. C. Bhayani of the
Gujarat University in whose opinion the present study paves “the way for<i> </i>investigating
the bases and authenticity of Hemachandra’s Desinamamala and provides highly

exhibition. <i>(2) Kathak </i>is an action plus song affair. First, there will
be a fifteen-minute pure dance–an engaging mosaic of motion–with orchestral
support. Mimetic elements like the lifting of Govardhana or playing the flute
are thrown in between. Next ‘nritya’ is followed by one-act play which employs
pantomimes in illumination of the words of a song. (3) Bhaktimal Nataks deal
with the lives of Vaishnava saints. The language and techniques are adapted
mostly to the tastes and capacities of the illiterate commoners. Though music
is not considered an organic part of the plays, devotes, take occasion to stir
up congregational singing. (4) <i>Ramlila </i>is both staged and mimed. The
season for its enactment is Dasara. The incidents narrated, acted, danced and
sung are lifted from Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas. (5) Raslila is a circular
dance performed by Krishna with Gopis on full-moon autumnal nights followed by
enactment of a play covering the childhood exploits of Divine Krishna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

event states in his welcome address with his usual poetic verve: “When chaos is
in the air everywhere, the poet cannot stay out of this turbulence. The poet’s
part in this universal drama is mighty magnificent, monumental.” Eight papers
review the state of the art of poetry in eight Indian languages, from Konkani
to Urdu. Rabindranath Meson and Satya Dev Jaggi, two practising poets, speak
from the experience of composing poetry. Sathya Babu analyse, Menon’s poetry
while P. B. Sreenivas adds a note on poetry in films. Over twenty short poems
from well-known Indo-English poets such as V. K. Gokak, Shiv K. Kumar, Gopal
Honnalgere, M. P. Bhaskaran and Kamala Das are included. </p>

is a very neatly printed and produced Indian edition of a work, first published
in 1934. The author is well-known and lived in India and elsewhere among Yogis,
sages, mystics and wise men and written several books based on his wide ex­periences,
wanderings and studies. This is one such and deals with “A Technique of
Spiritual Self-Discovery for the Modern World.” The vision and the message, the
author had from the Wise One of the East (when he was about to start on one more
of his numerous journeys) was “Forget not the fellows in distress.” He sought
to fulfil this expressed wish of one of his spiritual Guides by first setting
down what life has taught him, putting into words the wisdom learnt from dearly-bought
experience. This is the genesis of this book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Richardson has made a commendable effort to gain a sympathetic understanding of
the Indian way of life. She visited India in 1969 as a guest of the Indian
Government. She did not rest content with visiting the big cities. She
established close contacts with people from different walks of life. She
visited and lived in ordinary homes prompted by her keen desire to study the
culture and multitudinous customs and habits prevailing in India. The author
made an earnest attempt to grasp the vital secrets of the religious creeds of
the Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis. Behind the baffling spectacle
of diversity she was able to discern the underlying unity of the human heart
that throbs with the same emotions. She could discover a keen zest for life on
the one hand and a fatalistic resignation on the other among the teeming millions
of<i> </i>India. She came to India and looked at this fascinating land with the
zeal of a seeker after truth rather than a casual tourist. The tender hearts of
India impressed her so much that she felt at the time of leaving this land that
only her physical body was departing but her spirit would forever linger over the
famous spots and humble homes she had visited during her short but significant stay.<span

is a collection of stories by a writer of renown in both Tamil and English. As
the author had been actively involved in the independence movement, most of the
stories bear that stamp. They are all written in lucid, attractive style.
Stories like the “Ghost of Mahabalipur” reveal his acquaintance with
psychology. “The Flower Queen” which unfolds the rustic romance of a guileless couple
and their untimely tragic end reveals the author’s acquaintance with medicine.
The story “Pandits of Parameswar” is a beautiful satire advocating removal of
untouchability. “Saitan Mansion Mystery” is a delightful thriller. “Melting
Sarees” is a study in humour. “Hallucination” depicts the communal riots after
the independence. Everywhere we see the author’s profound reverence for Gandhiji
and his principles. As the author himself in his personal life had followed
Gandhiji truly his stories do not smack of mere propaganda, they have a true
authentic ring about them. The book has been nicely got up.<span

historical novel, the main theme of which revolves round Tirumalamba, otherwise
known as Mohanangi, daughter of Srikrishna Devaraya and wife of Aliya Ramaraya.
Tradition has it that she wrote a Prabandha “Marichi Parinayam” and dedicated it
to her father. The former part of the novel is mainly devoted to that aspect of

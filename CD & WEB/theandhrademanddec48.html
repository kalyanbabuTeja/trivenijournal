mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>THE problem of Andhra Province is a long standing
one; its beginnings may be traced to the great agitation against the partition
of Bengal which convulsed the whole of India from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin.
The principles enunciated by Lord Hardinge, the Governor-General of India, in
his Despatch, and the statements issued by other statesmen of the day
justifying the annulment of the partition, the re-union of the Bengali speaking
divisions into one Province and the separation of the Bihari speaking area from
Bengal, appealed to the imagination of the Andhras and filled their minds with
an ambition for a separate Province. The Andhra Movement was the outcome of
this aspiration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A long period of thirty-five years has passed since
the demand for the Andhra Province was made for the first time at the Andhra
Conference held at Bapatla, Guntur District. This demand has gone on
unremittingly all these long years. Many leading personalities in Andhra who had
joined enthusiastically in the agitation for the Province have passed away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Almost every year during this long period,
conferences were held and resolutions demanding the creation of Andhra Province
were passed and submitted to Government. The agitation was based on the general
principle of redistribution of Provinces in India on the basis of language and
culture. Along with the agitation for the Andhra Province, the Andhras were
also advocating the reorganisation of the Provinces in India. A pamphlet designated
the “Redistribution of Provinces on Linguistic and Cultural, Basis” written by
Dr. B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, was published and widely distributed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In 1917 when Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford
visited Madras for enquiry regarding the New Reforms, a deputation consisting
of leading men from the different Districts in Andhra under the leadership of
the late Nyapati Subba Rau Pantulu waited upon them and presented a Memorandum
urging the necessity of redistribution of Provinces in India and also the creation
of Andhra Province in particular. As a result of this deputation a provision
was introduced in the Government of India Act, 1935, that the Local
Legislatures may pass Resolutions for the creation of Linguistic Provinces and
have them accepted by the Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The question of Andhra Province was also taken up
by the Legislature in Madras more than once, and in 1938, when the Congress
Government was in power, a Resolution moved for the creation of the Andhra,
Tamilnad, Karnataka, and Kerala Provinces was accepted on behalf of the
Government by the then Prime Minister, Sri C. Rajagopalachariar. He then
quoted, in support of the resolution, the following remarks of the Statutory
Commission:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“For those who speak the same language and form a
compact, self-contained area, so suited and endowed as to be able to support
its existence as a separate Province, there is no doubt that the use of common
speech is a strong and natural basis for provincial individuality. But it is
not the only test. Race, religion, economic interests, geographical contiguity,
due balance between country and town, between coast and interior may all have
to be relevant. The most important of all principles for practical purposes is
the largest possible measure of general agreement on the changes proposed, both
on the side of the area which is gaining and on the side that is losing
advantage.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sri C. Rajagopalachariar added: “Judged by every
one of the tests including the later portion, judging the question on everyone
of these ideal separately and as a whole, the claim of the Andhra Province
stands good.” Referring to the conditions detailed by the Statutory Commission,
he further remarked: “On all these points, there is no cause for opposing the
claim for a separate Andhra Province.” Thus there can be no better
authoritative pronouncement in favour of the Andhra Movement for a Province.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A quotation from the Indian Statutory Commission
(Vol. 1, page 55) will be specially relevant to the main question, as it
pronounces an emphatic opinion on the division of Madras Presidency into
distinct linguistic areas:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Madras may be divided into several areas according
to the predominance of particular languages. The principal languages are Tamil
and Telugu which are spoken by 18 and 16 millions respectively. Malayalam is a
language of over 3 millions in the Indian States of Travancore and Cochin and
the adjoining British District of Malabar, and Canarese is spoken in the
Districts bordering on Mysore and the Bombay Presidency, while in the extreme north-east
of the Province there are several Oria speaking areas. These linguistic
differences have during recent years assumed considerable political
importance…With the movement of linguistic amalgamation we shall have occasion
to deal elsewhere. The demand for the formation of Andhra or Telugu Province
which was put forward 17 years ago at a conference of Telugu speaking Districts
has been persistent for many years and has now become an important political
issue. It has on two occasions in recent years become the subject of formal
debate in the Madras Legislature, which has by a fairly large majority endorsed
the proposal for the constitution of a separate Andhra Province. The social
changes in this Province are of no less importance than the linguistic and they
have already exercised a profound influence on the political situation and the
grouping of the parties.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Long before the question was taken up by the
Legislatures, the Andhras had appealed to the Congress for the separation of
the Andhra Districts from the Madras Province, and in the year 1917 the
Congress recognised the disadvantages arising from the clubbing of the Telugu
speaking areas with those of other languages in this single Province of Madras.
But owing to the opposition of some of the leaders of the South, the A.I.C.C.
constituted the Telugu Districts into what they were pleased to call, the
‘Andhra Congress Circle,’ for the purpose of carrying on Congress work
independently of the Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. In this connection, we have
gratefully to acknowledge the efforts made by the late Sri Nyapati Subba Rau
Pantulu and the great support given by Sri Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak who
cut short the opposition of the Tamil leaders in the Subjects Committee by
saying: “Why do you come in their way and not allow them to work for
themselves?” Immediately after the constitution of this Andhra Congress Circle,
the Andhra Provincial Congress Committee was formed and commenced to function,
having separated itself from the Madras Provincial Congress Committee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>However, the Andhras were not satisfied with this
but carried on continuously the agitation for the Province, urging at the same
time the necessity of reorganising Provinces in India on a linguistic basis.
Later, the wisdom of the movement in its full significance was accepted by the
Congress, and in 1920, when Mahatma Gandhi took the management of Congress
affairs into his hands, the Provinces in India were all reorganised on a
linguistic basis, and the Andhra Province thus came to be recognised by the
Congress as a separate unit working along with other Provinces of India in all
matters relating to the Congress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Andhra Province would have been an accomplished
fact several years back like Orissa and Sind but for the boycott of the Simon
Commission by the Andhras, as directed by the Congress. Everywhere in Andhra,
the Commission was presented with black flags accompanied by the slogan,
‘Simon, go back.’ However, they looked forward to the day when India obtained
her independence and their aspiration for a separate Province would be
realised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>After the declaration of Independence, Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, speaking about the creation of
Linguistic Provinces in the Constituent Assembly, is reported to have said that
whatever may be the case of other Provinces, the question of Andhra Province
stood on a different footing, meaning to say that it has prior claims. Dr.
Ambedkar, the Minister for Law in the Central Government, has also advocated
the creation of the Andhra Province under Sec. 93 of the Government of India
Act of 1935, even before the new Constitution for India is formed. These and
other similar statements of other leaders confirmed the hope in the minds of
the Andhras that they would soon be granted the Province and be left free to
develop their resources and secure a status of equality with other Provinces in
India. But the appointment of the Linguistic Provinces Commission to tour
through the country and enquire into the desirability of the creation of
Provinces on a linguistic basis has chilled the expectations of the Andhras,
particularly because their, claim for a separate Province has been classed
along with those of other Provinces and brought back to the stage of
preliminary enquiry, not withstanding the fact that the question of Andhra
Province has already been discussed threadbare many times and approved by
leaders of thought and status in the country and even responsible bodies like
the Legislatures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Again, even before the Commission prepared and
submitted their report, some of the leaders have come forward with adverse
criticism while others suggested the postponement of the question to some
distant date. Pandit Nehru is reported to have stated that the problem of
creation of new provinces on a linguistic basis involves many intricacies
requiring calm consideration, which is possible only after the numerous
complicated situations now facing the Government are overcome and more peaceful
conditions are established in the country. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Deputy
Prime Minister, seems to have advocated the putting off of the question for a
period of ten years. Again, Mr. Munshi, the erstwhile Agent-General in
Hyderabad, as re- ported in the press, has indulged in harsh criticism of the
movement itself calling it ‘linguism’ and even urging it to be fought against
as ‘Hitlerism,’ ‘Fascism’ and ‘Racialism.’ There are yet others who are arguing
against the movement, advancing the plea of provincialism and separatism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>These criticisms are based upon groundless
apprehensions that the creation of Provinces on a linguistic basis would
militate against national unity and ultimately lead to the disintegration of
India. It is too late in the day to discuss this aspect of the problem, as it
was raised and answered time and again since the days of the agitation against
the partition of Bengal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Lord Hardinge, after laying down the conditions for
the creation of the New Provinces of Bengal observed: “The scheme for
satisfying these conditions was to reunite the five Bengali speaking divisions
and form them into a Province to be administered by a Governor in Council.”
Then referring to the Biharis he said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“We are satisfied that it is in the highest degree
desirable to give the Hindi speaking people included in the Province of Bengal
a special administration. These people have hitherto been unequally yoked with
the Bengalis and have never therefore a fair opportunity for developing. There
has moreover been a marked awakening in Bihar in recent years and a strong
belief has grown up among Biharis, that Bihar will never develop until it is
dissociated from Bengal. That belief will, unless a new remedy is round, give
rise to agitation in the near future, and the present is an admirable
opportunity to carry out, on our own initiative, a thoroughly sound and much
deserved change.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“It would have been well for the country had the
division into Provinces for purposes of Government followed the lines marked by
race and language, so as to reinforce the sympathy which arises from similarity
of feeling of pride in the local Government. The existing administrative

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In this connection it is relevant to refer to the
formation of the Madras Province which has no relation to considerations of
either the unity of language, race, history, or tradition. It is a mechanical
aggregate of territories, added one to the other in the process of acquisition
by the British through a long period extending from 1611, when some British
traders established a Settlement in Masulipatam, and ending with the completion
of the acquisition of the entire area now comprising the Province by the
Military occupation of the country under the Nawab of Kurnool in 1833 on the
plea of maladministration. The Province thus constituted has in it a
conglomerate of four main languages, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kanarese,
spoken by four different peoples, occupying four different areas in it. The
evil consequences of bringing together people speaking different languages are
numerous. To quote but one instance, the confusion of languages in the
Legislature in Madras may be referred to. The members ignorant of English do
not understand the speeches made in English, in which language practically the
entire proceedings are conducted, and the speeches made by these members in
their mother-tongue cannot be followed by others. This pathetic condition of
the members is a mockery of democracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Further, the Madras Province, as it is, is unwieldy
on account of the variety of populations living in it, and the conflicting
interests to be attended to. The elaborate schemes, both agricultural and
industrial, to be undertaken for the economic development call for the
immediate division of the Province into separate units convenient for efficient
administration. Therefore the claim of the Andhras for a separate Province is based
both on justice and expediency. Again, the question is asked whether the Andhra
Province can find revenues adequate to maintain the administration. No doubt
need be entertained on the subject as the financial resources of the tract,
even as they now stand, will not fail to meet the cost of administration.
Moreover, immense are the possibilities resulting from the expansion of the
resources hitherto neglected. The great rivers of the Andhra Desh, the vast
fertile plains, mines, and forests, constitute the potential wealth of the
Province which is almost inexhaustible. The enthusiasm and interest of the
people, born of the pride in the new Province, will supply the talent and
energy necessary for the launching of schemes for the development of the
resources. And these when completed would enhance the financial credit of the
Province and would enable the Government to undertake progressive measures for
the material and moral advancement of the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As to the criticism that the creation of new
Provinces fosters the spirit of provincialism and separatism, it has to be
pointed out that such a spirit is not after all to be despised. Sir Thomas
Holderness expressed the view that “the provincial spirit, rightly understood
and properly cultivated, is not only far removed from but positively helpful to
the growth of national life and to the development of the national idea.”
Besides, the natural law of progress and evolution is from the lower to the
higher sphere of life, first the pupil in the school, then the student in the
college, first the citizen in his own country, then the citizen of the world.
Hence the experiences of provincial life are but a training ground for the
development of national sentiment. The sentiment of Nationality in India has
been built upon permanent factors such as the magnificence of her natural
environment and her wonderful art, history, and civilisation which have stood
the test of ages and cannot be effected by the creation of Provinces on a
linguistic basis. Provinces are, after all, but parts of the Indian Dominion
and the progress and strength of each part means the progress and strength of
the whole, even as the strength of each link in the chain means the strength of
the entire chain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A new question has come for consideration, <i>viz.,
</i>what should be the language of administration in the Provinces to be newly
formed. Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have suggested, in his Memorandum to the
Linguistic Provinces Commission, that the creation of these Provinces should be
on the condition that Hindi should be made the language of administration in
each Province! The same idea seems to underlie the criticism by Mr. Munshi when
he said that the creation of Linguistic Provinces would raise the provincial
languages in rivalry to the national language. Both of them seem to think that,
unless Hindi is made the language of administration in the Provinces, the
development of national unity and the strength and influence of the Central
Government will be greatly endangered. But this opinion is based upon a
misconception of the place to be given to the national language in the life and
economy of the Provinces, and it also ignores the value and importance of the
provincial language. That there should be one common language for all India is
an established proposition, but even the sponsors of this proposition never
intended that the common language should take the place of the provincial
language or obstruct its development. Admittedly, the purpose of the common
language is only to facilitate communication between the peoples of various
Provinces, and there is no possibility of any rivalry between this and the
provincial languages, so long as it is confined to its limited purpose and no
attempt is made to have it override the legitimate province of any of the
provincial languages or usurp its function.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The principles of democracy demand that even a
common man in the village must be given the fullest freedom to play his part in
the administration with the full consciousness of his own duties and
responsibilities and to offer intelligent cooperation. It is therefore
indispensable that the provincial language should be made the language of
administration in each Province. To make Hindi the language of administration
in the Provinces is to install it in a place of importance and dignity, which
English occupies in the country at present. It means that Hindi like English
will have to be taught in schools and colleges as a compulsory subject of study
for all examinations. Thus the importance and attraction which Hindi gains will
for ever bar the progress and development of provincial languages, for the
people will lose interest in their mother-tongue and neglect the same in their
effort to secure proficiency in Hindi. The common man, who is not expected to
gain higher knowledge of Hindi, will be compelled to remain where he is, being
unable to take part in the administration of the Province.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

time is inopportune for the creation of new Provinces, as it involves the
solution of numerous intricate problems, it may be observed that, in the first
place, the question does not appear to be so complicated that it cannot be
decided by ordinary investigation carried on by persons commanding the
confidence of the public. In extraordinary cases, where opposing interests
create intricacies, the dispute may be solved either through arbitration or by
referendum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It must be said that the problem of Andhra Province
does not present any such insurmountable difficulty. The most easy thing to do
is to immediately constitute the eleven Telugu speaking Districts in Andhra
Desh into a Province, and take up later at a convenient time the consideration
of their claims for the contiguous areas beyond the boundaries of these
Districts. To put off the question to any distant date is highly unreasonable.
The consequence of any postponement will be the obstruction of the free growth
of democratic institutions in the Province; it will hinder the development of
its resources to an indefinite time. The people will have to suffer, as
hitherto, all the losses and discomforts due to inefficient administration. The
present conditions of administration in the Province bear evidence to the
helplessness of the Andhras. In these days of democracy numbers count and so
the members representing Andhra in the Legislatures will always be outvoted by
the superior number of Tamil and other areas. The chances of carrying on any
measure conducive to the interests of the Andhras are very limited. Preference
is always given to measures that serve the interests of the people of the
South. Such has been the state of things for many years now. The Andhras there-
fore cannot submit to this intolerable situation any longer. And so they demand
the immediate creation of an Andhra Province. I earnestly hope that, when the
Province becomes an accomplished fact, the Andhras would not fall behind any
other Province in India and will faithfully adopt the ideals set before us by
Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Indian Nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

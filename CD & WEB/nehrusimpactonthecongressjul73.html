<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>So much has been written about the bewildering
puzzle of Jawaharlal Nehru that it requires no little courage to state that he
is easily understandable. The myth of ‘Nehru the enigma’ is perhaps a part of
the larger myth of the ‘inscrutable East’. He was indeed a complex personality.
But when the principal urges and hopes of Jawaharlal Nehru as well as the main
facts of his background and experiences are taken into account, his actions make
sense in terms of universally recognized human motives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps
the answer to an ever-haunting question of why the world still wonders about
Nehru, while it has made up its mind quite quickly about others, is that in the
recent past the world has witnessed the emergence of a new genius of a leader,
who cannot be fit in any of the old categories. Nehru was a new type of
personality. He was a political leader, a politician, one who devoted of his
life to the practice rather than the theory of politics. However, one cannot
deny the fact that throughout his career Nehru maintained a more-than-casual
interest in theory as well. His voracious reading and philosophical bent of
mind enabled him to i</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

broad theoretical perspective. He was a politician, yet he shunned
Machiavellianism in politi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cs; he disliked religiosity, yet he
appreciated ethical values both in personal and public life; he came under the
influence of Mahatma Gandhi and adopted his principle of choosing right means
for attaining right ends, yet the latter’s continuous stress on the religious
and spiritual side of the national movement seemed to him incomprehensible; and
finally he came under the influence of Karl Marx, yet he did not commit to
Marxian philosophy fully. Temperamentally he was against violent methods which
the Marxists and the Communists think indispensable for bringing about any
social and political revolution. His decisions as well as his ideology were
guided by his knowledge of history, and he was in the habit of interpreting
social and political situations in a historical perspective.</span><span

was the chief architect of new India, and his influence on the Indian masses
and the intelligentsia was decisive. He influenced the Indian National Congress
both during the course of national struggle for freedom and after independence.
Indeed, his position in the Congress was second only to Gandhi so long as the
latter lived, and the supreme after the death of the Mahatma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nehru’s
appearance on the Indian political stage was slow but decisive. Up to 1926 he
did not make any substantial contribution </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to the national
movement, except that of following Gandhiji with certain reservations. In 1926
he went to Europe where he stayed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for about a year and
nine months. His visit to Europe may be considered a definite turning point in
the development of his political thinking. Up to this time, nationalism had
undoubtedly been his principal theme and it continued to be of very great
importance right up to 1947, and after, but his extended stay in Europe gave
him a better perspective of Indian problems against the broader background of
the world situation. Furthermore, he came into personal contact with many
socialists and left-wing labour organisations while attending the Congress of
Oppressed Nationalities held in Brussels. The Brussels Congress, in which
communists played an important role, revealed to Jawaharlal the inner conflicts
of European labour. He was impressed by communism. In November 1927, he visited
Soviet Russia and saw the tremendous changes there under the communist regime.
But the communists often annoyed him by their methods, which he regarded as
dictatorial and vulgar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is significant that Nehru had not committed himself to any definite social ideology
until the age or thirty-eight. Nationalism continued to be a prominent thread
in the fabric of his political thinking. This was inevitable, as all of his
thinking was done in the context of the struggle for national independence.
Socialism was largely a theoretical issue, until independence would be
attained. Nevertheless, from 1927 onwards, and through the 1930s, socialism
increasingly provided the basic pattern for the fabric, into which the older
thread of nationalism was woven. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his return to India, Nehru attended the 42nd session of the Congress, held in
Madras in the last week of December 1927. At the Madras Session, he committed
the Congress to the goal of “complete national independence”, by making it to
pass a resolution to that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

travelled a great deal and delivered many public addresses. Everywhere he spoke
on political independence and social freedom and made the former a step towards
attainment of the latter. As he was against the idea of Dominion Status, he, on
December 27, 1928, moved an amendment to Mahatma Gandhi’s resolution on
Dominion Status at the all-India Congress Committee held in Calcutta, under the
presidentship of his father, and reiterated the demand for complete
independence. Next year he was elected President of the Congress. On December
29, 1929, he presided over the Lahore Session of the Congress and made </span><span

independence the unalterable goal of India. In his presidential address, he
firmly stated that independence for Indians meant complete freedom from

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
was Nehru’s first major triumph in national policies. The resolutions passed by

lapsed; henceforth the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Working </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Committee of the Congress passed a resolution
fixing January, 26th as Independence Day. January 26, 1930 was hailed as
Independence Day, and great gatherings all over India stood to take pledge drafted
by Jawaharlal Nehru. The pledge set complete independence as the goal, to be
pursued by means of non-violent civil disobedience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
moved gradually towards the realization of her goal. During the period from
1930 till 1947, Nehru repeatedly stated that the ultimate goal of India was not
Dominion Status but the attainment of complete independence, and all the
Congress resolutions were famed with this goal in view. During the years
1931-’33, he was much distressed by the growing communal spirit in the country.
And he thought that the only solution to India’s communal problem was a free
Constitution prepared by a fully representative Constituent assembly. At the
Bombay Session of the Congress in 1934, he, therefore, moved a resolution for
convening a Constituent Assembly to frame a suitable Constitution for free
India, which the Congress appro</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was in view of his demand for complete independence that Nehru rejected the
Government of India Act of 1935 and termed it as a “new chapter of slavery.” He
tried to move the Congress to fight against it. He was not satisfied with
anything less than complete independence. He was vehemently opposed to the idea
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
accepting the office under what he described as the “slave constitution.” He
considered the possibility of “co-operation with </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the Raj” a
grave danger to the national movement. Nevertheless, he accepted, though
reluctantly, the Working Committee resolution in 1937 for the acceptance of
office and formation of Ministries under the Act of 1935. It was because he was
made to understand that the Congress wanted to fight the new constitution and
end it by all means within its power, inside and outside the Legislatures.
Clarifying his position, he stated: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru wanted the Government to clarify its </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>war aims in terms of
Indian independence. He held freedom as prerequisite for India joining the
Allies. The Congress fully supported his stand, and it prepared for civil
disobedience, if the British Government forced India to side the Allies,
without first declaring its war aims in terms of Indian freedom. Nehru had
already set the tone of thinking of the Congress, and by and large Congress
policy followed the lines indicated by him in his letter to the <i>Manchester
Guardian </i>on September 8, 1938. And he worked as the major draftsman of the
Congress Working Committee resolution of September 14, 1939, on “War aims and
India.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

individual civil disobedience was declared under the leadership of Gandhiji.
Nehru was arrested in October, 1940, and he remained in prison until June 1945,
except for a short period in 1942. After 1945, events moved swiftly in the
direction of Indian independence. In February, 1946, a Cabinet Mission was sent
to India to draw up a plan of self-government for the country. The plan, which
was proposed, engendered further controversy between the Congress and the
League. In August, 1946, Nehru, in his capacity as Congress President, was
asked by Lord Wavell, the Viceroy, to form a Government at the Centre.
Jawaharlal headed the Interim Government until the time of partition. In March,
1947, Lord Mountbatten came to India as the new Governor-General. In rapid
succession partition was agreed upon, the Indian Independence Act was passed,
and on August 15, 1947, independence and partition were effected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
independence Nehru assumed full leadership of the country, and carried the
Congress with him to give a practical shape to his nationalist thought. He
fought against communalism, religious dogmatism, casteism and provincialism as
he thought that unity of India was the supreme concern of the day. For him, the
unity of India was not merely an intellectual conception, but was an emotional
experience which overpowered him. That essential unity, he felt, had been so
powerful that no political division, no disaster or catastrophe, had been able
to overcome it. Nationalism meant to him an emotional integration of the
people. He constantly reminded the nation of its great future, and called upon
the people to stand straight and look up at the skies, keeping their feet
firmly planted on the ground, and to bring about a synthesis, namely the
integration of the Indian people. The emergence of India in the mid-twentieth
century as a united and secular state must be regarded as the development of
Nehru’s thought. Indeed India was shaped on the pattern of his outlook and
thought, and the Congress was only to follow his lead. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
field in which Nehru influenced the Congress was the economic field. As a law
student of about twenty-one years of age, he was vaguely attracted to the
Fabians and socialistic ideas in general. His revisionist socialism had much in
common with the thought of the Fabians, but he reached that position somewhat
independently. In fact, it was the thought of Marx and Lenin which first
brought him to a real commitment to socialism. Under the impact of Marxism he
interpreted imperialism as the last gasping effort of a decadent capitalism
about to be swept away by the onward march of world socialism. Inexorable
historical forces, according to him, had already deemed the British rule in
India. Further, Nehru saw in Marxism a scientific approach to economic and
social problems. It was the essential freedom from dogma and the scientific
outlook of Marxism that appealed to him. But above all, he found in Marxism a
moral concern for the downtrodden masses which coincided with his own idealism.
In 1920 Nehru had discovered for himself the utter wretchedness in which
peasant India existed. Because of his growing sensitivity to India’s poverty,
he was attracted to a philosophy which took the problem </span><span

the late twenties of the century Nehru was found busy in directing people’s
attention to economic and social changes. Towards the close of 1929, the
Congress Session was held at Lahore under his presidentship. A few weeks before
that, he had presided over the All-India Trade Union Congress at Nagpur, “It
was very unusual,” Nehru wrote, “for the same person to preside over both the
National Congress and the Trade Union Congress within a few weeks of each
other.” He hoped to bring the two movements closer to each other–“the National
Congress to become more socialistic, more proletarian, and organised labour to
join the national struggle”.<sup>2</sup> As the National Congress possessed a
bourgeois outlook, Nehru worked to drive the Congress to a more radical
ideology in facing social and economic issues. At the Lahore Session of the
Congress, he took a firm step to declare that he was “a socialist and a
republican”, and was “no believer in kings and princes”.<sup> 3</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

leftist philosophy under Nehru’s leadership began to grow within the Congress.
A significant step in a socialist direction was taken in 1931 at the Karachi
Session. The Congress Working Committee was persuaded by Nehru to adopt a
guardedly socialist resolution on fundamental Rights and Economic Policy,
which, besides many other things, said, “The State shall own or control key
industries and services, mineral resources, railways, waterways, shipping and
other means of public transport”.<sup> 4</sup> The Karachi Resolution was the
first official Congress pledge in favour of socialism. It was a personal
triumph for Nehru, as the resolution laid, to some extent, the foundation of a
socialist democratic state that he thought of building in free India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was, however, not all smooth sailing. The effect of Nehru’s socialist
propaganda upset many elder Congressmen. The rightists in the Congress believed
that the socialist programme might weaken the national struggle by dividing the
nationalist forces. But Nehru continued with his socialist plans and
activities. He clearly stated that socialism had coloured all his outlook and
activity. Political independence was undoubtedly the paramount issue, but the
country, he believed, must take the road <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to<i>
</i>s</span>ocialism if it wanted to solve effectively the problem of poverty
and unemployment. He was determined to go his own way, whether he remained
Congress President or not. The basic objectives, which he set before the
Congress at its Faizpur Session held at the end of December, 1936, were
tinctured with socialistic spirit; and it was with these objectives in view
that the election campaign was to be launched. In the forthcoming elections,
the Congress gained a striking victory. One of the main reasons for the success
of Congress was the mass appeal of its election manifesto, the credit for which
must go to Nehru. In fact, his influence on both the Congress and the Indian
masses was decisive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

slipshod manner in which the Congress Ministries functioned. Being discouraged
by the trend of Congress politics and the growing communalism in the country,
he devoted his attention to the activities of the National Planning Committee,
which was established in 1938 at the instance of the Congress. As the
fascination of this work grew on him, he came to realize the hard realities
which faced planning in a country like India, with diverse interests and social
diversities. Broadly he faced two problems: the socialist one aiming at the
elimination of the profit motive and emphasising the importance of equitable
distribution; and big business striving to retain free enterprise and the
profit motive as far as possible, and laying greater stress on production. There
were other approaches as well. National self-sufficiency was taken, however, to
be the objective for the country, and planning had to be thought of with that
end in view. It was to the credit of Nehru that in that first attempt at
comprehensive planning for India he could lead the Committee to think that the
future of India lay i</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

disappeared as the war came, followed by Nehru’s imprisonment, release, and the
revolution, and again imprisonment, etc. But the serious attention to planning,
which he had paid, led him to form certain clear ideas as to the shape of
things to come. In 1946 he, as head of the Interim Government, indicated that
one of the basic principles, which his Government liked to follow, was to
combat poverty, remove economic inequality and raise the standards of living,
so that the way to socialism in the country might be paved. In December, 1946,
while moving the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly, he
emphatically stated that new India would be a democracy, a democracy not in an
ordinary sense but the fullest democracy. He urged the House to declare that
India would stand for socialism and that she would go towards the Constitution
of a socialist state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with all his strength to build India on socialistic lines. With the passing of
years, he gained maturity to his thought and consequently, his earlier
socialism underwent a considerable change. He now thought that the old style
capitalism had been greatly modified and that the attainment of the socialist
state could be sought by means of the democratic process. While proceeding to
work for a democratic socialist state, he kept in view the peaceful techniques
and the requirements of time. He thus moved cautiously towards a Socialistic
Pattern of Society which, according to him, must be classless and casteless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru went with the planning. As he claimed, it aimed at the establishment of a

of the scientific revolution which is transforming the world. The resolutions
moved at the All-India Congress Committees at Avadi and Nagpur were inspired by
Nehru. He wanted the Congress to follow a more definite and determined policy
to create a new social outlook. Democracy could not long survive in a country
where poverty and unemployment remained unsubdued! A way out had to be found
and Avadi showed the light. It was there that the All-India Congress Committee
decided that “planning should take place with a view to the establishment of a
socialist pattern of society,” where the principal means of production would be
under social ownership and control and where there would be “equitable
distribution of national wealth.” The Nagpur Resolution on land reforms
emphasised ceilings on land and joint-co-operatives. Thus the Congress, under
the dynamic leadership of Nehru, moved to build India a democratic socialist
society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

years, the Congress remained engrossed in internal politics, and it paid little
attention to foreign affairs. It was during the nineteen-twenties that the
Congress turned towards other countries, and gradually developed a foreign
policy based on the principles of elimination of imperialism everywhere and the
co-operation of free nations. Appreciating this <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the Congress to show a greater and greater interest in international politics,
and to work for the development of friendly relations with neighbouring
Countries. As early as 1927, he moved a resolution at the Madras Session,
persuading the Congress therein to declare unequivocally that India could be no
party to an imperialist war. He stated that there was no antagonism between
nationalism and internationalism. On the contrary, he pleaded that
internationalism <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>could </span>develop
only in a free country. According to him, there could be no effective
internationalism so long as some nations remained subordinate to Imperialist
powers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

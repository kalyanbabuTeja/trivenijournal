<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raghunathabhyudaya of Ramabhadramba.</I>–(Bulletins of the sanskrit Department –No. 2.–Edited by T. R. Chintamani, M.A., Ph.D., University of Madras.--1934. Price Re. 1. Foreign 2sh.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Sanskrit poem deals with the life of the Nayak king Raghunatha who lived in the earlier half of the seventeenth century; the author was a beloved mistress of that king. The character of the king is likely therefore to be somewhat idealised and his achievements given exaggerated values. But a careful historian can easily quarry from this poem considerable historical material. His conclusions can be corroborated by the <I>Sahityaratnakara, </I>another extant historical poem about the same king, and verified by the numerous inscriptions and other historical records of the period. A mention of this poem was made by Dr. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar in his ‘Sources of Vijayanagar History’ and by Mr. T. A. Gopinatha Rao in the ‘Madras Christian College Magazine’ but the poem itself has not been published till now. Dr. Chintamani has done considerable service to the students of South Indian history by obtaining a transcript of this poem from the manuscript in the Saraswati Mahal Library at Tanjore and editing it with an introductory note on the author and a summary in English, canto by canto, of the contents of the Kavya.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from its obvious value to the student of history, the poem is a notable and welcome addition to Kavya literature. The poetess is apparently endowed with a rich imagination and commands an easy flowing style. The use of <I>alankaras </I>reveals considerable poetic talent. There are many delightful echoes from the <I>Ramayana </I>and the works of Kalidasa. The quaint conceits of the authoress add a rare charm to the descriptive portions of the poem. Special mention may be made of the descriptions of the Cauvery river and the Chola country. The poetess has, besides, the rare gift of turning maxims into epigrams which have the ring of proverbs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How the ‘charming descriptions, the edifying dialogues and the luminous excursuses’ of the <I>Ramayana </I>have permeated the mind of the poetess as well as the daily life of her hero is rendered apparent at every turn of this poem, in the poetic descriptions as well as in the delineations of the characters. There is a delightful summary of the <I>Ramayana </I>story in the fourth canto which brings out prominently how the hero Raghunatha modeled his life on the life of Sri Rama.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concluding cantos, eleven and twelve, contain an intimate description of the Nayak’s harem. Sanskritic and Sastraic studies had permeated the lives even of the women of the period; and the several accomplishments of the ladies of the royal court of Raghunatha Nayak in the triple streams of culture–poetry, music and drama–ought to enthuse modern Indian women in their attempts to regain their past eminence and glory.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another feature of the poem, for which lovers of Carnatic music and South Indian dance as well as research workers in those topics feel thankful to Dr. Chintamani, is that the last canto contains references to the <I>ragas </I>and dances in vogue in the earlier part of the seventeenth century.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Unadisutras in Various Recensions.</I>–(Madras University Sanskrit Series, No.7, Part 6. Edited by T. R. Chintamani, M.A., Ph.D., University of Madras.–1934. Price Rs. 3. Foreign 6 sh.).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This part contains the <I>Unadi Sutras </I>of Bhoja and those of the Katantra school with the commentaries or ‘vrittis’ of Dandanatha Narayana and of Durga-simha respectively. Both these sets of sutras are different from the sutras of me Paniniyan school. The sutras of the Katantra school have been published in the Bibliotheca Indica Series; but that edition does not contain the portion relating to Unadi. For the first time, both the sutras and the commentary of Durga-simha have been published, as part of the Series of Unadi Sutras, by Dr. Chintamani. The commentary is bound to be of considerable help not only in the study of the sutras of the Katantra but also in arriving at the correct readings of several of them. The Editor has been put to considerable difficulties in reconstructing the text from the only palm-leaf manuscript available to him, which in several places was moth-eaten, rendering the deciphering of the letters almost impossible in very many places. The tentative readings given by Dr. Chintamani will, it is hoped, stand the test of corroboration by other scholars who may have access to other manuscripts, containing the text and commentary of these sutras; in any case, in the absence of other copies these tentative readings will be welcome to students of Sanskrit grammar as supplementing Professor Eggeling’s edition and helping in the reconstruction of the sutras of the Katantra school.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other set of sutras forms a part of the Sanskrit Grammar <I>Saraswati Kanthabharana </I>of Bhoja, the full text of which work the learned Editor will be publishing shortly. The Unadi portion of the sutras are now issued along with a commentary by one Dandanatha, valuable suggestions about whose identity are contained in the introduction. Neither these sutras nor the commentary have been published before. Dr. Chintamani has, however, in his edition of Paniniyan Unadisutras (published as part 2 of this number) given the correlations made by Narayana Bhatta between the sutras of the Paniniyan school and the Bhoja sutras and also published the list, given by that commentator, of the sutras of Bhoja which could not be brought under any of the Paniniyan sutras. The publication of the authentic text of the Bhoja sutras will enable the student of Vyakarana to appreciate the efforts of Narayana Bhatta to make a comparative study of the sutras of the two schools.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that the textual readings relating to these Unadi Sutras are noted under the corresponding section of the <I>Saraswatikanthabharana. </I>It would have been more convenient to the student of the Unadisutras to have them incorporated in this part itself.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">ENGLISH</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social and Political Life in the Vijayanagara Empire.–</I>By Dr. B. A. Saletore, with a Foreword by Dr. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, (B. G. Paul &amp; Co., Madras 1934, Volumes I and II, Pages LV+470+525, Rs. 10.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These two volumes form a very creditable addition to the respectable number of valuable publications on South Indian history which Messrs. Paul &amp; Co., have issued in recent years. The reputation which this firm has established in the field of historical publications on South India is perhaps unrivalled in Madras; and the present attempt is quite in keeping with the past record of the firm. The author of these two volumes is a scholar of the Germanic type with training and experience in Berlin, and he has had the benefit of guidance under that punctilious scholar who has made for himself a unique name in Indian history, namely, the Rev. Fr. Heras. The volumes have been published with the aid of a grant from the Publication Fund of the University of London and a generous donation by a gentleman who has preferred to remain anonymous. They are dedicated to Dr. L. D. Barnett, the author’s teacher and guide. A short introduction from the pen of Dr. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar adds to the value of the work which was originally approved as thesis for the Doctorate of Philosophy in the University of London in 1931.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Volume I begins with the detailed classification of the copious bibliographical sources upon which the author has relied. An idea of the thoroughness of the list can be seen from the fact that it covers 42 pages. The volume contains 9 chapters besides an introduction. In the first of these the author describes the country in general and in the succeeding chapters he deals successively with the capitals of the empire, the revenue administration, central government, local government, ‘justice and oppression,’ foreign relations (with some reference to Hindu-Muhammadan amity), and the army.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Volume II has got 9 chapters devoted to the description of the Varnasrama-dharmas, the social institutions in general, the Brahmins, women, social legislation; public service, honours and patriotism; habitation, food and dress, corporate life in social matters, and lastly, festivals, games and amusements. In every chapter there is a general introduction dealing with pre-Vijayanagara times, followed by the details connected with Vijayanagara. Every fact is supported by ample quotations from all the original authorities, indigenous and foreign. There are occasionally expressions of views which may not be unanimously approved. But the author always tries to demonstrate his views with copious documentation. This volume is illustrated with a picture of the Virupaksha temple and three other pictures to illustrate dancing and hunting scenes taken from temple walls. There is a glossary of technical terms covering over 40 pages, followed by an index of 56 pages. The author, it will be thus observed, has rendered a substantial service to the cause of South Indian history. Though it is regrettable that, in a scheme planned so largely and carried out so successfully, there are no special chapters allotted to the numerous schools of literature and philosophy; though the reader misses the large achievements of the people in the field of Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and Kanarese literatures, as well as the large number of spiritual and philosophical treatises which appeared copiously in all shades of religious thought from the numerous village colonies which were established on a large scale by the emperors throughout the vast expanse of the empire; there can be no doubt that the exhaustive study of all the other aspects of the history of this glorious period of South India is a thing of which the author may be proud and for which students of Indian history cannot be sufficiently grateful.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Metaphysics of Berkeley.</I>–By G. W. Kaveeshwar, M.A. (Published by Mrs. Ashavati Kaveeshwar, C/O Mr. M. K. Bakshi., B.A., Headmaster, Government High School, Khandwa, C. P. Price Rs. 2-8 net.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lucid as the critical exposition of the Metaphysics of Berkeley is, the value of the book is enhanced by the parallelism that is drawn between the Berkeleian system and Vijnanavada. The author agrees with Fraser in characterising Berkeley’s position as ‘Spiritual Realism,’ a theory which holds that ‘what-so-ever is real is ultimately spiritual in essence.’ Superficial students of Berkeley are apt to regard his metaphysical system as subjective idealism; and this mode of understanding his philosophy is not without support from his own writings. When he says that the <I>esse </I>of every object dc is its <I>percipi, </I>he appears exactly to re-echo the dictum of the Vijnanavadins that, because blue and the cognition thereof are never seen apart, they must be identical.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But what is essential in Berkeley’s system is not its subjectivistic tendency. Mr. Kaveeshwar distinguishes subjective idealism, which holds that each particular thing lasts only so long as the particular perception of it by some one Individual percipient lasts, from objective idealism according to which a thing continues to exist so long as any spirit is perceiving it, and he gives it as his opinion that what is essential in Berkeley’s philosophy is its vein of objective idealism.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thoughtful students of Berkeley will agree with him in his view that the Irish Bishop destroyed matter in order to make room for God. Berkeley confuses metaphysics with theology; and Berkeley’s philosophy is essentially a theology –a doctrine about God. Many of the criticisms which the author of this book levels against the inconsistencies of Berkeley’s metaphysics are acute and just; and the book, while being a valuable addition to the literature in the field, is likely to be particularly useful to Indian students of Western Philosophy.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From Wrong Angles.</I>–By Gagan Vihari Mehta (Published by the Author, 70 A, Chakarabare Road, Calcutta. Price Re. 1-8-0, pp. 181).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Mehta has been known to the Indian reading public as a contributor to some of our leading journals and periodicals. By family tradition and present vocation he belongs to ‘big business.’ In this volume he steps aside from the high seriousness of commerce and in a mood of sportive banter makes fun of our problems and politicians. To a people like us not particularly endowed with the sense of humour, works like Mr. Mehta’s are of great value. They afford not only intellectual delectation but help understanding, for a good smile makes the world kin. In the preface the author has quoted from a French journal, ‘I hasten to make fun of everything lest it make me weep,’ which forms as it were the moral justification of the present work. The opening paper, ‘The Viceroy of Tomorrow,’ is in the author’s best vein. It is less an effort at parody than an essay in psychology. It is an imaginative reconstruction of the reactions of some of our leading politicians to the startling thought of their becoming the Viceroy of India. Other notable papers are. ‘Geometry of the First Round Table Conference;’ ‘How to repair the Round Table,’ ‘Third Round,’ ‘Impressions and Depressions’ and ‘A singular outburst of Plurals.’ Mr. Mehta is gifted with a style that is suited to the purpose. It is light without being trivial, and his epigrams and paradoxes have all the naturalness and spontaneity that can only be found with humourists of a class. This is a book which ought to be read and enjoyed.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Natya Kala.</I>–(7, Thambu Chetty St., Madras, Annual subscription Rs. 2, Single copy As. 8).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This quarterly journal, devoted to drama and the fine arts, is the official organ of the ‘Andhra Nataka Kala Parishat.’ Recognising the need for a co-ordination of all artistic activities in Andhra, the Parishat brings together, every year, actors and playwrights, musicians and dancers. The Telugu stage must be so transformed as to make it the brightest expression of the artistic talents of the people. While we have gifted actors amongst us, the plays produced are pitiful. The advent of the ‘contract play’ has lowered the tone of our performances. The Parishat is seeking to reform the stage, to encourage playwrights, to build up a National Theatre. The <I>Natya Kala </I>is a worthy exponent of the ideals of the Parishat. It is exceedingly well-produced and contains representative articles on every aspect of the art of the theatre. There is some amount of overlapping of themes in the first number, and far too many photographs of actors off the stage. Mr. N. V. Seshayya is a great enthusiast, and under his editorship the <I>Natya Kala </I>is bound to occupy a high rank among Andhra journals.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A History of India.</I>–Part I, The Hindu Period. By M. Somasekhara Sarma (The Indian Publishing House Ltd., Madras. Price Re. 1.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not often that a school-book on history rises to the dignity of literature. Mr. Sarma, however, is a writer of beautiful Telugu prose, in addition to being a research scholar of high attainments. In his books and papers, he maintains the standards set by his Guru, the late lamented K. V. Lakshmana Rao. The present work, ostensibly prepared ‘in accordance with the Syllabus for Group A of the S.S.L.C.,’ deserves a much loftier place than the one it seeks to fill. It incorporates the results of the latest research, and even students of the B.A. classes may turn to it with profit. Within the short compass of less than 300 pages, it narrates the story of our strivings and failures, and the vicissitudes of our religious and cultural life. To the general reader, happily free from the incubus of examinations, Mr. Sarma’s book is an ideal introduction to the study of Indian history.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Udayini.</I>–(Published six times a year. Annual subscription Rs. 4. Single copy As. 12. 15, Audiappa Mudali Street, Vepery, Madras.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the ill-starred <I>Jayanti </I>ceased publication, we have not come across any Telugu journal fit to take its pace as the interpreter of the progressive tendencies in Telugu literature. A host of cheap periodicals have come up, which have vulgarised the public taste and dragged journalism into the mire. <I>Udayini, </I>edited by Mr. Kompella Janardana Rao, seems almost like the <I>Jayanti </I>reborn under happier auspices. As a reviewer in the <I>Kistna Patrika </I>puts it, the <I>Udayini </I>inherits the ‘unfulfilled renown’ of <I>Sahiti, Sakhi, </I>and <I>Jayanti. </I>It has already enlisted the co-operation of nearly all the leading writers in prose and verse. Beautiful in form, and rich in its contents, <I>Udayini </I>is an ornament to Telugu journalism. Besides poems and stories, the first two numbers give us some valuable literary criticism. We are unable, however, to reconcile ourselves to the prose style of the Editor.</P>

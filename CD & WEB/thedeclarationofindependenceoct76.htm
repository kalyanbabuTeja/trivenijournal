<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
July 1776, a group of 56 men, of whom at least 50 were members of the Masonic
Fraternity, signed a document which has come to be considered one of the great
landmarks in human history. Largely authored by one of the most illumined and
literate men of the 18th century, Thomas Jefferson, that document­–the
Declaration of Independence–established the separation of the American colonies
from England on the basis of certain philosophical premises current in the Age
of Enlightenment. The significance of the Declaration has been said to lie in
the fact that it translated concepts concerning the inherent rights of man,
rights, that is, which every human being possesses simply by virtue of his being
human, from the philosophical sphere to the political arena.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
bicentennial of American independence has <span class=SpellE>focussed</span>
the attention of nations throughout the world on the radical basis on which a
democratic nation was first established. For the theoso­phical student, this
bicentennial may provide a useful occasion to examine certain correspondences
between what may be called a collective intent to achieve national freedom and
the stages required for the individual achievement of personal freedom. Students
of the esoteric philosophy are inevitably concerned with the question of
freedom, a term which may be taken as synonymous with liberation and even with
self-realization. The question of what constitutes true freedom has always
engaged the philosophical mind. Philosophers both eastern and western have
attempted to resolve the question of whether or not man is essentially free.
The men who signed the Declaration of Independence, however, did not debate the
philosophical issue; they stated, rather, that all men have an inherent right
to enjoy liberty and towards that end may establish their own government which
derives its powers from the governed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>An
exploration of what may be termed the “American experience,” based on the
Declaration of Independence, may be helpful in understanding our own situation.
Often ideas that first emerge in the collective consciousness of a group or
institution must ultimately be brought into full realization by each
individual, for only thus is their validity proved and the evolutionary
progress of the whole assured. For example, we may suggest that the world today
is experiencing a kind of a “Roman moment” of history, a time when the forces
of materialism are set in direct opposition to all that would uplift and
advance the human spirit. In a parallel manner, every individual comes to the
point in his life, a “Roman moment,” when the forces that would hold him in
bondage to material interests, selfish concerns, <span class=GramE>personal</span>
desires are sharply opposed by his spiritual aspirations, his concern for the
welfare of others and his recognition of the brotherhood of humanity.
Similarly, the American experience founded on a declaration of the equality of
all men and the consequent right of all to enjoy certain freedoms must become
the experience of every individual as he seeks to free himself from his bondage
to the past and to all that would enslave him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
tracing the correspondences between the collective and individual experience of
freedom, there are three aspects especially which deserve our attention. A
study of the state of affairs in the American colonies in 1776 reveals, first,
that the Declaration of Independence was drawn up and signed in the very midst
of the struggle to achieve that independence and not after the war for independence
had been won. In fact, in July 1776 the out­come of the conflict was even in
some doubt, as the men who signed the Declaration knew full well when they
mutually pledged “to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred <span
class=SpellE>honour</span>.” Second, it must be noted that the Declaration
marked not so much the achievement of freedom as the <i>intent </i>to establish
that freedom by the enunciation of principles on which an independent state
could be founded. The third aspect which deserves consideration is the fact that
the union which was visualized by the Declaration was not achieved all at once,
even when the conflict then raging was ended. The goal of union of the separate
colonies was realized in a series of stages and after several failures (e.g.,
the Articles of Confederation were replaced by the U. S. Constitution, but even
then the issue of federalism versus states’ rights was resolved only after a
bitter Civil War nearly a century after the Declaration of Independence).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
what is the significance of those three factors revealed by a study of the
collective experience in achieving national inde­pendence when we consider the
individual or personal experience in the attainment of freedom or liberation?
There are, I suggest, certain valid parallels between the group experience and
indi­vidual realization. At the outset, we may note that just as the colonies
were subject to a foreign power which many began to feel was an unjust
relationship, so in our individual lives we may come to recognize that we are
in bondage to desires, illusions, prejudices which actually constitute a “foreign
power” within us and from which we must free ourselves or continue to pay
tribute to that power. So the idea of freedom must first arise within us: we
must know it is possible to break the bonds that have held us subject to the
past or enslaved us in the present. There must be born in our consciousness an
awareness of the inalienable right of the self to be free, free from the
illusions of the personal self, the desires and passions that bind us and
shadow our lives. And then in the very midst of the struggle to be free, we
must declare our intention to liberate ourselves. There can be nothing vague
about this, nothing equivocating: we must commit ourselves fully, pledging our
total resources to the task of winning through to self-realization which is
true freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
first step, then, is a declaration of the way we intend to travel, a statement
of the goal we intend to achieve. We must define the nature of the freedom we
expect to gain; we must know in what liberation consists. It may not be
possible to know in detail how we shall achieve our aim. Just so, the men
meeting in Philadelphia to draw up a Declaration of Independence did not at the
same time devise plans of military action or accompany the Declaration with
schemes of military strategy; they set, rather, the goal towards which finally
all subsequent actions would be directed. In a similar manner, we must clearly
perceive the end we would achieve and recognize that all of our energies must
be applied towards that end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
first stage may be analogous to the prerequisite for reaching <span
class=SpellE>Bodhisattvahood</span>, the state of compassionate enlighten­ment,
as outlined in Mahayana Buddhism. In many Buddhist texts, the aspirant is told
that at the outset there must arise in his mind and be held steadily present in
his consciousness through­out all the struggles that follow the thought of
ultimate enlightenment, <span class=SpellE><i>bodhicitta</i></span><i>. </i>So
the men of the colonies in 1776 had one thought dearly before them: the thought
of independence as a free and self-governed nation. We too, if we would achieve
self-realization, must have a clear vision of our goal and set forth fearlessly
and unhesitatingly our aim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
cannot wait until the inner struggle is won before <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>we<b> </b></span>announce our intention. Indeed the very declaration we
make may serve to intensify the conflict between the powers that would deny us
our freedom and that Immortal Self which must dis­entangle itself from the
bonds of personal enslavement. Not every aspect of ourselves will join in the
struggle nor even consent to engage in the revolution that must take place. It
would be a mistake, for example, to believe that everyone in the American
colonies supported the cause of independence or even <span class=SpellE>favoured</span>
separation from England. Many wanted to continue the ties at any price; the
Loyalist sympathizers were legion. So in our own nature, there will be many
elements that militate against our achievement of spiritual freedom; many
aspects of our personal selves will resist any breaking of ties with the animal
instincts, with our normal desires and customary ways of thinking and reacting.
Some parts of us may even prove traitors to the goal we seek, and we may find
ourselves seeking compromise with our own shadow, hoping to have the best of
both worlds as it were. To <span class=GramE>effect</span> a revolution in
ourselves is no easier than to establish a nation’s independence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally,
out of the group experience exemplified in the Declaration of Independence, we
may learn that freedom is sometimes achieved by stages and that ultimately true
freedom is best guaranteed when there is a centrality of government which will
uphold the rights and exact the obligations of each constituent part. In full
self-realization, the federal authority of the Atman has been established, but
there cannot be violated the natural rights of the mind now freed from
prejudice, of the emotions now purified of unwholesome desire, and of the
physical vehicle through which action that is selfless may flow unimpeded by reaction.
But in the achievement of that self-realization, we may need to proceed by
stages, establishing first a kind of loose confederation among the vehicles,
each demanding its own “rights” until each has learned that true freedom may
require the surrender of some portion of those “rights” in order that the whole
may prosper. If the mind, for example, claims complete independence, but the
emotions are bound by desires for self-aggrandizement, for self-gratification, how
can the mind be truly free? It is weighted by the pull of emo­tion and cannot
be free to receive spiritual insight and respond to intuitive understanding.
Only when the governance of the self is vested in the Self, the <i>Atman, </i>can
there be true freedom for all aspects of the self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
path to such freedom, to true liberation, has been given many names. In the
East, it is called Yoga. Dr I. K. <span class=SpellE>Taimni</span> has pointed
out, in <i>Glimpses into the Psychology of Yoga, </i>that “...the whole
philosophy and science of Yoga is based upon the assumption that man is
completely free himself from the illusions and limitations in which he is
involved and to become established in the world of Reality to which he really
belongs.” Here essentially is the final freedom; it was exemplified by the
action taken by 56 men in July 1776 and it is reconfirmed every time an
individual determines to follow the path to self-realization. The ultimate
freedom is our freedom to free ourselves. We are similarly free to bind
ourselves, to clasp about us the chains that spell enslavement, that hold us in
bondage to the personal self and its desires and passions. The choice is always
ours: “none else compels,” as <i>The Light of Asia </i>so beautifully phrases
the primary fact of our humanity, that to be human means to have the
inalienable right of a choice of ways.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>With the Kalyani session, the Indian National
Congress enters on an important phase of its career of service to the nation.
Having played a leading role in the struggle for freedom, the Congress took
over the administration of the country from the British, overcame the initial
difficulties consequent on Partition, consolidated the nation’s strength, and
planned for its social and industrial progress. But the organisation, which
started nearly seventy years ago as the champion of the people’s rights and
emerged as the Party in power at the dawn of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City> in 1947, has now to acquire new
virtues and display new qualities of leadership. Differences in temperament and
outlook led <span class=GramE>to one secession</span> after another from the
parent body. <span class=GramE>The secedes</span> formed themselves into
parties or groups, and, after the first General Election, they sat in
opposition to the Congress Governments in the Central and State Legislatures.
The Congress must therefore strive to retain its hold on the biggest body of
electors in the world, exercising adult franchise and looking to the leaders of
political parties to implement their programmes. Success at elections has become
the prime condition of continuance in power, and a complicated party-machine
has to be kept going from year to year, charged with the task of educating the
‘common man’ in every constituency not only with regard to his rights under the
Constitution but also his duties as the citizen of a democratic State. The
Congress still retains its idealism as well as the ability to guide our new
Democracy through the present tangled conditions, and to assert <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
position as the advocate of peace and goodwill among the nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
mere continuance in power, as a result of electoral victories, is not enough.
The Congress organisation has not maintained intimate contact with the people
in whose name the Congress Governments claim to govern. The emphasis must hereafter
be shifted from the Parliamentary programme of the Congress to its constructive
tasks as envisaged by Gandhiji. A better understanding between Congressmen in
office and in the Legislatures, and Congressmen in charge of what is called
‘field work’, is essential for the proper functioning of a great Party like the
Congress. Once this understanding is established, Ministers and legislators
will develop the strength of will to keep back the hordes of local party-men
who wish to promote their personal influence rather than the welfare of the
Constituency or the country. After a general election or even a bye-election, a
legislator must consider himself, as Pandit Nehru pointed out, the
representative of the entire population of the area and not merely of those who
voted for him. This applies with even greater force to the Ministers. So long
as the objectives of the Congress are defined on an all-India basis and applied
to the needs of the States, the Ministers owing allegiance to the Congress must
keep these objectives in view. But it does not follow that they should look at
every single problem, big or small, from a party point of view or appoint
persons to places of dignity and influence merely to promote party ends. There
was a time when the Congress was the nation. It has now to work its way back to
that position. This effort will involve the extending of the hand of fellowship
to the members of other democratic parties pledged to Parliamentary methods.
These can re-enter the Congress or co-operate with it in the implementation of
programmes conceived in the interest of the State as a whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It treated with superior disdain the members of the legal and the educational
professions and those who pursed art and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>literature. All these
were sympathetic towards the Congress but they did not identify themselves with
any political party. No effort has been made by Congressmen generally to profit
from the experience and the ability of these sections of the public, and, when
candidates are set up for any constituency, men of light and leading are
usually left out. This has resulted in the emergence of a class of legislators
definitely below par, unable to apply <span class=GramE>their</span> minds to
the serious study of public questions. Their contribution to the debates is a
blank, except for occasional vituperation. The dignity of the Legislatures,
particularly of the States, has to be restored by the selection of persons who
may not please the Party bosses or promote sectional interests in particular
areas, but yet function as wise legislators and custodians of national welfare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the open session of the Congress a great deal of heat was imported into the
discussion of the resolution dealing with the <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span>
of States. It was left to Pandit Nehru to restore a saner outlook and to treat
the question as one of national reconstruction. He wanted an integrated, united
nation, not a regimented nation, not a uniform nation”. He wished to preserve
“all the magnificent variety of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>”.
<span class=GramE>The appointment, by the Government of India, of a States
Re-organisation Commission consisting of Mr. Fazl Ali, Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Kunzru</span> and <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span> <span
class=SpellE>Panikkar</span> bas been widely welcomed.</span> When the
opponents of linguistic States wax eloquent over the need for Indian unity,
they forget that neither Andhra nor Karnataka ever claimed the right to cut
itself away from the Indian Union. They forget also that the greater part of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> is already divided on the basis of
language: U. P., Bengal, <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>, Orissa,
Rajasthan and <span class=SpellE>Saurashtra</span> are fairly homogenous units.
If a few more States are carved out in response to the reasonable demands of
the people of Southern and Western India, it cannot lead to the disintegration
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or to inefficiency from the point of view of the <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
of the country. The advocates of linguistic States are only asking for new
administrative units, based mainly on language and cultural traditions but not
ignoring considerations of military safety or financial viability. The Centre
is always welcome to take over particular areas like seaports or cantonments to
be administered directly by <span class=GramE>itself</span>. Nor is it denied
that citizenship of any linguistic State carries with it simultaneously the
citizenship of the Indian Union and the right to settle down, carry on
business, acquire property, or hold office throughout the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the Commission gets down to fundamentals, it
will realize that language is an important factor, though not the sole one, to
be taken into consideration. If linguistic rivalries have assumed ugly shapes,
it is largely due to the continued denial of the right of many millions of
Indian citizens to live an integrated life in well-knit, homogeneous States. It
is unfair to claim that the U. P., the <span class=SpellE>Bihari</span> and the
<span class=SpellE>Saurashtra</span> people are better all <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> patriots than those of Andhra, <st1:place
w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place> or Karnataka. These latter pulled their full
weight in the national struggle and placed Mother India on a high pedestal,
offering her their devotion and loyalty. Border-areas which are bi-lingual
present a problem and it is here that friction arises. But it will not be
beyond the wit of the Commission to evolve some reasonable formula for <span
class=GramE>demarcating</span> the border-line, and, in addition, for
safeguarding the interests of both the language groups in respect of education;
administration, and business. Among the knotty problems which the Commission has
to tackle are the future position of the <span class=SpellE>Rajpramukhs</span>,
the obliteration of the distinction between different classes of States–A. B.
or C–in the Indian Union, and the grouping of contiguous States into ‘regions’
for purposes of <span class=SpellE>defence</span> and fiscal policy. For the
first time after the achievement of freedom, the politicians and the thinkers
can address themselves to these questions in an atmosphere of quiet, and come
to conclusions based on an objective study of the facts and conditions of our
time. It is not necessary for Congressmen of the status of Sri S. K. <span
class=SpellE>Patil</span> to seek to create prejudice against the protagonists
of linguistic distribution by starting National Unity fronts and arguing that
linguistic States must inevitably lead to national disaster. He and his friends
are free to present their case to the Commission. If the Congress has directed,
Congressmen to desist from all kinds of open propaganda or agitation in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of linguistic States, the directive applies with
equal cogency to those who are opposed to the formation of such States.
Attention may now be diverted to the collection of the data to be presented to
the Commission. The Government of Andhra <span class=GramE>have</span>
appointed a special officer to gather the material relating to the border-areas
between Andhra and the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> States of Madras,
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>, and
Orissa. He and the non-official Committee which will work with him may be
depended upon to apply themselves with care to their immediate task. Other
States can copy this example and thus enable the Commission to assess the
conflicting claims in the border areas. The Commission work will form an
important landmark in modern Indian history.</p>

class=SpellE>Kshetragna</span> and <span class=SpellE>Tyagaraja</span> left a
rich heritage to Andhra, but it was given to the Tamils to cherish it and to
win for it India-wide recognition. With the establishment of a new State and
the growing desire to achieve excellence in diverse fields, the <span
class=SpellE>Andhras</span> must make amends for their neglect of music and
dance. An Academy is not merely an assemblage of scholars and artistes; it is a
center radiating a love of the Arts. It will train all aspirants and help them
to reach the highest levels. There is plenty of musical talent in Andhra but
not enough of sustained <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>. The artistes must
submit to a long course of discipline and pursue their art in a spirit of
dedication. An Academy can provide the proper atmosphere for the growth of the
Arts and draw unto itself the homage of all art-lovers.</p>

of Sri Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar earlier than January of this year. I recall
with gratitude the very generous and affectionate welcome accorded to <i>Triveni
</i>by the leading lawyers of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
in the early thirties. But for the atmosphere of tenderness then prevailing in
and around Luz Church Road, the infant journal could not have made any
progress, The stalwarts of that generation, <span class=SpellE>Sivaswamy</span>
<span class=SpellE>Aiyer</span>, <span class=SpellE>Venkatarama</span> Sastri,
Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar, and C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar–who is happily with us
still to cheer and to comfort in moments of anxiety–attached the highest value
to a cultural journal. The late Justice <span class=SpellE>Govindarajachari</span>
belonged to my generation, and his close association with <i>Triveni </i>secured
for it the special attention of Sri Alladi. Whenever <span class=SpellE>Govindarajachari</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Chandrasekharan</span> and <span class=GramE>myself</span>
went about for financial assistance to the journal, Sri Alladi would greet us
with his broad smile<i> </i>and his hearty ejaculation: “You three form the <i>Triveni.
</i>I can guess why you have come: Here is my <span class=SpellE>cheque</span>!”
It was in those days that <span class=SpellE>Govindarajachari</span> gave me a
little-known instance of Sri <span class=SpellE>Alladi’s</span> generosity. The
Maharaja of <span class=SpellE>Pithapuram</span> once sent him an extra ten
thousand, and Sri Alladi passed the amount to the Ramakrishna Students Home, <span
class=SpellE><i>Mylapore</i></span><i>, </i><span class=GramE>saying</span>,
“This is more than my stipulated fee. I cannot keep it. Let a good institution
have the benefit.” He knew how to earn and how to give away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

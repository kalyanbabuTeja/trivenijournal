crises in the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place> and in the Soviet
satellite empire dominate the world situation to-day. Thus has once more been
brought home to all thinking men and women the truth that, in the actual world
as distinguished from the ideal world of imagination, issues are decided by the
presence of superior force, whether it be to our liking or not. It is enough
that the superior force is present. It need not be actually used. <span
class=GramE>The mere threat to use it, provided that there is a conviction that
it is superior, resolves the issues, however critical they may be.</span>
Superior logic may bring intellectual satisfaction. The expression of moral
indignation may bring emotional satisfaction. But they have very little
influence on the actual shaping of the course of events. It is only when logic
and moral indignation have the help of superior force that they have a chance
of winning. With superior force present, even issues, which have no logic or
moral right behind them, win. This has been the course of human history, and
events to-day <span class=GramE>are</span> one more illustration of the working
of this principle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Middle East crisis is a trial of strength between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>
on one side and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> and <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on"><span class=GramE>France</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span
class=GramE> on the other.</span> For a long time <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> dominated the area. Its
domination began in the nineteenth century when it commanded the largest amount
of force in the shape <span class=GramE>of an invincible navy and vast
financial resources</span>. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
too had similar ambitions in those days but the force at its command was
inferior to that of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was the legal ruler of all this area but she was too weak to resist these
outsiders. The Turks were as much aggressors in this area as the British and
the Russians. The only difference is that they were the earlier aggressors and
because of the superior force they then had, they conquered the Middle East and
<st1:place w:st="on">Northern Africa</st1:place> which constituted then and
which constitute now the Arab world. For four centuries they ruled over this
world. The Arabs had not the strength to overthrow the Turkish rule. The
attempt to overthrow it was made by the British and the Russians. The British
succeeded in the attempt and the Russians failed. The last scene in this
attempt was the <span class=GramE>first world war</span> (1914-18). At the
close of that war the British became rulers–either directly or indirectly, of
much of the Middle East–Iraq, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jordan</st1:country-region>,
<st1:City w:st="on">Palestine</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>
etc., with her ally <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
ruling over <st1:country-region w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Lebanon</st1:country-region> and some regions in <st1:place w:st="on">Northern
 Africa</st1:place>. The Arabs then welcomed the British domination as it meant
the overthrow of the four hundred years old Turkish rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no question of the British or the French possessing a moral right to rule
over all Arab countries. Such a rule was quite contrary to the principle of
national self-determination proclaimed by the British themselves along with
their French and American allies in the <span class=GramE>first world war</span>.
Having overthrown the Turks, they should have left the Arab countries to be
ruled by their own people. Such a course was consistent with principles of
morality and justice. But the British and French were not prepared to do it.
They said that it was they that made all the effort to overthrow the previous
aggressors, the Turks, and that it was just that the reward of the effort
should go to those who made the effort and succeeded in it. It meant that if
the Arabs wanted to become free, they should acquire the force needed to
overthrow the British and the French. And the history of the years following
the <span class=GramE>first world war</span>, from 1918 to the present day, is
the history of the efforts of the Arab countries of the Middle East and <st1:place
w:st="on">Northern Africa</st1:place> to gain this superior force to get rid of
the British and the French domination once and for all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Superiority
and inferiority are only relative terms. The difference between the force at
the disposal of the British and the French on one side and of the Arabs on the
other became less and less as a result of the losses sustained by the former in
the <span class=GramE>second world war</span> which brought them only a <span
class=SpellE>pyrrhic</span> victory. It would have grown still less if all the
Arab nations had been prepared to work together under the control of one common
government instead of as half a dozen independent States into which they became
distributed at the end of the first world war. One of the ambitions of Colonel
Nasser, the present ruler of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is to bring as many Arab States as possible under his leadership and offer a
united front to the British and the French. He has not, however, succeeded in
this, though the events of the last three months have revealed brighter
prospects in this direction. All the same, the growing weakness of the British
and the French resulted in the Arab States of the Middle East and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> becoming
politically independent. The French have ceased to be rulers of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Syria</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Lebanon</st1:country-region>
and the British, of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iraq</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region

and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Even in Northern Africa the French had to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span>
the independence of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Morocco</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Tunisia</st1:country-region>, their former
colonial dependencies, and they are engaged in a hard struggle to retain their
supremacy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Algeria</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
British control over the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place> was, like
all control, both political and economic. It was most reluctantly that they
yielded their political control. They have not even to-day completely yielded
it because they retain bases in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iraq</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jordan</st1:country-region> and they have
protectorates in the Persian Gulf and the <st1:place w:st="on">Red Sea</st1:place>.
They have a large amount of economic control through the oil companies
exploiting the oil resources of the area. The source of much of the prosperity
of these countries is their oil. Three fourths of the world’s oil reserves are
said to be in the Middle East and as oil will continue to be the most important
fuel until atomic energy is produced on an economic scale, those like the
British, who are already in possession of these resources, are not disposed to
give it up. If, for any reason, the British and the French find themselves
unable to get oil from the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place>, their
economic decline is certain, and they will have to be satisfied with a low
standard of living. It is through the <st1:place w:st="on">Suez Canal</st1:place>
that they get most of the supplies of oil, and this is the reason why they
regard freedom of navigation through the canal as a matter of life and death to
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What is the best way of interpreting and
understanding the events of the last three months in the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle
 East</st1:place>? We have to take, as our starting point, the existence of a
conflict of interests between the British and the French on one side and the
Arabs on the other in this area. All this is the land of the Arabs. They do not
want British and French domination in any form. They want to be complete
masters in their lands. This is an axiomatic truth about which there cannot be
any argument or controversy. This is the essence of Arab nationalism as it is
of nationalism in general. If the Arabs are to be complete masters of their
lands, all traces and relics of British and French domination should be swept
away. The existence of the Suez Canal Company is one relic of that domination.
This Company was originally formed to work the Suez Canal in days when Egypt
was a dependency. It was a Company in which the majority of shares was held by
the British, the French, and other foreigners. It had a lease for 99 years
expiring in 1968, and it was agreed that at its expiry control over the canal should
automatically revert to Egypt. There was the international convention of 1888
under which the Company was required to allow free navigation in the canal for
the ships of all nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
happened on July 26, this year, was Colonel Nasser’s <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>
of the Suez Canal which is a water-way passing </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>entirely over
Egyptian territory and consequently subject to Egyptian, sovereignty. <span
class=SpellE>Nationalisation</span> was the logical outcome of Egypt’s
independence. Egypt had every legal right to do this, especially when Colonel
Nasser made it clear that compensation would be paid to the shareholders. The
British and the French did not accept this, though they said there was nothing
illegal about it. They opposed <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>
because they entertained a fear and suspicion that it would be followed by some
kind of discrimination against their ships in the matter of tolls and in the
provision of other facilities for navigation. Such a discrimination would
result in their Middle East oil supplies being cut off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Why
did they entertain such fear and suspicion? It was primarily because they felt
that Nasser was a dictator who was determined to bring all the Arab world under
his control and that his success in such an enterprise would spell disaster to
them. He openly pursued an anti-British and anti-French policy. Not merely
this. According to their views he was becoming more and more pro-Soviet. He
opposed the Baghdad Pact created by the British for the protection of their
interests in the Middle East against Soviet aggression. He was getting arms
supplies from Soviet Russia and the Communist States allied with her. He was
thus, in co-operation with Soviet Russia, building a superior force for
himself. If he becomes the leader of the Arab countries, there would surely be
the risk of <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> of Middle East oil
companies, which would spell British economic ruin. With him at the head of the
Arabs, there would be obstruction to British communication with the Far East
and with Australia and New Zealand. One should not forget that the Middle East
is on the shortest route between Europe and the East, that it has a strategic
importance as the meeting place of three continents, and that in the British
view it would become a sphere of Soviet influence, the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>moment
that they lose control over it. They were therefore </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>afraid
that the <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> of the Suez Canal was
fraught with serious consequences for them, politically and economically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>The French
suspected Colonel Nasser because, according to them, he was the force behind all
the trouble they were having in their colonies in Northern Africa, especially
in Algeria. So long as he was in power the trouble would continue. They
therefore thought that it would be to their national interest to oust him from
all authority in Egypt. The <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> of the
Suez Canal is only a step taken by him to increase his prestige and influence
in the Arab world and they opposed it as they were unwilling to see any
increase in his prestige and influence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:32.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Suez Canal issue thus became a trial of strength between Nasser on one side and
the British and French on the other. If it was only the freedom of navigation
for the ships of all nations in the canal without any discrimination, Colonel
Nasser was prepared to give all the assurances that these, along with the
other, users of the canal wanted. He was prepared to stand by the international
convention of 1888, suitably revised in the light of modern conditions. As
suggested by India he was quite willing to the setting up of an International
Advisory Body to help the Egyptian Government in running the canal. What he
disliked was international control, which went quite contrary to the principle
of Egyptian sovereignty over a national highway. Several conferences were held
in London, after the canal was <span class=SpellE>nationalised</span>, to bring
pressure on Nasser to accept international control. But he was not prepared to
compromise on what he considered to be a fundamental principle of his country’s
sovereignty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the very beginning, the British and the French were determined to bring him
round by the use of force; and for this purpose, they moved their armies, navy
and airplanes to Cyprus. Unfortunately for them, however, they were deterred
from such a course by the United States. She was averse to any war against
Egypt as it would surely develop into a third world war with nuclear weapons.
She felt that it would be possible to get Nasser to agree to some arrangement
under which freedom of navigation across the canal could be guaranteed. She
also felt that it was time for her to tell her British and French allies
plainly and clearly that she could not indefinitely support them in their
colonial policies, as this was making her unpopular in the under-developed
world of Asia and Africa. She <span class=SpellE>realised</span> the strength
of Arab nationalism and the risk involved in using force to put it down. Any
use of force in this connection would bring Soviet Russia into the Middle East,
the one thing which the British, the French and all other members of the North
Atlantic Alliance were determined to prevent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
all these ten years of cold war, the British and the French were in close
alliance with the United States. It was this unity of the West that gave
strength to the Alliance. It is true that the Suez Canal issue was not the
first occasion when acute differences arose between the United States and
Britain. The British disliked the pressure which the United States brought on
them at the time of the oil crisis in Iran and the pressure to evacuate the
Suez Canal area in 1953. But it was now that the rift among the allies was open
and clear. The British and the French became increasingly dissatisfied with the
United States for the latter not having co-operated with them in their efforts
to retain international control over the canal. They were therefore determined
to act by themselves. And without consulting the United States, they issued an
ultimatum to Egypt and invaded her territories at the head of large forces on
the last day of October. They destroyed the air-bases of Egypt, her airplanes
and much of the arms supplies she received from the Communist countries. They
occupied a part of the canal zone. Thousands of Egyptians lost their lives.
Their purpose was to depose Colonel Nasser, set up a puppet government over
Egypt, and save for themselves, whatever power and influence they still had in
the Middle East and Northern Africa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

excuse put forward by the British and the French was, that they undertook that
‘police action’ to put a stop to a war between Israel and Egypt that had
already been going on, a war which would affect the free navigation of the Suez
Canal, the international lifeline, and establish peace in the Middle East,
which was being threatened by the attempts of Israel and the Arab States to
break the armistice terms imposed on them by the United Nations in 1949. No
one, however, was deceived by these excuses. Even in Britain, large sections of
the people condemned the actions of their government as amounting to open and
naked aggression, which brought <span class=SpellE>dishonour</span> to the
country, which threatened the disruption of the Commonwealth and the outbreak
of a third world war, in which Britain would be the first victim of nuclear
weapons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the root of the crisis in the Middle East is the State of Israel. This State is
only eight years old. It was a State established in the face of the opposition
of all Arabs. It was so established because Israel had superior force in
1948-49 when the Arab States opposed her and carried on warfare against her.
There could be no answer to the question whether it was morally right for the
Jews who left Israel two thousand years ago to return to Palestine on the
ground that it was at one time their homeland, to drive away more than half a
million Arabs to whom also Palestine was equally a homeland for two thousand
years, and establish a State of their own. But the fact is that they returned,
and because of their superior force, they established a State for themselves,
and are determined to defend it under all circumstances. There is also equally
the fact that the State of Israel has been <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>,
on the very day of its establishment, by Soviet Russia, the United States and
several other states, and that she is a member of the United Nations. With a
population of less than two millions, she has been maintaining a standing army
of about 75,000, with up-to-date weapons, and a reserve force of about 200,000.
In the war of 1948-49, the United Nations intervened and brought about an
armistice, which defined the boundaries of Israel. The U.N.O. has also an
armistice commission on the spot, whose duty is to see that neither Israel nor
the Arab States cross the armistice lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what has been the actual course of events? The Arab States have not at all <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> Israel. They are in a state of war with her. It
is a cardinal item in the policy of all of them to put an end to her. This has
been proclaimed on a number of occasions by them, and Colonel Nasser is as much
an adherent of this policy as any other Arab ruler. In spite of the armistice
and the armistice line, and the presence of the armistice commission, there
have been border clashes, especially between Israel and Jordan, and Israel and
Egypt. The supplies of arms to Egypt by Communist countries, going on for the
last one year, has strengthened her considerably from a military point of view.
Israel was unable to get similar supplies from the United States, Britain and
France. She was told that these three States had already entered into a pact
under which they were obliged to defend the existing frontiers of Israel in
case of aggression by Arab States and of the Arab States in case of aggression
by Israel and that that pact of 1950 would maintain peace in the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

withdrawal of the British from the canal zone, and the growing supply of Soviet
arms to Egypt, naturally alarmed Israel. To add to this, there was the military
alliance between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Jordan which had been an ally
of Britain, with a British contingent still stationed within her territory, was
becoming more and more anti-British. The elections recently held in that
kingdom brought into parliament an anti-British and pro-Communist majority.
Israel felt that all this would bring Jordan also closer to Egypt, all the more
because, most of the Arab refugees from Palestine were settled in Jordan. There
was also in recent months a movement of Iraqi forces to Jordan borders. All
this created alarm in the mind of Israel that the border clashes might
ultimately develop into a full scale war when the Arab States accumulated
superior force. According to Israel time was on the side of the Arabs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

therefore became convinced that it would not be to her interest to keep quiet
until the Arab States gathered superior force. She was determined to act. It is
not clear whether she had any understanding with Britain and France. She
crossed the armistice lines on October 28, and invaded Egyptian territory in
large numbers. She occupied the Gaza strip, and a large part of the Sinai
peninsula, advancing within a few miles of the Suez Canal, when the British and
the French began their invasion. The aggression of Israel was as much open and
naked as that of Britain and France, though she had some excuse, which the
other countries had not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

general <span class=SpellE>mobilisation</span>. But Israel paid no heed to such
warning, because she knew that it would be a mere warning, unaccompanied by any
throat of the use of force to give effect to the warning. When Britain and
France began their invasion, the situation became more serious. The matter came
before the Security Council, but no action could be taken by that body, as the
two aggressors against Egypt were permanent members of the Council, and vetoed
the Council’s attempts to pass any resolutions. An emergency meeting of the
General Assembly was then called, as there was no provision for the big power
veto in that body. Resolutions were passed by the Assembly with unprecedented
majorities, calling on Britain, France and Israel to cease-fire and to withdraw
their invading forces. Britain and France, who were determined on occupying the
canal zone, and undermining the power and authority of Colonel Nasser, refused
to accept the terms proposed by the Assembly, and suggested all sorts of
conditions including the stationing of a U.N.O. force in </span><span

Soviet Russia would throw her rocket bombs against them, and thus put an end to
their unjustified attacks on a weak country. This was something sudden and
unexpected. Britain, France and Israel had superiority of force over Egypt.
They could have conquered her because of such superiority. But there now

exactly is the situation now? The General Assembly is sending a force of four
thousand, contributed by a number of countries, the big powers not being among
them, to Egypt to keep peace between Israel and that country. The British and
the French state that they would withdraw their armies when a U.N.O. force,
competent to keep peace, is stationed there. But there are other complications.
They want the U.N.O. force to safeguard the free navigation of the canal, in
addition to keeping peace between Israel and Egypt. But there are countries
like India who are against the force being used to settle the canal issue. What
would happen in case the British refuse to withdraw unless this condition also
is satisfied? Will the U.N. force fight with them and with Israel armies? If a
fight becomes necessary what can a miscellaneous contingent of 4000 do against
the superior invading armies?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all this is the threat of Soviet Russia that she would send volunteers to
defend Egypt and the Middle East. China is prepared to do the same. Can the
U.N.O. meet such a threat? Has it the necessary strength for it? There is of
course the view expressed by President Eisenhower that the United States would
not keep quiet in case such volunteers are sent. Everything is thus in a state
of confusion. The Soviet has a definite policy. She is determined to establish
her influence in the Middle East, taking advantage of the tension between the
Arab countries and the West. She has superior force to accomplish her
objective. The United States has as yet no definite policy. Without her
co-operation, the U.N.O. can do nothing in the Middle East. It looks as if the
Arab world will become a sphere of Soviet influence unless something
extraordinary happens in the United States, to give a positive direction to her
policy. Small States like Syria, Lebanon, and even Egypt cannot live independently
in a world dominated by two big powers. They must be content with the role of
being attached to one or other of them though the nature of this attachment may
vary from one State to another. History supplies many examples of spheres of
influence, of protectorates, of client States, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

crisis in Eastern Europe is somewhat different from that in the Middle East. In
the Middle East there is an attempt at fresh aggression. What happened in
Eastern Europe is aggression and conquest by Soviet Russia ten years ago.
Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Albania and Eastern
Germany, with a population of hundred millions, were occupied by the Soviet
armies in 1944-45. They set up in them puppet governments of their own. All
these countries are actually colonial dependencies of Soviet Russia. Their
economies have become subordinated to that of Moscow; and people in them suffer
from all the evils of colonialism. Soviet oppression has become unbearable. The
result is popular revolt. The Poles and the Hungarians are carrying on a
struggle for national freedom and Soviet armies are being used to suppress it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Soviet government is justifying its action on the ground that its armies are
being used to put an end to counter-revolutionary fascist movements, and that
the armies are being sent there at the invitation of the local governments.
This is however a most unconvincing argument. How can there be a
counter-Revolutionary fascist movement, after ten years of successful Communist
rule, liquidating all capitalist and land lord elements? Apart from this it is
no concern of outsiders to intervene in a civil war in any State. The parties
to the war must be allowed to fight it out among themselves and decide the
issue. Did not Lenin, Trotsky and all the other revolutionary leaders condemn
the allies when they sent armies in 1917-18 to put an end to the civil war in
Soviet Russia?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

us be clear that what is now happening in Eastern Europe is a struggle by the
nations there to get rid of Soviet imperialism and not to establish Capitalism

equally of service to Poland, Hungary, Romania etc. There is still a party of
Stalinists at Moscow, which is against all <span class=SpellE>Titoism</span>,
and it is that party that is now asserting itself. This raises the question
whether Stalinism is really dead. Each of these countries is determined to
accept Communism. They do not want to go back to Capitalism. Some of them like
Hungary have also undertaken to adopt a policy, of not aligning themselves with
the West, and remaining neutral, like Austria. In spite of all this the
Stalinists in Soviet Russia are determined to use force for perpetuating their
imperialistic control. In essence there is no distinction between British and

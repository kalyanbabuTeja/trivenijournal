was the Christmas season, and the promenade of the city presented a festive
appearance. It was the heart of the city and presented every evening an unending

was almost a year since he had arrived at that provincial German town as one of
a <span class=GramE>batch</span> of trainees from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place> to undergo training in a
steel factory. When he first arrived at that town its exotic life and strange
atmosphere had almost swept him off his feet. He had belonged to a small sleepy
town in the Southern extremity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, far, far away from the
cities and had been brought up in a conservative, tradition-bound atmosphere.
Of course he had gone to the city for higher studies, but those were days of
complete absorption in studies. Those days his world had consisted only of his
college and his hostel and he had no time or inclination for any distraction
from his studies. Therefore he had never taken any part in the main stream of
city life. His first real contact with life took place in that strange German
town and no wonder that everything about him had thrilled and excited him. The
merry shoe-shine boys playing their trade on the side-walk, the vivacious
working girls in their chic dresses, demonstrative couples whose style was not
cramped by any inhibition, shop-windows bright with all sorts of modern
luxuries and gadgets–all these offered a perpetual feast to his eyes and he
liked to wander </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>about that place every evening. An evening walk
on the promenade had become a routine with him <span class=GramE>which</span>
proved a source of amusement to his colleagues who made fun of him and even
tried to frighten him, saying that, if he did not look out, some day he would
find himself ensnared in the charms of some roadside Juliet. But all the
ragging of his colleagues did not suffice to make any change in his daily
routine… <o:p></o:p></span></p>

He had come there as a matter of habit and was sauntering along absentmindedly.
For the past few days he had been feeling somewhat out of sorts and restless.
He had been conscious of a vague feeling of discontent within him but had been
unable to locate its exact source. Now that vague feeling had <span

and <span class=SpellE>Vasant</span> Desai, nicknamed ‘the Snob,’ a product of
English public-schools and the Oxford University and an embodiment of cultured
sophistication. Though the others called Desai a snob behind his back, they
suffered from an inferiority complex in his presence and were very much in awe
of him and his public-school manners. Desai, the son of a high-placed civil
servant, was himself a born leader. He never forgot his advantage as the only
one in that group with a real public-school education and never allowed others
to forget this fact. He laid down the law in everything, whether in the matter
of pronunciation of a word or in the correct way of handling the knife and fork
at table. Desai’s colleagues were envious of his authority but they had
implicit faith in the values for which he stood. There was therefore an
unacknowledged, but none the less keen competition among them to be guided by
his opinions and to win his approbation. They were always haunted by a secret
fear that they might commit some <i>faux pas </i>which would expose them in <span
class=SpellE>Desa’s</span> eyes as wanting in manners or lacking in taste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

were a lively company no doubt, but all their liveliness and boisterous good
spirits did not suffice to dispel <span class=SpellE>Murthi’s</span> vague
yearning. If there had been some companion from <span class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span>,
his own part of the country, he might not have felt so lonely. He was sick to
death of having to speak an alien language to be understood. He had never been
strong in English, still less was he in German which he was obliged to learn in
a short-term course before coming to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> for training. Every time he
had to talk, he was painfully conscious of his brain frantically struggling to
translate his thoughts into passable English or German. In spite of his earnest
attempts he could not express himself completely and to his own satisfaction,
and he had the feeling that a part of the thoughts he had wanted to express had
remained unexpressed, choking his brain. He was aware of the absurdity of this
feeling, which seemed so illogical, but there was no denying that the feeling
was there, and it made him pretty uncomfortable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

since he had left <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there had been no occasion for him to talk in his mother-tongue. He even began
to nurse the absurd notion that he might forget it and cut a sorry figure when
he returned among his own people. Memories of home began to obtrude on </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>him
quite frequently. When he was dining with his friends at a port restaurant in
that town, with its sophisticated atmosphere, subdued lighting and liveried
waiters, his mind unaccountably <span class=SpellE>travelled</span> back to the
memory of his mother pouring diluted butter-milk over his cold rice, and he
relived again in imagination the pleasure of contact of his fingers with<i> </i>cold
rice. Eating at home had always been such a jolly affair. He had a number of
brothers and sisters who enjoyed every morsel of even the cold rice they used
to have of mornings. Dinner was an elaborate ritual. There was a lot of
ragging, fun and noise...As he now watched the soft-footed <span class=SpellE>waifers</span>
flitting about in conspiratorial silence in their cool efficient way, he longed
once more to be back again among his<i> </i>noisy brothers at dinner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was the same when he went for his bath. All the
pleasant comfort of the shower was no match for the cool, limpid water of the <span
class=SpellE>Tamraparni</span> <span class=GramE>river</span> where he used to
swim for hours together during the long summer days. Once in the river he used
to forget all sense of time and spend hours in aquatic acrobatics despite his
father’s warning against such activities. It would be long past midday when his
ablutions were over, and he would slink home entering it by the back-door to
escape spanking by his father for coming late. </p>

apart from all these memories, what made him <span class=GramE>specially</span>
homesick was his yearning to speak and hear his mother-tongue. He was surprised
at this, for he had never imagined that he had <span class=GramE>to</span> much
feeling for his language. He had always prided himself on what he called his
broadmindedness in the matter of language. He was no doubt proud of Tamil. He
admired its primitive ruggedness and robust strength. But he had no patience
with the fanatics who claimed all sorts of superior merit for their own
language and decried other languages as of no merit. He was quick to appreciate
the good points in other languages too, so much so that his fanatic friends

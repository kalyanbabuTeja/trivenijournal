</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand what you want to know, oh my friend!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But to describe that attachment of love is to renew it at every moment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ever since I was born, I have sighted beauty, but my eyes are still not gratified;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to sweet voices, but they have not penetrated my ears;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many a spring night have I spent in joy, still I have not understood what real Union means.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through millions of ages have I kept my beloved in my heart; yet my heart is not at peace.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many a learned man have I seen immersed in pleasure; but I have not seen real feeling in any one!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Says Vidyapati: Not one in a million could be found to give peace to my soul.</P>

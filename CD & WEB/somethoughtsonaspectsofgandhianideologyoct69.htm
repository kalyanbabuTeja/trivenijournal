propose to deal with Mahatma Gandhi's views regarding the ideal political and
social order. His ideas on democracy may be developed along the following
lines: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Democracy
involves faith, hope and charity. It is based on the faith that all men are kin
and each man is an absolute and in himself. <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>
would say this is so, because they are all God’s children. Gandhi might agree,
or might say this is so, because they are all manifestations of the one self.
This implies that the natural light of reason shines in all men, may be in some
more brightly than in others, but nevertheless in all;</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>that every individual has an intrinsic dignity and worth,
second to no one else’s, and that individuals’ needs differ. So, each must have
an opportunity to <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> them. No one has greater
rights than another; so everyone has an equal right to shape and control the
institutions under which he lives and is entitled to equality of treatment
under them. This also entails the belief that as all men are endowed with
reason, their collective knowledge and experience alone can properly guide <span
class=GramE>their</span> collective action towards the welfare of all <i>(<span
class=SpellE>sarvodaya</span>). </i>It follows that none may carry a lighter
burden than another; duties and responsibilities devolve on all alike. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Democracy
cannot be built without the hope that men can achieve the good life on earth in
spite of the determinism in nature and the presence of moral and physical evil
in <span class=GramE>themselves</span> and in nature. Man is free to construct
the kind of world he wishes to live in and has the capacity to do so. Without
the hope that a man can be happy to the degree he fulfils his duties and
responsibilities, there can be no incentive to build or preserve democracy, for
in any other social order he cannot properly discharge them, or exercise his
rights. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>r unwilling causes of
each other’s sufferings. They need mutual sympathy and compassion. Besides, it
is through communion that a good deal of happiness comes. Through helping
others comes a sense of <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> and a certain type
of happiness. One enlarges his personality and raises it to a higher level by
going out of oneself to the others and sparing their joys, commiserating in
their sorrows and serving them. Men must support and sustain each other, and
give comfort and solace to each other. One alone cannot be free, all must be
free; one cannot be happy without all being happy; and only in the salvation of
all is the salvation of one. It, therefore, <span class=SpellE>behoves</span>
us to love our fellowmen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> faith could be explicated in the above
manner. Gandhi, of course, did not use the term “democracy” as much as he used
the other two terms: “self-government” (<span class=SpellE><i>swaraj</i></span>),
and “the kingdom of God” (<span class=SpellE><i>Ramaraj</i></span>), which he
defined as “sovereignty of people based on moral authority.” This is also what
the apostle of Western democracy, <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>,
meant by it. Both Jefferson and Gandhi considered individual freedom as a
supreme value and used the moral standard to judge all political institutions.
Neither of them could conceive democracy without a moral basis and purpose. Its
great American academic exponent John Dewey defining it as a way of life which
provides “for the participation of every mature human being in the formation of
the values that regulate the living of men together,” held that it cannot be defended
against totalitarianism without taking the moral position which <st1:place
w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> took. Modern Indian thinkers too have <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> this. The real guarantee of democracy, says M.
N. Roy, is the moral conscience of the people in power. “The problem of human
goodness,” writes <span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>,
“is of supreme moment today.” Except on the plane of Jefferson and Gandhi, it
is not possible to solve this problem and provide an incentive to goodness. In
the present day disconsolate world of doubt, despair and denial, democracy
anywhere can survive and be strengthened only if men develop their moral sense
and become loyal to it. Democracy is possible only in a world of moral
certainties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
sort of social order is most conducive to democracy? Here again Jefferson and
Gandhi gave similar answers. Only life and work in small communities will
permit men to have genuine self-government and personal responsibility.
Otherwise they cannot have an effective voice in shaping their destinies. A
social </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>order which cannot make charity possible is not
good. Charity cannot manifest itself without personal relationships. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will be instructive to recall Jefferson’s plan for <span class=SpellE>organising</span>
democracy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
He wanted the country to be divided into thousands of self-governing “wards”,
“little republics”, each directly exercising all civil and military functions
as far as its affairs are concerned. According to what he called the “mother
principle”, “governments are republican in proportion as they embody the will
of their people and execute it.” Thus <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> would be a great republic
built out of little ones, each a voluntary legal union of citizens who promise
to each other to protect each other’s rights. People will exercise their
freedom by asserting, respecting and enforcing the rights of each. Thus in this
system, the will of the majority is not the sovereign, as Locke conceived. Nor
is it the <span class=SpellE>Hobbesian</span> mutual compact of subjection to a
sovereign for, as Thomas Paine said, to obey an individual is debasing. Neither
should people as a whole be allowed to constitute a faction and endanger public
concern <i>(<span class=SpellE>res</span> <span class=SpellE>publica</span>). </i>In
<st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>’s scheme the individual wills as
well as what Rousseau called the General Will would be subjected to the
sanctity of natural and civil rights. On the <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>
of each little republic, thought <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>,
would depend the health of the great society. All the little republics and the
great republic acting and acted upon each other would maintain a “beautiful
equilibrium”. Whenever a decision was required on any important matter
concerning the entire country, <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> felt
all the “wards” should be called into meeting on </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the same day, so
that simultaneously the collective sense of all the people could be available.
As Dewey pointed out, all this was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“an essential part of <st1:place
w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place>’s political philosophy,” though it was not
adopted. Democracy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.
  A.</st1:place></st1:country-region> might have been sounder </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
more direct had it been adopted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
all accounts we find that self-<span class=SpellE>subsistuent</span> and fully
employed village communities were the vital organic units of the distinctive
Indian civilization. The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was an association
of caste and village communities in a complete and self-sufficing life. <span
class=GramE>The State as a union of autonomous towns and villages a great and
unique political contribution of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</span> Early British
administrators noted that it was such union of self-governing communities, each
a little republic in itself, which preserved the people of India and enabled
them to enjoy a great deal of freedom and happiness, in spite of all the
vicissitudes they passed through. It is no wonder that Gandhi wanted this
system to be revived. In his scheme each village would become “a complete
republic, independent of its <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span> for its vital
wants, and yet interdependent for many others in which dependence <span
class=GramE>is</span> necessary.” In such a system, Gandhi felt, there would be
“perfect democracy based upon individual freedom,” “the individual becoming the
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>architect
of his government.” Gandhi did not work out a detailed scheme as to how the
relations among the villages and the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>should
be <span class=SpellE>organised</span>. But M. N. Roy, thinking that democracy
requires the direct participation of the entire adult population, has conceived
of “a Pyramidal structure of the State raised on a foundation of organized
local democracies,” and <span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> of a communitarian polity founded on
“self-governing, self-sufficient, agro-industrial, <span class=SpellE>urbo</span>-rural,
local communities.” The Parliamentary and <span class=SpellE><i>Panchayat</i></span><i>
Raj </i>systems, as worked out till now, have not been able to establish an
authentic grass-roots democracy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>; <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
ideas at least provide the norms to improve them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
<span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span> of the political order requires a <span
class=SpellE>reorganisation</span> of the economic order. Here too Gandhi’s
ideas have heuristic relevance. “Our main object”, said <span class=GramE>Nehru,</span>
“is to increase production and thereby find progressively fuller employment for
our people.” Let us see what has been accomplished. At the end of the III Plan
ninety to one hundred <span class=SpellE>lakhs</span> of people have been left
unemployed. The IV Plan Draft envisaged creation of 190 <span class=SpellE>lakhs</span>
jobs, while during this period two hundred and fifty <span class=SpellE>lakhs</span>
of people are expected to join the <span class=SpellE>labour</span> force.
Thus, in 1971 over one hundred and sixty <span class=SpellE>lakhs</span> will
remain jobless. So, by then there will be more unemployment than previously. As
for our production, with a per capita rate of 90 dollars, our gross national
product is not higher than that of countries like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Congo</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Guinea</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sudan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Our
annual increase in growth rate (0.9 per cent) is much below that of other underdeveloped
countries. From this it is clear that the type of planning and economic policy
followed till now </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not succeeded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Considering
our population and resources, in the foreseeable future there is no hope of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> being
lifted to the level of the highly developed countries. Why is this so? It is
not possible nowadays to uproot and push the peasants out of villages <span
class=GramE>through<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>enclosure</span>,
and force them to work in industries to extract surplus <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
from them. Ruthless <span class=SpellE>collectivisation</span> of agriculture
and <span class=SpellE>utilisation</span> of slave <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
cannot be resorted in a democracy. Our Government, structured as it is, cannot
increase the already high level of taxation on urban incomes, cannot bring into
light all the black money and hoarded wealth, and cannot also mop up by means
of taxes part of the agricultural incomes which have quadrupled in some parts
of the country in recent years. The ordinary people cannot become more
abstinent than they are already, to save and invest more. Moreover, the capital
investment and development we might be able to achieve in all these ways may
make little impact on poverty. Capital from abroad on the requisite scale may
be available, if we choose to become the dependency of a great power. What then
is the alternative? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> may answer as follows. We must utilize to
the full the one great asset we have–our gigantic population. An intensive and
better use of their manual <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and an expenditure
of capital proportionate to our resources is the way out. Our situation does
not permit us to aim at any kind of affluence. We must realistically aim at a
universal and strictly limited <span class=GramE>raising</span> of the material
standard of living, which will permit our people to have at least basic
amenities and simple happiness. According to Gandhi, more than that is neither
good nor necessary. As <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhave</span>
pointed out, “freedom from, the lure of money and performance of body <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>” is “the acme of Gandhi’s philosophy.” Each village
should become self-sufficient through agriculture, use of hand-tools and rural
industries. If <i>everyone </i>works with his hands and hand-tools, and if the
land and materials are made available to the workers, there would be no
unemployment. This recalls Jefferson’s utopia in which “agriculture, handwork
and learning” would flourish and guide the lives of men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

India dare to reject industrialisation and technology, forego the hope of
becoming affluent and a great power commensurate with its continental size, and
<span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> to create an agrarian utopia? There is also
the danger that <span class=SpellE>deindustrialisation</span> might only
increase poverty, without ushering in an utopia. But, even if it follows the
path of large-scale industrialisation, will it succeed in becoming a developed
country and abolishing primary poverty? This is a dilemma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> economy not only eschews large-scale
industries but requires <span class=SpellE>decentralisation</span> of village
industries. <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhave</span>
has made a fruitful distinction between non-<span class=SpellE>Centralisation</span>
and de-<span class=SpellE>Centralisation</span>. Prior to the machine age,
industries were carried on in the villages in independent units scattered all
over the country without any plan or co-ordination. Now village industries have
to be <span class=SpellE>organised</span> on the basis of “a comprehensive
all-pervading idea.” This, says <span class=SpellE>Bhave</span>, is <span
class=SpellE>decentralisation</span>, or intelligent non-<span class=SpellE>centralisation</span>.
As many think, Gandhism is not totally opposed to machines. It is opposed, says
<span class=SpellE>Bhave</span>, only to machines which create unemployment,
idleness and intellectual dullness, and not to those which fit into </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>man’s
hands like a subsidiary limb. One may compare this idea of <span class=SpellE>decentralisation</span>
to that of <span class=SpellE>Aldous</span> Huxley. In Huxley’s scheme, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>individuals,
families and small co-operative groups own lands and small power-driven
instruments of production, necessary for subsistence and for supplying local markets.
While too much of huge machinery leads to regimentation and loss of
spontaneity, absence of mechanical efficiency leads to chronic poverty and
anarchy. Huxley hits upon small power-driven machinery as the golden mean.
Similarly, the Indian socialist leader <span class=SpellE>Lohia</span>
envisaged <span class=SpellE>decentralisation</span> based on the small-unit
machine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anyway,
this much seems to be clear: Unless consumption is <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>,
our production-structure cannot be <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>. There is
in India now such a mass hunger for food and consumer goods that only
large-scale production of them can satisfy it. So, unless it is decided to
content ourselves with the <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> of bare and
simple necessities of life and minimum possible consumption, <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> production-techniques need not be introduced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

now come to another problem. The increase in country’s productivity is not the
only real problem. Application of modern science may do the trick. The greater
problem is that of social justice. An increase of national wealth will only
make the rich richer and the poor poorer, leaving the demand for social justice
untouched. Here again Gandhi provides a possible solution. Whatever one has,
says Gandhi, one holds as a trust for the benefit of all. Not only wealth, but
one’s physical strength, skills and intelligence must be for the service of
all. His doctrine of trusteeship is the use of all one has for the good of all.
At the international level, whatever one nation has must be shared with the
others. This is a reinterpretation of the concept of <span class=SpellE><i>loka-sangraha</i></span>.
The <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> economic order is based on individual
non-possession (<span class=SpellE><i>aparigraha</i></span>). “Land in a
village,” says <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span>, “must belong to it as a whole,
and factories in the country to the whole nation. None should be owner of
property.” The <span class=SpellE>Gandhians</span> want a revolution in which a
privileged minority consents at least to an equitable, if not equal,
redistribution of all wealth in any form. Will our upper classes, and our
parliament and legislatures, as they are now constituted and composed, dare to
do this soon enough to make the other kind of revolution unnecessary? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

proceeding to a discussion proper of Maxim Gorky’s work as a writer, it would
be just as well to remind ourselves of the office of literature and the role
and function of the writer as understood in the Russian tradition through the

characteristic way, in one of his poems, which says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
Evtushenko <span class=GramE>mentions of the ‘poet’ is</span> indeed equally
true of all other writers as well. We could take it that he was using the word
‘poet’ in its larger sense of any writer, worth his salt, who should be
something of a ‘seer’ (as we speak of the <span class=SpellE><i>Kavi</i></span>
in the Indian <span class=GramE>tradition</span>), not merely a ‘critic of
life’ (as Mathew Arnold would have it) but the ‘unacknowledged legislator of
the world’ (in Shelley’s famous phrase). This would bring us to the problem of
“engagement” and “disengagement” in literature. We could almost hazard the
broad <span class=SpellE>generalisation</span> that Russian literature is
essentially an “engaged” literature. It would be hard to think of any Russian
writer who has made a mark on literature within and outside the country of his
birth, who is not “committed”, to something or the other. For that matter, the
Russian reader himself is “committed” in a manner, in which the Indian reader
of the present day (or British, French or American reader) is not. It is not
unusual for seasoned people nearer home, of High Court Judges, <span
class=SpellE>practising</span> or retired, to listen to some
religious-cum-literary discourse and nod their heads vigorously at the
exposition of some anecdote in a myth or legend, with a suspension of critical
discernment (and not merely of disbelief) that they would not be guilty of in
their more active hours. Which means that they are taking a mental holiday, as
it were, which is perfectly understandable, when we remember that literature,
in this context, is taken as a legitimate source of harmless entertainment.
Without going into the merits of this attitude, one could <span class=SpellE>recognise</span>
the fact that the Russian attitude, of the <span class=SpellE>intelligentia</span>,
and of the others, is very much different from this. Literature to them is real
and earnest, as life itself in all its manifestations. The purely aesthetic
attitude had almost never found <span class=SpellE>favour</span> in Russian
criticism. The theory of ‘Art for Art’s sake’, so fashionable with writers and
other artists in the England of Oscar Wilde and Walter <span class=SpellE>Pater</span>,
had never really taken root in the Russian soil, with the possible exception of
a few exotic, hothouse plants towards the end of the 19th century. The Russian
writer, through the ages, had, by and large, been very much engaged in the
social significance of what he was writing and, in the process, identified
himself with the establishment, be it the church or the state. Individualism
had always been suspect and the lone wolf is not a familiar creature in the
Russian literary fauna. If he did not hunt with the pack, he was never really
far away from it, to be quite out of touch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

literature is usually divided into three broad periods, for the sake of the
student’s convenience: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

10th century when St. Vladimir embraced Christianity) of Christianity to the
end of the 17th century; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Second or Modern period, </i>which begins with the era of Peter the Great,
early in the 18th century, when he opened for Russia a window on the West and “<span
class=SpellE>secularised</span>” the literature and thought of the day, in his
own way by controlling the church, and ends with the great Revolution of 1917; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Soviet Russian literature, dominated by the values of ‘Socialist Realism’ under
the inspiration of the Rulers of the day, (i.e., Lenin and Stalin); and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It is possible to think of another period, starting with the repudiation of the
personality cult of Stalin under Khrushchev and the trend of <span
class=SpellE>liberalisation</span>, which can be presumed to continue till the
present day, with appropriate tactical and other functional changes, as and
when found necessary by the exigencies of the national and world situation.
(Signs are not wanting, according to some informed students of contemporary
Russian literature, of the emergence of a new golden age in Russian
literature.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

nineteenth century is considered by the critics of world literature as the
golden age of Russian literature–with its <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>pushkins</span></span>,
<span class=SpellE>Lermontovs</span> and <span class=SpellE>Gogols</span> and
other famous names in verse and prose. While the earlier half is well-known for
poetry (as that of the Romantic Revival in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>) the latter half is justly
known for its prose, especially fiction. It is the great age of the Russian
novel, of not only novels of enormous size but of undoubted world significance.
<span class=SpellE>Turgenev</span> and Tolstoy, <span class=SpellE>Dostoevsky</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Chekhov</span> (as a playwright and short story writer
mainly) have had an unmistakable impact on European fiction of the day,
undreamt of by any British and French novelist of the day, Eliot, <span
class=SpellE>Thackeray</span> or Hardy, <span class=SpellE>Proust</span> or <span

other novelists, taught to us at school and college in <st1:country-region

merely pretty and provincial under the dominating shadow of the Russian

Gorky comes in here as not only a great name but a dynamic force to reckon with
after Tolstoy and <span class=SpellE>Dostoevsky</span>. He stands as the great
bridge that links the pre-Revolution and post-revolution periods of modern
Russian literature. For a long time after the Revolution, he served as the
unofficial spokesman of the Soviet writers, who treated him as a kind of Ivan <span
class=SpellE>Kalita</span> of the modern period, a guiding spirit and
integrating force, in the manner of the famous Russian ruler of the 14th
century, who unified the separate hereditary principalities into a single
Muscovite state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 w:st="on">Soviet</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and the Soviet people. The expression was actually coined by Gorky himself at
the First Soviet Writers’ Congress in 1934, a couple of years before his death.
The term is used to imply the fundamental agreement </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
the artist with the emergent socialist world, as distinct from the ‘critical
realism’ of the 19th century, which portrayed and <span class=SpellE>criticised</span>
the surrounding reality, without suggesting, explicitly or </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>implicitly,
the way of changing it. According to this definition, writers like Samuel
Butler and George Bernard Shaw, <span class=SpellE>Ibsen</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Strindberg</span> would come under the category of “critical
realism”, as I understand it, though one of them at least was a professed
socialist, of the Fabian variety. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gorky
himself had a good word or two for ‘critical realism’ which was close to
‘revolutionary romanticism.’ It had its uses. “Members of this group of
European writers”, he said in his address to the Writers’ Congress, “have a
double and indisputable value for us, first, as technically model works of
literature, and second, as documents that explain the rise and decline of the
bourgeoisie, documents created by apostates to this class, who depict its way
of life, traditions and acts from a critical angle.” He looks at it as a
struggle against feudal conservatism and industrial capitalism waged by the petit
<span class=SpellE>bourgoisie</span>, on the basis of liberal and humanitarian
ideas. In other words, it is good as far as it goes, but does not go far
enough, according to him. To him ‘critical realism’ is negative and impotent as
unfettered ‘individualism’ is irrelevant and meaningless. To make his position
clearer, he observes: “While in no way denying the tremendous work done by
critical realism, and fully appraising its formal achievements in the art of
word imagery, we must <span class=SpellE>realise</span> that we need that
realism only in order to throw light upon survivals of the past, and wage a
struggle for their eradication.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the positive side of his beliefs, he commends the new concept of ‘socialist

describes it thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

realism proclaims that life is action, creativity, whose aim is the unfettered

on the postulates of this definition is built up the conception of the
‘positive hero’ and the philosophy of optimism, driving one along the path of
economic progress and social change. When the history of literature is looked
at from this angle, as <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>
did it in his essays and speeches, there is more encouragement to seek in the
literature of folklore, in which the positive hero is always there for
politically-oriented critics to hail and celebrate. Pessimism also goes against
the grain of folklore, which has a sturdiness and <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>
of its own, along with a <span class=SpellE>naivette</span> not quite to the

himself, though, in fairness to Gorky, it must be admitted that he is unstinted

technical virtuosity. For Tolstoy and his works, he had the highest regard,

apt and telling illustration of the literary method of ‘socialist realism’
could be found in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorky</st1:place></st1:City>’s
own work–the famous novel entitled <i>Mother. </i>It is not necessarily
accepted by world critics as his greatest work, though its influence on the
emergent socialist world had been enormous. There can be, and I know there are,
two or more opinions on its intrinsic worth and literary value. But there are
no two opinions on the fact that it is his most epoch-making work, as far as
this country is concerned. (It is translated into the major Indian languages
three to four decades ago, and reprinted more than once.) I myself happened to
read it in Telugu translation, by K. <span class=SpellE>Linga</span> <span
class=SpellE>Raju</span>, or <span class=SpellE>Gadde</span> <span
class=SpellE>Lingaiah</span>, I am not quite sure, when it was smuggled into
our circle, while I was yet a schoolboy some thirty years ago. I <span
class=GramE>was wanting</span> to read it in its English version and have not
been able to complete it for various reasons, including the sad but undeniable
fact that it seems now very much the worse for wear. Anything like the first
fine rapture was hard to seek on a second acquaintance, for a reader whose
primary interest happens to be literature. Reliable critics, not necessarily committed
to the Soviet way of thinking, attribute its lasting success to its “harmonious
combination of realism and romanticism.” Although the story of the novel closes
with the defeat of the revolutionaries, the reader is left inwardly convinced
of the ultimate victory of the revolution. The mother in the story, shown in
beginning, as meek, passive, frightened and nervous, emerges towards the end as
a character of great courage and initiative, poise and dignity, successfully
throwing away the yoke of fear, meekness and submission. A positive heroine,
who fills the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;

innate gentleness and graciousness and unobtrusive nobility, and without being <span

and critics outside of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
who are not unduly attached to these guide-lines of ‘socialist <span
class=GramE>realism’</span> continue to be greatly impressed by the admirable
mixture of outspoken realism and romantic gusto that <span class=SpellE>characterised</span>
most of his works, especially those written before <i>Mother</i>. They are
valued for the broad and comprehensive picture of Russian life presented in
them, though some of them lay themselves open to the charge of a lack of
constructive unity and are apt to be disfigured by interminable conversations
on “the meaning of life.” There is a school of reliable critics, the world
over, who think better of his mature, autobiographical and other writings,
including recollections of Tolstoy and other writers and memories of his own
childhood. The penetrating and plastic realism with which he presents a vast
gallery of Russians here in these books is seen to be unrivalled. These could
be enjoyed with unqualified delight by readers, who owe no allegiance to the
oft-repeated tenets of “socialist realism.” Among his earlier works some of the
stories are powerful enough to rank among the <span class=GramE>world’s</span>
finest, irrespective of ideological considerations. That beautiful story of
suspense, comedy and pathos, entitled <i>Twenty-six men and a Girl </i>is none
the worse for wear and makes enjoyable reading, some seventy years after it is
written. The <i>Lower Depths </i>(drama) and the later novel <i>The <span
class=SpellE>Artamonov</span> Business </i>are but two of the examples of his
keen observation of the quirks of human character. In his remorseless technique
of photographic realism and withering irony, he bears a family likeness to <span
class=SpellE>Galsworthy</span> at his best, for instance, of the <span
class=SpellE><i>Forsyte</i></span><i> Saga</i>. His portrayal of the tramps and
vagabonds, the waifs and strays and ne’er-do-wells and the dregs of society,
who were so, for no fault of theirs had won him a special place not only in
Russian literature but in the world’s proletarian literature. He made a hero of
the kind of human material that was not considered heroic in traditional
literature. It was an act of intellectual redemption and reclamation.

only as a writer, but as a friend of struggling writers and well-wisher of
young writers, is Gorky remembered in Soviet Russia. Unlike some of the other
Soviet writers, who were out to deny the past and destroy the tradition in art
and culture, Gorky was tolerant and intellectually flexible enough to be aware
of the heritage of the past which, however, he tried to interpret according to
his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:

revolution. Though he was a fighter to the last, he never lost sight </span><span

the writer in himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with other great Russian writers like Tolstoy and <span class=SpellE>Dostoevsky</span>.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
its depth at its best. Making due allowance for the demands of legitimate
didacticism in an emerging society, Gorky bids fair to stand by them, wherever
Russian literature is read and remembered, for its own sake. The impact of
Gorky on writers, scattered the world over, apart from political workers
athirst for a new world order, has been powerful–and one could think of Mulk
Raj Anand, and <span class=SpellE>Khwaja</span> Ahmed <span class=SpellE>Abbas</span>,
besides <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span> and Krishna <span class=SpellE>Chander</span>
in this country, and Hemingway and <span class=SpellE>Steinbeck</span> in
America, who owe (consciously or unconsciously) something of their boldness and
directness to his technique of narration. But it is time that students of
comparative literature made a reassessment of Gorky’s contribution to the world
of prose fiction in non-political terms, and not shrink from a judgment that
might be substantially different, if need be, from what it was a generation or
two ago. If it be a story of sons and fathers, again, let the former not be
denied the natural privilege of upsetting the scale of values held dear by the
latter! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

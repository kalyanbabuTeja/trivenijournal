</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Moghul Empire was undoubtedly ruined by the failure of Aurangzeb to subjugate the Deccan after a war of twenty-five years. Its resources were exhausted and the prestige of its army was seriously impaired. The viceroys in the various provinces began to acquire semi-independence. Worse still, the yearly incursions and levy of tribute by the Marathas in the different parts of the country undermined imperial authority. The decline of the Moghul Empire began rapidly in 1707, and in 1740 it was an established fact. On the other hand, the British challenge for supremacy and paramount power in India definitely began in 1776, and succeeded in 1818. Thus, from 1707 to the end of the 18th century India was under a free-lance. It is generally held that the Maratha power was in the process of acquiring paramountcy but failed on account of the advent of the English. Many historians therefore hold that the mantle of Akbar was acquired by the English not from his Moghul descendants but from the Marathas. The Maratha power was certainly formidable, and at one time swept over a large tract of India. Clive seriously suggested that the Marathas should be bought off from incursions into Bengal by the payment of a tribute. Similarly the Directors were always anxious to avoid hostilities against them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there are certain difficulties in accepting the claim of the Marathas to Imperial Power. It is true that the paramountcy of the Company was established only after the three Maratha Wars; but when the English crossed swords with the Marathas, the latter were already a declining power. Even if the English had not arrived on the scene, the Marathas would never have won the Empire of India. They had already been overwhelmingly defeated in 1761.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A slightly detailed analysis of the power of the Marathas is warranted in any study of the British conquest of India, not because it was overwhelming, though for a short time, but because of two unique considerations. Firstly, it was the only power which obtained a great sway in India and at the same time was not foreign. This is indeed a unique occurrence and therefore demands a particular consideration. Secondly, a study of Maratha power and its decline brings out almost all the causes which eventually led to a European conquest of India, and shows the weaknesses under which the Indians laboured. A study of 18th century India furnishes us with some of the eternal truths of Indian history, and therefore is a veritable storehouse for research.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will always remain a debatable question as to how far the Maratha power was a religious reaction against the tide of Islam, and how far it was free from any crusading bias. Was it an attempt to establish a Hindu sovereignty, or, in modern jargon, was the Maratha Empire a communalistic reaction? There is conflicting testimony in contemporary accounts. There is no doubt whatsoever that Shivaji was a pious Hindu and became increasingly so in later life. However, his piety was a purely personal affair and there is little sign in him or his own successors of fanatical intolerance. Similarly, the fact that he always had in his service some Mahomedan troops and the respect he showed to Muslim saints makes it clear that he was no bigot. The religious orthodoxy and reaction may have been a later growth, and later scholarship may have made Shivaji a ‘protector of cows and Brahmins’ in a more narrow and sinister sense. Perhaps the judgment of so great an authority as Sarkar ought not to be lightly put aside. He admits that the disintegration of Shivaji’s kingdom after his death and the rapid decline of Peshwa power later was due to a growth of ‘orthodoxy’ and the more rigid observance of caste differences.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The causes of the rise of the Maratha power were, in fact, several. One of the greatest was that it was a popular rising with a national basis and hence unique in the history of India. A national resistance means the resistance by all the people in a country as one body. The Marathas fought the Moghul as a foreigner and in order to defend their own country. Before Shivaji his father Shahaji had also fought the Moghuls, but the motive of his resistance was the defence of his own <I>Jagir. </I>In the days of Shivaji it was genuine Maratha nationalism that the Moghuls were contending against. This is proved by two considerations. Firstly, the saint and poet Ramdas is acknowledged to be the intellectual progenitor and the spiritual director of the rise of Maratha power. His precepts and the organisation he created had a profound influence on the Maratha people. His organisation was that of mendicant friars and wanderers who quickened and consolidated the religious spirit as well as acted as a secret service and intelligence department for the rising Maratha power. They proved invaluable during Shivaji’s career. Besides this, Ramdas was an unofficial adviser to Shivaji who frequently sought him out for consultation. One of the most famous and oft-quoted injunctions of Ramdas was, ‘All Marathas should be brought together and a sense of duty towards Maharashtra should be increasingly cultivated among all." No exhortation to national unity could be plainer. A unification of the Maratha race was not only a cause but an ideal constantly to be borne in mind. Even the term ‘Maratha’ was used in a much wider connotation than was used before or since. Generally all the people living in Maharashtra are not called Marathas; but at the time of Shivaji the designation probably covered Dhangars, Ramoshis, Kolis etc. But today Marathas have become a caste and generally include only the cultivators. Thus a final unification of the Maratha race was retarded by the formation of the caste. In historical writings there has been a confusion about the proper use of the term ‘Maratha’. It is used synonymously with ‘Maharashtrian’ i. e. one who lives in Maharashtra. ‘Maratha’ strictly speaking only means a cultivator or one who has risen from the class or cultivators. It is probable that the intention of Shivaji and Ramdas was to use the term in the widest possible sense, but caste-consciousness soon broke up that unification; and with the rise of the Peshwas, the Marathas became a caste, with the consequence that one of the unique features in Indian history was quickly suppressed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second consideration which still further proves the genuineness of Maratha nationalism is the composition of the Maratha armies. Usually most of the Hindu armies–the Rajput, for instance–were recruited from a special caste whose duty it was to protect and govern society. It was in fact a professional army as well as a hereditary occupation. But the Maratha army was not drawn from any such hereditary professional class. It consisted of farmers, shepherds and cowherds. It was an army raised from the soil and the countryside, without reference to the martial status of the recruits. Neither were the leaders of the Marathas strictly from the Kshatriya class. It appears that there was a great dearth of the second caste in Maharashtra. Very few of the high-class Marathas are of Kshatriya origin. They have mostly risen from the ranks of farmers. "The Marathas of the upper class are in origin identical with the great agricultural Kunbi tribe and are now differentiated from them merely by the accident of social status." Thus the Maratha army was a national army, unlike any that was produced before in India, and therefore not only was it unique but it had a far greater chance of success against hired mercenary troops.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another cause of the rise of Maratha power was the decay of the kingdom of Bijapur on account of the constant pressure which the Moghuls employed against it. In fact most of the Moghul campaigns in the Deccan were directed against the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golkonda, which they were particularly desirous of conquering. Shivaji for a long time was not taken seriously by the Moghuls. Not only that, but his power was suffered to remain and even secretly approved of by the Moghuls as a constant sore to the Bijapur kingdom and a source of weakness to it. Besides, Aurangzeb never really intended his lieutenants to conquer the Deccan, so to say, "off their own bat." He was afraid that they might become too powerful and a danger to himself. He therefore either starved them of troops and supplies or changed the commanders constantly. Moreover, the Moghul generals themselves were not very anxious to conquer the country and terminate the war in the Deccan. In the hundred years that they campaigned in the Deccan, they never achieved much by way of conquest and occupation of the country. Perhaps many of them were even bribed. Bernier gives the following testimony: "The truth is that the generals employed against Bijapur, like commanders in every other service, are delighted to be at the head of an army, ruling at a distance from the Court with the authority of kings. They conduct every operation therefore with langour and avail themselves of any pretext for the prolongation of the war, which is alike the source of their emolument and dignity. It is become a proverbial saying that the Deccan is the bread and support of the soldiers of Hindustan."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there were also certain military factors which were definitely in favour of the Marathas. Without success in the field no State can be established or secured. The Moghuls were fighting far from their seat of power and their bases of supply in northern and central India. The length of communications was so great that the Marathas found it easy to cut off their supplies unless they were escorted by a very strong guard. The barren and hilly nature of the country was eminently suitable for the mobile tactics at which the Marathas were expert. They made surprise attacks, harassed the enemy and avoided pitched battles. The Moghul army, unused to such tactics, wore itself out because it could not get at grips with the enemy. The Marathas maintained themselves and increased their own boldness as well as valour by constantly ravaging Moghul territory. The impunity with which these attacks were made undermined the entire prestige of the Moghuls and ruined their government, because no government can long continue after losing its prestige. The Marathas were still further helped by the military weaknesses of the Moghuls. The Moghul army consisted largely of cavalry and a few pieces of field-artillery useful only in pitched battles. Bernier makes it clear that the infantry was an inconsiderable part of the Moghul forces. This cavalry was most suitable in the plains of North India but was quite useless in the hills of the Deccan. Shivaji occupied the hill-forts with his mobile infantry guard and used his cavalry merely as an auxiliary arm for purposes of scouting, foraging, to cut off the supplies of the enemy and to ravage the enemy territories. The Moghuls were in a peculiar dilemma. Their own cavalry was quite useless in order to occupy the country and reduce the hill-forts. On the other hand if they converted it into an infantry and brought large guns, which incidentally they did not have, to breach the forts, their army became immobile and could not move quickly. Besides, it reduced their cavalry also to inaction, being engaged only in defending the guns against the surprise attacks of the enemy, and left the enemy horse to ravage the country and cut off supplies with impunity. Moreover the hill-forts proved by no means easy to reduce. In short, Moghul cavalry could not reduce the forts and Moghul infantry could not get supplies or stop the ravages of its own territory. Thus the failure of the Moghuls consisted in their inability to solve the problem of reducing the hill-forts which were the basis of Maratha resistance. Finally, the Deccan was an unsuitable country to invade with a large army which could not get supplies from the countryside and where the water was bad. The description which Bernier gives of the kingdom of Bijapur is applicable to the entire territory of the Deccan. He says, "It should also be observed that the kingdom of Visapur abounds with almost impregnable fortresses in mountainous situations, and that the country on the side of the great Moghul’s territories is of a peculiarly difficult access, owing to the scarcity both of forage and of good wholesome water."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foregoing account makes it clear that the Maratha power was organised in such a way as not only to baffle the military skill of the Moghuls but also to undermine their power in their own empire by successful inroads into their territory. The Marathas rapidly followed up their successes into North India, and year after year collected revenue from various Moghul provinces. In this they followed the general mode of warfare in Asia, in which an invader generally collected tribute or looted but did not establish his own permanent administration. The Maratha agents collected revenue but the judicial administration as well as the maintenance of peace and order was never undertaken. In short the Marathas conquered territories but did not occupy them. In this they showed the weakness of their sway in India. It also explains not only their rapid decline but also the smallness of Maratha States that survived the British conquest of India. Such power as was theirs could only continue while its military superiority could be constantly and effectively demonstrated. As soon as the Marathas lost their military preponderance at the battle of Panipat, their empire fell like ‘a house built on sand’. The Maratha forces, more often than not, resembled Tartar hordes. The Tartars swept over most of the then known world, but left no permanent effect upon it except the curse of their memory. Like the Marathas they conquered and ravaged but did not occupy. Every year after the harvest gathering, the peasant-warriors having no other occupation would collect and pour out into the adjoining territories for <I>Mulk-giri i.e. </I>conquest and loot. Like a shower in spring their invasions came suddenly and powerfully but left very little permanent effect behind them. Their mode of warfare consisted in ravaging the territory of the enemy, cutting off his supplies, cutting up his out-posts and advance-guards, making lightning surprise attacks but avoiding pitched battles, and either in attempting to manouvre the enemy out of his strong position into unfavourable ground or in compelling him to surrender out of sheer exhaustion. This naturally required training and discipline which the Marathas had acquired by experience, and while they stuck to it they remained unbeaten. The Maratha power has often been described as a predatory power. Though an exaggeration, it is an exaggeration of an important truth. A predatory power hardly ever creates an empire and certainly never retains it. To repeat an oft-quoted remark, the Maratha power was more suited to destroy an empire than to create it. Finally, it is quite obvious that the genius of their leader was largely responsible for the rapid rise of the Marathas. That Shivaji was a man of extraordinary genius, and that the first two Peshwas were men of rare ability, have scarcely been denied. Whether a movement brings out a man or a man creates a movement is a nice point so far not settled, but there can be no two opinions on one question: a people generally get such leaders as they deserve.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What then led to the fall of this people? No doubt the causes were many, which incidentally will make it clearer why the English found their task so easy. All the causes of the fall of the Marathas group round one central cardinal fact. The Marathas as a people and as a power did not remain for long what the genius of Shivaji had designed them to be. After the death of Baji Rao I, they drifted away from the course that had been marked for them. The further away they drifted, the nearer they came to ruin in the shape of a military disaster. No doubt chronologically the third battle of Panipat lost by the Marathas was a turning Point in their history, but it was not an unaccountable stroke of destiny as some would have us believe. It was an inevitable consequence of certain tendencies which were becoming increasingly manifest in Maratha life. With a better general, Panipat might have been postponed but it could not have been avoided. Even before Panipat, important changes had begun to take place in Maratha life which would have sooner or later brought their power to an end. The loss of Panipat introduced further complications and hastened the end. Scindia and Holkur had already begun an independent course of action of their own, though their ambition was still hidden. Quarrels in the family of the Peshwa had already started with the jealousy between the brothers of the third Peshwa. The third Peshwa himself was given to luxury and sensuality in a way un-dreamed of by his predecessors. Bankruptcy had always threatened the Marathas and Baji Rao I was always at a loss to know how to meet his creditors. Pomp was being imperceptibly introduced in the army on active service, and non-military appendages in the shape of women accompanied it. The traditional mode of mobile war in which the Marathas excelled was being dropped, and the artillery arm recently introduced under Ibrahim Khan was accorded increasing importance in the decisions regarding strategic movements and tactical manouvres. The use of artillery condemned the Marathas to fight pitched battles in which the Afghans and North Indian troops were more at home. It destroyed the mobility of Maratha forces on which their effectiveness so largely depended. It meant also that war could be decided in a few battles and the Marathas could no longer decide the issue by wearing out the enemy. The issue henceforth depended upon superiority of equipment, discipline and steadiness. This is the explanation of British success, for the British were undoubtedly superior in equipment. There were other general causes contributing to the fall of the Marathas. An important cause was naturally the absence on the Maratha side of really first-rate personalities. The men who dominated the situation on the Maratha side both in the second as well as the third Maratha War were none of them men either of first-rate character or ability. Some of them like Baji Rao II were a positive handicap. Scindia was indolent and a lover of luxury, Holkar was always bordering on insanity, and Baji Rao had perhaps even a criminal strain in his character. Leaders are an important indication of the vital forces alive and active among a people. Therefore it is a reflection on the Marathas themselves that they had no able leaders and proves that their vitality was sapped. Mahadaji Scindia, Ahalya Bai Holkar and Nana Fadnavis, all died before the outbreak of the second Maratha War. None of the Marathas were prepared for a struggle against the English and certainly not those at Poona, where ever since 1775 the handling of Poona affairs was in the hands of Nana Fadnavis who was no soldier and remembered Panipat vividly, having been one of those who had escaped from it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, even more than personalities, the supply of the vital forces of man-power are in the end decisive in any prolonged struggle. It was true that the battle of Panipat destroyed the flower of the Maratha army. One full generation of young men was annihilated and most young men of all the leading families were killed. Contemporary accounts tell that there was not a single home in the Deccan which had not lost a member. In fact there was such a dearth of young men after the defeat of Panipat that the Peshwa found it difficult even to raise an army of 60,000 effectives in his war against the Nizam. But it was not Panipat alone which sapped the vital roots of Maratha power. The process was of some duration. Up to Panipat the Marathas were constantly engaged in active war, and therefore for a full century there was constant drain on their resources of man-power. Moreover this drain was on a population which was quite small in number. The total Maratha population, understood in the widest sense, could not have exceeded 5 million, all told, at that time, and naturally that portion of the population from which men enlisted for active service was even smaller. Clearly, on the basis of a population so small, a drain of a century could be almost fatal. This explains the failure of the Marathas to secure the empire of India and suggests that, even if all other mistakes had been avoided, it would have been impossible for them ever to have conquered all India. It would be like expecting Czechoslovakia to conquer Europe.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second cause of the fall of the Marathas was their internal jealousy and absence of unity. There was plenty of this jealousy soon after the death of Shivaji, but it had not been able to burst into a danger for the Maratha power. The Maratha power was kept together under the feudal leadership of the Poona Government. But as soon as the Poona Government weakened after the battle of Panipat; the feudatories become independent. The Gaekwar soon accepted English protection; but the greatest loss to the Maratha cause came from the hatred and jealousy between Scindia and Holkar, two of the most powerful Maratha chiefs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But by far the most important cause was the change which took place in the character of the Maratha armies. It has already been observed that one of the causes of their rise to power was that it was a movement of the entire people and the fact that theirs was a national army in a sense unknown in India before. A people’s movement can release enormous forces, which if they are properly directed can become a great vital, irresistible force. The exploits of the French Revolution in Europe were possible because the national zeal of the citizen-army was capable of superior effort compared to the professional armies of European monarchs. But the last national army of the Marathas was destroyed at Panipat. Henceforth it began to acquire not only a professional but, what was more serious, a non-national character. Soon after the loss of Panipat, Maratha nationals ceased to predominate in their armies. The proportion of natural-born Marathas who entered the army began to decrease rapidly. Most of their infantry consisted of North Indians who were purely mercenary adventurers. This naturally was a source of great weakness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still another cause of their failure was the change that took place in the organisation of their army and the so-called Europeanisation. North India being a flat country does not afford many strongholds to act as bases of operations. The nature of the ground is therefore unfavourable for a purely guerilla warfare. It would be difficult to avoid pitched battles on the broad plains of Hindustan. The Marathas therefore developed their artillery and their infantry mostly under French instruction. The successes which the French and English armies had already won, purely on the strength of their artillery, tempted the Marathas to do the same. This adoption of the European mode was largely responsible for their undoing. Wellington has left it as his testimony that, had the Marathas stuck to their ancient method of war, they might have fought a prolonged struggle to a successful conclusion. The successes of Holkar in the second Maratha War lend plausibility to this opinion. After all, fighting pitched battles was unsuited to the genius of the Maratha race, and, since the issue depended on the relative effectiveness of fire-arms on both the sides, their own failure was a foregone conclusion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the last cause of the fall of the Maratha people is embodied in another aspect of their failure to establish an empire in India. So far history gives abundant testimony to the observation that stable and enduring civilisations are established only when new ideals, with a vision broader than before, greater inspirations and a more progressive outlook on life are embodied in the movement of a people. A people in order to establish a new civilisation must preach a new order. Their social, political, economic and often spiritual life must have as its ideal and basis something new and progressive, something which they can give to others. Only then new civilisations are created. Those who bring the new message may go down after an initial flush of triumph, but the progressive ideas which they bring remain and take root. The French Revolution, for example, was based on certain ideas of human relationships, of government and of life, that were a great progress over those of a feudal and serf-ridden Europe. Hence the extraordinary achievements of Revolutionary France which took so great a part in the birth of 19th century Liberalism in Europe. The Marathas in India could not create an empire or a civilisation because their movement was not based on any new progressive idealism in any sphere whatsoever. The rigid orthodoxy which accompanied it from the beginning, and the greater observance of caste-rules into which it later on degenerated, pronounce it to have merely been a reaction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foregoing analysis makes it clear that the Maratha power was successful in overthrowing the Moghul Empire, for which purpose it was well-organised and eminently suited. But the Marathas created a void after the fall of sovereign power. They themselves could not fill the vacant place thus created. They themselves had no new ideal or constructive suggestion to make regarding the political or social organisation of the country. One empire was destroyed, but nothing constructive materialised to take its place after its fall. The greatest defect of the religio-nationalist movements, among which that of the Marathas was one, is that they are not only not progressive but often leave the last state worse than the first. The 18th century witnessed a century-long civil war in India with greater destruction of life and property than was known for many a century before. It was on such an empty and devastated stage that the English made their bid for paramountcy. And, properly speaking, they were never really seriously challenged.</P>

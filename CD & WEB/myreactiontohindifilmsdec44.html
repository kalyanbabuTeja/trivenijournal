<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
for once I should like to do a spot of cinematic criticism. It is not that I
have seen all the films, or even a very large number of them. I am aware that
there are lots of film-fans who make a point of never missing a single <i>premiere.
</i>I envy their singular fortune: but emulation is out of the question. The
vast majority of us can indulge in that luxury only occasionally. Then there
are some films that one <i>will </i>not go to see if one is left to one’s own
devices. Thus I am not attracted by historical and spectacular films: wild
horses cannot drag me to them. It does not matter what superb actors and
actresses are being screened: they cannot alter my rooted antipathy to the <i>genre
</i>itself. I cannot persuade myself to enthuse over antique dresses and
speeches and gestures; nor am I unduly fond of gorgeous spectacle. That
partially explains my prejudice. Similarly, those films in which the ‘stars’
are very young boys and girls are non-starters so far as I am concerned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a time when I liked only western films, giving the elbow, as it were, to
the indigenous variety. Instead of, like Brer Rabbit, “lying low and saying
nuffine”, I used to go <i>out of my way </i>to pass strictures upon them. Those
strictures, as it happened, were mostly just. Anyhow, it was true that I was
not inclined to cross myself, or to fall into a trance, every time the name of
an Indian picture was announced. Then, all of a sudden, like Paul of Tarsus, I
was smitten by a dazzling light. “The stream of tendency”, not ourselves, that
guides our footsteps in this life took me to the Krishna Cinema on a certain
evening in July of 1937 to see the New Theatres’ ‘President,’ the beauties of
which were just then being extolled to the skies. That journey of mine to
Charni Road opened my eyes, so to speak: it was the starting-point of my
fervent admiration for the Indian cinematic industry, and, in particular, for
the products issuing from the leading Indian studio, the New Theatres, of
Calcutta. I was convinced that the ‘President’ was an out-and-out triumph for
the Indian cinema; and that Saigal, the hero of that film, is not only, as he
has been claimed to be by persons qualified to judge in these matters, the
greatest of Indian actors, but that he is an actor worthy to be included in the
world’s First Eleven of male film stars; and I was bewitched by the virtuosity
of Leela Desai also. The acting of Kamlesh Kumari (the President) improved as
the road show progressed, reaching its crescendo of excellence in its
concluding stages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
word must there be said about Saigal’s singing. It was superb. His voice was
enchanting, and all his songs had an incomparable lilt. One factor in their
favour was that they were never cacophonous, and that they </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>never
rose an octave higher than was imperative. But they were too short, and they
were too few. Leela Desai’s remark to him, <i>“Prakash Babu, apka gana log
bahut Phasand karthe hain”; </i>was perfectly just. Another remarkable feature
of Saigal’s acting was that it was the last word in naturalness and
spontaneity. I do not think that there is any western actor who can score over
him in this respect. Even if he had only stood there doing nothing one could
easily have discerned in him a born actor. He can be very witty, too. Saigal,
in short, is in the great tradition; and with this I am content to leave him
for the present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
shall be said of Leela Desai, who acted the part of the President’s sister, the
mischievous school-girl, and who always took the active part in the love-making
between her and Prakash Babu (Saigal)? I cannot find a single fault with her
acting. She played up to Saigal splendidly. Even her eyes were most expressive.
What naughtiness was in them? As a shameless hussy she could give points to any
of your Hollywood actresses–and win. In the love-duet between her and Saigal it
was she who always led. She was the personification of Mr. Bernerd Shaw’s pet
notion that, in this eternal amorous game, it is the <i>woman </i>who leads the
man on and not, as is commonly supposed, the other way about. From the moment
she jumped down her school garden-wall and almost fell plump into the arms of
Prakash Babu, who was sitting below chewing the end of his reflections anent
his dismissal from his job, she never, in a manner of speaking, left him to
himself. She would bring down the house with her: <i>“Uske bad kya hua, Prakash
Babu</i>?” The poor man had to dance to her measure ever afterwards. When she
found herself with him alone she gave us the impression </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
having fed on honey-dew and on the milk of paradise. Then, in addition to her
sparkling dialogue and supremely ‘alive’ acting, she was gorgeous in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>her
dancing performance. Her whole face was a mirror in which her thoughts were
reflected. She was an imp of mischief from commencement to conclusion. </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
honourable mention must be made of the acting of Mahomed Nawab (the jobber,
Dinubhai, and friend of Prakash Babu in the picture). Next to Saigal he was the
most delightful actor in the show. He could set the house in a roar by the least
of gestures; and his countenance could assume any<i> </i>expression it chose
and squeeze the last drop of meaning out of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ever
since that visit of mine to the Krishna Cinema the leaven has been working, and
I am now as crazy about Indian films as any man alive. This is not, however, to
say that I fail to discriminate among them, or that I am not overcome by a
feeling of the most acute nausea at my ‘recollection in tranquillity’ of by far
the vast majority of them. And so I come back to that unquestionably best film
studio in the country, the New Theatres’, of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Calcutta: whose
‘President’ it was that opened the flood-gates of my fancy for this type of
Swadeshi article. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have no manner of doubt that with the advent of the same Theatres’ ‘Vidyapathi’
on the silver screen an entirely new standard has been set in the Indian
cinematic industry. Having seen that film no less than eleven times, owing
mainly to Kananbala’s versatile performance (indeed, in the acting, singing,
walking, running, leaping, lying, talking, sense her little finger was mightier
far than the loins of everyone else, barring Saigal, not only in this film, but
in all the films of which I have experience), I hied myself in all haste to
‘Mukti’, where also she happened to be starring. I was stupefied by the amazing
contrast. The maker of ‘Devadas’, save and I except in person, was not visible
in ‘Mukti’; and it was then proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that Devaki
Bose is head and shoulders above Barua as a Director, as also that, in the sphere
of music, R. C. Boral is far superior to Pankaj Mullick. Boral, indeed, is
unrivalled in his chosen field. Timir Baran, excellent as his work was in
‘Devadas’, was responsible only for one film, and, therefore, cannot be
bracketed with Boral, who has been associated with the musical side of the New
Theatres’ films from <i>auld lang syne.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
repeat, Vidyapathi’ is India’s Number One picture, and Kananbala India’s Number
One actress. I am prepared to argue, till the cows come home, that even to
behold Kananbala standing perfectly still is a liberal education in itself.
With an ideal actor, or actress, and a director to match, you have a film that
is worth paying a visit to: and the supreme merit of ‘Vidyapathi’ is that there<i>
</i>you find this rare combination. One encounters a flaw in ‘Vidyapathi’, and
it is to be found in the theme itself. That theme is that we can reach the
god-head even through the love which man bears to woman or woman to man. Bating
this controversial issue, however, the film is “the Pillars of Hercules of
mortal achievement”, in a phrase immortalised by Mr. Maurice Baring. Both the
hero (played by Pahari Sanyal, India’s Number Two actor) and the heroine (acted
by Kananbala) acquit themselves beyond reproach. The jester of ‘Devadas’ and
the washerman of ‘Chandidas’ and the hare-brained student of the ‘Millionaire’,
and the absent-minded hero of ‘Dhoop-Chaaon’ presents a front of dignity here
that is really to be seen to be believed. That blind singer, K. C. Dey, also
‘puts over’ the best performance of his career in this picture. But it is the
unprecedented success that it is because of Kananbala. I had, before, admired
Leela Desai in the ‘President’, Umashashi in ‘Chandidas’ and ‘Dhoop-Chaaon’,
Molina in the ‘Millionaire’, Ratan Bai in ‘Yahoodi-ki-Larki’, and Shanta Apte
in three or four films; but all these pale before the radiant performance and
personality of the one and only Kanan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have already paid a glowing tribute to Saigal, in connection with the
‘President’. I am certain that what he does not know of acting is hardly worth
knowing. He appears to have the knowledge of the whole science of acting at the
tips of his fingers. I suspect that he can act with his eyes shut, and even
then contrive to give us a brilliant performance. As a singer he is Apollo
himself–on a brief sojourn on this planet. What a marvelous voice he has,
indeed! More, he can modulate it to every emergency. He can, I verily believe,
play on all the notes–and then some. He is so compact of melody that I can
almost ‘go bail’, in Stevenson’s phrase, on the statement that he can infuse
harmony even into a laundry bill. It was said of Socrates that he brought
philosophy down from Heaven to inhabit among men. Substitute ‘Saigal’ for
‘Socrates’ and ‘music’ for ‘philosophy’, and that dictum will stand equally
true. When Saigal begins to sing I shut out everything else from my mind for
the time being. I went to the picture, ‘Devadas’, half-a-dozen times–chiefly to
hear his ‘Duhkhe’ song. Then there is that other song of his, in the
‘Millionaire’, where, standing before a microphone, he pours out his heart to
his ‘be-all and end-all’, Leela (played superbly by Molina), who had been
‘listening-in’–without, let us hope, an over plus of displeasure. In
‘Puranbhakt’ he has a very tiny role, as a Sanyasi, but he makes even that
memorable by his one and only song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
me he represents the finest acting in the country. Like the Apostle, he can be
all things to all men–on the screen. He can be the last word in exuberance–as
in the ‘Millionaire’: a model of seriousness, as in ‘Chandidas’: a mixure of
both, as in the ‘President’: and a most inimitable tragic hero, as in
‘Devadas’. Talking of Indian film-acting I can say that he “flames in the
forehead of the morning sky”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
to him comes Pahari Sanyal. Mahomed Nawab is our ablest comedian–though he can
act a serious role, well enough, for is not his portrayal of the Jew in
‘Yahoodi-ki-Larki’ his masterpiece? His portrayal of the snake-charmer in
‘Sapera’ is also not to be sneezed at. As for Prithviraj, he has come into his
heritage at last, with the release of ‘Vidyapathi’. He is the handsomest of our
screen actors. No one can walk as majestically as he does: besides, he has a
way of patting one on the pack that is all his own. He bears a close
resemblance to Basil Rathbone, and has a figure which ought to be the envy of
every man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I forgotten Jamuna, of ‘Devadas’ fame? <i>“Nahin, Paru, Nahin.” </i>She shone
resplendently in the earlier half of that play; and she was at her best in the
very first scene itself, in which she had a very pleasing coquettish way of her
own. She gave an ideal performance by the over-whelming <i>sincerity </i>of her
acting. Hazlitt said of Cavanagh’s playing that “</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>his service was
tremendous”. So was Jamuna’s whole-hearted identification of herself with her
part. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

word must be written about Bharati Devi. She made her debut in the New
Theatres’ ‘Doctor’. She was even better in ‘Saugand’ and in ‘Kashinath’, nor is
she below her form in her latest role in ‘Wapas’. Her singing is as good as
Kananbala’s and the same holds good as regards her acting in general. The
future of Indian films is safe in such hands as hers. Why I have harped so much
on the products of the New Theatres’ Studio is that, taking them by and large,
as the saying is, they are decidedly the best pictures that our indigenous
industry has so far produced; they are the “very sea-mark of its utmost sail”:
and not least in <i>naturalistic </i>acting, which is the alpha and omega of
acting in general.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

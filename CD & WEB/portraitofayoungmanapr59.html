<p class=MsoTitle>PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN<span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>By S. LAKSHMI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jumped in just as the train was moving off and sank into a corner-seat with an
exhausted sigh, noting with pleasure that the sigh came off rather well. After
having spent hours perfecting it, he now used it almost unconsciously. As a
matter of fact it was getting to be quite as good as the sarcastic smile with
the one eyebrow raised. Smiling, he lit a cigarette. His downward glance fell
on his college file, and immediately his spirits rushed to the lower depths of his
being–a place they often haunted. The essay was unfinished again, and he had
really meant to do it well this time! The thought of Professor <span
class=SpellE>Dastur’s</span> caustic remarks, and the contemptuous lower lip of
the girl who shared the tutorial with him, made him slightly sick inside; but,
after all, these were things of the passing moment. What really disgusted him
was himself, for this was one more instance of his weak-mindedness. Again and
again he would resolve to do something, and set out in all earnestness to carry
out his resolutions. But an hour or two, at most a day or two, was all the
concentration his system seemed capable of. Then his mind would wander off to
other things; a new interest, a new resolution to whip up his enthusiasm again.
And the net result was that he remained the same spineless, <span class=GramE>characterless</span>
nobody that he had always been!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
will never grow up, he thought with despair; how will I ever be mature and
strong-minded if, even in little things, I cannot bring the dictates of my will
to a satisfactory conclusion. And, when, oh! <span class=GramE>when</span> will
I be able to respect myself? I do not have any principles, he thought. That’s
the real trouble–no principles, no faith and no beliefs. He would so much have
liked to have a burning interest in something. He often pictured himself
working through the night, absorbed in some obscure subject, coming alive to
his surroundings with the first rays of dawn, only to refresh himself with
coffee and go back to his life-interest. He always included the coffee, or some
equivalent, in all his noble dreams, for, without that earthy touch, the whole
thing would have been too much in the realms of fancy to legitimately introduce
himself into the picture. This particular picture was one of his <span
class=SpellE>favourites</span>: the deep and serious young man, so different
from his college-mates whose frivolous heads were alien to serious thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But, then there was
another picture of <span class=GramE>himself</span>: the broad-minded
man-of-the-world whose central faith in life was experiencing everything that a
human being was capable of experiencing, both intellectually and emotionally.
He was a man of arts and a man of philosophy; outwardly he was reserved and
cynical, but, in truth, he had a real love of humanity, and unobtrusively
expressed it in his generosity </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>towards, and tolerance of human frailties
and idiosyncrasies. Carried away with himself he looked up with his
“worldly-wise yet kindly” expression, and encountered the sophisticated and
superior look of a lovely creature in a willowy <span class=SpellE>saree</span>,
who had just entered the compartment. In his present self-confidence he
bestowed his<i> </i>“benevolent and fatherly yet tinged-with-amusement” look on
her veneer of sophistication, and, catching sight of himself in the mirror
opposite, he realized with horror the idiotic expression his face was indulging
in, and his spirits raced back to rock-bottom, a place wherein normally lodged
all unpleasant things. Here he encountered previous incidents when he had made
a fool of himself. These were rapidly dismissed, for he could not face the waves
of shame that swept over him at such recollection. However, occasional
incidents brought him up short, and he had to go through each painful sequence
before his masochistic self allowed him to pass on to the not-so-painful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
the time he had read a paper at the T...Historical Society. He was one of its
youngest members, and, therefore, this was indeed a privilege. For days before,
he had pictured himself holding the attention of a crowded room with his rare
combination of youth and profundity, finally to have his paper declared the
outstanding paper of the evening, by an audience captivated both in sentiment
and intellect. He spent a certain amount of time and thought working on the
paper, and felt he had done it justice; but reality and fancy <span
class=GramE>had<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>got</span> so confounded
that he could no longer judge the merits of what he had written. And the
picture of the event was as clearly imprinted on his mind as if it were a
well-remembered past event rather than a hoped-for future development. The
confidence he gained from this confusion resulted in keeping him calm and
collected, so much so that even his surprised family gained faith in his mental
prowess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
meeting was well attended, apart from the fact that there was a good sprinkling
of family and friends. His was the last of three papers, and he rose in turn,
fully satisfied that the first two papers had been no more than mediocre. The
nightmare began after the first few pages. Looking up at a pause, suddenly the
crowded room and the bored faces became his only reality. Fancy fled him, and
in a piercing vision of clarity he saw himself for what he was pitiable in his
attempts to impress, exposing this mediocrity to the polite boredom that
surrounded him. Since he could not immediately sink through the floor, he
continued reading his paper, wishing to prolong it as long as possible,
dreading the hypocritical appreciation that would inevitably follow. He had
rather he was booed off the platform than face the sympathetic congratulations,
with their implication that he was not clever enough to see through their
obvious falsity. Heart-breaking shamefacedness enveloped the picture, and he
shuddered at the recollection. Oh! <span class=GramE>what</span> was the use?
Whatever was the use<span class=GramE>?...</span>He just did not have the
intellect to do anything at all. At least one would have expected that lack of
intellect would be compensated for by strength of emotion, or <i>something. </i>But
he seemed to be barren all round. In any situation involving his emotions,
whether it be love or anger or jealousy, he invariably had moments of clarity
when he stepped outside himself and looked askance at the emotion of the
moment. This, and the ensuing doubt, promptly set a brake on the emotion in
question, and further attempts to accelerate it were seldom successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
if he was happy in his family and the comfortable life and good education they
were able to give him, if he was nothing in himself but an empty shell, a
hollow casement wherein the winds of civilization rushed through leaving no
mark behind. That struck him as rather a nice turn of phrase! And looking
round, he slowly surfaced at the sight of a vaguely passing station, to reflect
on the fact that, now as before, he was indulging in his <span class=SpellE>favourite</span>
game of day-dreaming and self-analysis coupled with self-pity. Casting about
for some shred of self-respect to cling to, he found the usual answer in his
genuine love of books. But what help are they, he continued to reflect,
traversing along the familiar route and sinking back into his reverie. All I
seem to learn from books is cynicism and mistrust of myself. I observe such
varied modes of thought and ways of life only to be an alien to them. It is
like window-shopping, he thought. It only makes me more dissatisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
are being stupid and pessimistic again, came up his other self, this continuous
wallowing in self-pity. Make up your mind now and do something. Finish that
article, and send it off. Just because they rejected the last one, it does not
mean that this will be no good. And, anyhow, if you are going to be dejected by
a few refusals of your attempts at establishing your self-respect, then you
might as well jump off this train!...And glancing up, heavens! The scenery
through the window was unfamiliar! Jerked into reality he looked around more
definitely and realized he had gone past the station where he should have got
off. Oh, God! he thought, hurriedly getting his things together for the next
station. Not only do I not do what I have resolved to do but even the most
elementary things seem to get out of hand for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:30.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this <i>thinking, thinking, thinking</i>!…..He would really make up his mind!
No more dawdling over day-dreams. Why, life would go by and he would not be a
part of it! There would only be his castles in the air! Enough of this. From
now on he would concentrate on doing: yes, that was it–<i>doing. </i>He would
fill all his time with some activity, some concrete interest, something that
would put him in line with the toil of generations of Man. That was the way to
go about things. The only-way….. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
with a new buoyancy he stepped off the train as it slowed down, and crossed to

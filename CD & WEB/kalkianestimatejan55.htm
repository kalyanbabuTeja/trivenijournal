last two months have witnessed the genuine grief of the entire Tamil people at
the passing away of Kalki (Sri R. <span class=SpellE>Krishnamurti</span> who
had endeared himself to them in many ways and was pre-eminent in the fields of
journalism and literature. Though too near to him in point of time, I feel I
was sufficiently remote from him in other respects to enable me to attempt an
estimate of his position in the world of Tamil Letters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kalki’s
literary career may be roughly divided into three periods. From the point of
time and association, these maybe called the ‘pre-Anand a <span class=SpellE>Vikatan</span>’,
the ‘<span class=SpellE>Ananda</span> <span class=SpellE>Vikatan</span>’ and
the ‘Kalki’ days. From the literary angle, these periods might again be termed
the period of preparation and apprenticeship, the period of great achievements,
and the period of greater achievements and consolidation. Of these, the first
was mainly taken up by his efforts towards <span class=SpellE>popularising</span>
the constructive programme of Mahatma Gandhi in the South, though his literary
output was not negligible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kalki’s
activities with the pen covered a very wide range touching almost every known
literary form, from a mere humorous sally to a novel of immense dimensions.
These included, among others, essays in light and serious veins, art and
literary criticism, biography, the short story, the lyric and the novel, and in
each one of these he excelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Kalki’s contribution to the cause of Tamil journalism and literature can be
best understood only in the context of the circumstances that prevailed during
his early days. When he entered the field, the periodical, as it is understood
today, virtually had no existence. Towards the removal of each one of the
factors that contributed to such a state–linguistic, psychological, political
and social, he individually <span class=SpellE>laboured</span> more than any
other. As this is untimely related to the bigger question of his contribution
to Tamil literature, it will be dealt with at length.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Kalki took up the pen, literature in <span class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span> was
groping its way. The language, as the result of <span class=GramE>a neglect</span>
and a conservatism bordering on orthodoxy, was in a state of languor. The
English educated section of the people looked upon every new venture with an
air of contemptuous <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>, which was <span
class=SpellE>equalled</span> only by the ‘jealousy’ of the <span class=SpellE>pandits</span>.
The early pioneers, of whom Kalki was the most notable, had to demonstrate to
one section the great though latent potentialities of the language as an
efficient medium of thought and communion in the modern world, and at the same
time convince the other section that the language, though possessing an ancient
literature, great and considerable must, to be alive, continually breathe the
fresh air of constant association with the life of the people and be nourished
by the live language and thoughts of the masses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
output in Tamil prose <span class=SpellE>upto</span> the end of the last
century could ill compare with that in other languages, or its own poetical
one. Of course, as everywhere else, the reason was that prose suffered badly in
comparison with poetry in respect of brevity and the possibility of easy
committal to memory. But the predominant reason seems to have been a notion
that the writing of prose called for<i> </i>no great gifts, or, if at all, only
an inferior kind of gift. To get over this psychological ‘pull’, the few who
tried their hands at prose made the style as strange and remote from life as
poetry was in form. That is, what the piece lost in form, they hoped to make up
in style. The result was a language stiff and formal; studied and artificial;
hard upon the tongue and harsh upon the ear. By bringing the language of
literature nearer the live language of the people and by giving it flexibility
and strength, and simplicity and spontaneity, Kalki completed the task earlier
begun by <span class=SpellE>Bharati</span>. Between them, these two great
masters of prose and poetry, respectively, proved that there was almost nothing
in the world of human thought and knowledge that could not be well and
thoroughly expressed in Tamil, and what is more, in a manner understandable,
and acceptable to all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Tamil Journal owes its present stature to a great extent to the efforts of
Kalki. Kalki did not write, but <i>spoke </i>through the printed page to the
people. His easy way of presenting the most difficult problems of the day gave
the people of <span class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span> <span class=GramE>a grounding</span>
in the fundamentals of politics and economics, which enabled them to take their
proper place in the national movement. Kalki <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
to the full the potentialities of the serial story in enlisting and maintaining
a flow of regular subscribers; and exploiting this to the full, he played the
Pied<i> </i>Piper with his pen, turning the thousands of his readers into
children at his heels. Following his example, many young and efficient writers
have come up with the result that the periodical has become part of<i> </i>the
scheme of things in every Tamil home, and the two journals in the shaping of
which Kalki had no mean share, namely, the ‘<span class=SpellE>Ananda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Vikatan</span>’ and the ‘Kalki’, together with the ‘<span
class=SpellE>Kalai</span> <span class=SpellE>Magal</span>’ remain today the
supreme expression of everyday life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Inseparable
from Kalki’s work as a journalist is his career as a pamphleteer. Mention has
already been made about Kalki’s prose style. Under the magic of his hold, his
pen became a camera, a brush, a lute, a trumpet and a sword. The <span
class=SpellE>colours</span> of the rainbow, the stillness of the southern
breeze, the majesty of the mountain, the speed of the storm and the roar of the
surf, all unfolded themselves as Kalki veiled his pen. With this in hand and
backed by a prodigious creative <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>, he adventured
into many lands and explored new regions, finding new delights and unearthing
fresh ones. Vigorous in their inspiration and uncompromising in their
directness, his editorials, when they concerned the world and the nation at
large, were analytic and instructive and always actuated by a patriotic <span
class=SpellE>fervour</span>. To undo many an injustice, to redress a grievance,
to focus public attention upon a point, to raise memorials to the great dead
and a score of other good causes, he acted as ‘the bell-ringer who was up
first” and called others. During the three general elections, he woke up the
people to a sense of duty and virtually led the voters to the Congress box.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
with problems ‘domestic’ and nearer home, it was <span class=GramE>not rarely</span>
that he lost the objective outlook upon things, and allowed his fancy to become
a law unto itself. With him every difference became a ground for controversy
and every controversy tended to grow into a quarrel. The Kalki of the
controversies is a controversial figure indeed. Whether it was the ‘Rajaji’
question or the Tamil <span class=SpellE>Isai</span> (music) movement, the
question of the film footage or the problem of the <span class=SpellE>Travancore</span>
Tamils, the <span class=SpellE>Prakasam</span> Ministry (of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>) or the <span class=SpellE>Parulekar</span>
Report, he jumped into the fray with unhesitating zeal, the moment his
sympathies got roused. Once inside, he scarcely looked to see where his
opponent stood and continued the battle long after the enemy quit–defeated or
disgusted. His indictments often over-shot the mark; for he allowed himself to
be diverted from the normal literature of reason by the currents of passion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
his pamphlets to his short stories and novels is a happy change. Here Kalki
stands on ground which is his, for he was a supreme master of that craft by any
standard. Whatever be his subject his brush moves with ease and sureness over
the canvas. His short stories, a good number of which is of world class, abound
in fine specimens of character study and are purposeful without being tediously
<span class=SpellE>moralising</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

his<i> </i>novels, ‘<span class=SpellE>Kalvanin</span> <span class=SpellE>Kathali</span>’
and ‘<span class=SpellE>Parthipan</span> <span class=SpellE>Kanavu</span>’ are
perfect specimens of harmony and symmetry from the artistic point of view. The
former is a tragedy drawing its material from </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>modern
middle-class life. It tells the story of an innocent and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>noble
youth whom circumstances turn into<i> </i>a thief and his love for a village girl
which does not culminate in marriage. Con</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>vincingly told, this
story brings to our mind at his<i> </i>best, both in point of style and
technique. This<i> </i>Hardy element can be traced in some of his later novels
also, as a subtle undercurrent. But with Kalki there is a greater balance
between the individual and the circumstances, and the unseen cruel hand of Fate
does not play so crushing a role. The result is that they are far less
pessimistic in their tone. This is only in keeping with </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kalki’s
own philosophy of life, that man can and must raise himself by his own
efforts–a philosophy which he amply proved in his own life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kalki makes his first entry into the field of historical romance.</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Having for its background the <st1:place w:st="on">South India</st1:place> of
the <span class=SpellE>Pallava</span> Period, it tells of the sense of
curiosity and the craving for adventure which prompted the early Tamils to
cross the ocean, found empires and spread the Tamil art and culture in distant
lands. Running through it like a thread is the love story of Prince <span
class=SpellE>Vikrama</span> of the <span class=SpellE>Chola</span> Dynasty and <span
class=SpellE>Kunthavai</span>, the daughter of the <span class=SpellE>Pallava</span>.
Subdued in tone and delicate in refinement, these novels display a rare dignity

in its interest and abounding in dramatic situations, this story, in common
with ‘<span class=SpellE>Ponnivin</span> <span class=SpellE>Selvan</span>’, its
successor, a historical, has distinctly the ‘periodical’ label stamped upon it.
An abundance of intricacies in<i> </i>the plot and a tendency on the part of the
author to be carried away by the ease and swiftness of his invention, are the
other drawbacks of these two great novels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Ponniyin</span> <span class=SpellE>Selvan</span>’, the last of his
novels, would suggest that, due to considerations other than literary, the
author has to abandon part of the original structure of his plot. The
characters at first seem to be heading for a particular kind of climax, but in
unwilling obedience to the dictates of their creator, appear to have built up
another. An Occasionally long description that slightly overburdens the
narrative at places, and some artificiality in the dialogues, especially of
those of high rank, are other snags which this novel shares with ‘<span
class=SpellE>Sivakamiyin</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabatham</span>’, the
author’s greatest and most mighty creation. These minor faults pale into
nothing before the majesty of these two works in which the author scales lofty

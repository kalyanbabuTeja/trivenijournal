<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turn to Budgets for a moment. A most unusual and altogether novel procedure is introduced in the J. P. C. Report in relation to Budgets. The J. P. C. is not satisfied with the recommendation of the White Paper that the Federal Upper House should, at the instance of Government, be able to demand that any grant which has been reduced or rejected by the Lower House should be brought up before a Joint Session. ‘We think,’ says the J. P. C. Report, ‘that all demands should be considered first by the Lower House and subsequently by the Upper, and that the powers of each House in relation to any demand should be identical, any difference being resolved by a joint session to be held forthwith.’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much the most astounding provision in the whole Report is contained in the Second Schedule, which enumerates the provisions of the Bill the amendment whereof is not to affect the validity of the Instrument of Accession of a State. Thus, any amendment relating to the following points will invalidate the Instrument of Accession, and this means that these powers which are really the reserved powers under the Act cannot be transferred even by Parliament without entitling a State to walk out of the Federation. Yet, the Bill speaks of the inability of the States–once they gain access to the Federation–to secede. Let us briefly review the provisions whose amendment is virtually interdicted, rather we extract nearly the whole Schedule for the interest it abounds in.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PART II, CHAPTER II</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exercise by the Governor-General, on behalf of His Majesty, of the executive authority of the Federation, and the definition of the functions of the Governor-General; the executive authority of the Federation; the functions of the council of ministers, and the choosing and summoning of ministers and their tenure of office; the functions of the Governor-General with respect to external affairs and defence; the special responsibilities of the Governor-General relating to the peace or tranquility of India or any part thereof, the financial stability and credit of the Federal Government, the rights of Indian States, and the discharge of his functions by or under the Act in his discretion or in the exercise of his individual judgment; the provisions relating to His Majesty’s Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General; the superintendence of the Secretary of State; and the making of rules by the Governor-General for the transaction of, and the securing of transmission to him of information with respect to, the business of the Federal Government.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The power of the Federal Legislature to make laws extending to a State or the subjects thereof, the power of the Governor-General to empower either the Federal Legislature or Provincial Legislature to enact a law with respect to any matter not enumerated in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule to this Act; the provisions of the chapter relating to inconsistency between a Federal law and a State law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The previous sanction of the Governor-General to the introduction or moving of any Bill or amendment affecting matters reserved to the discretion of the Governor-General in relation to defence or external affairs; the power of Parliament to legislate for British India or any part thereof, or the restrictions on the power of the Federal Legislature and of Provincial Legislatures to make laws on certain matters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PART VI</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In so far as the provisions of that Part relate to Indian States.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PART XII</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resolutions of the Federal Legislature or any Provincial Legislature recommending amendments of this Act or Orders in Council made thereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">FOURTH SCHEDULE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The oath of affirmation to be taken or made by the Ruler or subject of an Indian State.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SEVENTH SCHEDULE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any entry in the Legislative Lists which has not been accepted by the State as a Federal subject.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The addition, of Schedule 2 to the Bill virtually brings about this condition of things:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. A State has to make a declaration that it is willing to abide by this Act.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. This, when accepted by the King, forms the foundation of the Federation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The Act so formulated has two sets of sections, (a) some enumerated as Chapters in Sec. 2, (b) those ‘saved ‘.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Virtually these are (a) Structural, and (b) Functional.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. No amendment relating to matters enumerated (not saved, <I>i.e., </I>matters structural) shall affect the validity of the Declaration.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. But in any case such an amendment is not binding on or does not extend to any Federated State-unless the Prince individually concurs in it. The implications of such an arrangement are with regard to matters ‘saved’ in Schedule 2. (i.e., functional matters), that any amendment of the Act in respect of ‘saved’ matters affects the validity of the declarations of the Federating States, and thus produces one of two results. Either the Federation is dissolved, or amendments are made impossible at the inception or in the implementing. In effect then, while structural amendments are capable of being passed with the consent of the Federating State and in any case in respect of British India, <I>i.e., </I>while structural amendments are capable of being made to apply to British India and such of the States as consent to them, functional amendments destroy the Federation itself or destroy themselves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">EXAMPLES</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Structural.–Appointment of the Commander-in-Chief, Financial adviser, Advocate-General.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Composition of Legislatures in respect of British India Provincial Governments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Functional.–Reserved Powers. Railway Board. Functions of the Reserve Bank Services.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realty the object is to prevent the change of the Act in response to further agitation or by, say, a Labour Government, and to use the States in the Federation as an additional and effectual bar to further progress.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now understand why the decennial statutory enquiry of the Montford scheme is abandoned, for this Act will be not for a decade, nor for a generation, but for eternity.</P>

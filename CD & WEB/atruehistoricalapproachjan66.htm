‘a dome of many coloured glass staining the white radiance of eternity’
Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet </i>has been made to shed different colours by
different critics most of whom have been interpreting it in their own divergent
ways. No other work of literature has stimulated so many different critical
approaches and interpretations as this masterpiece of Shakespeare, and this in
itself is, perhaps, a testimony to its amazing vitality as a work of art. It is
amazing that this play (The “Mona-Lisa of literature” as T. S. Eliot described
it once) should have been subjected recently to a Marxist historical analysis
by Arnold Kettle (the author of <i>An Introduction to the English Novel) </i>whose
study “From Hamlet to Lear” appears in a collection of writings most of which
can be termed as critical exercises in the Marxist historical method. It is
proposed to examine here whether Shakespeare’s masterpiece can bear out a
Marxist historical analysis and what a true historical approach should seek to
reveal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
some of his fellow contributors in the volume in which his study appears and
which is edited by himself, Arnold Kettle claims to make a historical approach
to Shakespeare. It is true that <i>Hamlet </i>has been studied for too long
rather unhistorically; it has often been discussed as, a study in character and
even the celebrated critics right from Coleridge down to Prof. L. C. Knights
have concerned themselves only with defining Hamlet’s problem purely in
psychological and metaphysical terms. It is thus difficult to disagree with
Arnold Kettle when he states that Hamlet’s problem cannot be described in
purely “Psychological terms” and that “it involves not only Hamlet but the
world he lives in.” Even the statements that Hamlet looks at the world as “an
advanced humanist” of his time, and that there is “an undercurrent of social
criticism in the “solid and detailed presentation of the Danish court”, are
hardly controvertible. A knowledgeable student of Renaissance literature and
history would easily discover the analogies in the play between Hamlet’s world
and Shakespeare’s contemporary England, the analogy in particular between the
Danish court of Claudius and the intrigue-ridden Renaissance court of
Shakespeare’s England. The historical approach hardly provokes much criticism
if it confines itself only to a discovery of the analogies just referred to;
disagreement with the approach arises only when the assumptions underlying the
analogy between the Danish world and Shakespeare’s England are overstressed and
overstated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Marxist approach of Arnold Kettle, in spite of its claim to be historical, is
far from being so. One would normally expect a critic adopting a historical
perspective to view historically the problem of revenge which forms the
epi-centre of the play; on the other hand, what is offered in the way of
criticism is an interest in the humanist-hero of the play who, it is claimed,
is acutely conscious of “not belonging” to the contemporary ruling class and
whose dilemma is not so much a dilemma about the code of revenge or even about
the wider problem of action as a dilemma about the class-divided society of
Shakespeare’s time and the values that society stood for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hamlet’s new view of the world he lives in is,
essentially, the view of the world of the most advanced humanists of his time.
It rejects as intolerable the ways of behaviour which formed the accepted standards
of the contemporary ruling class...The revolutionary nature of Hamlet’s view of
the world is that he sees tyranny and murder and inhumanity not as unfortunate
abuses but as the norm and essence of the Court of Denmark not as blots on a
society he can accept but as integral parts of a way of life he now finds
intolerable. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
foregoing passage makes it clear that the Marxist historical criticism reads
too many of its own preconceived notions into Shakespeare’s play rather than
discover afresh what is there already in the work. What is questionable is
whether there is so much rejection on Hamlet’s part of “the accepted standards
of the contemporary ruling class” and whether Hamlet’s “new view of the world”
is really so “revolutionary” as is being claimed. Arnold Kettle does not
specify what “the accepted standards of the contemporary ruling class” were and
only describes in very general terms the Danish Prince’s dissatisfaction with
those values. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
nature of Hamlet’s dissatisfaction with the world around him needs to be
clearly understood in the context of the dramatic situation as described in the
early part of the play. If Denmark appears as a ‘prison’ to him and the whole
universe an “unweeded garden grown to seed”, it is not so much because of his
intolerance of “the ways of behaviour” of the “contemporary ruling class” as
because of some of the rude shocks his moral sensibility has suffered. His
mother’s hasty marriage with his uncle, a ‘satyr’, so soon after the death of
his father, a ‘Hyperion’ is, as is evident from his first long soliloquy (“O
that this too too solid flesh...” I, ii, 1.129-159) the root cause of his early
melancholy and grief. Even after Hamlet’s suspicions about his uncle are
confirmed by the ghostly revelation, his sense of revulsion and
disillusionment, it must be noted, does not remain confined only to the
immediate world of the Danish court around him, but goes beyond that and
envelopes the larger and wider universe. Hamlet’s confession to Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern in his first meeting with them is certainly not that of a man with
a mask but can be taken as a genuine expression of a real state of his mind: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

nature is certainly not “revolutionary” in the Marxist sense; the
disillusionment arises not just out of Hamlet’s dissatisfaction with “the
accepted standards of the contemporary ruling class” but goes deeper than that.
What is being suggested is that Shakespeare’s hero is not just a Marxist
radical contemplating only the evils in his contemporary society, but a
representative of the “human condition” contemplating the eternal problem of
evil–evil as represented in the microcosmic world of Claudius’s court. The
struggle as depicted in the plot of the play is one between the two “mighty
opposites”, Hamlet on the one hand and Claudius and his associates on the
other, and not a struggle between a radical humanist of the sixteenth century
and the contemporary ruling class. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
the Marxist historical critics, then, <i>Hamlet </i>seems to have interest only
as a play of the realistic type with a radical humanist as its hero “who, in
the year 1600, could no longer look at society from the point of view of the
ruling class.” The play has interest only as a document in social criticism and
not as a supreme tragic art form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hamlet nor Shakespeare, in the year 1600, could resolve in action, even
tragically, the dilemma of a youngman from whose eyes the veils which shrouded
so many truths about the class-divided society had been torn. Shakespeare could
do nothing about Hamlet’s dilemma except express it with profound realism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Marxist interpretation of <i>Hamlet </i>as the realistic expression of a
dilemma about a class-divided society is just another kind of
oversimplification like the other critical interpretations which have
considered the play as a psychological study in character. The American critic
Francis Ferguson has quite discerningly taken note of the analogies in <i>Hamlet:
</i>besides the analogous father-son relationships and analogous stories in the
play itself, there are, according to him, stretching beyond the play in all
directions, analogies between Denmark and England; Denmark and Rome under the
mightiest Julius; Hamlet’s stage and Shakespeare’s stage; the theatre and life;
and finally Denmark and the traditional cosmos. Every critic who has approached
this play has been tempted to dwell exclusively on one of these analogies or
one of the facets of this many-sided play to the exclusion of its other
engaging and no less irrelevant aspects. Arnold Kettle’s Marxist approach also
suffers from this concern to extract meaning out of the play by overstating the
analogy between Shakespeare’s England and Hamlet’s corrupt state of Denmark; it
ignores the other analogies in <i>Hamlet–</i>particularly the one between the
world of Denmark and cosmos, and by doing so, misses altogether its bewildering
richness and other levels of significance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is obvious that the Marxist approach of Arnold Kettle, like some of the earlier
critical approaches of Bradley and other critics, concentrates on the delay
motive in the story and tries to explain it away in terms of an external
cause–Hamlet’s intolerance of “the accepted standards of the contemporary
ruling class.” The tenor of Arnold Kettle’s critical thinking seems to suggest
that Hamlet delays because he is a radical humanist who cannot bring himself
round to conform to the old revenge code. Even the statement that Hamlet for
the greater part of the play behaves as a humanist and then relapses towards
the end into the role of a conventional prince has the implication that
Hamlet’s earlier hesitancy in carrying out the command of his ghost-father
springs from an innate revulsion towards the revenge code–a revulsion
characteristic of a radical humanist–and that he later overcomes that revulsion
in order to conform to the “law of honour.” While an innate revulsion towards
the revenge code can be a convincing cause for Hamlet’s delay, it alone cannot
account for Hamlet being a radical humanist with a “new view of the world.” It
is also worth pointing out that the innate revulsion towards the demands of the
code is a revulsion typical of a highly sensitive and self-conscious human
being whom Hamlet was meant to represent. For all his humanist sensibility and
views on man (“O what a piece of work is man...” 11,2, 1. 313-316), Hamlet, it
must be noted, never rejects altogether the duty of revenge, the “imperious
demand” from beyond the grave. He is never content to say like Charlemont in <i>Athiest’s
Tragedy </i>“Patience is honest man’s revenge,” nor does he completely give up
the old concept of ‘honour.’ The following passage, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“revolutionary” outlook attributed to him by Arnold Kettle. What has been
missed by the Marxist critic is that the questioning of the revenge code and
all the other values it stood for is done not so much by the Danish Prince as
by his creator. This implicit criticism of the revenge code–one of “the ways of
behaviour” of the contemporary ruling class–is made by the dramatist in an
imperceptible manner and has been adroitly built into the tragic pattern of the
play. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

To say this is not to deny the existence of some amount of criticism of the age
in the play; no one who has read the play can miss the undercurrent of
criticism of the age which is found in the ironic portrayal of Polonlus and
Osric, in the topical allusions to theatres and actors, and also in the
treatment of the pagan concept of revenge so popular in the day. But, the mould
and tone of the whole play, it must be noted, are not those of a modern
realistic play. Whatever criticism there is in the play, either implicit or
explicit, has been subordinated to the tragic pattern, and in no way upsets the

is significant that a lot of interest has been evinced in recent years in the
revenge theme and framework of the play. A true historical approach demands, in
fact, a consideration of all the factors that had a bearing on the popularity
of revenge on the Elizabethan stage, and the dramatic and artistic use that
Shakespeare has made of the revenge theme in the light of the prevalent
attitudes towards it. Paul S. Conklin, in his examination of the <i>Hamlet</i>
criticism in the early seventeenth century found scattered in the various kinds
of writings of the period, concludes that the seventeenth century, in its early
decades in particular, viewed Hamlet primarily as “a bitterly eloquent and
princely avenger”. The early seventeenth century’s reaction to Shakespeare’s
“Sweet Prince” as its own significance and is a pointer to the way
Shakespeare’s audience must have viewed this play as one belonging to the
revenge tradition. Recent scholarly work has made a study of the various
factors that had made revenge a popular theme on the Elizabethan stage; one of
the principal reasons for its popularity was that it had been treated in the
plays of Seneca and some Greek dramatists whole influence inspired Kyd and
others to essay plays on the subject; and the other no less important reason
for its popularity was a social factor rather than a literary one in that
revenge was linked up with the medieval and Elizabethan conception of ‘honour’
which prompted many a nobleman to take recourse to duels for effecting private
revenge despite the religious and Biblical injunctions against it. Revenge
continued to sway the feelings of the Elizabethans in spite of the propaganda
against it by the Ecclesiastical personnel of the day. In the light of all the
prevalent attitudes towards revenge, Shakespeare’s treatment of it in a play on
the subject deserves our attention. It would be helpful to know whether
Shakespeare takes up his own moral stand on a convention so popular in his day
or whether he uncritically conforms to the pagan concept of revenge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

John Lawlor’s study has the merit of defining the nature of the tragic conflict
in <i>Hamlet </i>and Shakespeare’s incomparable contribution to revenge
tragedy, it has not brought out clearly whether Shakespeare has taken any stand
on the issue of the ethic of revenge. It was, of course, out of an artistic and
dramatic necessity that Shakespeare refrained from making his hero raise
explicit questions about the revenge code, but, it is inconceivable that a
dramatist like Shakespeare whose last plays unmistakably extol the Christian
virtue of forgiveness and reconcilement and whose philosopher-hero (Prospero)
of <i>The Tempest </i>proclaims, “The rarer action is in virtue than in
vengeance” (V, 1, 1, 27-28), should have uncritically accepted the pagan
concept of revenge in a play like <i>Hamlet. </i>Critical opinion in recent
years has been sharply divided over the question of whether <i>Hamlet </i>is an
indictment of revenge or not. Some critics have tended to regard the play as a
study of revenge in the abstract, while a critic like Bertram Joseph quotes
impressive historical evidence from the writings of the period in support of
his view that “<i>Hamlet </i>is set in the Renaissance tradition of honourable
and noble behaviour” and that in Shakespeare’s time “the law of honour,” which
was the law of revenge, “was still regarded as akin to the law of nature.” The

there is no reason to believe that it can be considered as altogether devoid of
even an implicit criticism of a particular convention–revenge as a duty for the
murdered kinsman. It is true, as Bertram Joseph says, that “there is no
overwhelming condemnation of revenge or of the normal attitude to nobility and
honour” in <i>Hamlet </i>at least, or even in the rest of Shakespeare’s work
But Bertram Joseph commits the mistake of equating Hamlet’s attitude to revenge
with Shakespeare’s own; he also gives far too much of importance to the
opinions about the “law of honour” which were prevalent in Shakespeare’s time
and which do not seem to have influenced considerably Shakespeare’s treatment
of the revenge theme in this particular play. Though we may not find “any overt
statement in the play that revenge is unworthy,” we nevertheless do find an
implicit and ironic criticism of the code of revenge built into the tragic
structure of the play. Shakespeare has not altogether failed to refashion the
materials of his story according to his own vision, and it cannot be too
readily assumed that Shakespeare retained, along with some other elements of
the plot, the pagan morality of revenge of his source. There is sufficient
evidence in the play itself to show that Shakespeare has not altogether avoided
taking a moral stance on the question of revenge. The character of Laertes is a
case in point. Current <i>Hamlet </i>criticism regards Laertes as a typical
example of the traditional avenger familiar to the Elizabethan audience, a
character who will “dare damnation” and will sweep to revenge in utter
disregard of all moral values in order to obey the “law of honour”. The
readiness with which Laertes joins hands with Claudius in laying the treacherous
“mousetrap” of the duel for Hamlet is a reminder of what the noble prince
cannot stoop to under any circumstance. Laertes has all the traits required in
a true revenger while Hamlet has not; Hamlet all the time aspires to be a
revenger and in the end becomes one only by chance in the last duel scene; his
manner of killing Claudius with the envenomed point can hardly be described as
a premeditated act of an avenger and can at best be described as an act of
requital for Cladius’s treachery in the duel. While the character of Laertes is
thus meant to be a ‘reflector’ (to use Henry Jame’s word) to Hamlet, throwing
light on the prince’s nobler and more honourable nature, it is also meant to be
an ironic criticism of the unscrupulous avengers of the revenge tradition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

moral import of these lines is unmistakable, if not very palpable: an
uncritical following of the code of revenge, however time-honoured and popular
it may be, can only lead to “carnal bloody and unnatural acts,” enmeshing both
the guilty who put on deaths by cunning and the avengers who cause them by
“forced cause”. It is the code of revenge, with its cult of blood, that wrecks
even a noble and “Sweet Prince” like Hamlet who, despite all his questionings
and probings of weightier and more serious matters, never questions the duty of
revenge, although his manner of achieving revenge in the duel scene amounts to
hoisting the “engineer” with his own “petar”, and in that sense is not so
treacherous and dishonourable as Laertes’s way of achieving revenge. But there
is no mistake about what has been the chief motivating force of all the
havoc–of all the “carnal” and “unnatural acts” and the “casual slaughters”–in
the play: Destiny, as if to expose the flaws or a code devised by fallible
human intelligence, has chosen the evil-doers and the avengers as its agents to
show how the inexorable laws of divine retribution and justice operate in this
universe. In the concatenation of all the seemingly random events operating as
pure chance and the willed acts of the major characters in the play–a
concatenation which alone can sustain the tragic sense–the code of revenge, it
is obvious, also forms an inevitable link and a no less significant driving
force. In short, instead of showing directly the fatal consequences of the
working of the revenge code, Shakespeare has subsumed it all into the larger
cosmic design of destiny and human character and, by so doing, has preserved
the basic tragic structure of his play without allowing it to acquire the
overtones of a morality play. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

by then the norm for the treatment of revenge matter. With his attendant spirit
always guiding him properly, Shakespeare could yet subordinate the supposedly
“intractable” material of the revenge story to the larger design of a tragedy
and thus make his own incomparable contribution to the revenge tradition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

understand the nature of Shakespeare’s contribution, it is necessary to
perceive the exact manner in which Shakespeare’s rivals in the revenge
tradition have failed to raise their plays to the higher level of a tragedy.
Kyd, Shakespeare’s predecessor in the revenge tradition, relied solely on a
pagan morality of revenge and on showing dramatically, by making use of the
melo-dramatic elements, how his hero meets the requirements of the code; this
explains why the <i>Spanish Tragedy </i>is only a revenge play rather than a
Shakespearian tragedy. Shakespeare’s successors, Chapman and Tourneur, tried to
introduce some variations into the revenge pattern by raising the question of
the ethic of revenge but these variations, as John<i> </i>Lawlor’s study has
made it clear, resulted only in depriving their plays of a tragic conflict.
Shakespeare’s triumph consists in the preservation of the tragic balance and in
the introduction of a subtler kind of criticism of the revenge code. By working
within the limits of a tragic art-form Shakespeare could emphasise equally the
part played by human character and a mysterious ‘Destiny’ shaping the events
implacably; this helps the dramatist in investing his theme with far more
universality than a conventional treatment of the revenge matter would have
made it possible. It should also be noticed how Shakespeare has made the best
artistic use of the freedom that the form of tragedy<i> </i>allowed him: since
most of the tragic heroes are ‘scapegoats’, in a sense, Shakespeare makes
Hamlet also appear as a ‘scapegoat’, in two different ways; Hamlet is made a
scapegoat by Destiny in the sense that he too is swept away in the final
purgation of ‘cankerous evil’ which takes place in the state of Denmark; he is
made a scapegoat by the revenge code also in so far as the necessity to carry
out the injunctions of revenge enjoined on him, enmeshes him, as it were, in a
chain of events which finally leads to his being an avenger himself while
becoming at the same time the object of another avenger (Laertes) for having
earlier killed Polonius. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

implicit criticism of the revenge code is certainly one of the many levels of
significance that Shakespeare’s masterpiece on the revenge theme has to offer.
Shakespeare seems to have deliberately shrouded this criticism with ambiguity
and subsumed it into the larger design of a tragedy so that the play may not
descend to the level of a realistic satire. This ambiguity appears to have
positive virtues rather than negative virtues when we bring the right kind of
historical perspective to our study of the play. As a dramatist working for the
public theatre in the year 1601, Shakespeare possibly could not have attacked
openly a convention which was so popular and which was also at the same time
bound up with the way of life of the nobility. If <i>Hamlet </i>had contained
an open repudiation of revenge, it would have acquired the overtones of a
modern problem play like Galsworthy’s <i>Silver Box </i>which, for all its
tragic intention and tone, suffers from having a narrow focus in so far as it
is concerned only with bringing to light the inadequacies of a social set up.
By showing the working of an old convention within the larger design of Destiny
and character–a design characteristic of classical tragedy–Shakespeare could
satisfy the demands of great art, and also of the contemporary theatre without
at the same time compromising his artistic integrity by an uncritical
acceptance of the revenge code of his medieval story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Marxist historical approach fails to take note of Shakespeare’s supreme
achievement in the revenge tradition by narrowly considering Hamlet’s problem
as a dilemma about a class-divided society. A true historical approach, on the
other hand, would make us aware of the great qualities of intelligence and
moral sensibility which a master dramatist has brought to bear on his treatment
of what was by then a stock-in-trade revenge theme. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

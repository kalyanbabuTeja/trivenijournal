style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Right
from his birth to death in 1950, Harold J. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> was
concerned mainly with the liberty and rights of the individual. As a
progressive intellectual he insisted more on an experimental political
philosophy based on a dynamic theory of state functions and a social psychology
of the motives and desires of men than on abstract principles of politics. He
always remained in search of a new faith, and came under the various influences
which made him change his political ideas from time to time. At the successive
stages of his career we find him as an ardent proponent of some sort of
individualistic federalism, <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>marxian</span></span>
socialism and democratic trade unionism. His activities as a political
philosopher, teacher, party leader, public speaker and confidential adviser to
public men, were so numerous that he found no time to revise his political
writings and give them a consistent statement. Nevertheless, the corner-stone
of his political philosophy was his faith in the individual. To establish this
we must examine carefully his career. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harold
<span class=SpellE>Laski</span>, the second son of Nathan and Sarah <span
class=SpellE>Laski</span>, was born in a Jewish community on June 30, 1893.
This was the period when different ideologies, such as Utilitarianism, Fabian
Socialism and Communism were spreading with a view to reforming the various
prevalent conceptions regarding sovereignty, parliamentary democracy and
economic and political liberties of the individual. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span>,
the product of such a period, imbibed its spirit fully. As a young boy he spent
most of his time reading books on science and liberalism. They predisposed him
to oppose all orthodox opinions and dogmas regarding the social and political
institutions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is interesting to note that the political movements which impressed young <span
class=SpellE>Laski</span> in his undergraduate days, and to which he constantly
referred in his early articles, were the women’s Suffrage Movement, trade union
movement in <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region> and the
alliance between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ulster</st1:country-region> and
a section of the Conservative Party to sabotage the Liberals’ Home Rule
Legislation for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
These movements of the pre-war period were rooted in a violent outburst against
the spirit of Victorian Liberalism. In this period the belief in the gradual
progress in the status of women and the respect for constitutional procedures
were rejected by the more violent Suffragettes and the radical trade unionists.
It seemed as if the orderliness and respectability of the nineteenth century
had become such a strain on the feelings of a number of men that they were
trying to destroy the liberal world in which they lived. It was at this period
that <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> spent his formative years in school and
college, and he became a rebel against such an atmosphere. He felt the need to
dedicate his life to find out a new world with a view to relieving the
downtrodden common man from want, ignorance and misery that were noticed as the
common feature of the Victorian era. He took part in Suffragette Movement and
helped the strike of <span class=SpellE>chainmakers</span> by collecting money.
At this time, though he remained content with constitutional agitation, the
idea of revolution was agitating his mind. He wrote a short book with the title
<i>The Chosen People </i>(which remains unpublished), in which he told that we
should welcome the ideas of Darwin and Marx in order to get rid of traditional
outlook that had become outworn. Further, he maintained that social truth could
only be discovered in an atmosphere of freedom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a translation of <span class=SpellE>Le’on</span> <span class=SpellE>Duguit’s</span>
book <i>Law in the Modern State </i>on political pluralism from French. At the
same time, he was greatly influenced by the writings of the late F. W. Maitland
while studying history at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>.
Ernest Barker was mainly responsible for it. Barker, his tutor, himself being
interested in the academic revolt against <span class=SpellE>Hegelism</span>,
encouraged him in his study of mediaeval lawyers. <span class=SpellE>Gierke</span>,
Maitland and <span class=SpellE>Figgis</span> had justified the theory of
corporate personality as applied to religious and industrial organizations in
society. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> drew inspiration from them, and his
earlier writings were devoted to the task of supporting the theory of corporate
personality of religious bodies and guilds which were able to maintain their
rights and independence against the state in the <span class=GramE>Middle</span>
Ages. He argued that trade unions should have a similar position in the modern
society. But his theory of groups was different from that of Figgie, <span
class=SpellE>Gierke</span> and Maitland. It was purely individualistic in
essence, because he maintained it for safeguarding individual liberty. For this
purpose he also made a special study of the legal system which protects the
rights of associations and free speech in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> thus started his
career with an attack on the monistic theory of state sovereignty, as expounded
by the idealists, considering it as dangerous to individual liberty. To defend
individual liberty against the coercive authority of the state, he, on the one
hand, tried to establish the corporate personality of groups, and, on the
other, he elaborated the individualistic theory of obedience to the state. His
formula of “contingent anarchy”, appearing as it does in his individualistic
theory of obedience, worked as a revision of the relations between the
individual and the state. He criticized traditional political thought for its
concentration on state power at the expense of the political society (the
people), for its over-simple assumptions about human nature and for its <i>penchant
</i>for deductive reasoning. He remarked: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
simple <i>a priori </i>premises of Hobbes or Locke, the intriguing mysticism of
Rousseau’s General Will, eloquence about the initiative of men and its
translation into terms of private property are no longer suited to a world that
has seen its foundations in flame because to its good intentions an adequate
knowledge was not joined. What we need...is the sober and scientific study of
the conditions of social organizations.” <sup>1</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Quite
often <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> called for a new inductive political
philosophy, <span class=SpellE>centred</span> less on political principles than
on administrative functions and based on a realistic social psychology that
would do more justice to the complex character of human personality and
motivation than did the psychology of Aristotle or <span class=SpellE>Machiavelli</span>
or Hobbes. He did not approve of the classical theory of human nature that
regards it as static and fixed. On the contrary, he asserted that human nature
is dynamic and evolutionary. Like Graham <span class=SpellE>Wallas</span>, he
thought that the new political theory, seeking an institutional structure that
would offer opportunities for the creative expression of the diverse impulses
of men more adequate than those provided by the sovereign state, should be
grounded in a satisfactory knowledge of the motives and desires of men. Each
man must be encouraged to realize his own personality, while the state must be
so organized as to give scope to the individual’s sense of spontaneity and his
creative impulses, thereby fostering the emergence of a wide diversity in the
desires, attitudes and values of its citizens.<sup>2</sup> Since he was
primarily concerned with the preservation and promotion of individuality and
spontaneity, he rejected order and unity as the final values. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
hinted above, <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> studied carefully the pluralistic
and pragmatic philosophies of <span class=SpellE>Figgis</span> and Maitland and
James and Dewey, and found a point of view that was extremely congenial to his
own opposition to the revived state idealism, and to his conviction, which
marked him as heir to the utilitarian tradition of <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span>
and the Mills, that the state was to be judged in the light of its actual
contributions to the well-being of its citizens. The test of validity of state
action is a pragmatic and utilitarian test. That is, how far successful it is
in achieving its purpose, namely, the promotion of the good life for its
citizens. Viewed in this fashion, the state becomes, he thought, what <span
class=SpellE>Duguit</span> called “a great public service corporation”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further,
as he was aware of the dangers of concentration of powers in the state, he
called its authority as federal. There are, he argued, various associations in
society, and each of them has an important part to play in the development and
enrichment of an individual’s personality. But each association has only a
partial contribution to make to the individual. The state, as one of these
associations, can satisfy only the partial needs of the individuals, and
therefore their allegiance to the state is partial. The state cannot regulate
the whole life of a man, and it must share this function with other
associations. The state, in this sense, is not independent. It is rather
pluralistic and federal as society is federal.</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Laski</span> thus argued in his
earlier writings that the authority of the state should be federalized and mass
participation in Political activity be increased. If these principles reflect
his adherence to the ideals of individual and group freedom, they also
constitute limitations upon the exercise of power, weapons for defending <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> and its organizations against hostile action on the
part of the state. There was, therefore, a fundamental ambivalence in his
attitude towards the state’s final coercive power, and he conceived of the
authority of the state as conditional. The state is given power to control men and
their voluntary groups in order that it may satisfy their common needs; it
commands obedience to its laws from them as long as they are in their interest.
But gradually his belief that the individual cannot develop his personality and
enjoy freedom in the presence of economic insecurity, which he had maintained
somehow or other from his early childhood and which he called as the “central
conviction” of his life, became stronger after the publication of <i>Grammar of
Politics </i>(1925) owing to the changed political and economic situations in
Europe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a great economic crisis in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>, which
he ascribed to the inefficient capitalist system. He felt that even the British
and American democracies were unable to tackle their economic problems of this
period. As opposed to the failure of economic policies in capitalist
democracies, the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> had made great
economic progress and had directed its efforts towards the equalization of
wealth and the establishment of economic security for all the citizens. The
comparison of the British and the American systems with that of the <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> convinced him that the <span class=SpellE>demecratization</span>
of state power was not the real solution of the problem, and that individual
liberty was merely a function of economic equality. Consequently, his faith in
some sort of humanistic socialism, mainly rooted in his sense of social
justice, which he had maintained from his young age, became stronger. He
himself had admitted: “I have, I suppose, been a socialist in some degree ever
since the last years of my school days.”<sup> 3</sup> He also had recorded the
influence exerted upon him while he was a schoolboy in Manchester by a “great
schoolmaster who made us feel the sickness of an acquisitive society”, by the
books he had read, especially those of the <span class=SpellE>Webbs</span>, and
by a speech in which <span class=SpellE>Keir</span> <span class=SpellE>Hardie</span>
had described the <span class=SpellE>labour</span> struggles of the Scottish
miners. He became sick of the old economic structure of society and gradually
started looking towards <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>marxism</span></span>
for an answer. While accepting Marx’s economic interpretation of politics and
living under his strong influence, he called his early pluralism a half-way
house to the real solution of the problem. For him “the pluralist attitude to
the state and law was a stage on the road to an acceptance of the Marxian
attitude to them”. <sup>4</sup> His argument was that as the state was an
“executive instrument” of the economically dominant group in society, it was
necessary to destroy first of all the class-structure of society before
limiting the powers of the state. In a classless society, he thought, the
purpose and the function of the state would automatically change. With this
also changed his definition of individual liberty as found in the first edition
of <i>Grammar of Politics </i>(1925). He asserted that liberty was not so much
a positive thing as it was a negative condition. As such, strong state action
was essential both to protect the individual liberty and to change the old
economic structure of society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
<span class=SpellE>Laski</span> approved of the necessity of a strong state
(during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism) with a view to
bringing about a new economic structure and, at the same time, regulating the
federal life of society, he was never in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of
the method which Russia had applied in replacing her old economic system by a
new <span class=SpellE>marxist</span> system. He also did not welcome the
dictatorship in Soviet Russia and the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>marxian</span></span>
identification of state with society. His fundamental belief was in the freedom
of the mind, and he regarded society as federal in character. He always
insisted upon the democratization of the state power. The groups, he said, must
enjoy the necessary freedom in their own sphere of action, and they should
participate in the process of administration. Without this the state would
become </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

could not be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sacrificed for the sake of a strong state for
creating a new socialist state. He paid a glowing tribute to Britain for its
democratic way of life in the following words: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Nowhere
have I found in greater degree either the qualities which make private life
lovely or in public relations the instinctive embodiment of the anxiety for<i> </i>fair
play...When all is said against this people that can be said, British
leadership seems to me to have been a beneficent thing in the history of
civilization.”<sup> 5</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
accepting the power of the state as a stage to bring classless society, he did
not dismiss the fears of bureaucracy and ignore the need for safeguards. He
said “unless we <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> that decentralization is
the secret of freedom, government becomes ‘they’ instead ‘we’; and that sense
of aloofness is fatal to the <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> of
personality. Do let us ceaselessly remember that planned democracy is planning
for the individual citizen, and not against him.”<sup> 6</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Holding
the purpose of society superior to that of the state, he still insisted upon
the need of participation of voluntary groups in the process of administration.
The state should give to the groups their due place in the inquiries and
negotiations that precede any final decision of the government. Representatives
of voluntary associations should sit with and advise government officials on
political and economic questions of common interest. There should be a network
of advisory committees and industrial councils to guide the government at all
levels, and the rule-making powers should be more and more devolved upon
territorial and functional assemblies in order to check the concentration of
powers in the hands of the government. Such a mass participation in the
democratization of state power, he regarded as highly essential to safeguard
the individual and group freedom against the coercive authority of the state.
His argument was that the atmosphere we required, if we wanted to attain
happiness for the multitude, was one in which we were to gain everything by
common experience and not by force and compulsion. In a dictatorship the
leaders insist upon an artificial unity, and, as such, there remains no scope
for diversities in social life. The chief danger to society, according to him,
is from the desire of those who possess power, because they develop, in the
long run, the habit of keeping society static for their personal gains. But society,
he argued, is not static; it is dynamic and diverse. And the path to happiness
is not a single one. Men are not willing to yield the insight of their
experience to other men’s insight, merely because they are commanded to do so.
They love freedom and try to maintain it by all means because it is necessary
for the development of their life. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> remarked
that “liberty cannot help being a courage to resist the demands of power at
some point that is deemed decisive; and because of this, liberty, also, is an
inescapable doctrine of contingent anarchy. It is always a threat to those who
operate the engines of authority that prohibition of experience will be
denied.”<sup> 7</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

idea of some sort of commonwealth of economic groups and trade unions, working
side by side with the government. He pleaded that it was only with their
consent and their collective effort that any economic and political change in
society could be brought about. Thus he was in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of a conscious change in which the masses participate actively and consciously.
He was so <span class=SpellE>enamoured</span> of individual freedom and the
democratic way of life that, in spite of his acceptance of the necessity of a
strong state, he completely dismissed the idea of an all-inclusive state. He
argued for a limited state authority with a view to maintaining individual
liberty. He did not want that its authority should ever degenerate into
dictatorship as it had happened in the Soviet Union. As he was conscious of
society and its federal structure, he constantly regarded authority as federal
and believed that the state necessarily worked in society as one of its
agencies. It is society which always determines what should be the purpose and
functions of the state from time to time. Thus the state, according to him, is
merely a means to attain social justice, and it should work as an instrument of
realizing the multitudinous aims </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the above analysis of <span class=SpellE>Laski’s</span> career it can be stated
that he was mainly concerned with the understanding of the problems of
individual liberty in relation to the complexities of society and the
restraining character of state authority. He did not discuss the claims of
individual liberty, the nature of society and the character of state authority,
separately, from an academic viewpoint. On the contrary, as a political
philosopher, he viewed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

of the period in which he lived. The time in which he was born and lived was
the period of revolution and reform. The liberalism of the Victorian Age was
crumbling down, and the various theories like pluralism, Fabian socialism and
communism were becoming more and more popular. Under the influence of these
theories, the claims of the people were put forward with a view to raising
their standard of living, and there was a general demand to modify the existing
political institutions in order to bring an overall change in their economic
and political status in society. The change in the position of the working
class and women was urgently needed. For that it was urgent, firstly, to change
the economic order of society, and, secondly, to review the classical theory of
state monism. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span> studied the problems of his time
and tried to find out a solution to them. He was not an arm-chair thinker, but,
on the contrary, he was out and out a practical man. He was always ready to
admit his mistakes and revise his political ideas in view of the changed
political and economic conditions, and, as such, he was not at all dogmatic in
his attitude towards any political, or economic or social question. He remained
sincere, throughout his career, to the cause of individual freedom and human
progress, and discussed the authority of the state in the perspective of the
various demands of the federal society. Thus his theory of the state was a
dynamic theory of state functions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

intellectual leader of a great number of people in England and exerted his
influence, directly or indirectly, in shaping the various policies of the
country. If he did not stick to one political faith in his life, it was due to
his over-conscientiousness which made him hesitant about every political theory
of the state. But whereas other 18th and 19th century thinkers failed in
adjusting the claims of the individual to those of the state, he succeeded with
his factual and realistic approach to the problem. Adam Smith, Ricardo, <span
class=SpellE>Malthus</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span> and J. S. Mill
were utterly practical, and they relied too much upon the selfish nature of the
individual. These thinkers commonly shared the view that, as self-interest is
the motive force in society, the state should interfere with commerce and
industry as little as possible. Although they differed from one another on
several points, their conclusion that liberty is the essence of restraint was
practically the same. Such a conclusion regarding human nature was prompted by
their defective knowledge of human psychology. Hence, their <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
of the selfish nature of man and the freedom of opinion is not adequate to
remove all our doubts. As they missed the academic and conceptual aspects of
the problem, they failed in reconciling individual liberty to state authority.
On the other hand, Green, Bradley and <span class=SpellE>Bosanquet</span> were
university professors and their approach was too academic. As academicians,
they idealized the state and accepted, to all intents and purposes, the majesty
and might of the ‘government. Even Green was no exception to it. He too
insisted that the state was the only source of actual rights. By freedom he
understood an identification of oneself with the Divine Spirit. And since he
agreed that the Divine Spirit found its highest expression in the state, it is
obvious how close was his approach to the Hegelian thesis that true liberty is
realized in the state, to which <span class=SpellE>Bosanquet</span> and Bradley
were wholeheartedly committed. Their conclusion regarding the realization of
liberty by the individual was completely vague and not understandable. They,
were not conversant with the practical nature of the problem, and, as such,
they visualized things from a distance. Consequently, they also failed in
finding out an adequate solution of the problem. <span class=SpellE>Laski</span>
had an advantage over both sets of thinkers. He was both an academician and a
practical statesman. He looked to the problem at close quarters and could
succeed in presenting a well-argued thesis on individual liberty. He followed a
middle-path in opposition to the empty individualism of Adam Smith, <span
class=SpellE>Ricardi</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span> and Mill and the
pseudo-Hegelianism of Oxford idealists like Green, Bradley and <span

their minds regarding the economic and political problems of their age. He told
them not to be dogmatic in their outlook and judge things on the basis of their
usefulness in social life. The age we live in is an age of reason and
criticism. It is an age in which we question and examine everything before we
accept it. We cannot approve of things because they were found valuable in the
past. He, therefore, warned them that it would be a sheer mistake to stick to
one conclusion dogmatically. In his own life he was always found ready to admit
the mistakes of his conclusions and revise them with a new vision. As a
political analyst, he evaluated political institutions and political problems

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Bapirazu joined the
first year class of the College, if I remember rightly, in nineteen thirteen,
when he would have been about sixteen years old, He and I were eminently what
Bhavabhuti calls <span class=SpellE><i>samana</i></span><i> dharma</i>;<i> </i>our
dispositions were remarkably alike, and that in so many ways that I cannot
easily remember which particular predilection it was that first drew us
together. I think it must have been his delight in telling stories of his
boyhood. I always enjoyed what seemed to me the romantic glimpses of old Indian
country life which all too rarely relieved the dullness of my students’ essays.
Bapirazu would from the first have been unusually rewarding in this respect.
But it was his oral communication of such fare that I remember better. A
delightful talker in every way, and a sworn lover of country life and country
lore, he was especially a born story-teller, with a remarkable gift of
reminiscence. He lived with zest and with equal zest remembered. Heaven, he
said to me once, is remembering our pleasant times. This from a sage of less
than twenty years! What a pity that he never lived to write a book of pure
reminiscence such as a poet writes in age. It might well have been his best
book, for I doubt whether the best of him ever got into his books. Many of his
casual memories it is now my own turn to remember. He told me once how nearly
we came to never meeting at all. He had a cousin who resembled him from babyhood,
and once after a family festival the two mothers unwittingly exchanged babies.
The mistake was only <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> because his mother
presently missed her baby’s anklets. More personally revealing was his account
of the habit he developed rather later of stealing from (I think) his
grandfather’s bed to watch the midnight shadow plays or ‘Skin-pictures’, that
delightful old Asian equivalent of the now too, too Western movies. His
grandfather always knew where to look for him. A ‘Skin-picture’ fan myself, I
tried later to persuade him (and to persuade my friend the Editor of <i>Triveni
</i>to persuade him) to write an account of that early love of his, with
coloured drawings by his own hand of those traditionally ornate and glorious
transparencies of leather, those two-dimensional and radiant effigies of the
stately Rama and the terrible Ravana and the nimble Hanuman. What more
endearing epitome and memento could we have desired of the later poet and
painter, with his abiding devotion to his country’s tradition as enshrined in
the poetry and picture and music of the Andhra folk as well as of their social
betters? Alas, it was never to be written,–I feel sure that he meant to write
it. I cannot believe that he ever grew ashamed of his earliest idolatry and its
innocent object, as I suspect that too many of Mr. Ramakotiswara Rau’s readers
were and perhaps still are ashamed of those lovely untouchables. I say perhaps,
for I wonder if any ‘<span class=SpellE>Tolu</span> <span class=SpellE>Bommalu</span>’
fellowships in Andhra still survive the competition of their all-conquering
Western counterpart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
good example of <span class=SpellE>Bapirazu’s</span> gift of happy childhood
reminiscence is the account of an old-fashioned Brahmin wedding which I have
incorporated almost word for word (for it arrived opportunely in a letter) in
the marriage chapter of my <i>South Indian Hours </i>(P.223). There are many
other traces of him in my writings, I recorded<i> </i>in the same book his
impromptu comparison of a certain recurring type of September <span
class=SpellE>raincloud</span> to a <span class=SpellE>Nagaraja</span> with
expanded hood, and another of Pampas plumes beside <span class=SpellE>Godavary</span>
to clouds seen from a mountain top at dawn; these promising now not the
story-teller but the poet. The story of <span class=SpellE>Balakrishna</span>
in my <i>Phantom Waterfall </i>collection is an artificial amalgam of two true
episodes, the setting a sketch of him in action from life, the rest an
experience of his in his own words which came like the wedding in a later
letter. The sketch illustrates several characteristics of the future poet and
painter; his love of images visible and invisible, of playful myth-making, of
swimming. The first and last at least I shared with him. He gave me the <span
class=SpellE>Nandi</span> which he found in the river and I still have it (but
it is of copper not of silver). The stone <span class=SpellE>Venugopala</span>
from <span class=SpellE>Bhuvaneshwar</span> he managed to retain. To finish
with my larcenies, the first verse of the poem “To his Friend beside <span
class=SpellE>Godavary</span>” in my <i>Sonnets of East and West </i>is a
literal translation of a Telugu verse of his written on a Christmas card about
1917. This card has also a drawing of an allegorical maiden. Such handmade
Christmas cards I used to get regularly about that time and earlier from the
Damerla brothers and <span class=SpellE>Varada</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkataratnam</span>
also and still have several. But <span class=SpellE>Bapirazu’s</span> alone
bore original verse. The second verse of my poem is my own and was prompted by
an inexplicable cessation of his letters to me in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I did not know that he was
then in prison for too rashly airing his patriotic sentiments. Otherwise in the
twenties we wrote to one another astonishingly </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>often as it now
seems to me. In the thirties the exchange began to flag and later became
spasmodic, but it never died away. So after all the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Sacred</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">River</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
never had to freeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was from these handmade Christmas cards suggested no doubt by those of Ram and <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Varada</span></span><span class=GramE>, that</span>
I first noticed the promise that was in him to draw as well as write. He had
not Ram’s <sup>1</sup> visual grip, but his delight in pictures and picturing
and general inventiveness led me to think that he might succeed painter in a
less naturalistic manner than that which attracted </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ram,
and I suggested that he should learn to draw in the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>archaistic
manner then <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> in Bengal. When the Bengalis
later sent an educational art mission to the South he remembered my suggestion
and followed it, how happily is known to all. I mention <span class=GramE>this
the</span> more gladly for an amusing reason. When my book on <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place> was published in 1924 no less a person than Sir (as he
became) William <span class=SpellE>Rothenstein</span> spoke of me to his
students as “the man who misleads the Indians”. I heard this at the time from
one of the said students, now a painter of distinction. Now Sir William can
only have heard of an obscure pedagogue of ‘the benighted Presidency’ like me
from the Bengalis, perhaps through Mr. <span class=SpellE>Havell</span>; and
the Bengalis can only have heard of me from Ram when he once paid them a visit;
and Ram can hardly have told them more of me and my connection with painting
(for there was little more to tell in words) than the fact that I had helped
him to join the Bombay School of Art. So my misleading of the Indians boils
down to this! How deeply it rankled in Calcutta (for in those days there was
sharp rivalry between the two Schools) appears from Mr. O. C. <span
class=SpellE>Gangoly’s</span> amazing outburst against both Ram and me as many
as ten years later in a letter to <i>Triveni </i>when it printed my
recollections of Ram (see the three issues of <i>Triveni </i>from January to
October 1931). That I had in the meanwhile atoned in a measure for my earlier
perversity by sending another disciple to a colony at least of the Calcutta
School, perhaps itself sent South to counteract my baleful influence, had
evidently not redeemed my character. I hope these memories of that other
disciple will not elicit a like protest from the other direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the end of my time in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
I used to employ someone to read to me after dinner to save my <span

another reader. The two </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>were supposed to come on alternate
evenings, but it seemed to me that Bapirazu too often persuaded his partner to
take his place, for<i> </i>I do not remember that he ever took his partner’s
place in return. His partner was an obliging youth and a Christian</span><sup><span

I hope that Bapirazu made it up to him in other ways. Our<i> </i>reading when

my Telugu, but oftener we talked, instead, of everything under the sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1916 both Bapirazu and Damerla Rama Rao went with me to <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Ajanta</span></st1:place>. Ram was already studying art at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>, and we picked him
up at <span class=SpellE>Manmad</span>. We rode from<i> </i><span class=SpellE>Jalgaon</span>
in pony carts, Ram riding in mine for<i> </i>half the way and Bapirazu for<i> </i>the
other half. We spent several adventurous days exploring the caves. Our first
visit was made without a guide, and we found the most famous of the painted
caves heavily padlocked. We made violent but vain assaults on the first of
these <span class=SpellE>defences</span> to confront us. This was at the famous
Seventeenth cave, and Bapirazu attributed the violent rainstorms by which our
whole sojourn was thereafter interrupted and endangered (for we were never sure
of being able to ford the torrent) to the <span class=SpellE>Nagaraja</span>
guardian whose chapel is immediately below, and whose dank and ancient sanctity
seems to pervade the valley. <span class=GramE>Standing overawed once in the
vast and secret gloom of the largest (No.</span> IV) <span class=GramE>of</span>
these subterranean halls, “What a place,” said Bapirazu in a conspiratorial
whisper, “for a Home Rule meeting!” He and I rarely talked politics, whereas
Damerla Venkata Rao and I were always sparring. But Bapirazu never disguised
his ardent patriotism or softened the expression of it for<i> </i>my benefit.
With what regretful gusto would he recall the lost excitements and glorious
expectations aroused in his childish bosom by <span class=SpellE>Bepin</span>
Chandra Pal’s agitation, and describe the precocious activities and schemes of
himself and his schoolmates, of ten years of<i> </i>age and under, in
furtherance of the cause. I wish I could remember the details of this crusade
of the children. It would have made a delightful chapter in that book of
childish memories which he seems never to have written. He would end by
lamenting what at the time seemed the flagging of those earlier hopes and <span
class=SpellE>ardours</span> and descant upon the faith that removes mountains.
This phase of his recollections always brought to my mind (indeed he may
himself have quoted) Wordsworth’s equally nostalgic memories of the incipient
French Revolution: “Bliss was it in that day to be alive.’ But, for Bapirazu,
that day was to return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the following April we visited <span class=SpellE>Bhuvaneshwar</span> and spent
several days exploring its many beautiful old temples. This time Ram’s elder
brother and his cousin <span class=SpellE>Kavikondala</span>, the Poet, came
too; altogether quite a little galaxy of talent, One day I came upon them all
swimming together in the lovely little old stone tank of the <span
class=SpellE>Mukuteshwara</span> temple. They seemed rather abashed, as if they
were afraid that I should join them; for we had been amusing ourselves by
imagining a plot to smuggle me into the great <span class=SpellE>Rajalingam</span>
temple disguised as a <span class=SpellE>Cashmiri</span> pundit. Another day
when I was laid up with a chill (in high April!) the four of them walked
without me the six miles to <span class=SpellE>Undavilli</span> to see the
famous <span class=SpellE>Jaina</span> caves there. Another day Bapirazu, <span
class=SpellE>favoured</span> by heaven as usual, found in a field a small stone
sculpture of his <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> idol <span class=SpellE>Venugopala</span>,
clearly a last priceless fragment of a lost twelfth century temple. This we
carried away and it must be still among the treasures left by him. That same
year or the next he and I cycled up the river from <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Bezwada</span></st1:place> to <span class=SpellE>Amaravati</span>.

do not remember that Bapirazu ever played tennis or even turned out for hockey,
but he was as fond of swimming as I was, and as much at home in (and under) the
water. We used often to bathe together from <span class=SpellE>Naga-lanka</span>
in the early morning. I like to remember that I taught him the sidestroke which
was then unknown in those parts and which he mastered at once and used with
ease and power. In the dry spring season we and the <span class=SpellE>Damerlas</span>
often went for an evening sail in a hired <span class=SpellE><i>nawa</i></span><i>,
</i>and once at least when the waves rode higher than usual we all dived
overboard in a race with a fisherman who had expressed anxiety about safety of
his boatload of distinguished landlubbers. But the pleasantest to remember of
all our swims were those we had at all hours of the day from the borrowed <span

I sent him a copy of one of them only last year. It shows him trustfully
sleeping in the forest like the youthful Horace. He thanked me for this in the
last letter<i> </i>he ever wrote to me–indeed it was sent to me by his
daughter, the poetess after his death–and enclosed a lyric on it which must
have been one of the last he wrote. Of one of the other two sketches I am
sending you a copy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

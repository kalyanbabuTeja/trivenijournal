‘We, the People of India’, established a Sovereign Democratic Republic, we took
it for granted that we will have or we have had already, all the conditions
necessary for its successful working. One of those essential conditions is that
a democratic country should have a competent set of people having the capacity
and time for thinking on the various problems of democracy that arise from time
to time. If ancient Athens and old England could run their governments well, a
large part of the credit should go to the fact that their economic organisation
then facilitated a large number of people both to acquire the requisite
knowledge as well as to play their proper part in the governance of their
States. The inference is not that we should either go back to the days of
slavery or to feudalism but that we should take note of the point and make the
necessary adjustments in our modern economy, both for the education of the
people and for their leisure. It is in the light of these requirements that we
should watch keenly the socio-economic pattern that we are slowly trying to
evolve in this Welfare State of ours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are various phases of education and various needs, and it is due to a failure
to distinguish between them that sometimes a lot of confusion is created in our
minds. First, there is the question of the education of the masses, as
distinguished from that of the classes, and that in spite of the classless
society we want to create. Then there is the question of university education
along with the question of the medium of instruction. To take the man in the
street, the sovereign citizen of India, first, he requires education in two
senses–education in the ‘affairs’ of the country so that he could take an active
part in it and, above all, he should form the habit of acquiring knowledge and
thinking about it. Secondly he requires the knowledge of a profession whereby
he would be able to earn his livelihood. And both require a good amount of
literacy so that he could continue to acquire knowledge in his later days. This
presupposes another condition of democracy–the availability of cheap and sound
means of knowledge–what we may call ‘literature’ which is available easily to
the adult literate at prices at which he would be induced to acquire. Judged
from this standard, the otherwise admirable and thorough Report of the Press
Commission is very disappointing. While the Commission <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
that an independent Press where ‘opinion is free but facts are sacred’ is a <i>sine
qua non </i>of democracy, they have failed to suggest any effective means of
securing to the ordinary citizen cheap (economically) knowledge through the
daily press and other journals. If I am to recommend, I would at once suggest
the creation of a number of autonomous corporations–the prototype of voluntary
trusts which the Press Commission would like the present proprietors to create
themselves–with Government money, and start cheap language newspapers at
various places in India so that almost every village could get the newspaper
printed in the evening by the next morning. The cost to the Government will be
trifling compared with the vast sums of<i> </i>money we are spending on other
matters, but the result would be tremendous. To avoid misunderstanding, let me
be clear. I want the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> to create so many
‘Trusts’ with so much money and leave them to themselves as if they are private
trusts. I also want that these trusts should be run on business lines, and all
competition should be avoided by fixing rates as the Press Commission has
suggested. I would make the price less by Government granting a subsidy to all
the papers on the basis of their circulation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Please do not think that I am creating these ‘classes’; on the other hand, it
is the enthusiasts of Basic Education that are trying to perpetuate or to
create afresh a new ‘<span class=SpellE>sudra</span>’ caste of basic education
and a new ‘<span class=SpellE>brahmin</span>’ class of liberal education–that
is what it amounts to if basic schools are started in all rural areas,
confining the other education to the urban areas. Of course people from the
villages could still go to the towns and get liberal education, but the fact
remains that a large proportion of village children <i>cannot </i>go to the
towns and thus will be consigned to basic education whether they have aptitude
or not. This is not to condemn the ideals of basic education which are high
enough, but to <span class=SpellE>emphasise</span> the need for more careful
thinking than what we have bestowed so far. There is another aspect to it. If
we are teaching a craft, let it be taught in the modern methods of
technological knowledge; otherwise a child learning the ancient craft in the
ancient way will find, when he comes out, that his methods are useless of<i> </i>application,
and will have to learn the same craft again with the help of modern machinery.
This can be done when our schemes of<i> </i>rural electrification are complete.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the success of democracy depends upon liberal thinking, then training in
liberal ways of<i> </i>thinking–and that is what liberal education aims at–is
very essential. And we can also recount with pleasure, if not with surprise,
that all democratic countries are having this kind of liberal education. If
that is good for the U.S.A. and England, France and Australia–and we pay them
our best homage by sending our graduates and M.A.’s there for ‘higher’
education, and give them a place of <span class=SpellE>honour</span> when they
return–why should it become unsuitable for India, especially when we have
adopted in India the British ideal of democracy and its mode of government? And
this is the gist of advice to us by expert educationalists like Sir C.P., Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> and Dr. R.P. <span class=SpellE>Paranjpye</span>
through the various convocation addresses, whose season has just begun. So also
their advice regarding English as the medium of instruction should count with
the authorities–not merely with the Government but with all the future leaders
that are in making today. True it is that the Governments are leaving the
Universities to themselves today, but that is largely due to two factors–both to
the galaxy of Vice-Chancellors that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has today as well as to the
good sense of the powers that be that has the tradition of listening to the
advice of the expert. But these conditions cannot be guaranteed to last
forever; and the impression is gaining ground that ‘reform’ of university
education is essential, but it is temporarily postponed due to the wishes of
the experts now. It is now the proper time, when the old experts are still
alive and the powers that be are reasonable, that the nature and extent of
these ‘reforms’ be settled, so that such an essential and sacred thing like
education will not fall into the hands of those that cannot make a distinction
between personal fads and correct policies.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<h1>THE BANK AWARD</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One of the grounds on which we condemn the present
university education is that it prepares the man for no particular career. But
is that charge correct? Do we not want bank clerks and managers; do we not want
administrators, lawyers and teachers? But the charge is that, because of the attraction,
all want to get liberal education, thus causing unemployment. But the solution
to that problem is neither to change the university education nor to reduce its
later attractions–both will amount to committing suicide to avoid death–but to
choose and pick the students that will go for higher studies, and to make the
attractions in other walks of life equally strong. There are two such
attractions in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the ‘educated’–emoluments
and prestige. Slowly the emoluments are moving in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of the manual worker. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
for instance, a recent survey reveals that a manual worker gets about £ 10 a
week as against £ 9 obtained by a clerk. Even in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a skilled worker gets more
than a school-teacher, and a university lecturer gets less than a bank manager,
of even a third-rate office. But the prestige is there which is responsible for
the Muses not going on hunger strike. One may ask: ‘Are the bank staff to be
tallied with manual workers?’ But that is what has been done by the Bank Award,
the subsequent story of which raises a number of incidental questions. Number
one is–is banking an industry? If so, why not consider teaching also as an
industry and give the teachers the rights–very enviable rights–of the Trade
Unions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second question is–how are we to judge if wages in a particular trade are
‘reasonable’ or not? Is it in comparison </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with what they produce
or with what they get in other industries, or what they get in other countries,
or is there an all-India wage level? So far as we know, there is no uniform
wage level in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
and the other day Sir Sri Ram was calculating the percentage of wages got by
the Indian worker compared with the per capita income, and he came to the
conclusion that the Indian worker gets the highest percentage in the world!
(The figures for the U. S. A., U. K., Japan, and India being respectively 190,
145, 263 and 419). In an article on ‘The Race: Profits and Wages’ the ‘Eastern </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Economist’
has shown that in the race between profits and wages in real terms, it is the
employed and not the employer who are </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>winning”. But at the
same time, the report of the Reserve Bank on Company Finance clearly shows that
the level of profit of the capitalists is quite reasonable and sound. All this
points out that while the capitalist and the <span class=SpellE>labourer</span>
are both making ‘adequate’ earnings at a ‘racing speed’, the wage earner is
gaining more between them. But who is paying them both? Somebody is paying and
that somebody is the poor consumer! And this is accentuating because of a
peculiar attitude the Indian public takes towards what constitutes a
‘reasonable wage’ in any industry. It is not to be compared with what the
Indian in general gets, but what the best among the workers gets in any
industry, or according to the amount of profits which each industry is
making–though in this particular banking ‘industry’ it has been shown that if
the Award was implemented as it was, at an average of <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>.
50,000 cost per branch, many banks would have to close down. Similarly the
Press Commission have pleaded for higher wages for the journalists–journalists
are also ‘workers’ in the newspaper industry–and the other day Sir C. P. <span
class=SpellE>Ramaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span> said in <span
class=SpellE>Ahmedabad</span> that he would not be worried if consequently a
few newspaper concerns are closed down. The point here is not that <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> is not entitled to a higher wage or ‘reasonable’
wage; but that we should have a clear policy on what constitutes that
‘reasonable level’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For, otherwise, the definite trend
in India is that <span class=SpellE>labour</span> could demand and get more
wages as long as the concern is making profits; and this idea is paving a
peculiar sway under the patterns we are evolving for the management of
industries. The accepted theory is that it is decided by supply and demand and
marginal productivity of <span class=SpellE>labour</span>; but there came first
trade unions that obstructed the operation of the law, and next came the
intervention of the Government, and lastly the Government has itself </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>become
the capitalist, so that today Labour demands, the Government adjudicates and
gives the award; and invariably in </span><span class=SpellE><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>favour</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
of Labour. Why and how the impression has gained ground that an increase in
wages is always at the expense of profits alone, I do not know; but definitely
it is at the expense of the consumer that it is largely taking place in this
country. The example of the Railways will make it clear, especially in view of
the resolution of Parliament this session to review the working of the Railway
Convention. If the Railways will have to make reasonable profits to pay the
General Revenues etc., and if Labour has to get an adequate wage, the only way
to get it is by increasing the fares, and this is exactly what the Government
have been doing for all these years; and the consumer pays. This is the same
story with the postal services, with the textile industry, the Tramways of
Calcutta, and of every other concern; and the process seems to be endless. Thus
is created a peculiar feeling of ‘group interest’, as if each industrial
concern or industry exists only for the material interests of the <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>COMPANY MANAGEMENT</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
leads us to the general question of company management also. The old Company
Law of India has been under revision by Parliament and naturally the Managing
Agency system </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>has been under criticism, and it has received both
bouquets and brickbats. The question of State management has also come </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>under
consideration, especially since the advent of nationalization in England.
Public corporations should be allowed enough autonomy so that there would not
be the usual red-<span class=SpellE>tapism</span> characteristic of the
Government offices; yet something must be done to make the Directors of the
Corporation feel a sense of responsibility for the decisions they make, as they
do not have the usual risk. The question is, where is that limit to be drawn.
It is true that, as Prof. Robson says (in his ‘Problems of <span class=SpellE>Nationalised</span>
Industries’) “the original impetus to the movement for public corporations came
from a two-fold desire to secure freedom from parliamentary supervision over
management, on the one hand, and treasury control over personnel and finance on
the other”; but it does not mean that so many <span class=SpellE>crores</span>
of the public money should be handed over to nominated directors who have no
stake at all in the concern except their own reputation. The problem requires
some deep consideration, and one expected much from the symposium on the
subject recently held at Rangoon by the ECAFE. Their Report catalogues five
kinds of <span class=SpellE>organisations</span> in vogue; there are <span
class=SpellE>organisations</span> managed on the lines of Government departments,
others managed by special boards or committees, some managed as public
corporations, some described as ‘operating contract’ and the last described as
mixed-ownership corporations. Some of these forms of organisation can be seen
in operation in India; but the disappointing part of the Report is its
inevitable conclusion that “it cannot be said that any form of organisation is
best for administration of public enterprises in all countries and in all
circumstances”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
conclusion shows how difficult is the nature of the problem; but this problem
does not brook any more delay, especially in view of the tendency towards a
sort of group interest mentioned above, and the recent trend towards changes in
the estimates and other lines of criticism <span class=SpellE>levelled</span>
against some of the public-managed concerns in India. Though there is no cause
for any alarm, and the increase is justified by sound experts, it is worth
while noting the difference between the original estimates and the final ones

always for a particular job in the Cabinet? Is the Labour Minister always to
look after the interests of Labour from inside? The method of appointing
experts was first tried in Madras in 1937 by Rajaji when he appointed Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Rajan</span> for Public Health and Sri <span class=SpellE>Giri</span>
for Labour. Later on, the emphasis shifted to regional representation, though
it was hotly refuted by Sri Nehru and <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span> Patel at
the time of the resignation of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Matthai</span>. But we do
give some kind of regional representation as well as communal representation in
the making of all Cabinets, and it is in a way inevitable. But the question of
Labour is different. The appointment of three leaders connected with Labour as
the three successive Labour Ministers since 1947 gives rise to the question
whether Labour shou1d be represented in the Cabinet, and that too by one
connected with Labour. And if a candidate is chosen because he is a leader of
Labour, then it is only inevitable that he should feel an obligation to Labour
and try to safeguard their interests always, lest any repudiation of his
leadership by Labour should strike at the very root of his leadership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

question that arises is whether, when a minister resigns from the Cabinet, he
owes an explanation to the President who has appointed him, to the House to which
he, along with his colleagues, is responsible, and to the nation at large whose
ultimate trustee he is. Here the unwritten Constitution of England may not be
very helpful, but the practice there is usually to explain the reasons in the
Commons–of course, if the outgoing minister so desires. In India since 1947, we
have had six resignations, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

are more points for public education, and Pandit Nehru with natural and
legitimate pride exhorted the Indians the other day at the annual gathering of
the A. I. N. E. Conference to look at the all round progress of the
country–this great ‘Adventure in India’. There is really something in this
great achievement on which the Indians should be educated, but equally should
the Indian be educated, said J. R. D. <span class=SpellE>Tata</span>, on some
simple notions that the Indians should shed, a catalogue of which he has given
recently:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unemployment; that it is more important to impoverish the rich than to enrich
the poor; that a Welfare State can be built without first creating the </span><span

if we are not prepared to accept this ‘neat indictment’ of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Tata</span>, it is certainly worth our while, especially for the
educated classes of India, to ponder over them to see if there is any truth in
this. But the more important question is whether the intellectual is associated
with this ‘big adventure’ at all. “The Indian intellectual needs to throw
himself into the Indian adventure,” says the ‘Eastern Economist’, and notes
that “at the present time, he is still an onlooker.” But why this apathy? The
powers that be should investigate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

even the villager associated completely? Pandit Nehru asks us to catch the glow
that has been lit in the villages. It is true that there is a new enthusiasm in
the country, a new spirit and a new outlook, but our point is that it is not
yet up to the maximum desirable or practicable. That is largely because it has
been one of the old complaints, that the people have not been associated with
the Plan. This drawback–if there was one–will be rectified, we are told, in the
case of the Second Five Year Plan under preparation. If we want the people to
catch the new slogan ‘<span class=SpellE>Haram</span> harm <span class=SpellE>hai</span>’
(complacency or a feeling of restfulness is harmful), the people must be
educated to know not only how it is harmful, but also what exact part one has
to play in this Great Adventure. There are thousands of people in India who do
not know, though they are really very anxious; what exactly each has to do ‘to
do his bit’. The Second Five Year Plan has to give minute instructions and
plans to meet this particular demand, especially of the educated classes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
this is all true, one great cloud that obstructed our horizon is being slowly
removed–the uncertainty of our economic policies; and this feeling of stability
we get when we go through </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the resolutions passed at the <span
class=SpellE>Ajmer</span> session of the A. I. C. C. and read the firm speeches
made by the majority of the leaders. The private sector therefore can go on now
with their plans for the future, assured of this new climate of industrial and
economic policy. We are now sure of our basic objective of economic policy
which is “maximum production, full employment, and social and economic
justice”, and it is for all concerned to shape their outlook and activity accordingly.
On the question of nationalization the Prime Minister was emphatic: “When
resources were limited should they be used for putting up new industries or to
acquire old ones? If they were <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> for new
industries, the State-owned sector became bigger and bigger and more competent.
If an old industry was acquired, the State got old and outworn machinery. It
was far better to have additional production from a new State-owned factory. If
an old factory was acquired, the production remains the same.” This note is
certainly encouraging for the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

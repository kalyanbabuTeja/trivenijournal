task of writing a biography, particularly an autobiography, is a difficult and
delicate one which only the most gifted can accomplish with any measure of
success. Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span class=SpellE>Ismail</span>
may well derive an <span class=GramE>authors</span> proud satisfaction over the
success that has attended his fine effort. It is indeed a happy idea that
prompted him, in response to the wish of numerous friends, not only in India
but scattered over three continents, to record some phases of his long and
eventful career in the form of a book, which, both for its charm and contents,
must rank high in the biographical (and autobiographical) literature of India.
There is however one regret which every reader would feel, namely that it is
not longer than it is. But Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> chose otherwise,
desiring that his readers should wish for more rather than less. And thus we
have what is a model of a short autobiography which affords not only
intellectual pleasure but something also of political education. It certainly
makes no small “contribution to the history of the sub-continent in the
momentous first half of the twentieth century”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Mirza’s</span> name is associated with several administrative
achievements in the States of <span class=SpellE>Mysore</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>. It is the fortune of few men to have a career so
prolonged, so active and <span class=GramE>so</span> uniformly successful as
that given to this distinguished statesman. In the conduct of the
administration of these two States he enjoyed almost plenary power. Persian by
descent and <span class=SpellE>Mysorean</span> by birth, he had the unique
advantage of having been brought up and educated along with the Prince who was
later to be Ruler of the State and of winning alike his friendship and confidence
in an unusual degree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the active support of the Maharaja always assured, he carried out those
brilliant reforms which contributed so much to the glory and prosperity of the
State. There is perhaps no other instance of such splendid collaboration or the
good of a State in the whole of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
than that between Maharaja Sri <span class=SpellE>Krishnaraja</span> <span
class=SpellE>Wadiyar</span> and <span class=SpellE>Dewan</span> Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span class=SpellE>Ismail</span>. “Whatever success I
may have had as <span class=SpellE>Dewan</span>, I owe to the confidence,
sympathy and guidance of him whom we all revered so profoundly, and who till
the other day was striving with us in the difficult task of raising the status
of our country–I refer, of course, to His Late Highness,” wrote Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> to the present reviewer sometime after the demise of
the great Ruler, who to him was an object of sacred veneration and whose death
was the greatest sorrow he had known in life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the fifteen years of his <span class=SpellE>Dewanship</span>,
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:place></st1:City>
made phenomenal progress in all directions. Within less than five years of his
taking charge, <st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:City>
had come to be regarded as industrially the most advanced, and politically the
most progressive, State in all <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>,
and a pattern even for <st1:place w:st="on">British India</st1:place> to copy.
So prosperous indeed was <st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:City>
in 1940 that a visitor return from the State remarked to the writer that politically
he could wish for nothing more than that <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
should become an enlarged <st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:City>,
and added, “Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span class=SpellE>Ismail</span>
is an incomparable statesman who can give lessons in statecraft even to the
best brains of <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> and <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>.” It was about this time that Viscount Samuel, no
mean judge of men, hailed him as the finest statesman of the <st1:place w:st="on">British
 Empire</st1:place>. When some months later Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span>
suddenly resigned his high position, there was a chorus of tributes from every
quarter of the country. “He leaves behind,” wrote one. “<span class=GramE>not</span>
only a model of an <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> but also an example of Indian statesmanship,”
and very feelingly added, “<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span

A pressing invitation came to him from the young Maharaja of <span
class=SpellE>Jaipur</span> to accept the Prime-<span class=SpellE>Ministership</span>
of his State. At <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>, during the four years of his
stay, Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> almost did wonders. His active mind
and boundless zeal would not allow a day to be lost and he applied himself to
the task before him at once. Reconstruction, new parks, new buildings,
restorations and improvements of all kinds, besides the overhauling of the
entire administration, were carried on at an amazing speed, so much so, the
city of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span></st1:place></st1:City>
fast changed its appearance and began to pulsate with a new life. In spite of
his numerous activities, Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> found time to
inaugurate constitutional reforms and to formulate a scheme for the
establishment of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Rajputana</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
which was later to come into being. In the words of Cecil <span class=SpellE>Beaton</span>
his plans were as numerous as his inspirations. The Maharaja had Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza’s</span> great aims in mind when he gave expression to the
hope, in one of his speeches, that by whatever alchemy it may be, what were
then but arid wastes would ere long change into smiling greens of plenty. Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> was working for this end. But before all that he
wanted could happen, he received a call from the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span>,
who was then facing a crisis, to help him in his administration. It was by no
means easy to refuse the offer, for it was not for the first time that it was
made. Twice before–the first time eighteen years previously–he had a similar offer
from the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span>, but he declined it without hesitation
because his single-minded devotion to the Maharaja (Sri <span class=SpellE>Krishnaraja</span>
<span class=SpellE>Wadiyar</span>) would not permit him even to consider it.
Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> was singularly free from that ambition
which is often the spur of lesser men. At every stage he subordinated his
personal advantage to the claims of public duty. And so, while the Maharaja was
anxious that he should stay, and the public equally so, he chose to say goodbye
to <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span> with the conviction that one should say enough
to oneself before others said it. Even more important than to know when to
catch an opportunity is to know when to forego an advantage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

can be no two opinions about the appropriateness of Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza’s</span>
appointment to the Prime-<span class=SpellE>Ministership</span> of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>. He went there
with great hopes and ambitions, and in a spirit of dedication. He was anxious,
among other things, to make <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>
“a <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of Eastern culture and civilisation, of
intellectual activity and of common harmony,” and “to achieve for it that moral
and material pre-eminence which is her due.” It is indeed highly interesting to
know something of the good work done, as told by the author himself. Writes Sir
<span class=SpellE>Mirza</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“When
at the Headquarters, I set apart two mornings in the week for interviews with
all and <span class=SpellE>su<span class=GramE>:ndry</span></span>, as I had
done in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:place></st1:City>,
also in <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>. It was a very taxing duty, as can
easily be imagined–seeing dozens of people, each with his request or grievance.
But it was worthwhile. It satisfied the public as nothing else could, and I
know of no better method of checking corruption among officials. In <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Mysore</span></st1:place></st1:City>,
while I was at the head of the administration, corruption was practically
non-existent. In <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>, too, it had come under
control. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>,
people began to feel that a new freedom had dawned upon them, and officials
were much more<i> </i>courteous and considerate to the public than before. All
this was a direct result of the Head of the administration being so easily
accessible to the public. I saw from two to three hundred people on each of the
two<i> </i>mornings. A report reached the <span class=SpellE>Nizam’s</span>
ears that his Prime Minister was busy holding ‘durbars’ twice a week in his
office! I assured him that I was not seeking self-<span class=SpellE>aggrandisement</span>

the great hopes of Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> were not destined to be
fulfilled, and after the withdrawal of the British control he found it
impossible to stay any longer in Hyderabad, on account of the vigorous and
“calculated campaign of vilification” against him by the <span class=SpellE>Ittihad-ul-Mussulmeen</span>
which had the backing and financial support of even some members of the
Cabinet. On returning to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Bangalore</span></st1:place></st1:City> for the summer recess,
and acting on a certain intuition that is always his strength, he tendered his
resignation to the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span> in a letter which he
addressed him on May 15, 1947 wherein he uttered the first warning of the
deepening crisis. “The intrigues and agitations to which I refer,” wrote Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span>, “are, I firmly believe, directed as much against the
interests of Your Exalted Highness as against myself. But, while a word from
you would have stopped the campaign at once, you have maintained silence, and

must be mentioned here that Mr. Jinnah was vehemently opposed to the
appointment of Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> as Prime Minister of
Hyderabad, for the only possible reason that the latter, in spite of several
approaches, refused to join the Muslim League. Jinnah moved earth and heaven to
prevent his appointment. He first telegraphed to the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span>,
“exhorting him not to appoint Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> and
threatening him with dire consequences if he disregarded his advice.” And
later, when the appointment was about to be made, he rushed to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City> to see the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span>
himself and make a determined effort to stop him from proceeding further. The
account of<i> </i>the fateful interview that took place between the <span

autobiography and should be read in its entirety, alike for its exciting
interest and its dramatic effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

after his retirement Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span> continued his
endeavors to find a solution to the Hyderabad problem. Finding the situation
becoming worse, he wrote to the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span> urging him in
strong terms to come to a settlement with the Indian Government before it was
too late, and offered to mediate in his behalf, and even went to Delhi on that
mission. In this connection, in the words of Sri C. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>,

history.” But the <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span>, who was at the time “more or
less a prisoner in his palace and unable to act independently,” allowed the
supreme opportunity to be lost, thus making the police action a compelling
necessity to put down the growing <span class=SpellE>Razakar</span> menace. The

throughout been strongly opposed to the Muslim League and resolutely kept himself
away from it, unmindful of Jinnah’s serious displeasure, and the consequences
of that displeasure. As an example of moral courage there is not, in the

regret is keenly felt in some quarters, and widely shared by many in India,
that the services of so gifted a statesman and so great an administrator are
not harnessed to the service of the country. Some have been even puzzled at
this absurdity. The clue to this is to be found partly in Sir <span

all retired from active public life, and partly in a very revealing passage in
the book. “In an article I contributed to <i>The Times </i>in May, 1949,” says
Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span>, “I had <span class=SpellE>criticised</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sardar</span> Patel for his policy towards the States, which
I <span class=SpellE>characterised</span> as ‘ruthless’. He seems to have
resented this very much. <i>Democratic autocrats </i>are hard to please. I do
not suppose the other members of the Cabinet relished my remarks, either. I do
not remember exactly what I said in certain letters to my friends, but I must
have given expression to my views in a manner too frank to please them. I have
in my life <span class=SpellE>practised</span> very few economies of truth in
the expression of my opinion, and this habit has got me into trouble sometimes,
both with the British Government of India and the present Government in Delhi.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

himself. He neither entertains any ill-will nor withholds his admiration where

realisation of their potentialities and destiny. The value of the volume to the
lay public, especially those unacquainted with the English language and denied
regular instruction in History in the schools and colleges, is unquestionable.
Even to the educated, its value is bound to be considerable, as an authoritative
and continuous history of the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> through the

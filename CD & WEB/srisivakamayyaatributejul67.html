dawn of 11th February, 1967, did not herald light but darkness; the newspapers
carried the sad news of the sudden passing away of Sri M. Sivakamayya. The end
came at Masulipatam in the early hours on 10th. “The news was stunning in its
effect and one was dazed for the nonce. It was difficult to believe that Sri
Sivakamayya, with his simple khadi attire and serenity and determination writ
large on his face, was no more. But the news was true and had to be swallowed
somehow like a bitter pill. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a difficult and necessarily inadequate exercise to try to sum up a life’s
achievement, particularly when it is rich and multifoliate as in the case of
Sri Sivakamayya. Scholar and teacher, humanist and educationist, administrator
and philanthropist, editor and critic, and, above all, gentleman and <i>Sahridaya–</i>Sri
Sivakamayya combined diverse roles in himself. He was one<i> </i>of those rare
people who are born teachers and for whom teaching is not a mere profession but
a vocation. Teaching does not consist in instruction, nor in completing the
portion according to the prescribed syllabus; it must be a continuous process
of provoking and quenching the thirst for knowledge, and kindle the fire within.
It must be a true translation of the Vedic chant<i>–Asato ma Satgamaya tamaso
ma Jotirgamaya–</i>which would verily be the foundation for the edifice of
life’s full-blown development. A true teacher’s words are a permanent and
priceless treasure with us and one often recollects them in tranquility for
solace and strength, inspiration and guidance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

teaching exceeds the dull routine of syllabus and examination, class-room and

Truth. It is conceived of in that broad perspective and charged with that
sacredness that teaching </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>affords ineffable joy and leads to the
unfolding of the recipient’s personality. Sri Sivakamayya always had this
exalted ideal before him and strove every minute of his career to achieve it.
His numberless students who are scattered allover the State and even outside
would testify to it. They cannot still forget his brilliant and altogether
original exposition of such classics as <i>Macbeth, Othello, Hamlet </i>and <i>King
Lear</i></span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

Sivakamayya took his first M.A. in Mathematics and this gave him a mathematical
precision in outlook and style. The B. Ed. training gave him an insight into
the psychology of the student and the technique of teaching, and whether he
taught in the class or conversed in a group, spoke publicly or indicted an
article, one could discern the typical approach of a teacher with emphasis on
backgrounds and trends. Sri Sivakamayya was also a product of the Indian
cultural tradition and had a stout faith in spiritual values. His study of
writers and thinkers like Tagore and Sri Aurobindo was over and above the mere
literary angle and he was profoundly influenced by the philosophy that is the
mainspring of their writings. He averred more than once that the ills and evils
of the world today were the result of the slinking away of spiritual values.
He, however, used to strike an optimistic note and say that there would be a
renaissance of spiritual values and that the present spell of gloom was but a
passing phase. Even as in the physical world matter is indestructible, he used
to say, in the spiritual realm also, the work done by a Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
or a Vivekananda or a Sri Aurobindo or a Tagore would never be in vain and its
constructive results were bound to be felt one day. However much we try to
alter the complexion of the country by industrialisation and the like processes
of economic and social reconstruction (as we fondly hope), we cannot totally transform
the character of the country. India would cease to be India if it drifted away
from spiritual values. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ardent believer in the democratic ideal, Sri Sivakamayya used to assert that we
should not fight shy of implementing the democratic principle at all levels. As
regards the student indiscipline, his opinion was that the problem became
endemic in the country because there was a failure of mutual trust between
students and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>teachers. When the Andhra University addressed
the Principals of the affiliated colleges on this question, he was among the
few to send clear and concrete proposals, and he suggested the formation of
Councils consisting of students and teachers to deal with the difficulties of
students and see that they do not ‘escalate’ into ‘problems ‘. Education at the
college level, he used to say, should be a co-operative enterprise in which the
students and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>teachers were involved in creative partnership. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Regarding
the matter of falling (or fallen) standards also, Sri Sivakamayya’s views were
refreshingly optimistic. He was often saying that it was the policy of
unthinking expansion that was responsible for the discouraging results. The
best student today is in no way inferior to the best student of ten or twenty
years ago, if we consider any class. At no stage is personal attention
possible. The lecture system is good but it has to be supplemented by a
thorough tutorial, and this the colleges cannot afford because of<i> </i>financial
implications. Even the examination pattern places a premium on memorization and
the ‘choice’ often makes it a gamble. Add to this the frequent ‘reforms’ and
‘reorganisatiom’ in educational field. It is because of all these factors that
one finds that the ‘end-product’ today is not so encouraging and it is unjust
to find fault with the quality of present day students. If anything, they have
to be looked upon with sympathy as they are being dealt with as guinea-pigs by
their well-meaning but unwise </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Sivakamayya’ gave the best of his life to the Andhra Jateeya Kalasala, though
he had earlier worked in the Hindu College for nearly fifteen years and in the
beginning of his career as the Headmaster of a Middle School at Nellore. The
Andhra Jateeya Kalasala was the proper place for him and Sri S. T. G. Varadachary,
himself a Sanskrit scholar of unusual calibre, spotted Sri Sivakamayya with
rare vision, when he took the momentous decision to convert the national
institution into a college imparting instruction in university courses. From
that time when he joined as Vice-Principal till the day of his demise Sri
Sivakamayya’s life and his very being were inextricably woven into the fabric
of<i> </i>the Kalasala. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Sivakamayya’s joining the Kalasala was no fortuitous circumstance; it was as
though the happy coincidence was a contrivance of God. The Kalasala was the
offshoot of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>educational renaissance in the early years of
the present century and catered to the need for national education with
emphasis on fine arts and handicrafts. Such patriots and stalwarts as Sri Adivi
Bapiraju, Sri Katuri Venkateswara Rao, Sri Bezawada Gopalareddy, Sri Kolavennu
Ramakotiswara Rau and several others were actively associated with it. It was
therefore in the fitness of things that when the Kalasala returned to life,
albeit to assume a different role, Sri Sivakamayya, who was also full of
patriotic zeal and nationalist fervour, should have been the first teacher to
be invited. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sivakamayya embodied in himself the ideals and aspirations of the Kalasala. The
college was his life and its development his fulfilment. In this connection, I
cannot but recall an incident that took place in 1954. It is unforgettable. Sri
M. Anantasayanam Ayyangar, the then Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha, visited the
College one day. The visit was probably delayed for some reason and the V. I.
P. turned up at 12-30 P.M.–the time of recess for the students to go away. But
still Sri Sivakamayya wanted that the students should not miss the
distinguished guest. Something like an emergency meeting was arranged and the students
assembled near the Science Laboratory in a vast crowd. The guest and Sri
Sivakamayya were standing on the verandah. Sri Ayyangar began his brief speech
with a comment on the name of the college and quipped that there was hardly
anything national about the ‘National’ College. Probably the speaker was not in
a good mood, what with the hot sun above and the tight programme ahead. Sri
Sivakamayya, however, was not the man to allow anybody to get away with such an
impression. His face was livid and he was quivering with emotion–the whole
picture vividly gleams before my mind’s eye–, and pointing to the audience he
said, “Please see them They are standing, braving the blazing sun, to listen to
you. Is this not part of our national culture?” He then pointed to himself–he<i>
</i>was always dressed in <i>dhoti </i>and shirt and did not have the usual
habiliments of most English teachers–and put the question, “Can you say which
subject I deal with?” Without<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>waiting
for an answer he went on to say, “I am the Head of the English Department. Am I
not national?” Sri Anantasayanam Ayyangar was overwhelmed by a double sense of
wonder and regretr and felt sorry for having said something off-hand. Such was
Sri Sivakamayya’s courage of convictions and he was the most passionate defender
of the honour and prestige of the Kalasala. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was his passion for teaching; teaching gave him joy and was a means of
self-exploration and spiritual sustenance, I happened to see him in January
last, a month before the tragic event, and requested him to take long leave
till he fully recovered. I suggested that even after leave he should take no
classes if possible and only small classes if unavoidable. I mentioned that he
might engage the B. A. Special English class. Quick and spontaneous was his reply
that the special English students were not specially interested in English and
he said that he would not be satisfied as a teacher unless he taught the Part I
students. “I am sure,” he said, “there will be at least one student who will
justify my trouble.” Others told me that he had said more than once in the
classes that he preferred death to refraining from teaching in the interests of
his health. Alas! how inestimably poor is the field of education for the loss
of such a totally dedicated teacher! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Jateeya Kalasala was the life of Sri Sivakamayya, <i>Triveni </i>was his
soul. It goes to the credit of the far-sighted Sri K. Ramakotiswara Rau, the
journalist of journalists, that he hit upon the right person when he chose Sri
Sivakamayya to perform the editorial functions of the journal. It needed
considerable persuasion to get him to agree to his name being printed. He
discharged the duties as editor with quiet efficiency and maintained the high
standards for which the journal carved out a name for itself. Sri Ramakotiswara
Rau also compelled him to translate pieces from classics like <i>Mahabharata,
Soundaranandamu, </i>and these renderings, which came out in <i>Triveni, </i>were
at once admirable for their chiselled beauty and remarkable fidelity to the
original. Very few people know that he was deeply read in Telugu literatim and
that he was a keen student of the Vedas and Upanishads. His reviews in <i>Triveni
</i>were always constructive and presented, besides a lucid analysis, a
judicious assessment of various books. One can find in these reviews evidence
of his rare versatility and catholicity of taste. He also wrote essays on
Dryden, T. S. Elliot, Keats and other writers, and broadcast talks over the air
on problems of literary and educational interest. He was closely associated
with the <i>Educational India </i>and one could see in his writings here how
much of bard core of original thought he had concerning different aspects of
education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sivaramayya and later he was under the spell of that eminent and saintly
teacher, the late Sri Vemuri Ramakrishna Rao. The intellectual vigour and
many-sided brilliance of the former and the austerity and idealism of the
latter went into his make-up. Added to that was his own love of simplicity and
rigorous discipline. In one of his reviews, he says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

determined and devout action, action directed towards a sacred cause. Yoga is
that which unites. It is supposed to unite the spirit with God, while the body,
mind and spirit are themselves in unison. More than other professions, teaching
affords ample opportunity for intellectual development and offers spiritual
solace to those who seek it. So, a teacher who is good and great, selfless and
sincere, is something of a <i>yogi. </i>It seems to me that Sri Sivakamayya
practised this <i>yoga, </i>because otherwise he would not have been so happy
as a teacher. It appears some of his relatives and well-wishers used to say to
him that he did not become sufficiently big’ in life. To this his reply always
was that he was most satisfied as teacher, whether in school or college, and

talk to Sri Sivakamayya was to lose oneself in some serious topic and one could
see the elevation from which he spoke and wealth of knowledge and perceptive
insight he brought into the discussion. He appeared to be reserved and
inaccessible, but once the ‘thaw’ took place, he would open out his heart and
was affable as an angel. He was reticent in criticism and alike restrained in
approbation. He cared more for the truth of his words than the taste. It seems
he was requested once to speak at a function arranged to felicitate a certain
gentleman who was a member of Parliament but not much of a parliamentarian.
Sri. Sivakamayya rose and mentioned all the good qualities of the gentleman and
said that those qualities more than justified the felicitation, though he was
not notable as a parliamentarian. He balanced the speech in such a way that
even the gentleman concerned was satisfied. He was so intellectually honest. He
was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

he agreed to do and never accepted things for which he had no mind or time.
Once he asked me to look after the preparation of a certain person for the M.
A. Examination in English. I expressed surprise and said that he certainly was
more competent. He smilingly replied, “I have myself advised him against my
guidance. My guidance will not see him through in anything less than five
years. So, it will begin after he gets the degree.” Thus, whatever he did he
did thoroughly and honestly, and his reading of books was critical and incisive
and he took the trouble of mastering all collateral information. I know the
deep study he made when he was commissioned to write an article on Vemana for
the <i>Vedantakesari </i>and the long hours he spent when he had to prepare a
15 minute radio talk on E. M. Forster. The illuminating exposition he made of
Philip Spratt’s <i>Hindu Culture and Personality </i>when I saw him in January
is still fresh in my memory, and his long and compelling review of this book is
among the few things he did before he breathed his last. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

used to make the suggestion to him often that he should accomplish some major
work in his life as a writer either in the field of education or in literary
criticism or comparative literature. He used to laugh it away and say that
after all teaching was his main pursuit and writing but a hobby. But I am<i> </i>sure
he would have embarked upon a task of that nature had God granted him at least
a decade of retired life. He was also planning to devote himself entirely to <i>Triveni
</i>once he retired. But alas! Fate willed otherwise. He is snatched away from
us. The gap is something that cannot be filled for <i>Triveni </i>and for all
those who used to look forward to him for ideas and ideals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are days when values of materialism have corroded the field of education also
and education is a miniature of general national situation. While most teachers
are concerned with the bell and the bill, there are others who concentrate the
‘private sector’ and build up fortunes. Everywhere we find the wild dance of
mammonism. There are others who are frustrated because their worth is not
recognised and they have to suffer the ‘proud man’s contumely’. One also finds
a new tribe of academic politicians emerging; their business is to issue
notices and organise meetings, observe different ‘Days’ and pressurise various
functionaries. Owing to these and other factors, ‘teaching’ is in the danger of
becoming a casuality. It is for the teachers of today to beware of these evils
and steer clear of political and communal pulls and pressures, preserve their
sanity and honesty, and forge ahead with devotion and determination. In this
field at least people should have integrity and idealism, ability as well as
nobility. Otherwise the future is bleak. It is not copious reports and
competent commissions, eminent Vice-Chancellors and enthusiastic Ministers of
Education that can redeem the situation. The teacher is ‘the thing’. It is in
this very important context that the lives of people like Sri Sivakamayya
‘remind us and we can make our lives sublime’. It is by cherishing the ideals
for which he stood and emulating his example that we can raise the most fitting

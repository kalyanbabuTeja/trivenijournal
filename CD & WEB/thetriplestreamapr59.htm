is given only to a few choice spirits in any age to perceive the One Reality
behind all appearances. To them, all knowledge is <span class=GramE>one,</span>
and every kind of striving after good leads to but one goal. In our blindness,
however, we divide ourselves into hostile camps, and worship at different
shrines. And whosoever is not with us is perforce against us. My God is Poetry;
yours is Philosophy; and his is Science. To each one his is the one and only
true God, and the rest are false and misleading. It is therefore imagined that
the business of the faithful is to rescue mankind from <span class=SpellE>thraldom</span>
to the false gods and reclaim them to the true<i> </i>faith. This is the
beginning of fanaticism, persecution, narrowness. There are ages of Faith, and
ages of Reason in human history. And each succeeding age preens itself on its
superiority over the last. The present is definitely an age of Reason, and Science

This was not so three or four decades ago. While the usefulness of<i> </i>science
was <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>, the love of the Beautiful as
expressed through art and literature, through history and philosophy, was very
marked. Raman and <span class=SpellE>Ramanujam</span> were great heroes, but
Rabindranath and Radhakrishnan were <span class=SpellE>idolised</span>. The
reading of poetry, in English and the Indian languages, was something of a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>passion.
To be able to quote verse freely was a mark of distinction; to write it was the
peak of achievement. We hung on the words of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the poet and
the philosopher, and glimpsed a world of ineffable beauty where everything
around us was “rich and strange.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in an age which is becoming severely practical and contemptuous of dreams and visions,
science is the <span class=SpellE>saviour</span>, and the prophets who work
silently and devotedly in their laboratories must lead us to the promised land
of plenty and progress. If only we could assure to the citizens of every land
the minimum of physical comfort measured in terms of food, clothing, shelter
and cleanliness, men everywhere will settle down in peace. And what power
except the power of science can overcome the obstacles which Nature places in
our way, as if to test our endurance and develop our initiative? The recitation
of poetry or the contemplation of beauty cannot add to the production of
commodities. In the familiar phrase, they cannot make two blades of grass grow
where there was only one. All talk of leisure for the pursuit of culture is
vain while millions are without the bare needs of subsistence. The strong must
strive endlessly for better living conditions; it is only the weak, the
sentimental, <span class=GramE>the</span> idlers, who seek to escape from the
stark realities of life. It is they who speak of the things “that are more
excellent” and point to a state of perfection transcending the physical plane.
But they have had their <span class=GramE>day,</span> they did not save the
world. Instead, they misled mankind into the mire of religiosity and
superstition. They exalted poetry and philosophy, diverting men from pursuits
more closely related to human needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

let us plump for science, and tell the poets and the seekers after saintliness
to mind, not <i>their </i>business but that of the community. All education
must have a scientific bias. Keen observation and skilful execution is the
quality to be aimed at. The intellect of man is the highest expression of his
being. It is that that makes him akin to God. What is not perceived by the
human intellect is of little consequence. It either does not exist, or, if it
does, it need have no influence on the thought or actions of man. The world, as
we perceive it by our untrained intelligence, is capable of infinite
improvement through the study and application of science. Regions below the
surface of the earth can be laid bare to our view. So too all that lies in the
womb of the ocean, or in the star-spangled heavens. Time and space are
annihilated by the <span class=SpellE>marvellous</span> inventions of man, and
the methods of warfare transformed beyond anything conceived by ancient and
medieval man. <span class=SpellE>Misaplications</span> there have doubtless
been, and <span class=SpellE>misdirections</span> of human energy. Science and
the scientific method in industry have caused some amount of misery. But that
is just a passing phase. Science which has conjured these monsters can also be
trusted to allay them. Devotion to science, and the growth of the scientific
outlook in every sphere of human activity, is the only antidote to our ills.
Yes, more scientific agriculture, better planned industry, better roads and
bridges, more efficient hospitals,–all this must mean greater happiness all
round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
even science is not proving a <span class=SpellE>saviour</span>. For over a
century the standard of living has been very high in Western Europe and the
United States of America,–the regions where science has had its greatest
chance. Colonial expansion, the capture of markets for the sale of consumer’s
goods at an advantageous price and for the purchase of raw materials from
industrially under-developed countries, the rivalry between the Powers for more
spheres of influence, the perpetual fear of war and the enormous growth of
armaments,–has not science led us inevitably from one disaster to another? The
better living conditions for which science takes the credit have not brought in
their train either greater contentment or more lasting peace. We are
perpetually on the brink of a precipice. The fact is that science, in its
pursuit of objective truth, has missed the meaning of life. It has failed to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> that man has needs other than those of the body,
that in addition to the nourishment of the body, his spiritual needs must be
met.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tendency to brush aside everything that cannot be perceived or accounted for by
the intellect of man is unfortunate. Love and hate, devotion and despair, are
not to be measured or resolved through the method of science. And when we seek
to pierce the realm of religious experience, the intellect of man comes up
against an almost impassable barrier. In the words of the Upanishad, “having
failed, it returns.” The mere intellectual, devoid of sentiment or faith, is
just an abstraction. All that we mean when we divide the persons of our
acquaintance into the intellectual or the emotional <span class=GramE>types,</span>
is to indicate the main tendencies in their outlook or <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>.

are often told that man is body, mind, and spirit. In the individual, as well
as the race, we therefore look for a harmonious development of the
corresponding faculties. It is the lack of synthesis that accounts for a
lop-sided development. Individual bent and training, there must always be.
Else, there is a danger of monotony and dull uniformity. <span class=SpellE>Mechanisation</span>
and regimentation are the twin evils of our time. To escape them, we have to
concentrate on the means of achieving variety and richness. It needs all sorts
to make a world, and over-emphasis on Science or Art or Religion as <span
class=SpellE>Saviour</span> of Humanity will promote just the kind of
disharmony that leads to strife. The great educationists are those that can
discover the special uniqueness of their pupils and bestow on each the
particular type of intellectual and emotional training needed to draw out the
best in them. But this is an age of speed and hurry, and few are the teachers
who can proceed this way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

now to technology, we may concede that the bicycle is superior to the
bullock-cart, and that the motor-car and the <span class=SpellE>aeroplane</span>
are vastly superior to them both. But it does not follow that the mechanical
efficiency thus developed indicates the ethical progress of man. <span
class=GramE>Everyone</span> of these means of locomotion can be used for evil
purposes as well as Food. So too, the village scholar who reads the <i>Ramayana
</i>from an old palm-leaf manuscript is not less of a scholar than his
city-bred brother who reads the same text from a linotype edition. Speed,
efficiency, precision are eminently desirable, but they ought not to be our
sole objectives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is always a limit to the satisfaction of human desires, in the purely physical
sphere. To put it slightly differently, there is a point at which physical
pleasures begin to pall. If man’s satisfactions can be compared to a beautifu1
building, the satisfactions that are just physical correspond to the
foundations which must be well and truly laid, while the intellectual,
emotional and spiritual satisfactions are like the superstructure with its
artistic refinements. There are vague, imaginings, indefinable longings,
spiritual urges, which seek satisfaction through means which are not entirely
physical,–which rather are intimations of our Immortality. The leaders of
mankind in all ages have sensed this need. The world of wonder and imagination
revealed through the great epic of all <span class=GramE>lands,</span> is the
world of ideas of which the common work-a-day world is but a pale reflection.
All <span class=SpellE>endeavours</span> to black out that world of ideas in
the name of a mistaken realism, can only lead to the impoverishment of human
nature. Even the folk-lore of the countryside, conveyed through fable and song,
is part of man’s rich heritage. To allow young people to grow in an atmosphere
of <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>, to tell them that arithmetic is real
while song and verse are mere vanities, is the height of folly. It is a crime
against coming generations. Let us not breed an unreasoning fear of sentiment
by equating even the most uplifting of sentiments with weak sentimentality.
This danger is as real today as the danger of war. It arises out of a
superstitious veneration of science, a veneration <span class=SpellE>equalled</span>
only by the veneration of Moloch or Belial. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

for they are unceasingly in search of sensitive souls capable of responding to

me, in particular, he was an elder brother for over half-a-century, watching
over me and blessing my <span class=SpellE>endeavours</span>. I first heard
him, speak in English at the National theatre, <span class=SpellE>Buttiahpet</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>. That theatre was an occasional
alternative to the open square in <span class=SpellE>Robertsonpet</span> during
the hectic days following the anti-partition agitation in <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>.
That was also a period of genuine constructive effort in <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>,
culminating in the foundation of the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span>
Kalasala. That evening the Doctor’s theme was “The Web of Indian National
Life.” As he developed his argument and spread before the mind’s eye the vast
panorama of Indian history and culture, I marveled at the beauty of the theme
and the <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> and spontaneity of his eloquence.
Admiration soon led to personal loyalty–and even affection for one who was
nearly fifteen years my senior. I was then studying with avidity the history of
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> in the local <st1:place

class=SpellE>Pattabhi</span> the publicist, Krishna Rao the savant, and <span
class=SpellE>Venkata</span> Sastri the poet, was very much like the Athens of <span
class=SpellE>Periclean</span> times. I was one of a group of students eager to
arrange lectures on subjects of academic interest. We approached Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Pattabhi</span>. Characteristically, he wanted <i>us </i>to
suggest a theme. When I mentioned “<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Federal Union”, he agreed
with pleasure. But that lecture never came off, for the Ulsterite-Irish
Principal forbade it: he suspected we were fast developing into seditionists! I
took this disappointment with a sore heart. But the Doctor and I came closer
and he reciprocated my affection. Time has its revenges. The Doctor became a
leading light of Free India’s Constituent Assembly which drafted a federal
Constitution for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Secretary of the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span> Kalasala, the Doctor
became my chief. I had known the Kalasala since its inception in 1910; its
cultural atmosphere and its wide lawns carpeted emerald green always held me in
thrall. It was, however, the desire to associate with the Doctor and to get
trained by him in unselfish public work that drew me to the institution in
1923–after the demise of <span class=SpellE>Kopalle</span> <span class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span>
Rao, the Founder–while yet I was serving in Sri Prakasam’s <i>Swarajya </i>along
with <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span> K. M. <span class=SpellE>Panikkar</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Khasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rau and G. V. <span

study and teaching, and enlivened by the companionship of the poets and artist
of Andhra, I led a happy, sheltered life.</span> But as the Non-co-operation
movement waned, and funds ceased to flow in, a proposal was mooted that the
Kalasala might apply to the Provincial Government for a grant-in-aid. I made no
distinction between service in an ‘aided’ institution and practice in a
British-controlled court of law. The Doctor and his friends withdrew from the
management, and, with a heavy heart, I left the Kalasala. That was the moment
when, if I chose, I could have gone back to the paternal home and the paternal
profession of law. But some power beyond me impelled me to launch the <i>Triveni
</i>and to keep her afloat through frequent storms and a few brief bursts of
sunshine. Like a wise and tender-hearted elder, the Doctor sought continually
to make life a little easier for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the useful in life, mine on the beautiful. I liked quiet and leisure; he was

any accounting, except of public funds, was an insufferable nuisance. We were

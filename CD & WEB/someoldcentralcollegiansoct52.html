<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am deeply grateful for the great honour done me
which I have accepted with some diffidence. I know that a speech is expected of
me. It is true that I have made a few speeches in my life, but that was not
very recently, and I have had time to get over the worry they were to me. I
trust my hearers have forgotten or forgiven the weariness they must have been
to them. The fact that I presided at the College Day in 1933 has probably
passed into merciful oblivion, or perhaps I have been forgiven the rather long
address I delivered on that occasion. When my friend, Rajadharmaprasakta Sri
Singaravelu Mudaliar, conveyed to me the desire of the Committee that I should
preside on this occasion, I felt it my duty to agree, especially as it was
proposed to unveil the portraits of two old boys whom we all love and honour. I
had the privilege of working for some years under the guidance and inspiration
of Sir M. Visvesvaraya on a scheme he held dear; and, Sri Rajagopalachari has
been my friend of a life-time. Both of them belong to India and History, but
this College sent them forth on their mission in life, and so we have a special
fee-right in them for pride and love. I felt that If an opportunity was offered
me to join in this tribute of honour to them, and if by doing this I could also
serve my Alma Mater and brothers and sisters of her family, I should not let
diffidence prevent me from accepting it. I have been somewhat of a recluse, and
this opportunity of renewing old friendships and in some degree recapturing the
freshness and ecstasy of long ago was also an irresistible attraction. It was a
happy thought to call this a Re-Union. It is to me something more than a
gathering of the old boys who are actually present here. I feel that the absent
are also with us in spirit. We are a great family re-united here, the past and
present together. To this hall is full of invisible presences–both of those who
are parted from us by distances, and of those who are no longer with us in the
flesh. To the latter we have to offer the homage due from the present to the
past, from us to the mighty men who have gone before. They were, one and all,
dear and true sons and servants of the Alma Mater, and helped to build up the
noble tradition that is hers Waters, Rice, Cook and Tait, Leonard, Venkataswami
Naidu, Narayanaiangar, Venkatanaranappa, Venkatesh Iyengar, R. Raghunatha Rao,
and Krishnaswami Iyengar, Sir P. N. Krishnamurthy, P. Raghavendra Rao, Sir T.
Thumboo Chetty, Jayaram, N. S. Subba Rao, B. M. Srikantia,–these are some of
the names among many that immediately occur to me. I hope it is something more
than the fondness of fancy which makes us feel that they are with us in spirit
and rejoice in this Re-Union.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Of all the dear and honoured names I have mentioned,
I would, this evening, select for a few words one which is to me personally
sacred–that of my revered Master, Tait. I owe to him–next to God and to my
beloved parents–all that has made my life worth living; but that is the only,
nor even the main, reason why I would speak of him this evening. He has a great
claim on the gratitude of this college and this country. He spent thirty years
of the best part of his life here, and gave without stint himself and his
unsurpassed talents to the service of this College; and he left it as high in
prestige as the proudest in India–great in learning and culture, great in sport
and sportsmanship. He implanted in us not only a love of learning but also a
code of honour and duty. Boys who sat at his feet, and were taught and inspired
by him, have gone forth to all parts of India covering themselves and their
College with glory. I shall only mention a few names of those who are not here,
and spare the modest blushes of those who are–Sri Rajagopalachari, Sir Samuel
Ranganathan, V. Narahari Rao, Sir Mirza Ismail, H. V. R. Iyengar and Sir T.
Thumboo Chetty; and in the illustrious assembly here there are many who are
proud to acknowledge the influence of Mr. Tait in shaping their lives and
career. Mr. Tait was proud of his boys and proudly conscious of work well done.
When at the end of his service he was asked what he would do if he were given a
couple of years extension, he answered with a smile, “Of course, I hope to
continue the work I have been doing these thirty years.” To me no college
celebration is complete without a tribute of gratitude to him. There were
people who thought him hard and cynical, but that was only the conventional
crust of the Britisher which hides warmth of heart. He also made no concealment
of his faith in the inherent superiority of the White Man, but that was the
fault of the conservative creed of his day, and with him it admitted of large
and generous exceptions in favour of his students, and of Indians he really
knew. I have lived longer than the ordinary span of human life, and met and
known some great and famous men. But, I don’t think I have met or known one
with a nobler, manlier heart or a more virile understanding. The last time I
met him was when I was in Britain in 1930 for the Round Table Conference. Once,
I went to Edinburgh to see him, and again a few weeks later, he came to London
to see Sir Mirza Ismail and myself.</p>

the former occasion, he came to the Railway Station to receive me, and before I
could prevent him he seized my suit-case and hoisted it on his shoulders, and
it was with difficulty that he could be persuaded to surrender it to a porter.
Next morning we went out on a long excursion–partly by bus and partly on foot
in a drizzling rain, which he persisted in calling a mist. He showed me the
Firth of Forth and several places rendered memorable by R. L. Stevenson, but
now in my mind chiefly associated with that morning spent with my Master. He
showed me the sights of Edinburgh–the place where Sir Walter Scott lived,
Holyrood Castle, War Memorial, etc., but what I most cherish in remembrance is
the happy family which made me welcome in 38, George Square. These memories are
dear to me, but to dwell on them might be tedious to you. I cannot, however,
refrain from telling you one characteristic incident which touched me like a
parental caress. On the day I left for London, early as the train started, he
was on the platform and thrust into my hands a packet of sweets–Edinburgh Rock
was their formidable name–saying with a chuckle, “I recommend them to you. I
used to be fond of them when I was a kid like you (I was a kid of 52, if you
please!). They will last you some part of the way, for you have to suck them,
and cannot bite them!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the two old boys whose portraits are to be unveiled today, C. R., as this part
of the country affectionately knows him, was very dear to Mr. Tait. C. R. told
the old boys in his presidential address in 1937 that Mr. Tait was very angry
with him for joining what he considered a rebellious movement; and, no doubt,
so he was. But I know that Mr. Tait was very proud of C. R. and in talk with me
usually referred to him humorously as “the eminent Premier” or “our
distinguished Statesman-friend” or “the mighty Congress Leader.” C. R., on his
part, loved and revered Mr. Tait quite as much, I think, as I do, and for the
same reason. On the day we heard of our Mr. Tait’s death, he wrote to me that
the loss had created a void in his heart and that he felt a dumb aching pain,
as of a child which has lost a parent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
memories of the Central College go back to 1890, when I got admitted into what
was then called the Matriculation Class. To a village-bred boy of thirteen, the
building which then consisted only of the hall under the Clock-Tower and two
wings, seemed a most awe-inspiring edifice. My first Class-Teacher was a
lovable gentleman named Sreenivasa Rao, who was known among us–irreverent
juniors–as the ‘singing bird’, owing to the cooing manner in which he intoned
the words “don’t you see?”, with which his lectures were generously punctuated.
I was next transferred to another section of the same class, where my teacher
was one Mr. Mrityunjaya Iyer, who was considered a martinet and a holy terror,
but whom about twenty years later I found to be a mild and rather temperamental
gentleman. I, unfortunately, came under his displeasure, and he asked me to
“stand up on the bench.” I was familiar with the exercise, having had occasion
to do it many times before for just cause. But this time the order seemed to me
unjust and tyrannical, and I roundly refused to obey. Threatened with bodily
violence, I resisted, and was promptly expelled. As a matter of fact, I passed
my Matriculation Examination from the London Mission High School where the
Reverend J. H. Walton, who was greatly tickled by the story of my expulsion
from the College, readily admitted me. It was lucky for me that the above
little <i>contre-temps </i>was not remembered against me when I sought
admission to the F. A. Class in the Central College.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ambition as a freshman at College was not distinction in studies. I would have
given all the marks I ever got in examinations for a few more runs at cricket.
I was a fanatical devotee of the game and my hero was Jayaram. To me he was a
God-like person of “atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest
monarchies”–the Achilles of the cricket field, before whose single prowess with
bat and ball the hopes of opposing teams crumbled into dust. Time somewhat
dimmed the halo of boyish worship, but my firm conviction is that, take him all
in all, he was one of the finest sportsmen India has produced. At cricket or at
tennis or at golf he was in a class by himself, unorthodox in style, formidable
in effect. Mr. Tait, who had seen the best cricketers in England in action and
was no mean performer at the game himself has told me that Jayaram had an eye
as quick and a wrist as supple as those of the immortal W. G. himself, and that
if he had the same opportunities he would have been as great a cricketer. Mr.
Tait was very proud and fond of Jayaram, and the two </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>together–the
one furnishing the spirit and the other the technique–built up a Central
College Team which achieved an Old Guard sort of prestige. Of the great
victories, the Marengo, the Auster</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>litz and the Jena of
this team, I was no more than a thrilled camp-follower. I was often given a
part in minor actions, but won no great distinction. But from the first, I was
a very enthusiastic trier, and seldom missed practice on the cricket field. As
a youngster my grave self-dedication to the game was what brought me to Mr.
Tait’s notice, by amusing him greatly. On the rare occasions on which I hit a
ball hard, he used to clap his hands with humorous enthusiasm and shout “Hip,
Hip, Hurray! Three cheers for Navaratnam!” He knew and liked me as a cricket
enthusiast before I did anything worth his notice at my studies, and, though I
haven’t done so badly at the latter, I get greater joy out of the memory of my
undistinguished cricket deeds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

obeying the will of us all, and giving expression to our unanimous sentiments
of love and esteem for Sir M. Visvesvaraya and Sri C. Rajagopalachari. It is
usual on such occasions to say a few words relating to the gentlemen we honour.
Fortunately for me, their lives have been lived on such a high and well-lit
stage that their notable achievements are history and common knowledge and need
no recounting. Yet, chosen as your priest for this function, I owe it to you to
give my own impressions of the great men–what a mathematician would perhaps

the end of the 19th century, invaded the Bombay Presidency, and captured year
after year the post of Assistant Engineer guaranteed to the candidate who

was in Poona for a year with my uncle who was taking the Engineering Course in
the College of Science (Sir M. V.’s College) and I remember that Visvesvaraya

story of Sir Visvesvaraya’s Working Life has been told with great simplicity
and directness by himself. Suffice it to say that after joining service as an
Assistant Engineer in 1884 he served with distinction notably in Bombay, but in
other parts of India and in Aden–in fact, wherever difficult problems
challenged professional talent. He was, I believe, invariably successful and
won for himself a place in the hearts of the people he served. He travelled
widely in all parts of the world, with an unerring eye for facts and methods
which would be useful in constructive work in his own country. Rich in ideas
and experience, and fired by a zeal for service, he came back to his own Mysore
as Chief Engineer in 1909, and he became Dewan in 1912 in succession to
Pradhana Siromani T. Ananda Rao. He was Dewan till 1918 when he laid down his
office as he found himself in disagreement with the policy recommended by the
Miller Committee. During his Dewanship, he had done enough to put Mysore on the
industrial map of India and to make his own name a household word in every
Mysore home. Many years later, he was persuaded to assume control of the Mysore
Iron Works at Bhadravati, his own conception, which was in a bad way,
practically at its last gasp, and he saved it from dissolution. He has taken a
distinguished part in the public life of India, especially in constructive and
economic activities and planning, and is one of the best known and loved of
Indians. On his 90th birthday the whole country joined in doing him honour; and
Mysore, the land of his birth, naturally led in these demonstrations of
affection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Visvesvaraya’s achievements as an administrator would make a long list. So, I
shall mention just a few of them: Mysore Iron &amp; Steel Works,
Krishnarajasagar and its system of channels and power generation, the Mysore
University, and the Mysore Bank. Much of what has been done subsequently owes
its inspiration directly or indirectly to his influence. Great as his record of
actual achievement has been, he has even a prouder title to our esteem and
gratitude. Demosthenes has said that the real work of a statesman is not cities
of brick or ships of timber, but in the hearts and souls of men; and judged by
this standard, Sir M stands high indeed. He taught us self-respect and
self-reliance, and helped to destroy the inferiority complex which years of </span><span

of such selflessness. If I dared to call him a philosopher he would no doubt
indignantly deny the charge, but that is what he is a Karma Yogi of whom our
scriptures say: “the doing of duty alone is his, not the fruits thereof.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I try to tell you something about Sri C. Rajagopalachari, I feel strangely
troubled. I have known him intimately these sixty years and more; yet every
time I see him, I see in him traits I had not noticed before. I have felt the
same in re-reading my favourite plays in Shakespeare, and I attribute it to a
maturing of my own perception by experience. It may be so in the other case
also, but it is more probably due to the gradual unfolding of C.
Rajagopalachari’s natural gifts under the stimulus of opportunity and a demand
for their exercise. We were at College together and shared for years a room 6
feet square in the premises, luxuriously furnished with two school benches.
Together we lived in Bangalore and Madras, reading the same books, thinking the
same thoughts, dreaming the same dreams, eating the same wretched food in the
hotels of those days, living in the same dingy rooms, and as far as possible
spending our holidays with one another. We had mapped our future to practise at
the same Bar, and accordingly after taking my Law Degree I went to Salem where
he was waiting for me. After about a couple of years there, our ways parted. I
gravitated to Mysore and the Civil Service, and he went on, with singleness of
aim, following faithfully the light that led him, undeflected by doubts,
unshaken by trials, and untempted by ambition, till fame came to him unsought and
he found himself one of the heroes of the nation and the makers of its history.
He accepted glory without exultation as he had gone to jail without plaint or
repining. Elevated to a position never held by an Indian; before, and in the
midst of the almost barbaric gorgeousness of a Government House, which had been
designed to gratify the vainglory of foreign satraps, he remained unaffected
and unchanged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he had laid down the office of Governor-Genera1 and was looking forward to a
peaceful life among his children and books, he was called for service as
Cabinet Minister. There were people who thought he was compromising his dignity

store by personal dignity or its trappings. That the country call him was all
that mattered; and he went!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Plan and even promoting his own partition formula. He retired, of course, into
the wilderness….C. R. as Governor of Bengal consolidated the communal goodwill
which Gandhi engendered. The minorities have looked on him for fairness and
friendship, and he has not failed them….The communal quiet in this seething,
over-populated, hunger-ridden and revolutionary City is in no small measure a

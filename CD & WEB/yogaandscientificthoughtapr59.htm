earliest form of <i>yoga </i>appears to have been the simple form of <span
class=SpellE><i>Pranayama</i></span><i> </i>ordained for every twice-born to be
<span class=SpellE>practised</span> in the course of <span class=SpellE><i>Sandhya</i></span><i>
</i>prayers <i>(<span class=SpellE>Sandyavandana</span>), </i>as detailed in <span
class=SpellE><i>Vayumahapurana</i></span><i>. </i>This simple form had been
given the name of <span class=SpellE><i>Pasupata</i></span><i> yoga, </i>a <span
class=SpellE>cultus</span> cultivated to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pasupati</span>, a manifestation of Lord Siva.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The prevalence of the practice of this <i>yoga
</i>cult can be traced as far back as the third millennium B. C. The strenuous
spade of the archaeologist, while unearthing the full-fledged civilisation,
pre-Aryan and far anterior to that of the Vedic period, on the banks of the
Indus, in the <span class=SpellE>chalcolithic</span> period of India’s history,
craned out some finds with the emblems of the <i>Yoni </i>and the <span
class=SpellE><i>Linga</i></span><i>, </i>the characteristics of <span
class=SpellE>Saivism</span> representing Siva and <span class=SpellE>Devi</span>,
symbols of the “Creative Principles of Life.” These discoveries, without much
risk of interpretation, corroborate the existence of a historical period during
which this <i>yoga </i>cult was current, hand in hand with <span class=SpellE>Saivism</span>.
In later literature Siva goes by the name of <span class=SpellE>Yogeswara</span>,
and is considered to be the originator of <i>yoga. </i>Hindu scriptures mention
that <i>yoga </i>was first taught by <span class=SpellE>Parama</span> Siva to <span
class=SpellE>Parvati</span>, his consort, to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
Brahman, the All Supreme. Though the cult <span class=GramE>was</span> in vogue
since long, the word </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>yoga </span></i><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>occurs first in
the <i>Rig Veda, </i>the first and foremost work in Sanskrit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
word <i>yoga, </i>is derived from a Sanskrit root equivalent to the English
word, ‘yoke’ derived from the same Sanskrit root, meaning ‘to join’ <span
class=GramE>This</span> word gained a very prominent place in the realms of the
literature of the various systems of Indian Philosophy. None of these has
refrained from seeking help from this pregnant word <i>yoga, </i>which
ultimately means the act of diverting the senses from this gross world, curbing
the dross of the Mind, to <span class=SpellE>harmonise</span> the individual
self with the Divine Self, that is, becoming one with the Divine Self by the <span
class=SpellE>subdual</span> of all outward-going energies, and by gaining
balance and by maintaining equilibrium between all the constituent forces in a
man, till they vibrate in perfect attunement with the One, the Supreme Self. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the purpose of <i>yoga. </i>The word <i>yoga </i>crept into literature and
gained currency, having ultimate meaning as the conception of a personal God
who is indissolubly linked with the subtlest form of matter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>is primarily suggested in four forms, namely, <i>Karma Yoga,
<span class=SpellE>Jnana</span> Yoga, Bhakti Yoga </i>and <i>Raja Yoga. </i>But
as human intelligence developed, and as spiritual revelations dawned on the
horizons of the human mind, the term <i>yoga </i>was further extended, to <span
class=SpellE><i>Sankhya</i></span><i> Yoga, <span class=SpellE>Buddhi</span>
Yoga, <span class=SpellE>Dhyana</span> Yoga </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Sanyasa</i></span><i>
Yoga. </i>But all these were only varieties of the same <i>yoga </i>that
manifested itself at different stages in the practice of an aspirant, and came
into vogue as per the <i>modus operandi </i>of the exponents. Different ways
were indicated to cater to the needs of varied tastes and temperaments. These
different methods, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

of this small self in order to become one with the Supreme Self, had the
fundamental unity that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>underlies the spiritual experiences of
these exponents. All these forms of <i>yoga </i>were but the facets of one
spiritual life, dealt in isolation only for purposes of metaphysical
speculations and theoretical discussions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
all the <span class=SpellE><i>Yogas</i></span><i>, Karma Yoga </i>comes first
because <i>Karma </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Janma</i></span><i> </i>(action
and birth) are concomitant. The word <i>Karma </i>has a very wide as well as a
very narrow meaning. But it must be always understood in a comprehensive sense.
It includes all conscious and voluntary acts of man which have any moral value,
because morals are higher than rituals and at the same time the Karma does not
ignore the value of rites and ceremonies, and it can also be humanitarian work
or social service. It is the discipline of the will. This <i>Yoga </i>teaches<i>
</i>the aspirant to give up both the fruits of action and the agency of action
as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
seeds of <i>Bhakti Yoga </i>are sown in the final stage of <i>Karma Yoga. </i>One
learns to give up the fruits of action and the agency of action while actually
taking part in it. It is only by means of self-absorption or self-forgetting
love, one will be able to achieve it. Thus <i>Karma, </i>slowly but definitely,
automatically but unconsciously, leads one into the regions of <i>Bhakti, </i>and
between <i>Karma </i>and <i>Bhakti </i>there is no deep line of demarcation.
Here one dies unto one’s self and lives unto God, and makes himself or herself
a perfect instrument of God, eliminating every trace of self or ego. Pure <i>Bhakti
</i>or self-forgetful love of God lifts the soul to a spiritual plane where a
higher law of Love, the law of God, prevails. This <i>Bhakti </i>is of nine
types, known as <span class=SpellE><i>Nava</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Vidha</span>
Bhakti, </i>entailing the excessive emotionalism of the five different schools,
that is, <span class=SpellE><i>Pancha</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Bhava</span>.
</i>The warm emotion of <i>Bhakti </i>should be held in its place by more
enthusiasm on one hand and spiritual vision on the other. It is the discipline
of emotions. <i>Bhakti Yoga </i>leads to <span class=SpellE><i>Dhyana</i></span><i>
yoga. <span class=SpellE>Dhyana</span> yoga </i>is nothing but an intensive
phase of <i>Bhakti yoga </i>in which state the soul raises itself to the
heights of the eternal bliss, living through rolling moments of rapt prayer
standing speechless but serene. By this means the <span class=GramE>holy
communion</span> is achieved and this union with a spirit higher than the human
self, with God, is known as <span class=SpellE><i>Jnana</i></span><i> </i>or
self-realisation. The word <span class=SpellE><i>Jnana</i></span><i> </i>comprises
much more meaning than what it corresponds to in the English word “knowledge”. <span
class=SpellE><i>Jnana</i></span><i> </i>is both knowing and</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>being
the known. It is even more. It is the secret of <span class=SpellE>Thriputi</span>,
that is, the secret of the unity of the Trinity: the knowing, the knower and
the known. “Thou alone <span class=SpellE>knowest</span> Thyself <span
class=GramE>Through</span> Thyself, O Supreme Person!” <span class=GramE>(X-15,
Gita.)</span> This is the final stage of spiritual life. The spiritual life
begins with the awakening and proceeds along <i>Karma yoga </i>and <i>Bhakti
yoga </i>to <span class=SpellE><i>Dhyana</i></span><i> yoga, </i>and culminates
in <span class=SpellE><i>Jnana</i></span><i> yoga. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

sustained and continued practice of the above three <span class=SpellE><i>yogas</i></span><i>
</i>leads to a stage where everything is done in accordance with certain laws
and rules in a very well-regulated manner: even the minutest act, even the
least conscious act of breathing. This discipline mode of living, embracing the
above mentioned three <span class=SpellE><i>Yogas</i></span><i>, </i>is <i>Raja
Yoga. </i>It </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>starts with the control of Prana by which all
forms of energy are being manufactured. “What is it, knowing which everything
is known?” is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the inquiring objective of <i>Raja Yoga. </i>It
further teaches, in simple and unambiguous terms, the value, the worth, the
merit and the power of that particular part of human energy which expresses
itself in sexual thought, and in the act of procreation, which, when checked,
controlled and conserved, changes into a potent power ‘<span class=SpellE>Ojas</span>’
which, in its turn, changes into ‘<span class=SpellE>Tejas</span>’. Indian
sages, of times beyond the reach of history, knew that sexual vitality and
sexual energy were potential ‘<span class=SpellE>Tejas</span>’, but modern
science and modern thought see in sex only a biochemical product of the human
mechanism, moving towards procreation and the gratification of the senses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the study of a thing from its very origins–of how it generates, develops and
reacts to the rest of creation in mutual relationship. It is a critical
attitude. It is an attitude, no doubt resting content with tentative
conclusions, which tries to put each observed fact in a universal scheme of
creation. Revolution of thought in this direction commenced since the days of
Aristotle. He was the most profound of all the Greek thinkers. He insisted that
no natural phenomenon could be explained scientifically until the purpose it
served was really understood and fully taken into account. After 2000 years his
thought survives, and we are where he was. Search for final causes was not
thereafter logically insisted on till the Renaissance in Europe, till Europe’s
Middle Ages came to an end. Even then there were pitfalls in scientific
thought. There were lapses into mid-thinking and into premature explanations of

thought may be said to have begun with the rejection of this Aristotelian
doctrine. Modern natural science came into being as the result of a growing
determination to banish purposive explanation from scientific procedure. It may
be said without much risk that Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes of the 16th and
17th centuries were the first to anvil and hammer out the problems of
scientific method. Both of them at a particular stage agreed and accepted that
nature did serve an ultimate purpose. Their protest was that the strategy of
this purpose was not known, and was not open to empirical observation. That
strategy was a mystery. Thus, Bacon in one of his famous essays confessed: “I
had rather believe all the fables of the Legend and the Talmud and the <span
class=SpellE>Alcoran</span> than that this universal frame is without a
mind...For while the mind of man <span class=SpellE>looketh</span> upon
secondary causes it may some times rest in them and go on further, but when it <span
class=SpellE>beholdeth</span> the chain of them, confederate and linked
together, it must need fly to Providence and Deity.” This was to say that the
Aristotelian tradition was after all justified in the main concern which
animated it. The desire of science to interpolate a multiplicity of final
causes as for each link of the chain of scientific explanation, before reaching
the end of the chain, was wrong. Even more wrong was the attempt of science to
read into each link or each detail of nature nature’s final cause itself
instead of a limited cause that serves, and links itself to, the final cause,
without itself being the final cause. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are two aspects of modern science which set it in contrast with ancient belief,

of its placing man in control over processes of nature. In this connection the
declaration of Descartes in his “Discourse on Method” deserves attention.
Bacon’s conclusion of his “<span class=SpellE>Novum</span> <span class=SpellE>Organum</span>”
with the statement of his belief that the development of the new science would
lead to a progressive improvement of man’s estate may also be recapitulated.
The dreams dreamt in the early seventeenth century were not fulfilled till the
middle of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the 19th century. Science,
after a strenuous struggle for about a period of three centuries, arrived at
the following results: (1) The ultimate basis of the whole universe consists of
indivisible material particles called atoms. They are 92 in number. But the
number used in the actual creation of the world is only 14, the others
occurring very rarely. (2) Matter and energy are two distinct entities. Mass is
the peculiar property of matter, and energy is without that property. (3) It is
the inter-action between these two that creates the world, and the law which
operates in this process is the law of casualness or the principle of
determinism. These findings pale down when viewed in the light of the
assimilated <span class=SpellE><i>Sankhya</i></span><i> yoga. </i>These results
were obtained by modern science at a huge cost, in laboratories constructed on
a colossal scale. But the <span class=SpellE><i>Sankhya</i></span><i> </i>science
was expounded by the great <span class=SpellE>Kapila</span> <span class=SpellE>Maharishi</span>,
he having attended to the problem only in the laboratory of his own mind
unaided, aided only by his own intuition, and worked out on the tables of his
intelligence, ages ago. Modern science, in one sense, is only an attempt to
understand ancient science, the science of all the sciences put together. It is
an apology for the science, of the great <i>yoga. </i>The<i> <span

empirical formulae of the atomic theory, of the physical existence of the
molecule, and the theory of the chemical combination of the atoms, and even
went farther, and established the fact that the evolution of the whole of

the progressive search of Science there was a period of classical science. To
this belonged Bacon and Descartes and many before them. With the dawn of the
twentieth century, modern science attained the age of adolescence. Within a
span of about 30 years it gained a robust body. It then shattered to pieces all
the fundamental concepts of classical science. Atoms were split into electrons
and protons, the particles charged with positive and negative electricity. They
were constituents of all atoms. The quantum theory of Max Planck and the wave
mechanics of <span class=SpellE>Schroedinger</span> advanced further, dropping
the idea of the charge. The electrons are now regarded merely as systems of
waves. Einstein, with his theory of relativity, advanced still further and
established that mass and energy were convertible. The ultimate substance of
which the whole universe is composed is to be sought in the fact that “bottled”
waves form matter and “<span class=SpellE>unbottled</span>” waves form energy.
That energy is the basis of the universe is an accepted fact of modern science.
There is a famous verse in the second portion of <span class=SpellE><i>Kurma</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Purana</span> </i>which was written evidently during the <span
class=SpellE><i>Purana</i></span><i> Yuga. </i>No better statement of
scientific deduction was ever made to the effect that energy forms the basis of
the Universe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

latterly saw that electrons and protons are not the final forms of cosmic
energy. There are other and finer forms of energy, exhibiting a higher degree
of consciousness in the world, beyond physics, leading in a direction where
almost the very primordial, cosmic energy, which is the only reality, and which
is pure consciousness, is reached. This same truth is embodied in other words
as having been said to <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span> by Krishna (Verses 4,
5, IX Chapter, <span class=SpellE>Bhagavad</span> Gita). Modern science is at
last understanding that the material cause of the universe is energy which has
two attributes: <i>Sat </i>reality, and <i>Chit, </i>consciousness. Science has
touched a stage when the substance on which modern science has to work has
become too thin and <span class=SpellE>vapoury</span> for its physical
instruments, has become too subtle for its gloss physical approach, reaches
beyond the physical plane, and challenges the mind as mind, the soul as soul.
Modern science is incapable of proceeding further. It is the spiritually
intuitive plane that really draws the new scientist today–even when he is
experimenting with the moon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of India. They maintained that the universe was only the manifestation of
cosmic energy, and that cosmic energy had three attributes. <i>Sat </i>(or
reality), <i>Chit </i>(or consciousness), and <i>Anand </i>(or Bliss). Modern
science with all the elaborate equipment, complicated machinery and colossal

gone out and investigated the universal in every direction, except one, and
that is the scientist himself. Science does not possess in itself the necessary

incapable of doing this. <i>Yoga </i>and <i>yoga </i>alone is capable of doing
this. Science, in the sense of modern science, dissolves itself in the other
science, <i>yoga, </i>the parent of all sciences, the moment modern science
begins to think of mind and spirit. The science of <i>yoga </i>made a thorough

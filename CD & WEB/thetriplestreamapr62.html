<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
pioneers of Indian journalism copied the example of their great contemporaries
in England. Indeed, there could be no worthier models to follow. For centuries
the leading organs of public opinion in England battled for the right. They
functioned as the tribunes of the people, and preserved their hard won
liberties. The work of the press was thus complementary to that of the
political leaders who stood up for liberty of thought and expression. We have a
similar story in India. Our fight for freedom was waged on many fronts; but the
platform and the press were the most important of them. India too has had her
heroes in the field of journalism–her Behramji, Malabaries and Ramananda
Chatterjees, her Chintamanis and Kasturi Ranga Iyengars. They were, to
journalism, what Gokhale and Gandhi were to national politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men at the helm of a newspaper must be alert. They must be men of insight and
vision who can grasp the inwardness of a situation, feel the pulse of the
public, and body forth the yet unspoken thoughts of the masses of men. This is
an instinct which is akin to genius, and every great Editor is something of a
prophet too. And if he is utterly sincere and unselfish, he rarely goes wrong.
He is able to function simultaneously as the reflector and guide of public
opinion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
well-conducted newspaper or periodical voluntarily imposes on itself certain
restraints, so as not to transgress against God, or the State, or the
reputation of individual wielders of power. Criticism, even strong criticism,
is an inherent right, but the exercise of it is conditioned by the equal
inherent rights of others. Criticism of measures, rather than of men, must be
the main objective, though it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between
men and the measures they sponsor when in office. But it is a salutary rule to
avoid the imputation of evil motives, unless the evidence is overwhelming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
wise Government, wedded to the democratic tradition, will not seek to fetter
the press. Any restraints that it may be called upon to impose on the press
during a period of war or other great crisis, are of a temporary nature. But even
in normal times, the State, in the interests of public order, has to enact laws
applicable to the press. Incitement to violence, or the promotion of hatred
between different sections of the public, has to be guarded against. In the
case of a professed guardian of the public welfare like a democratic press, a
Government should exercise the greatest caution when bringing in legislation
seeking to control the press. It is not enough that popularly elected
legislatures scrutinise such a Bill before it becomes law. The representatives
of the press must themselves be consulted, and charged with the duty of
maintaining standards of conduct within their profession. Violent and unbridled
criticism is certainly an evil, but, in the effort to prevent it, even the right
type of criticism is apt to be stifled. It is necessary to preserve freedom of
expression, without giving rein to licence. This becomes possible through an
under between the representatives of the press and the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the freedom of the press has implications other than the absence of restraints
imposed by the State through legislation or executive orders. Where the press
is fast ceasing to be a vocation, and taking on the character of an industry,
the influence of the money power may become a menace to the freedom of the
press. The fabulously rich industrialist is not content to ply his trade and
enjoy the comfort which the possession of wealth brings with it. He must
acquire political power by getting his men elected to the legislatures, and, even
more, through control over the press. One way of controlling the press is by
owning a newspaper or a chain of newspapers, and paying a competent staff to
function as mouthpieces of his views on all matters of public interest. Another
way is to win over the press through his power of patronage in the shape of
advertisements on a huge scale. The money power works in insidious ways, and
saps the vitality of the press. Friends of democracy and champions of the
people’s right to a free press, must devise means to protect the press from the
encroachments of the monied interests, quite as much as from encroachments by
the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
another danger to the press arises from the impact of mass opinion. In their
anxiety to give to the public what the public is supposed to want, the leaders
in the world of journalism unconsciously betray the true interests of that
public. If the papers feed the public on sensation, the public acquires a taste
for sensational news and for stories of violent crime. The taste grows on what
is served. It is an unhealthy sign when the press of a country panders to an
ignorant public, and sinks to the level of sensation-mongering. The truth is
that important elements in a nation’s life are fundamentally sound. Their
instincts are healthy. The press is not called upon to stray from the straight
path, and corrupt the public taste. All writing meant for the public must be
bright, lively, and interesting. But there is no need, acting on wrong
assumptions of popular requirements, to vulgarise journalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
presentation of news in proper form is a great aid to the busy reader. But
sometimes the lay-out and headlines are given too much prominence. In the
search for smart and sensational headlines, a wrong twist is given to the news.
For instance, some newspapers have developed the habit of giving what are
called ‘streamer’ headlines. Anyone can see that events of outstanding
significance like the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi or the inauguration of
the Indian Republic do not happen every day. By racking your brains for the
wording of a streamer headline from day to day, you are obliged to give undue
importance to ordinary occurrences, just because there must be some kind of a
thundering headline. Even in the disposition of the news over the columns on a
single page, some papers present the appearance of a zig-zag puzzle. Such
featuring is a hindrance rather than a help to the reader. It confuses him and
even misleads him with regard to the significance of the news items. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
recent years there has been a tendency to exaggerate the value of the technical
and business staff, and underrate the services of the real makers of a
newspaper or periodical. The framework of technicians and business managers is
indeed necessary for the successful functioning of a newspaper. But ultimately
it is the quality of the writing that tells. The editorial staff produce
valuable material dealing with the main problems of the day, in addition to
putting into shape the huge mass of manuscripts passing through their hands. It
is they, again, who keep in touch with the progress of knowledge in various
fields, and send out requests for special articles to persons who have mastered
their subjects and can write with clarity. The editorial staff which thus wins
special distinction for a paper is not usually rewarded in an adequate measure.
Comparing their emoluments with those enjoyed by men of similar ability and
equipment in the permanent services of a State, or in the realms of law,
industry and finance, one notes with regret the shabby treatment accorded to
these talented persons, who not only reflect public opinion, but shape and
guide it. The journalists of modern India have learnt to look upon their
profession as something of a mission. Their zeal is so great that they make
light of hardships. It is not fair to discount their services and take
advantage of their idealism. This is an aspect of journalism, on its business
side, which has not received the attention it deserves. The working
journalists, like the lecturers in our colleges and universities, are among the
lowest paid intellectuals in any land. In different ways, these are the
educators of the nation, and it is only the consciousness of service rendered
with devotion which sustains them in difficult moments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Politics
and economics play a large part in a nation’s life under modern conditions. But
they do not exhaust a nation’s range of interests. Art and literature, sport
and pastime, science and industry, philosophy and religion, appeal in varying
degrees to large sections of the public. The leading newspapers always
recognise this position, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and devote space to items of interest
bearing on these topics. But it is to the weeklies, the monthlies and the
quarterlies that the public </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>must turn for a fuller treatment of these
subjects. These periodicals are produced at greater leisure; the writers have
more time to collect their material and present it in an attractive manner.
They are like a half-way house between the daily papers produced at top-speed,
and the volumes of learned treatises which take years to write. The periodicals
cater to select, but cultivated, groups of readers. They thus influence the
opinions of those who in their turn influence the general public. It is to the
growth of the periodicals that we must look for the evolution of an
independent, cultured, and educative type of journalism. Appraisal of new
movements in painting and sculpture, criticism of the stage and screen, reviews
of poetry and fiction, disquisitions on contemporary science and current trends
in politics and philosophy, will appeal to a cultured audience. Periodicals can
be so edited as to serve as extension schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Several
journals of this type, Indian and foreign, have disappeared for lack of public
support. This will affect, adversely, the cultural life of a nation. A
periodical might not make a profit, nor even pay its way. But it will uphold
values which are of the utmost significance to the future of the nation and of
humanity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

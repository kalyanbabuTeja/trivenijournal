known as an electro-<span class=SpellE>encephelograph</span>. This has led some
theorists to suggest that telepathy, at least, could be explained in physical
terms without having to imagine non-existent sense organs. The electrical
activity of one brain might influence that of another by some sort of direct
sympathetic action, the result of which would be that both persons think of the
same thing at the same time. Dr. Grey Walter, a leading expert in the field of
electro-encephalography, has recently pointed out that such mutual influence of
different brains is inconceivable. The electrical disturbances within the brain
are so small that an inch away from the surface of the head they are physically
indistinguishable.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

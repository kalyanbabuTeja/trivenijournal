<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to follow this new orientation on the problems of life, the whence, whither, the why and the wherefore of man and the ultimate goal of human destiny, we have to know something about the personalities that have succeeded in projecting this new outlook and in re-interpreting the whole of the phenomena of religion for the modern world. The central figure of this drama is Baha’u’llah who was exiled from Persia in 1852 and died in the Turkish Penal Colony of Akka in 1892. His son and successor Abdul-Baha who accompanied his father in exile and imprisonment at the tender age of eight, came out of prison at the ripe old age of sixty-three in 1908 and passed away in Haifa (Palestine) in 1921 after having proclaimed the Message of Baha’u’llah in the continents of Africa, Europe and America.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Baha’i Philosophy was therefore projected from within the prison walls of Akka and every bit of it was recorded by the Supreme Pen as we call it in Baha’i terminology.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among Baha’u’llah’s writings we may mention <I>Haftwadi </I>(Seven valleys), <I>Kalmat-i-Maknuna </I>(Hidden Words), <I>Ighan </I>(Book of Assurance), Epistles to the Kings and Emperors of the world and many Tablets <I>(Alwah) </I>or letters written to the believers which give us an indication of his ideas and ideals in that inimitable Persian and Arabic which can be truly designated as revealed word of God. His son Abdul-Baha who is the expounder and the exemplar of his father, has to his credit the following well-known books–<I>Almudnia, </I>(Mysterious forces of Civilisation), <I>Makala Sahya </I>(Traveller’s Narrative), <I>Mufavazat </I>(Some Answered Questions), <I>Makatibs </I>(Tablets of Abdul-Baha and <I>Khitabat </I>or the Addresses delivered by him in England, France and the United States of America. All these have been translated into English and form a complete compendium in the form of selections in one volume known as the &quot;Baha’i Scripture&quot; and published in New York by the Baha’i Publication Committee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can do no better than arrange in order the teachings of Baha’u’llah and Abdul Baha on the problems that baffle solution and give their own words with regard to each of these questions. Before we proceed further let me state that Baha’u’llah was a Mystic, as every great religious thinker is more or less a Mystic, and I will first of all take his Mystic Philosophy and give an outline of the same. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stages of the journey of travellers from the earthly dwelling to the divine home have been designated to be seven according to Baha’u’llah. (1) <I>The Valley of Search</I>:- &quot;The steed upon which journey through this valley is undertaken is <I>patience. </I>The traveller must not become dejected or down-hearted. Heart must be purified and freed from every blemish and one must turn away from blind imitations of the past and he should close the doors of friendship and enmity to all the people of the earth.&quot; Next is (2) <I>The Valley of Love</I>:- &quot;The steed of this valley is pain. A lover fears nothing and no loss can do him harm. He finds life. in death and glory in shame. At this time the traveller is unconscious of himself and of aught else and he has no thought except that of the Beloved. Without pain this journey cannot be accomplished.&quot; (3) <I>The Valley of Knowledge </I>comes next. In this valley according to Baha’u’llah the traveller will be led from doubt to certainty, and from error of wordly desire to the light of guidance of piety. His inner eye will be opened and he will engage in close communion with the Beloved. The traveller will see in God’s creation neither difference nor contradiction. He will see justice in injustice and witness grace in justice.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After journeying through this valley which is the last station of limitation, the traveller reaches the (4) <I>The Valley of Unity </I>which has been split up into four stages of which this forms the first stage. Then follow the stages of (5) Contentment (6) of Astonishment and (7) of Absolute Annihilation. When a traveller steps into this Valley of Unity he hears with divine ears and sees with the eyes of God. He will know &quot;all voices to be from the ‘King’ and &quot;hear all melodies as from Him.&quot; He will find the splendour of the Divine Sun shining equally upon the contingent beings and see the lights of unity manifest and present in all existent things.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The traveller then exercises divine contentment and thinks of the pure, spiritual wine. Baha’u’llah says: &quot;The tongue is unable to give an account of the three valleys of Contentment, Astonishment and Annihilation because utterance falls exceeding short.&quot; The traveller’s amazement increases; he becomes astonished at the beauty of the All-glorious. And when he reaches the last stage–the Valley of Annihilation–he dies from self and lives in God. All this may have been put in a poetic language but to the Mystic these journeys are real experiences. I would suggest a thorough study of the <I>Haftwadi </I>in order to comprehend the Baha’i Mystic Philosophy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greatest contribution of Baha’u’llah to religion is the interpretation of Holy Books, specially, the <I>Gospels </I>and the <I>Koran </I>in a book known as the <I>Ighan </I>(Book of Assurance). Thus a new interpretation has been put on the doctrines that are common to Christianity and Islam, such as the Resurrection or the Day of Judgment, the Second Coming of Christ, the Prophet as an educator of humanity, the idea of God as manifesting His qualities through Divine Men in a Prophetic Cycle. We shall give below a few of these new interpretations by way of illustration. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take for instance the words: &quot;The sun shall be darkened and the stars shall fall from heaven,&quot; or when it is said, that&quot; The heavens shall be cloven asunder,&quot; (K. S. 82) or again; &quot;In that day, the earth shall be changed into another earth.&quot; The purpose of these allegorical words is not to be understood <I>literally </I>but <I>metaphorically. </I>For example one meaning according to Baha’u’llah of the ‘Sun’ is the ‘Sun of Truth’ or the Manifestation of Divinity. The ‘Moon’ and ‘Stars’ signify the divines of the former Dispensation at the time of the subsequent Dispensation. Therefore by the darkness of the sun and the moon and by the falling of the stars is intended the fall of the divines and the abolition of the ordinances or laws established in the old manifestation or at any rate the lessening of their influence under the new Dispensation. Now all this is not known to the interpreters of Holy Books, for they always read a meaning into these words which are neither true nor do they appeal to the reason of man. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must hurry on to some of the fundamental metaphysicial conceptions and the Baha’i view on these questions. I will arrange them as under and give in the words of Abdul-Baha, the expounder of the words of Baha’u’llah, the explanations offered and answers given in that wonderful book- &quot;<I>Some Answered Questions,</I>&quot;<I> </I>which can be recommended to students of Baha’i Philosophy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I. NATURE IS GOVERNED BY ONE UNIVERSAL LAW: - &quot;When we behold organization, arrangement and law in Nature we infer that there is some intelligence that is ruling the world of Nature. Human life is the branch of Nature which is the root. How can will, intelligence and perception be absent in the root when they are present in the branch? Evidently Nature in its own essence is in the grasp of the power of God, who is Eternal Almighty One; He holds Nature within accurate regulations and laws and rules over it.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is certain that the whole contingent world is subject to a law and rule, which it can never disobey; even man is forced to submit to death, sleep and other conditions. Contingent beings are, therefore, dependent on something which we infer to be an independent being, whose independence is essential. Throughout the world of existence it is the same; the smallest created thing proves that there is a creator, How can then this great universe which is endless, be self-created and come into existence from the action of matter and the elements? &quot;What a strange mistake is such a supposition,&quot; says Abdul-Baha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">II. THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR: - If a person were to say that he possesses perfect comprehension and intelligence and has no need of an educator, he would be denying that which is clear and evident. How can a child say, &quot;I have no need of education: I will act according to my reason and intelligence.&quot; An educator is therefore necessary. That Educator must be perfect who may give life to the world of humanity, change the earth, lay the foundation of a new existence, organise the world, bring nations and religions under the shadow of one standard–certainly nothing short of a divine power could accomplish so great a work. The founders of religions in the past–Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Krishna, and Zoroaster have been such educators who possessed divine qualities. Baha’u’llah is another such Educator.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">III. THE FIVE ASPECTS OF SPIRIT: - According to the Baha’i teaching spirit has five divisions– &quot;(1) The <I>vegetable spirit–</I>this is a power which results from the combination of elements and the mingling of substance by the decree of the Supreme God and from the influence, the effect, and connection of other existences. When these substances or elements separate the power of growth ceases to exist. (2) The <I>animal spirit </I>which also results from the</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">mingling and combination of elements, but this combination is more complete, and through the decree of the Almighty Lord a perfect mingling is obtained and the animal spirit, in other words the power of the senses, is produced. It will perceive the reality of things from that which is seen and visible, audible, edible, tangible and that which can be smelt. After the dissociation and decomposition of the combined elements, this spirit also will naturally disappear. (3) The <I>human spirit </I>may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on crystal. The body of man, which is composed from the elements is combined and mingled in the most perfect form; it is the most solid construction, the noblest combination, the most perfect existence. It grows and develops through the animal spirit. This perfected body can be compared to a crystal, and the human spirit to the sun. Nevertheless, if the crystal breaks, the bounty of the sun continues; and if the crystal is destroyed or ceases to exist, harm will happen to the bounty of the sun which is everlasting.&quot;–<I>Abdul-Baha.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;But the spirit of man has two aspects: one divine, one satanic; that is to say, it is capable of the utmost imperfection. If it acquires virtues it is the most noble of the existing beings, and if it acquires vices it becomes the most degraded existence.&quot; (4) The fourth degree of spirit is the <I>heavenly spirit; </I>it is the spirit of faith and the bounty of God; it comes from the breath of the Holy Spirit, and by the divine power it becomes the cause of eternal life. It is the power which makes the earthly man heavenly, and the imperfect man perfect. It makes the impure to be pure, the silent eloquent; it purifies and sanctifies those made captive by carnal desires; it makes the ignorant wise. (5) The fifth spirit is the <I>holy spirit. </I>This Holy Spirit is the mediator between God and His creatures. It is like a mirror facing the sun. As the pure mirror receives light from the sun and transmits this bounty to others, so the Holy Spirit is the mediator of the Holy Light from the Sun of Reality, which it gives to the sanctified realities. It is adorned with all the divine perfections. Every time it appears the world is renewed, and a new cycle is founded. The body of the world of humanity puts on a new garment. It can be compared to the spring; whenever it comes, the world passes from one condition to another. Through the advent of the season of spring the black earth and the fields and wildernesses will become verdant and blooming, and all sorts of flowers and sweet-scented herbs will grow; the trees will have new life, and new fruits will appear, and a new cycle is founded.&quot; <I>–Abdul Baha.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same way, the appearance of Baha’u’llah was like a new spring time which appeared with holy breezes, with the hosts of everlasting life, and with heavenly power.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IV. THE ORIGIN OF MAN: - According to the Baha’i teaching the universe is without beginning and without end. Absolute non-existence cannot become existence. There was no time when this universe was not because we cannot imagine a time when no being existed. Existence is, therefore, eternal and perpetual. The original matter which is in the embryonic state and the mingled and the composed elements which were its earliest forms, gradually grew and developed during many ages and cycles passing from one shape and form into another. United they appeared in this perfection, this system, this organization and this establishment through the supreme wisdom of God. Man similarly gradually grew and developed and passed from one form to another, until he appeared with this beauty and perfection, this force and this power. Man’s existence and this earth from the beginning until it reaches this state, form and condition, necessarily lasts a long time, and goes through many degrees, until it reaches this condition. But from the beginning of man’s existence he is a separate species. He is the embryo of the superior species, and not of the animal; his species and essence undergo no change. The idea that he was at first an animal and then developed and became a man, is not countenanced by the Baha’i teaching.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">V. THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SPIRIT: - The immortality of the spirit is mentioned if the Holy Books; it is the fundamental basis of the divine religions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The rewards of this life are the virtues and perfections which adorn the reality of man. For example, he was dark and becomes luminous, he was ignorant and becomes wise, he was neglectful and becomes vigilant, he was asleep and becomes awakened, he was dead and becomes living, he was blind and becomes a seer, he was deaf and becomes a hearer, he was earthly and becomes heavenly, he was material and becomes spiritual. For such people there is no greater torture than being veiled from God, and no more severe punishment than sensual vices, dark qualities, lowness of nature, engrossment in carnal desires. When they are delivered through, the light of faith from the darkness of these vices, and become illuminated with the radiance of the sum of reality, and ennobled with all the virtues, they esteem this the greatest reward, and they know it to be the true paradise. The rewards of the other world are peace, the spiritual graces, the various spiritual gifts in the Kingdom of God, the gaining of the desires of the heart and the soul, and the meeting of God in the world of Eternity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Briefly, the human spirit is in one condition. It neither becomes ill from the diseases of the body, nor cured by its health; it does not become sick, nor weak, nor miserable, nor poor, nor light, nor small. That is to say, it will not be injured because of the infirmities of the body, and no effect will be visible even if the body becomes weak, or if the hands and feet and tongue be cut off, or if it loses the power of hearing or sight. Therefore it is evident and certain that the spirit is different from the body, and that its duration is independent of that of the body; on the contrary, the spirit with the utmost greatness rules in the world of the body, and its power and influence, like the bounty of the sun in the mirror are, apparent and visible. But when the mirror becomes dusty or breaks, it will cease to reflect the rays of the sun.&quot;<I>–Abdul-Baha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Predestination and Free Will: - </I>With regard to this subject Abdul-Baha has said that fate was of two kinds; one was decreed which could not be changed or altered, such as the power of life created in the body of man was like the oil in a lamp, which when ended must be extinguished. The other kind of fate was conditional, for example, a strong wind blowing may extinguish the lamp. This can be avoided by caution and circumspection.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question, if man was a free agent or not, has been answered in this way. Says Abdul-Baha: &quot;Some things are subject to the free will of man, such as justice, equity, injustice, tyranny, good or evil actions. There are other actions to which every human being is forced, such as sleep, death, decline of power, injuries, misfortunes. Everyone of us is compelled to endure them.&quot; As a matter of fact the states of man are different and everyone is perfect in his own degree and man in all his actions receives help and power from God.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VI. THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOUL: - The Baha’i teaching is absolutely clear on this point. The human spirit does not descend into a body, that is to say, it does not enter it, &quot;for descent and entrance are,&quot; says Abdul-Baha, &quot;the characteristics of bodies.&quot; &quot;The spirit never entered this body, so in quitting it, it will not be in need of an abiding place. The spirit is connected with the body as this light is with this mirror. When the mirror is clear and perfect, the light of the lamp will be apparent in it, and when the mirror becomes covered with dust or breaks, the light will disappear.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VII. THE KINGDOM OF GOD: - The Kingdom of heaven is not a material place according to the Baha’i teaching. It is sanctified from time and place. The spirit has no limitations of time or space. The world of the spirit cannot be perceived by the eye or by the other senses–hearing, smell, taste or touch. &quot;Entrance into this Kingdom,&quot; says Abdul Baha, &quot;is through the love of God, through holiness and chastity, through truthfulness, purity, steadfastness, faithfulness and the sacrifice of life.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VIII. THE NON-EXISTENCE OF EVIL: - As a matter of fact, according to the Baha’i teaching, all that God created is good. There is no evil in existence; just as death is the absence of life or darkness is the absence of light or ignorance is the absence of knowledge, so evil is the absence of good. Light is an existing thing, but darkness is non-existent. A scorpion or a serpent may be evil in relation to man but in reality as regards themselves they are good. Satan therefore has no real existence according to the Baha’i teaching.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONCLUSION: - The above in brief is the outline of some of the Baha’i metaphysical ideas. The Baha’i programme for the regeneration of human society is a very elaborate one and is based on the fundamentals stated above. If we are living in a world which is under a divine government and if we wish to create a kingdom of heaven on this earth then we must equip ourselves with real knowledge–a knowledge that has been revealed to us by these divine teachers who have ushered in a new era of spiritual enlightenment for the human race. This is the New Day–the Day of God–the day when a New Dispensation has dawned and a New Heaven and a New Earth are being created before our very eyes. Let us look up to these great beacon lights for guidance as way-farers on this great journey from earthly life to divine life, through the valleys of search and of love and of knowledge to the valley of Union with God.</P>

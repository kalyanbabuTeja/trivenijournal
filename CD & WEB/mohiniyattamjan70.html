chain <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>lovely items
commencing with pure dance and proceeding according to an enchanting system to
combine it with <span class=SpellE>Abhinaya</span>, thus reaching the climax <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>pure dance and <span class=SpellE>Abhinaya</span>.
It is well known that the choreography <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span><span class=SpellE>Bharatanatyam</span> as we see it today was done by
the famous <span class=SpellE>Thanjavur</span> Trio: <span class=SpellE>Ponniah</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Chinnaiah</span> and <span class=SpellE>Shivanandam</span>.
It was they who christened it <span class=SpellE>Bharatanatyam</span>. It <span

out <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>its social stigma and
gave it a new name and elegant showmanship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

developed form is however found only in the <span class=SpellE><i>Chilappathikaram</i></span><i>,
</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the famous Tamil epic. There are
two views on the date of this epic. The latest of </span>the two dates is

that <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span> existed even before the seventh

<span class=SpellE>Madhavi</span> was the greatest exponent <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span><span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span>
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the time. Her training had
been unique. The description given in the poem shows that <span class=SpellE>Bharata’s</span>

system <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>dancing that existed
in <span class=SpellE>Dravidavritta</span> was built around the <span
class=SpellE>Devadasi</span> (also known as <span class=SpellE>Thevadicbi</span>
or <span class=SpellE>Thevaradi-achi</span>, the servant of God). They had a
good style of dancing in vogue. With the advent of the Aryans and the
absorption of knowledge contained in the Sanskrit works the <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span>
teachers found it to their advantage to adopt <span class=SpellE>Bharata’s</span>
<span class=SpellE><i>Narya</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Sastra</span> </i>in
giving sophistication to their styles. Thus even earlier than the seventh
century <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span> seemed to have acquired a system
and a certain degree of sophistication. During the days of the <span
class=SpellE>Chola</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Chera</span> empires <span
class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span> was very popular in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place>. It was considered most respectable too. That was the
beginning of the Bhakti period in Tamil <span class=SpellE>Nadu</span>. Many of
the <span class=SpellE>Devadasis</span> were pious and pure. It would be
interesting to know that <span class=SpellE>Kulasekhara</span> <span
class=SpellE>Alwar</span> of Kerala gave one of his daughters as the bride of <span
class=SpellE>Ranganatha</span>. <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span> however did
not stay at its pinnacle for long. When the disintegration of the <span
class=SpellE>Chola</span>, <span class=SpellE>Pandya</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Chera</span> empires began, <span class=SpellE>Devadasis</span>
were forced to seek the protection of local warlords and chieftains. As
distinct from an <span class=SpellE>organised</span> society under powerful
empire building kings, the warlords and chieftains held away over small
principalities. Standards of law and order or morality were also totally
different in the new situation. <span class=SpellE>Devadasis</span> gradually <span
class=GramE>fell</span> a prey to the newly emerged <span class=SpellE>carnel</span>
society and they deteriorated in every manner. Ultimately <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span>
was even banned by law. It was at that time that the immortal <span
class=SpellE>Thanjavur</span> Trio came like an Avatar to rescue this beautiful
damsel in distress. That they did a most magnificent job is known to us all
today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span> which served as the base for <span class=SpellE>Bharatanatyam</span>
was also the base for both Kuchipudi and <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>
styles of dancing. Kuchipudi style is about 500 years old. <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span>
in the 15th century was in a very disreputable state. A rare artist and
choreographer from a small village near <span class=SpellE>Tenali</span>
however saw the real art form that it contained. He wanted to redeem it. It
could not be redeemed unless its shape itself was changed. So he took out the
essence of it, added some of his own and converted it into a lovely form. Then
he came across the real difficulty. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>No<i>
</i></span>girl of society would come forward to learn it. So he picked up
good-looking boys and taught them the new dance in his house in Kuchipudi
village. And what is known as <span class=GramE>Kuchipudi,</span> thus grew up
amidst popular acclaim. Even today, the great performers of Kuchipudi are men.
Society no doubt took to later; but it was only after <span class=SpellE>Smt</span>.
Rukmini <span class=SpellE>Devi</span> of <span class=SpellE>Kalakshetra</span>
started dancing herself into the hearts of <span class=SpellE>Sahridayas</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the old days also there were a number of occasions when Kerala was under the
President’s rule. In those days the President was however called <span
class=SpellE>Perumal</span>. The principal chieftains of <span class=SpellE>kerala</span>
used to meet once in twelve years and elect their <span class=SpellE>Perumal</span>
or king for the next twelve years. They never chose a <span class=SpellE>Keralian</span>
for the post. They always brought in a person from Tamil <span class=SpellE>Nadu</span>
or occasionally from Karnataka. Most of the <span class=SpellE>Perumals</span>
were of Tamil origin. The <span class=SpellE>Perumals</span> had their
headquarters at <span class=SpellE>Tiruvanchikkulam</span> in <span
class=SpellE>Cranganur</span> near <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cochin</st1:place></st1:State>.
<span class=GramE>As the <span class=SpellE>Perumals</span> were usually <span
class=SpellE>Tamilians</span> the parties that accompanied them included the <span
class=SpellE>favourite</span> <span class=SpellE>Devadasis</span> too.</span>
Mostly they travelled through the <span class=SpellE>Palghat</span> gap in the <st1:place
w:st="on">Western <span class=SpellE>Ghats</span></st1:place>. All the <span
class=SpellE>Devadasis</span> did not settle down in <span class=SpellE>Cranganur</span>.
They stayed at different places famous for their temples. They were places that
were frequently visited by the <span class=SpellE>Perumals</span> also. <span
class=SpellE>Pazhayannur</span>, <span class=SpellE>Korattikara</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Perungottukurussi</span> are some of these areas where for several
centuries there were families of dancing girls. According to Mr. Rama <span
class=SpellE>Pisharoti</span> a number of <span class=SpellE>Devadasis</span>
came away and took shelter in Kerala during the Moslem invasion of Tamil <span
class=SpellE>Nadu</span> in the 14th century. He thought that most of them
settled down in these places. Dances performed in those days in the temples or
in the court were not called <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>. Otherwise
there would have been references to <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span> in
the literary works of that time. <span class=SpellE>Leelathilakam</span> of the
fourteenth century talks of the lovely female dancers but not <span
class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>. So also <span class=SpellE>Onam</span>
performance done by the four <span class=SpellE>thevadichis</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Thiruvella</span> temple in the eleventh century was also not
called <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
earliest mention of <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span> in a Kerala literary
work appears in “<span class=SpellE>Vyavasharamala</span>” written in 1709. The
reference relates to payments made to ‘<span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mutalaya</span> <span class=SpellE>Attakkar</span>’, that is,
dancers like <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span> players. There were other
references too of a similar nature in the 18th century. One could therefore
presume that sometime in the 17th century a choreographer whose identity is not
known seems to have done some work on the <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span>
then existing in Kerala and changed it to <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>.
Whatever it <span class=GramE>be</span>, it did not seem to be as wide-spread

produced out of the <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span> of the time, the
refinement that is known as <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span> today. They
composed many pieces for it. <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Swarajathis</span></span><span
class=GramE>, <span class=SpellE>Varnas</span> and scores of <span

witnessing, and participating in the renaissance of <span class=SpellE>Dasiattam</span>
in the <span class=SpellE>Bharatanatyam</span>. His accounts aroused enough
interest in the Maharaja to get the famous danseuse <span class=SpellE>Sugandhavalli</span>
from <span class=SpellE>Tanjavur</span>. It is possible that the influence of <span

have contributed to some movements or other in <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>
too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

too Kathakali had become the dominant art form. <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>
therefore travelled down to petty principalities and the dancers were forced to
earn a living by disreputable means. At the end of the last century it had
reached the lowest depths an art form could descend to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The <span class=SpellE>Varnas</span> are in Malayalam and in Telugu. Those sung
now-a-days are compositions of <span class=SpellE>Swathi</span> <span

was used. That both <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattatn</span> and <span

An eighteen cubit long cloth with the typical way of draping it with <span

</i>and with a short blouse revealing the midriff and with a low neckline and
the way of covering the breasts as well as the coiffure were more or less
similar. The <span class=SpellE>jewellery</span> used was different from that
used for <span class=SpellE>Bharatanatyam</span>. The following are some of
them: <span class=SpellE>Nettichutti</span>, <span class=SpellE>Kundalams</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Mukuthis</span> (<span class=SpellE>Valayam</span>), <span

to examine whether Kathakali has had any serious influence over <span

Yet Kathakali <span class=SpellE>Mudras</span> have exercised some influence.
The <span class=SpellE>Mudras</span> used in <span class=SpellE>Mohiniyattam</span>
are not pure; they are an admixture of <span class=SpellE>Kathakali</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mudras</span> and gestures used in <span class=SpellE>Kaikottikkali</span>

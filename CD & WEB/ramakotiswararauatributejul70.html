style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
seems so long ago that I first met Kolavennu Ramakotiswara Rau that his passing
away a few months back brings back to memory some of the events connected with
our acquaintance, which happened over the years. <i>Triveni, </i>which was
started by him in 1928, had been in existence for a few years, when it carried
a few of my articles, which encouraged me to feel that I could, if I strove
hard, become a sort of writer myself. But it was when I was in distant <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Patna</span></st1:place></st1:City>
that I remember receiving a letter from him asking me to contribute to the
magazine and to become a life subscriber. I do not remember the date exactly
but it was some time in 1935 or 1936. By then <i>Triveni </i>was in bloom
reflecting in its columns the idealism and the ideals of its founder. I did
become a life subscriber and also continued to write occasionally to it on
constitutional, economic and allied subjects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
then, and until a few years back, I had been not only a contributor but a
regular reader of the magazine. As I was away for many years in <st1:place
w:st="on">North India</st1:place> and came <span class=GramE>South</span> only
once in three or four years, my personal contacts with Ramakotiswara Rau were
not very intimate or close, nor had I occasion to watch closely the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>running
of the magazine which had its ups and downs. I knew however that Ramakotiswara
Rau had been nursing the child <i>Triveni </i></span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with all
possible care and that he was doing so at great personal sacrifice. I had come
to entertain a high regard for him as an individual even as I had a high regard
for the magazine. It was altogether a magazine out of the ordinary:
Ramakotiswara Rau had imparted to it the veneer of an essentially literary,
cultural and artistic magazine and <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> it as a
medium for the promotion </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of cultural understanding among people
speaking different languages and hailing from different linguistic areas in the
country. It did </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and does even now carry articles on other
subjects also but its predominant interest was cultural and literary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

North in <span class=GramE>1946,</span> and during my eight years’ stay in that

personal impression of Ramakotiswara Rau was that he had a genius for
friendship; that he had a high sense of moral and human values; that he had a
highly developed perception of what is fair and unfair; and finally, that he
was a person of great sensitiveness and fine sensibility. I do not know, and I
have not heard, that he ever consciously said or did anything which injured the
susceptibilities of anyone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

incident which enhanced my regard for Ramakotiswara Rau may be mentioned here.
After nearly 2½ years, the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><i>Indian</i></st1:PlaceName><i>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType> </i>published by the <span
class=SpellE>Subhodaya</span> Publications Ltd., <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, of which I was the first editor
(1948-1951), began to experience financial difficulties. The management, after
much hesitation, decided ultimately to hand it over to the then managing director
who agreed to continue its publication. But the assurance was not fully kept
and the editorial staff was given notice and I also received notice of
termination of service. But a private offer was made to me that I could
continue as editor, if I was prepared to accept reduced emoluments, which in
essence meant that I would work on only half the salary I was getting till
then. I would have agreed to the proposal, if only it was made in the proper
spirit and manner, as I <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that in a situation
of the kind that faced us, everyone had to make a sacrifice to facilitate a
growing institution going until things brightened up. But in the humiliating
“accept or leave” attitude in which it was made, the proposal was not worth
considering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While the matter was pending, the
editorship was offered to Ramakotiswara Rau on the reduced scale of emoluments
which I was asked to accept. Before accepting or rejecting it, Ramakotiswara
Rau came to me to know the circumstances in which he was approached and whether
I on my side was accepting the proposal made to me. When I explained the
circumstances, in which I decided to decline it, he said that he would not also
agree to take my place in the circumstances and refused the offer. I was deeply
touched by the courtesy shown by Ramakotiswara Rau in consulting me and by his
refusal to accept the position in what would have been a humiliating situation.

it somewhat irregularly published but the periodicity of its publication had to
be changed more than once. My occasional contributions to the magazine
continued for some time subsequently and I received very cordial and friendly
letters from Ramakotiswara Rau who, for some years preceding his passing away,
was in declining health and settled down in <span class=SpellE>Narasaraopet</span>,

of undesirable developments, one of which is the inordinate proneness for
acquisition of n positions of power and of money by persons who had till then
participated in the freedom movement and even served jail sentences.
Ramakotiswara Rau was remarkably free from personal ambition and I believe by
temperament disliked the methods indulged in by our latter day politicians who
have made politics a profession and <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> it for
personal or other equally ignoble ends. To the end he shunned politics with
power as the end objective and preferred to live in obscurity and poverty even
though he could have come into public prominence and become affluent, if he
wanted. On the other hand, it was also possible, that he may not have gained
any recognition if he chose to enter the lists as a competitor for political
preferment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

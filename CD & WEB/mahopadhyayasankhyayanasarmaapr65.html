State of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Andhra Pradesh</st1:place></st1:State>
recently celebrated, was a phenomenon among his elders and the stalwarts of the
Victorian era. Born to affluence, but never given to indolence, he was a boy
that arrested everybody’s attention and could not steal by the crowd even if he
would. He passed with distinction and stood first at the Middle School
Examination, held for the whole of the multi-lingual area of Madras Presidency
as it then was. This educational qualification of his was more than sufficient
to enable him to enter the legal profession which was held in high esteem in
those days. But his intellect and temperament were such that they would not
allow him to put on blinkers and run in a rut. What with his passion for
literature–Sanskrit, Telugu, and English, what with his love of the histrionic
art and the theatre and of fine arts like music, what with his keen interest in
almost all branches of science, what with the numerous facets of his mind that
not merely shone but scintillated, he would not be cribbed and confined to any
set pattern of intellectual activity. In his teens, he attained by his own <span
class=GramE>self-effort</span> striking mastery of Sanskrit and Telugu. When he
was barely seventeen, he started a journal called <span class=SpellE><i>Sujana</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Promodini</span> </i>which was his first literary debut, and
which he edited for two years. Encouraged by his friends, he performed at the
age of twenty his first <span class=SpellE><i>Satavadhanam</i></span><i>, </i>an
impromptu literary performance much in vogue in the Andhra country and
requiring display of one's memory, extempore versification, and alertness of
mind. In the same year, he brought out his first literary production entitled <span
class=SpellE><i>Sudhanidhi</i></span><i> </i>which is regarded as the first
book of Modern Telugu poetry. Though cast in the classical mould, it cut new
ground in the literary field, in that his descriptions of all and sundry in it
breathed an air of freshness and did not conform to the conventional type. He
openly expressed that his muse could not be put in a straight jacket, and he
proved to be a pioneer for later writers, who demanded and exercised freedom
from what they thought was the tyranny of the classical grammar and literary
criticism. However he did not go the whole hog with them, though to a large
extent he broke away from the cult of the turgid and factitious style. On the
other hand, with his scientific approach to everything, he was an exponent of
the use of the <i>mot <span class=SpellE>juste</span> </i>and the language that
expressed all the nuances of thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
by his first public appearance in the literary arena, he emerged not as a
novice but as a master, not as a seeker but as an authority, among the
litterateurs of his time. He had no need to pass through the usual phases of
apprenticeship and probation. With his impressive lineaments and imposing
intellect, with his capacious mind that earned him the name of a walking <span
class=SpellE>encyclopaedia</span> with his clarity and alacrity of intellect
and with his powers of quick repartee coupled with genial <span class=SpellE>humour</span>,
he easily dominated and captivated any literary gathering that he attended. His
was a masterful personality, and when he spoke, he held the audience in his
palm. It was no wonder that his knowledge that was at once deep, varied and
expansive evoked glowing tributes from contemporary leaders of thought in
various fields. He lived at a time when one of the passions of the Andhra
writers was to bring the Andhra public in touch with the treasures of Sanskrit
literature, and if he translated in running prose <span class=SpellE>Bhavabhuti’s</span>
<span class=SpellE><i>Uttara</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Rama</span> <span
class=SpellE>Charitram</span>, </i>a masterpiece of pathos and brought out in
Telugu <span class=SpellE>Kalidas’s</span> <span class=SpellE><i>Vikramorvasiyam</i></span><i>
</i>conceived and depicted in a classical setting, it was because Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sarma</span> was moved by a similar desire to serve the Andhra
people. He also produced original works, a social drama entitled <span
class=SpellE><i>Manorama</i></span><i> </i>having for its theme a type of
sub-communal wrangle rampant in his days <span class=SpellE><i>Partha</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Parajayam</span> </i>an unpublished work, <span
class=SpellE><i>Avadata</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Kalabhakam</span> </i>adapted
from <span class=SpellE>Buddhistic</span> literature <span class=SpellE><i>Utsrishtikarnam</i></span><i>
</i>a species of drama poignantly pathetic, <span class=SpellE><i>Rahasya</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Darpanam</span> </i>and <i>Andhra <span class=SpellE>Padyavali</span>.
</i>He founded a journal known as <span class=SpellE><i>Kalpalata</i></span><i>,
</i>which dealt, as its name indicated, with almost every subject under the
sun, including politics, which no journal had by then ever thought of touching
upon. To mention that he was its editor is an understatement. Except a
negligible portion, almost every column of it contained only his contribution.
He<b> </b>wrote seriously as well as in a lighter vein and his originality and
spirit of research were reflected in it. He was the first scholar that<i> </i>told
the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> that, besides <span class=SpellE>Srinadha</span>,
another poet <span class=SpellE>Mukkavalli</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkayya</span>
had fully translated the <span class=SpellE><i>Naishadha</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Kavyam</span> </i>of Sri <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>harsha</span></span>,
and cited verses from the translation. The journal posed certain literary
questions and puzzles, and prizes for the best answers were awarded in the
order of merit. It was <span class=GramE>this feature</span> of it in
particular that made it a meeting ground and common platform for many a
literary aspirant. One of the lifelong unions between two different writers,
then widely separated in several respects, but later well-known as literary
twins<i> </i>by the name of <span class=SpellE>Venkataparvateeswara</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kavulu</span> or poets was brought about by this journal. <span
class=SpellE><i>Nataka</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Sarvasvam</span>, </i>an
unpublished work of his, was hailed by leading men of letters that came across
it and are still fortunately with us as a unique and invaluable contribution to
the science<i> </i>of literary criticism particularly of the drama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He presided over many literary conferences and
delivered thoughtful and thought-provoking addresses which were mostly
extempore. Special mention must however be made of his Presidential Address at <span
class=SpellE>Tanuku</span> at the 13th session of the Andhra <span
class=SpellE>Sahitya</span> <span class=SpellE>Parishat</span> in 1924. It
discussed some of the fundamental aspects of the origin and the growth of the
Andhra language and literature and was assessed as one of the classics of
Telugu. One must also mention that a controversy, which had been raging in the
Andhra country for many years over the use of the colloquial or the grammatical
expression in literary works, reached its climax at this session and threatened
to create a permanent and unbridgeable chasm between the two schools of
thought. It was the genuine and the innate tact of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sarma</span>
that averted what might have otherwise turned out to be a cultural disaster for
the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span>. He had the ability to silence opposition
without rousing passions. Even if he often smashed an interruption by his
powerful retort, he immediately rounded it off by a humorous observation that
left behind no trail of bitterness. In recognition of his prodigious knowledge
and talents, the popular title of <span class=SpellE>Mahopadhyaya</span> was
conferred on him at the sixth session of the <span class=SpellE>Sarasvata</span>
Conference at <span class=SpellE>Tenali</span>. Some of his extempore verses,
which were not however recorded, gained large currency. He was also a patron of
the stage, and he actively participated in founding the Andhra <span
class=SpellE>Nataka</span> <span class=SpellE>Kala</span> <span class=SpellE>Parishad</span>
and presided over its first conference at <span class=SpellE>Tenali</span>. </p>

literary and artistic performances and achievements art but <span class=GramE>an
expression of a tiny fragment</span> of his all round personality. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Essentially,
he was of a scientific bent of mind, and given adequate opportunities for the
full play of his scientific faculties and researches, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
would have been one of the top ranking scientists of his day. He believed and
wrote for the benefit of the layman on scientific subjects, avoiding almost
completely the use of the technical diction. He was thus the forerunner of the
later movements and trials for bringing out scientific works in the vernacular
languages. He was also reported to have made bold predictions which later <span
class=SpellE>materialised</span> in the shape of scientific inventions. Unlike
most of the religious conservatives of the West or the traditional scholars of
the East, he not only accepted the Darwinian theory of evolution and the origin
of the species but made further speculations on its basis. One of the <span
class=SpellE>favourite</span> branches of his scientific study was Geology.
Some of the schemes for mining which he took up and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>executed
as the <span class=SpellE>Diwan</span> of <span class=SpellE>Chinamerangi</span>
Estate brought him into </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>touch with foreign experts, who took him
for a professional engineer. None the less, some of the projects which he
planned and tried to implement were more worthy of a cabinet minister of an
independent State than of a <span class=SpellE>Diwan</span> of a small estate
with limited resources. His imagination often outrunning his caution, he landed
himself and his <span class=SpellE>Zamindar</span> in financial difficulties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was a <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of attraction to his contemporaries
interested in culture and knowledge. He was holding what might be called a
literary <span class=SpellE><i>Darbar</i></span><i>, </i>a word that came to be
associated afterwards with the late Sri <span class=SpellE>Mutnuri</span> <span
class=SpellE>Krishnarao</span>, the illustrious editor of the Andhra Weekly
known as <st1:place w:st="on"><i>Krishna</i></st1:place><i> <span class=SpellE>Patrika</span>.
</i>Some of his colleagues and admirers, who had intimate contact with him, are
still available to tell us anecdotes in illustration of his ready wit, his
catching sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, his bewitching powers of
conversation, his skill as a <span class=SpellE>debator</span> and speaker, and
in short, of every aspect of his complete personality. To give but one
instance, one can recall an election meeting which he was addressing as a young
candidate opposing two influential rivals of established reputation, each of
whom however was lame. When a member of the audience interrupted him and asked
why he was standing against such powerful opponents, he retorted without a
moment’s hesitation by asking, why when lame men were standing he should not
stand having both his legs in tact. He was as conscious of his own abilities as
he was proud of the historical and cultural importance of the <span
class=SpellE>Andhras</span> and of the great cultural heritage and destiny of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, which he
never failed to stress whenever occasion arose. It is also said that his heart
was as large as his head and that he </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was generous to a
fault to his servants and dependents. He had and still has many Boswells, none
of whom however has written his biography. It is gratifying to find that the
State of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Andhra Pradesh</st1:place></st1:State>
which fittingly celebrated his birth centenary is also taking steps to gather
and consolidate all the instructive and interesting incidents about him, of
which no written record has been left to us and entrusted the task of
publishing his biography to Sri <span class=SpellE>Nidadavolu</span> <span
class=SpellE>Venkata</span> Rao. Efforts are also being made to see that his
unpublished works like <span class=SpellE><i>Nataka</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>sarvasvam</span> </i>are traced and preserved, and his works are
published and made accessible to the Andhra public. Such a publication would be
one of the best memorials to the late Sri <span class=SpellE>Mahopadhyaya</span>
<span class=SpellE>Venkataraya</span> <span class=SpellE>Sankhyayana</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sarma</span>, to whom the <span class=SpellE>Andhras</span> owe a
debt of gratitude. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

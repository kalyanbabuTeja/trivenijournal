with no plan at its heart and no point in its evolution. It is described as the

process of Nature is alike indifferent to man’s woe and weal. An empirical
investigation of the process of Nature reveals no moral principle at the back
of its workings. In the words of Hardy: “A blind unheeding hand is guiding us;
it is a blind, unfeeling and unthinking will” and is indifferent alike to human
happiness and human suffering. <sup>l</sup> This force drags the universe at
its heels, furthers some human interests without purpose and thwarts others
without malignity. Bertrand Rus</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

argues that Nature on its mechanical side goes its own way. It cannot be
completely brought to our bearings. Even the evolutionary </span><span

does not exhibit any unmistakable purpose. We see waste on a large scale. T. H.
Huxley in the <i>Romanes Lectures </i>(1893) describes </span><span

cosmic process as a kind of gladiatorial theory of existence “where the
strongest, the most self-assertive tend to tread down the weaker. It demands
ruthless self-assertion and thrusts aside, treading down all competitors.” The
law of existence is the survival of the fittest, not the fitting in of the many
to survive. Thus the naturalist sees an inscrutable, crass causality working in
Nature. It runs to no known or knowable end. So man cannot rely on it for his
guidance in his ethical life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the second law of thermo-dynamics is true or to be trusted, the world will
achieve a condition of eventless stagnation. All energy will be evenly
distributed and the universe will come to a rest in an uniform mass of cosmic
radiation. Such a world-prospect does not evoke or inspire any religious or
moral feeling in us. In the words of C. E. M. </span><span style='font-size:

inhabitant of the world will exhale to the unfriendly sky his last breath and
he will remember nothing about our art, literature, or genius. There is a
definite antithesis between the facts of Nature and the values of man. A few of
the ultra-rationalistic scientists deny the very existence of value and treat
man also as a piece of matter, the only difference being that he is a bit
complicated. Thus they deny God, immortality, soul and its salvation as gross
forms of superstitions to be discarded. The materialists exhort us to bring
Nature part by part under human control.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are a few other scientists who believe that there are values which the mind of
man cherishes and that they are not governed by the laws of nature i.e., matter
and motion. Such values are responsible for civilizations. The values are
Truth, the Good, Beauty, and Utility. They are not super-historical, nor
time-transcending objects. They are manifested here on this earth in the
actions of men. Russell argues that man’s freedom consists in cherishing these
values ere the blow falls. The universe is most often hostile, and the man of
wisdom must not prostrate before its mighty power. “In action, in desire, we
must submit perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in
aspiration we are free from our fellowmen, free from the petty planet on which
our bodies impotently crawl, free even while we live from the tyranny of
death.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
there is the antithesis between Nature and man’s values, and one has nothing to
do with the other. There are a few other scientists who look upon Nature as
unfolding its potentiality slowly through the corridors of time into matter,
life, mind, and in the supermen. They trace these manifestations as due to the <i>elan
vital </i>in nature. Some like Bergson believe in creative evolution and do not
consider that all the evolutes are prefigured in the unmanifest Nature.
Evolution is a creative process, and not a mechanical unfolding of what is
already contained in Nature. There is an immanent teleology. Mechanism in
evolution cannot account for all the process. Yet others speak of an emergent
evolution and describe the process as in travail struggling to produce the
Deity at the end. But one important doctrine common to all the twentieth
century evolutionist philosophers is that they find Nature a self-sufficient
cause for the creation. They believe in the autonomy of Nature. They do not go
beyond the historical present. They equate Reality with what is perceived by
the senses and grasped by reason. They confine the real to the Space-Time
frame. Some of our contemporary scientific philosophers derive all that is from
Space-Time and Nature. They explain and interpret the natural process of the
universe by its own principles. They do not seek it elsewhere. They assert the
independence of Nature and do not go beyond it. They think historically and not
transcendentally. They identify the ultimate with what happens in time and in
space. They do not recognize the eternal or the timeless. They know progress
which is in time and not perfection which is timeless and super-historical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Gita-idea of Nature (Prakriti) is not in agreement with any of the descriptions
of the evolutionist philosophers. Nature is the material matrix from which the
things of the world emerge due to the Lord’s creative power. Prakriti is not
antithetical to man. It is not malignant and wicked to man. It is not
indifferent to human woe and happiness. It is not neutral and pointless in its
process. It is not chaotic and independent of all laws. There is a definite law
governing the process of Nature “from the movements of atoms to the happenings
in History.” Nature is not dreadful nor is it self-sufficient. Its workings
cannot be fully accounted for from its own principles. It is not autonomous and
self-sufficient. It has a design, a purpose, a teleology, a law governing it.
Man and Nature do not work at cross purposes, they are complimentary when the
measure of co-operation is known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Gita-idea of Prakriti is very close to the description of the same in the
Sankhyan system of Philosophy, the one great difference being that Prakriti in
the Gita is not an independent principle as in the Sankhyan system. The
origination of the world is attributed by the Sankhyans to the spontaneous
evolution of Prakriti. In the Gita Prakriti and the Lord together are
responsible for the origination of the universe. Nonsentient Prakriti by itself
has no power, nor does the Lord create the world out of nothing. Prakriti is
the material cause (Upadana Karana) and the Lord is the instrumental cause
(Nimitta Karana). But there is nothing in the world which is not of the nature
of Prakriti. There is nothing in heaven or earth, among the Gods or men that
has not Prakriti as its constitutive stuff.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:

great Sankara posits Brahman as the chief philosophical category and the only
one which cannot be adequately described in terms of any attribute, because
there is nothing besides it. All description is relational and mediate. So we
require for it at least three terms, the two terms correlated and a relation.
As there is nothing besides Brahman in terms of which it can be described, it
is said to be indeterminate. In fact, but for Brahman, we have no basis for
existence or sustenance. Sankara holds the view that Brahman when confronted
with activity and creation is Isvara or God. That is, when Brahman is
conditioned by Prakriti he becomes the God of religion. He takes hold of
Prakriti and harnesses it to the purpose of creation. The Prakriti of the Gita
has two aspects. Prakriti as characterising and conditioning Brahman which
activates it is called Para (Higher Prakriti). This has no taint and does not
bind Him. It is made of Suddha Sattva. Theists hold the view that the physical
frame of the Lord in his avatars is made of Suddha Sattva. The Lord repeatedly
tells us that the activities of Prakriti do </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not affect Him at all.
Prakriti is dependent on Him. He is independent of it. He bears them and is not
in them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
let us see what is the character and nature of the Lower Prakriti with which
the Lord creates the universe. It is a complex entity of three Gunas: Sattva,
Rajas and Tamas. In the fourteenth chapter we have an elaborate description of
the nature of these three constitutive elements of Prakriti and their
functions. The centre of our consciousness, the divine in us, the spirit in man
is impaired, overlaid and confused with thick layers of unreality by the
binding power of Prakriti. Prakriti is responsible for bondage and the separatist
feelings in us. All activity is the result of the association of Prakriti. It
is Prakriti that prompts men to God-eclipsing activities. He needs to liberate
himself from the chains of Prakriti. Prakriti Sambandha (getting related to
Prakriti) is Samsara. The first of the three elements, Sattva, is shining by
its pure light. It makes us long for happiness and knowledge. It enslaves the
happy. When it is predominant the senses are clear and they are in a concert
pitch, perfect for their respective functions. It is mostly divine. Rajas is
the passionate in man. It thirsts after pleasures and possession and hungers
for action. It is responsible for greed and restlessness and a never-ending
chain of unregenerate activities. It is never still and ever agitates our minds
and muscles. When Rajas predominates we have the man of action without vision
and religious faith. Tamas is responsible for ignorance, sluggishness, stupor,
and dullness. It bewilders men and keeps them in perpetual delusion. Men go
dark and feel stupid when Tamas predominates. Every action is the work of the
Gunas. The individual soul identifies himself through delusion with the
workings of Prakriti and so he experiences anguishes and thrills. As long as
the delusion is there, man is bound to think that he acts and not Prakriti. But
with the onset of the recollection it is Prakriti that acts, there is an end of
the delusion. Lord Krishna, through his Gospel, helped Arjuna to regain his
lost memory of the Great Truth. The Lord is the directive force of the
Prakriti. It obeys His behests. It is moral and law-abiding. The world is not
amoral and a chance-universe nor is it the evolution of an unthinking matter
without any agent. It is a purposive process and its workings are informed by
the laws and purposes of God. It is perfectly Pre-established–the course of the
stars and the sun: the flash of the lightning and every detail–as to sustain
moral values and help the spiritual aspirant to attain it. Nature is not
unfriendly to man nor is the universe hostile in spiritual aims. The Lord
prescribes the moral and physical laws of the universe. So the world is a
valley, in the Keatsean phrase, “for the art of soul-making.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

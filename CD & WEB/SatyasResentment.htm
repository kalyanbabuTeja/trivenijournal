<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like a fierce trodden she-serpent or a fiery tongue of flame Satya arose; the flush of ruby-flare in her eyes flooded her cheeks with the crimson light of Kumkum, and in a voice injured and tremulous, she said:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Was such the advent of that sage who feeds on strife? And was such indeed his talk? And did he, the lord of the Gopis, lend a willing ear? And what proud words spoke Rukmini? O, lotus-faced maiden, tell me the whole truth at once and hesitate not the least.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Be it that Narada made a friendly present of that flower to Achyutha, proudly avowing the peerless excellence of the gift; and be it that he in his turn offered it where his love did rest: but, tell me what right had that artful sage of the gods to bring in my name on that spot?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To speak full many words that prick like thorns may be the very nature of that world-trotting sage, to whom discord is merriment. But should not my lord then have prevented such talk?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;And yet, and yet, the fault is not the sage's. Why, pray, should Rukmini so accept the gift? And what must I think of the conduct of that graceless cow-herd? Will not the heart break when one's husband, dear as one's own life, behaves this wise?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Uncritical about their own ways, these men still tell us that we women cannot be trusted. But, in truth, is it not men that are fickle-minded even as the fleeting clouds of <I>Sarat? </I>How can we trust them, then, my friend?–tell me how can we?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Woven into the very texture of my life with meshes of pure affection, living with me in desires ever insatiate, loving me and blending with me in pleasures ever so guileless, could he, my lord, have acted thus? But, ah! it maybe that, caught in the jealous charms of that Rukmini, he has forgotten me and my love!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To every wife, her lord is the life of her life, her protector, her God–but, when even he chooses to be ungracious, O, tell me, what prop is then left to the devoted ones? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The taking back of riches once given can be borne without pain. But, O my maiden, when love is once offered by the lord–and then withheld, what charm has life for me?–&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus wailing and weary, and full of jealousy and wrath, Satya, lovely as the creeping vine, rushed into the &quot;Chamber of Resentment&quot; like unto a <I>Naga </I>maiden passing into her grotto in a <I>Harichandan </I>trunk.</P>

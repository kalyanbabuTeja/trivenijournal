of the major economic consequences of the present War is the change in the
position of India in the field of international finance. She has long been a
debtor country and the foreign debt of the Government of India was over Rs. 400
crores before the present War, and every year she had to pay about £30,000,000
to Britain in addition to what the British investors in private enterprises in
India were earning in the way of profits. During the present War, the
Government has been able to liquidate most of the foreign liabilities and the
Reserve Bank of India has accumulated sterling assets worth about Rs. 1,200
crores. Before discussing the question of the utilisation of these assets, it
is necessary to describe their origin with a view to remove some doubts
entertained by some British publicists regarding the legitimacy of the claims
of India in this respect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Commodity exports. </i>Since the outbreak of the War, India has lost many of
her foreign markets for goods but her trade with Britain and the Empire
countries has shown a considerable export surplus. Britain has been obliged to
devote most of her resources to the production of war materials and,
consequently, her capacity to export goods abroad has diminished. She requires,
on the other hand, some essential commodities from India for which she could
not pay in kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the value of the exports on private account only. In addition to these, the
Government of India, through its Supply Department, has been placing orders for
essential materials required by the British Government in the Indian markets
and the Indian Government has been providing, in the first instance, the rupee
finance required for this purpose. The British Government pays for these
commodities in sterling in London, and as the Government of India requires
rupees for further purchases, the sterling thus acquired is transferred to the
Reserve Bank and rupees are obtained in return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is offered in amounts of not less than £ 10,000 at a time. If the amount of
sterling so purchased is not considerable, payment can be made from the Banking
Department. This causes a change in the assets held by that Department,
sterling being substituted for rupees. But the amount of sterling that can be
so acquired is limited. The Banking Department should have sufficient Indian
currency to meet the withdrawals of its depositors, and it is not desirable to
keep more sterling than what is required by those who have payments to make
abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the sterling purchased is in excess of what can be taken by the Banking
Department, the Issue Department of the Bank comes to its aid. The Reserve Bank
Act has laid down that at least forty per cent of the assets of the Issue
Department should be in the form of gold or sterling securities and that the
amount of gold should not be less than forty crores in value. The Bank is
therefore permitted to issue notes without limit with sterling. securities as

Banking Department increased from an average of about 4 crores to about 300
crores. In recent months the expansion of currency has been taking place at a
slower pace than during the last two years because the Allied Governments are

claim of India for the sterling assets so accumulated has been questioned in
some quarter on the ground that they are the result of India’s inadequate
contribution to the common war effort. Where the gain from an action cannot be
estimated in terms of money and the interests of the co-operating parties
cannot be separated, there is no other equitable basis for the distribution of
the burden except that of ability to pay. This is the accepted principle in the
matter of internal taxation and this principle has been accepted in connection

areas devastated by the War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ability of a country to pay for a war depends mainly on two factors, <i>viz., </i>the
extent to which its production can be increased and the difference between<i> </i>its
peace-time income and the amount necessary for satisfying the minimum customary
needs of the people. To these another circumstance might be added, <i>viz., </i>the
efficacy of taxation and loans for transferring surplus resources from the
civilian to the war use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

productive power of Britain increased considerably during the War and so part
of her War expenditure is met by increased production. Due to the backwardness
of India with regard to industrial development, she has to depend on foreign
countries for the supply of some essentials. Till 1,942 her industrial
production showed some increase, but since that year some of the major
industries have been producing less because of the difficulty of obtaining
certain essential products. When the War has reached her borders and when,
therefore, she has to make her maximum effort, India’s productive capacity has
diminished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the lowest paid working class family does not suffer from want except in cases

expenditure<i> </i>might<i> </i>be nearly 400 crores. It has been calculated
that the purchases made on behalf of the United<i> </i>Nations, for which<i> </i>we

value of about 300 crores per year. To these two figures we have to add the

money income of British<i> </i>India is about Rs. 3,500 crores. India<i> </i>is<i>
</i>therefore devoting<i> </i>about 20% of her national income<i> </i>to war
purposes, assuming that most of the contribution<i> </i>is<i> </i>made by
British India. The sacrifice of the Indians who have to forego one-fifth of
their<i> </i>peace-time enjoyment is<i> </i>greater than the sacrifice of the Englishmen
who have given up three-fifths of their five-fold income. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

burden on some sections of the people has been made heavier by the methods
adopted for transferring real income from the civilian to war purposes. Loans
and tax have not yielded the required amount and so the instrument of inflation
has been resorted to. This has hit some important sections of the community
very hard and the consequences are too well-known to require special mention.
It is said that in Britain health conditions have improved during the War and
the mortality rate has fallen. The common people might not have such a variety
of food stuffs as in peace-time, but they have a sufficient quantity of
wholesome food. The statistics relating to public health and famines in India reveal
quite a different picture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the accumulation of these sterling assets involved great suffering which has
taken the form of malnutrition, deterioration of sanitary conditions and even
actual starvation in some parts, it is but natural to suggest that they might
be utilised to relieve the suffering immediately. Several Indian public men and
economists are stressing the need for inducing Britain to release these assets
immediately, so that goods may be purchased with them and imported into India.
If consumers’ goods are imported the price level might fall immediately, and if
producers’ goods are got, production in India might increase. It may take time
to effect a decrease in prices but it would be more advantageous from a
long-term point of view. A similar result might be obtained if Britain and
other Allied countries are asked to pay in kind for the commodities which they
buy from now onwards. This will decrease the growth of sterling assets and
further expansion of currency would not be necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are not those that are most urgently required by the common people of India, <i>viz.,

give preference to the development of basic industries, we might have to draw
upon foreign countries for some consumers’ goods till our industries are in a
position to produce those goods in required quantities. The increased

factors of production, which<i> </i>would increase the demand for consumers

it is the schemes for<i> </i>raising living standards in India that will make a
heavy demand on the foreign balances of India. The problem of abolishing want
has become prominent since Roosevelt made his pronouncement on the Four
Freedoms. In countries in which production has reached such a level as to
provide the required necessaries for all people, the question one of fairer
distribution of income and of guaranteeing a minimum income during non-earning
periods. In countries like India where the total national income is not
sufficient to provide even the bare necessaries, the question is one of
increased production and better distribution. Industrialisation is considered
to be the primary objective of future economic policy, and if any comprehensive
scheme for this purpose is adopted, India would have to import equipment in
large quantities from foreign countries. An idea of the magnitude of the
requirements may be obtained from the Bombay Plan which requires external
finance to the extent of Rs. 2,600 crores of which a little less than half is
covered by the present sterling assets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

speaking, it is not necessary to earmark the finance obtained from a particular
source for a particular purpose. The total finance may be apportioned according
to the importance of the demand, irrespective of the source from which money is
obtained. In this matter it is however necessary to take two points into

type of bills becomes general. The question to be considered therefore is
whether the mechanism by which the purchases of foreign capital or consumption
goods by private individuals or corporations are financed, would automatically
substitute rupee securities when the sterling securities are withdrawn and

Government issues its pronotes and borrows from the Reserve Bank, and spends
the amount thus obtained. The Bank will have an eligible cover and the currency
will get back into circulation. If the new industries to be started are

is tenable only in so far as those works are concerned which require large
external finance. Unless it undertakes works which require mainly Indian

building of an export surplus is very important and this may be done either by
raising loans abroad or discharging past obligations. The existence of foreign
obligations acts as a stimulus to business activity and Britain will be able to
maintain full employment successfully so long as these foreign obligations

is another point which is of importance in this connection. India and Britain
can come to a mutually advantageous agreement with regard to the settlement of
this question if Britain is in a position to supply goods required by India at
competitive prices. If any scheme for rapid industrialisation is put into
operation, this country would have to get commodities by exploiting all the
available sources of external finance within a period of 10 to 15 years. The demand
for goods in the early years will be specially heavy, and in these years,
Britain may have to devote all her resources to the reconstruction of the
devastated areas. Further, an agreement like this will restrict the choice of
the Indian producers and consumers and it may retard the growth of multilateral
trade, the establishment of which is desired by most countries. It may
therefore be necessary to convert a part of the sterling into other currencies

avoided. The decision of the Conference is therefore not accord with one of the
major objectives of the Fund.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

things stand at present, the question of the liquidation of the sterling assets
of India is to be decided by negotiation between India and Britain. Britain
would naturally press for the acceptance of goods spread over a large number of
years, while the interest of India requires the conversion of at least a part
of the balance into other currencies. As Britain is<i> </i>indebted in a
similar way to several other countries, it is not possible for her to concede
this to all her creditors but it should be emphasised that the case of India is
a special one. Accumulation of sterling assets by countries like Australia and
Canada did not involve so much suffering as in the case of India. The
accumulated balances do not represent the voluntary savings of the Indian
people and they are due to the encroachment on the consumption of the people
which is already low. The only way in which this could be made good is by
helping India to have an economic organisation that would ensure adequate
living standards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has been suggested that India could borrow through the International Capital
Bank an amount equivalent to the sterling assets and this loan might be
guaranteed by both India and Britain. There are certain objections to this
proposal. Both India and Britain would have to borrow heavily after the War for
reconstruction purposes. There is already a plan under consideration for the
grant of a big dollar loan by the U. S. A. to Britain. India needs external
help in addition to the sterling assets if the efficiency of her economic
system is to be raised. It is to be considered whether the Capital Bank would
be prepared to arrange such large loans to the two countries. Further, the
sterling assets of India are in the form of short-term paper which carries a
low rate of interest. The long-term loans to be raised would carry a higher
rate. It is not advantageous to India to take a loan at higher rate of interest
on the security of assets which carry a lower rate. The transaction would be
advantageous only if Britain would undertake the repayment of the loan with
interest to the Capital Bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

problem could be solved only with the co-operation of the U. S. A. Her
productive power has enormously increased during the War, and if she follows a
policy of full employment, she has to maintain an export surplus till the
consumption of her people rises to a much higher level than at present. After
the War she will be the only country, besides Britain, which can supply the
goods which India wants. If she grants a big loan for the industrial
development of India, goods which are more urgently required might be purchased
from her and those that could be spread over time might be taken from Britain
in exchange for the sterling assets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru’s writings are like milestones in his life and a study of the writer,

is often referred to as the worthy son of a worthy father. <span class=SpellE>Motilal</span>
Nehru was a man of a colossal mould. He was a leading lawyer who grew into a
statesman, and the influence of the father’s personality, as Jawaharlal himself
acknowledges more than once, was deep on his life. After a brilliant academic
career at Harrow and <st1:City w:st="on">Cambridge</st1:City>, he returned to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City> and was soon
drawn to politics. It was a time of ferment. The Home Rule agitation, led by Annie
<span class=SpellE>Besant</span>, was then in full swing. Soon afterwards,
Gandhi appeared on the scene and uttered his Mantra of non-violent civil
disobedience, which resulted in a national reawakening. Gandhi was the man who
discovered the hero that was to discover <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and Gandhi, as well as his
father, <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> the mind of Jawaharlal and gave his
life a <span class=GramE>definite</span> direction. The impress of Marx and
Lenin too was there and the result of all these influences was, by the middle
twenties, Jawaharlal as a national leader. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was by no means a bed of roses to be a leader in those times. One had to lead a
life of physical hardship and make the prison one’s home for long years. But,
even this seemed a blessing in disguise, which we owe to the British. Tilak and
Gandhi, <span class=SpellE>Azad</span> and Jawaharlal, turned their
incarceration to advantage and achieved creative activity. Prison-life, Nehru
himself says, brings both leisure and a measure of detachment; it was from the
prison that the <i>Letters from a Father to a Daughter </i>and <i>Glimpses of
World History </i>were both written as a series of letters addressed to the
growing child, <span class=SpellE>Indira</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“I
do not claim to be a historian,” says Jawaharlal in the preface to the <i>Glimpses,
</i>and adds, “There <span class=GramE>is</span> an unfortunate mixture of
elementary writing for the young and a discussion at times </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
the ideas of grown-ups. There <span class=GramE>are,</span> numerous
repetitions. Indeed, of the faults that these letters contain there is no end.”
The </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>estimate is, of course, due to modesty and the <i>Glimpses
of World History </i>makes interesting reading. The letters take the place of
personal talk and are intended to give the growing child, <span class=SpellE>Indira</span>,
a panoramic view of the main events in world’s history. History should be a
spurt of thought and action in the present. The purpose of the letters was to
give the young mind of <span class=SpellE>Indira</span> the right perspective
and too impress on her the lessons of history. She was, besides, to grow into a
zealous participant in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s
struggle for freedom, as he says, “Good-bye, little one, and <span class=GramE>may</span>
you grow up into a brave soldier in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s service!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is also the feeling of separation from his near and <span class=GramE>dear,</span>
expressing itself here and there, but never is there a vestige of despair. He
says in the very second letter: “Meanwhile, you sit in Anand <span
class=SpellE>Bhawan</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Mummie</span> sits in
Malacca <span class=SpellE>Gaol</span>, and I here in <span class=SpellE>Naini</span>
Prison-and we miss each other sometimes, rather badly, do we not? But think of
the-day when we shall all three meet again!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the personal tone is maintained through out the letters. His own hopes and
regrets are mingled with the ups and downs of empires. The history of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
narrated from the very ancient times, with the history of other nations
concurrently running along side. All the main events in the world’s history
find their place–right from the decline and fall of the ancient Roman
civilisation to the rise and growth of modern Marxism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Great
events of history are ably summarized in a few sentences. Thus, referring to
the forces of the French Revolution, Jawaharlal says: “King Louis was gone. <span
class=GramE>But even before his death <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> had under gone an amazing
change.</span> The blood of her people was afire with the fever of revolution;
their veins tingled and a flaming enthusiasm took possession of them.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
completing the survey of world’s history, he points out briefly the difference
between the values of the old world and the world today. “Our age is a
different one; it is an age of disillusion, of doubt and uncertainty and
questioning. As in the days of Socrates, we live in an age of questioning, but
that questioning is not confined to a city of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Athens</st1:place></st1:City>; it is world-wide.” One might feel
unhappy and even desperate, but that is no solution. The only remedy is that
people should cherish high ideals and act accordingly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Criticism
is <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> sometimes that the <i>Glimpses </i>is
rather superficial, as it was addressed to a young girl. It may also be added
it is even dull in parts and there is frequent repetition. Sometimes, the
continuity is broken. Yet,<i> </i>it is its tone of intimacy and naturalness,
its freedom from dogma and theory that makes the <i>Glimpses of World History </i>a
better history than history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Quit India Movement found Jawaharlal again in the <span class=SpellE>gaol</span>
and it was during this period of incarceration that he wrote the <i>Discovery
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Discovery of India </i>also is not historical in the strict sense; nor is
it a romantic picture of the past. Jawaharlal very much likes to live in the
present, but he knows that the present has its roots in the past, while the
future is going to be the present of today’s past. As Eliot says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
such an understanding of the past, Nehru must have found the current writings
of history inadequate. Our history books follow a conventional pattern, and are
loaded with names and dates of events, and with catalogues of dynasties in
their rise and fall and lists of battles won and lost. They do not go beyond
the level of facts; they are merely informative and lack the real sense of
history. Nehru’s book, therefore, is an attempt to supply this need of a
history which can discover the soul of India, as it were,–her art, music and
literature, her achievements in science and philosophy and in industry and
commerce–and <span class=SpellE>analyse</span> the causes of her greatness and
vitality and the remarkable survival value of her cultural tradition, and
finally diagnose the malady that has entered her body-politic in recent years. <i>The
Discovery of India </i>is, in fine, an exploration of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in all
her aspects and an expression of her true spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> was in my blood and there was much in her
that instinctively thrilled me,” says Nehru, and there could be no more
authentic testimony to his eligibility to write on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The spirit of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> ran in
his heart and along the blood. That does not mean, however, that he had any
bias. He is always at a distance, distance enough to give him a distinct and
dispassionate vision, as he says: “I tried to identify myself for a while with
this unending procession, at the tail end of which I too was struggling. And
then, I would separate myself and as from a hill-top, apart, look down at the
valley below.” A sense of belonging and a sense of detachment are thus
reconciled, and he is like a water drop on a lotus leaf. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the people, exchanged pulses with them and observed the spirit of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
manifesting itself in every inch of the land; He could pierce through the
appearance of variety and separateness and see at the bottom unity and oneness.
“The unity of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,”
he says, “was no longer merely an intellectual conception for me: it was an
emotional experience which overpowered me.” He is aware that it is neither
politics nor elections that can help build the house of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
future–strong and beautiful–but an insight into the past and a digging deep for
the foundations so that we might be correctly guided in our thought and action.
It is this candid and courageous search for truth that is consistently evident
in his writings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a scientific outlook, he dismisses the division of Indian history into Hindu or
Vedic India, Moslem India and <st1:place w:st="on">British India</st1:place>.
There was, and is, only one thing, and that is <span class=SpellE>divisionless</span>
India–India that is one. He says, with a similar conviction, that the great
inventions in Mathematics in ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> were not the momentary
illumination of an erratic genius much ahead of his time. They must have been,
according to him, an answer to a social need. Likewise, he refuses to accept
that any loss of <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> sustained by either Indian
philosophy or Indian literature at any time was due to foreign invasion and
occupation. According to Nehru, the causes must have been more mental than
environmental and he says that there must have been a loss of <span
class=SpellE>vigour</span> and a kind of deterioration within, which was
inevitably reflected in the philosophy or literature of that time. A similar
objectivity is evident when he refuses to consider the Holy Scriptures of the
Hindus as God-made (<span class=SpellE>Apaurusheyas</span>). The best way of
looking at them, he says, is as an expression of the magnificent mind of man.
Although he pays sincere homage to the Vedas, he is not blind to the defect of

regards the Upanishads, Nehru’s praise is understandably high and yet sincere.
They are, he says, the greatest work ever created by man, and the wisdom and
analysis, the courage and clarity, so consistently present in them in every
word, are things unique. The all-embracing approach in them–an approach which
casts off all differences of caste and creed and treats the whole of humanity
as one, thus achieving a kind of philosophical democracy–is effectively contrasted
with the individualism of the social outlook. It was the message of Buddha that
offered a solution to these problems of caste and social individualism. All
castes are one, according to Buddhism. Love must be loved and hatred must be
hated. Discipline of the self is necessary. The society should gain precedence
over the individual. These are the main tenets of Buddhism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is forthright in condemning the narrow exclusiveness of the Indians in the
past. He says: “The Indians remained aloof, wrapped up in their own conceits,
and keeping as far as possible within their own shells.” They did not properly
and promptly respond to the intellectual and cultural influences of the
foreigners who came into contact with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

were in great ferment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <i>Discovery of India, </i>we get besides, perfect word-pictures of
personages whom Nehru was eminently qualified to describe. The life and
teachings of Buddha had a deep influence on Nehru, and he believed that
Buddhism offered a solution to the problems of life that would be acceptable
and applicable to all. Consider the lines describing Buddha, “…seated on the
lotus flower, calm and impassive, above passion and desire, beyond the storm
and strife of this world….<span class=GramE>”.</span> We almost see the Enlightened
One before our eyes. Yet another value of the <i>Discovery of India </i>is in
the objective account it gives of the Indian National Movement. The account is
full and Nehru does not spare even himself when it comes to a question of
criticism. There has not been a nobler, a purer and a better account of the
epic struggle of India in her march to freedom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

prose is admirably suited to all these diverse purposes. He writes with
sincerity and spontaneity, and the words have an <span class=SpellE>Auroreal</span>
freshness. The tone is one of intimacy and the effect is always powerful.
Pungency and pleasantness alike freely flow from the facile pen, and he can <span

all, a human being to the full. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

apostle of a message for the future. He is thoughtful and critical, and
believes in action–action that is selfless and dynamic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the <i>Glimpses </i>and the <i>Discovery </i>alike, Nehru presents history
in its sense and essence–history whose knowledge should influence human action
and promote human happiness. He does not impose any system or pattern on
events. He writes as a sensitive spectator of the varying scenes of life. He is
no defender of any faith, and has no predilections or prejudices. Nehru’s
historical works, therefore, are not merely a record of facts, but an interpretation
of their essential meaning–an interpretation that is constructive and that can
mould and modify human action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dr. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span> says, is the memory which a nation
possesses and is the cause of the nation’s persistent identity. Nehru’s works
of history, more in the nature of recapitulation from memory than of narration
of fact, link the past and the present, and bring out the continuity of the
ages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

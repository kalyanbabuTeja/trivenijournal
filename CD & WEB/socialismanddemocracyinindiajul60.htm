may resolve the stubborn contradiction between socialism and democracy, which
in other countries has remained unsolved. The contradiction seems to be real.
It is usual to discuss men and measures, they are important, but it is more
important not to miss the broad pattern of the social and economic revolution. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s crisis
is one of production, and the processes of socialist transformation have to be
related to it. Planned development, with the tremendous urges and needs of an
under-developed country, is an effort to meet the production crisis. The ends
are important, though it is good to emphasize the means. It is usual to think
of Indian democracy as a peaceful, if not wholly non-violent, process. If
Indian democracy cannot answer the needs of the people, it will <span
class=GramE>fail,</span> whatever changes the Constitution might undergo in
letter and in spirit. Those who do not accept socialism in any sense stress the
importance of preserving the forms of democracy at any cost, and there are
those who have doubts if socialism can be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>achieved through
democratic means. For a clear discussion of these attitudes, definition of
democracy and of socialism is essential. The </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>process embodied
in the Constitution, including the amending process contains the essence of
democracy; and socialism, which is outline in the Directive Principles of the
Constitution, adumbrated in the Second Plan, and projected in the Third Plan
and in the programmes of the parties pledged to socialism, is, broadly, the
collective organization and effort of the community, in the interest of the
mass of the people, for common ownership and control of the means of production
and exchange. Apart from the ideological method in the madness of parties of
socialism, and apart from the doctrines ranging from democratic socialism to
communism, it is only in practice, and from time to time, that terms like
‘democracy’ and ‘socialism’ can be annotated. To those who want to match means
and ends (and not merely want to go back to Adam Smith and confuse free markets
with freedom) the essence of the problems of democracy and socialism is how to
reconcile the democratic process with the socialist process. It has been the
central theme of doctrinal disputations and cleavages in the socialist movement
everywhere. It is so at present too, and the resulting </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>controversies
over democratic means and socialist ends have led to lack of clear
understanding about where we are going and whether we are going in the right
direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

happy, if cranky, existence of so many Indian socialists does not mean that
there can necessarily be something called Indian socialism, <span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span>
in concept and Gandhian in its ethics. The only socialism which has inspired
hope and fear in people is scientific socialism which began with Marx and soon
became international in inspiration and scope. In a big country, tradition is
bound to have an impact on the internationalism to which people like Trotsky
clung fatalistically. The absolutism of the <span class=SpellE>Romanoffs</span>
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could not be discarded like a winter cloak. The Czars fought for security from
the Baltic to the <st1:place w:st="on">Black Sea</st1:place>–and so did Stalin!
The <span class=SpellE>Manchus</span> and Confucius are deeply embedded in the
fatherhood of Mao <span class=SpellE>Tse-tung</span>. Even in smaller
countries, history has its hang-<span class=SpellE>overs</span>, though
Rumanian communism or Albanian communism has the character of a carbon copy.
The communists have had the advantage of a base in the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place>, and this has emphasized the fearful aspects of communism and
its conflict with socialism. Even the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>
has been changing under the impact of its economy and under the pressure of
international development, but communism does not change. The association of
socialism and communism is still as popular among conservatives as the
divergences between them are among communists and socialists. The differences
which have developed suggest that they are differences only over tactics, but
it cannot be forgotten that only communist parties have been able to bring about
socialist transformation, and not socialist parties. There have been other
important differences. The socialists have grown to value democracy, while the
communists, with Leninism for guidance and the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place> as their base, have believed in a rigid application of the
doctrines of the dictatorship of the proletariat and democratic centralism. As
the means influence ends, socialism has become different from communism. The
ideas are simple, but the ideologies have become complex. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> Narayan and others, who were known to be
socialists, have gone back to Utopian socialism, to <span class=SpellE>Proudhon</span>,
Saint-Simon, Owen, <span class=SpellE>Kropotkin</span>, and others, with their
emphasis on local organization and their fear of the State, though it is not
fashionable to claim to be Utopian Socialists. A vast country like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, with a
long tradition, cannot be imitative even in its socialism, and follow what some
<span class=SpellE>Cominform</span> decides. The task of socialist leadership
is to face the facts, interpret economic and social forces correctly, and guide
them. Schisms will wither away, and the unity of the socialist forces will
become real, if it is understood that power ultimately lies with the people.
The lesson which communism has taught to the world is that the democratic
process is worth preserving wherever it is possible, for democratic socialism,
which has become a contradiction in term in communist countries, has little
hope to offer and spare, if it ceases to be socialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Soviet Union which, as the first country to make a large-scale experiment in
socialism, has been a subject of study for all socialists for years, and has
had a great influence on several countries, has stuck to dictatorship of the
proletariat and to democratic centralism. The Communist Party works as the
agent of the proletariat, and has great achievements to its credit. The <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>, though it has a full constitutional
apparatus, has been a one-party regime, and has not yet been able to outlive
fully the violence of the Russian Revolution. It is recognized that dictatorship
of the proletariat has meant dictatorship of the party, with its social
composition changing from time to time, and, in essence, it has been
dictatorship of the Central Committee. In democratic centralism, the minority
has the right to dissent, though it must accept the decisions of the majority.
This right to dissent has been shown to be subject to several limitations. If
it becomes inconvenient to the majority, it can be denounced as anti-party
activity; and purges follow. It does not matter how far these purges have
become non-violent after de-Stalinization. There is no right for a minority to
form another party, and, as long as the one-party regime lasts, the <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> will have to be prepared for tendencies
towards Trotskyism or Stalinism. The point of interest, to students of
democracy and socialism, is that, white the Soviet Union has achieved great
economic progress, and safeguarded the interests of the working class, it has
not been able to free its social and economic processes from the tight control
of party preventing the emergence of new classes, or to assure the withering
away of the State in the <span class=SpellE>forseeable</span> future. In other
words, it cannot be said that, in the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>,
the democratic process and the socialist process have been reconciled, even if
democracy is not interpreted narrowly to mean the systems which prevail in the
West. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Yugoslav Communist Party, on the other hand, claims to be making a determined
effort to invest its socialism with full social content, in conformity with the
original aims of Marxism-Leninism. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

one-party regime, and the party is active. <span class=GramE>The organization,

democratic base for the productive process and socialist transformation, seems
to be an earnest attempt, and deserves sympathetic study.</span> There is a

follow the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, learning from experience. It has also
tried to learn from Soviet mistakes. These differences are as fundamental as
the differences over the relations between communist countries. The Yugoslav
party refuses to accept <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>’s
hegemony, and it is unfortunate that Soviet and Chinese criticism of the
Yugoslav stand has been concentrated on this aspect rather than on the more
important aspect of the internal application of Marxism-Leninism. To the
Yugoslav party, the uprising in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hungary</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was caused by the lack of social and democratic content in the Hungarian regime
which, under <span class=SpellE>Rakosi</span>, had become rigid, formal,
bureaucratic party control. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
these recent controversies in communist countries and the changes in the
economic policies and economic administration in the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place>, which had been wrongly supposed to be unchanging, it is
clear that socialism has as many problems as capitalism. Indian experience has
emphasized the lesson that the public sector has as many problems as the
private sector. This has impressed on all who are keen on socialist
transformation that humility is not only good in <span class=GramE>itself</span>
but is necessary for the social and economic progress of a country like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. There
are fewer illusions even among students of Marxism after what has happened in
recent years in the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>, and the
number of people with first-hand acquaintance with communist regimes is
increasing. Whatever inspiration they might receive from the improvement of
living conditions in communist countries, they cannot forget the Indian
context. They could at best be impatient, but they cannot ignore problems, and
an important problem is how to ensure the democratic process while ensuring the
socialist process, and how to make them one. It does not mean that, as some
say, capitalism is dead, and that there are no capitalists now, because of the
impact of State action in almost every field. It is known that all forms of public
enterprise and State activity have been vulnerable to the insidious influence
of private enterprise or of big business. Even if it is assumed that capitalism
in the old sense does not prevail, as it is claimed that in the United States
it does not prevail because of the increasing amount of federal control and
regulation, it does not mean that socialism has arrived or that we are all
socialists now. Nor is it certain that the present Indian economy carries the
assurance of developing into a socialist economy. In the Second Plan, however,
sound principles were laid down, and there is a framework of strategic
controls, which, if they are maintained firmly, can allow sufficient scope for
private enterprise to play its part, with legitimate incentives, as in
Communist China. It is, however, a stable economy that can impart stability to
the State, not the reflection of social temper in Parliament or declarations of
government policy. The State has to achieve confidence and dominance </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sufficient
to ensure socialism, and the disparate aims and character of the parties of
socialism have not been a helpful factor. From any point of view, it is
essential for the parties of socialism to realize that socialism is a troubled
process which should be made as smooth and painless as possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Democracy
and socialism have to be expressed in constitutional forms. If the people are
convinced that democracy is compatible with economic improvement, they will
never give up democracy. In Asia, as in the West, there has been some preoccupation
with the externals of democratic institutions. In Asian country after Asian
country, it has been shown that freedom from want is more urgent and important
than freedom of expression, and that the mere scaffolding of democratic
institutions is not enough. Naturally, the Asian peoples, somewhat perplexed
and distracted, are taking a long time to decide the form of democratic
structure which could be put into this scaffolding. The <span class=SpellE>patronising</span>
Western presumption that Asian peoples deserve some form of paternal
authoritarianism is silly. It is said that Asian people find it easier to
understand a political system from which a recognizable leader who personifies
authority can emerge than one in which the sovereignty vests in a vague mass.
Yet the critical and opposition spirit is in evidence everywhere in the region,
and many who love Nehru or U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span> do not necessarily
love the Nehru Government or the U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span> Government.
There has been an opposition tradition, strong and persistent, in several
countries; and the elaborate attempt to build up consciously, an opposition
like that of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party seems largely
superfluous. Personal domination of a leader is not non-existent in Western
democracies. The charge of Cabinet dictatorship is familiar in Britain, while
in other countries dictatorship is naked and personal. The effective leader in
the parliamentary system is sensitive to public opinion and has a sense of
responsibility, never caring to enforce obedience or conformity. In British
experience there have been examples of the unchallenged supremacy of one man,
like Churchill’s dominance in the last war, but he never discarded the working
of Parliament. U <span class=SpellE>Nu’s</span> re-emergence confirms that the
dominance of a single powerful personality might essentially be a response to
human, political, social, and even religious urges, common not only to the
democracies but to other forms of society. Each country in the region will,
without discarding the essence of democratic working, need time to evolve a
form of government which will solve its problems best and answer its urgent
needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

given it a socialist bias. Some of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Articles of the
Constitution, particularly the Article on compensation, have been amended to
soften property rights. Parliament, which has so far shown itself capable of
reflecting the people’s temper, may find the Constitution elastic enough to
push through more measures for extended public ownership and other forms of
social and economic reconstruction. It is not possible to deal here with the
various aspects of parliamentary democracy, the party system, the working of
Parliament and its committees, parliamentary procedure, the relations between
Parliament and the executive, the cabinet structure, and so on: for it is a
large theme. To make the democratic process real, Parliament has to be
vigilant, and must guard particularly against the “new despotism” of
departmentalism, which might seem inevitable in the growing mass of legislation
but should not go beyond certain limits. Below Parliament are State
Legislatures, with similar features and not very different problems.
Uncertainty prevails about the structure below the State level. The
Constitution allows it to be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

have not been liked by the State Governments, which are keen on preserving
their present powers and are not thinking of long-term needs. There is no
definiteness about the structure at the district and sub-district level.
Fortunately, there is less definiteness about the base at the <span
class=SpellE>panchayat</span> level, though, here too, there is no
co-ordination between the <span class=SpellE>panchayats</span> and the
development structures like the N. E. S. Blocks. The confusion has led to poor
results, for instance, in agricultural production. In local self-government,
there is still a great lag in the country, and it may prove bad for the
democratic process, and a severe handicap in development, even if it may not
lead to over-centralization which makes people’s participation unreal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

developed countries. Parliamentary democracy is not different from other forms
of democracy in its essential features. As it has developed in Britain and
other Commonwealth countries, it presupposes a constitutional structure, the
rule of law, an independent judiciary, a government of elected representatives
responsible to the legislature, and the existence of more than one party. It
also means secrecy of voting, and, in some constitutions, there is provision
for recall or referendum. It is known that it is a slow-moving, cumbrous
machinery, involving delays and dilatory procedures, though it has, sometimes,
under stimulus, and under stress of challenge, and with outstanding leadership,
shown <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> and totalitarian tendencies as in
Britain. The capacity of parliamentary democracy, however, to meet the pressing
social and economic urges of the people of a country with an under-developed
economy like India has been doubted, and not wrongly. Any form of government
depends upon the social and economic content which is put into it, and
parliamentary democracy might be as good as any other form of democracy for
social and economic change, provided the people and their leaders are capable
of ensuring change. In any such process, which must include industrialization
on a large scale, a certain amount of centralization becomes inevitable, and a
democracy on the <span class=SpellE>panchayat</span> pattern only, with
idealist economics, village industries, and any amount of decentralization,
cannot ensure the success of an industrial revolution. Whether there are to be
direct or indirect elections, there has to be democracy and government on a
national scale; and, if there is sufficient freedom of discussion, a pattern of
economic freedom, and scope for dissent, a one-party State or a party-less
State would seem difficult. In the Soviet Union, there are no differences in
economic doctrine, or competing economic interests, to make two parties
inevitable, and there is still the orthodox insistence on the one-party system.
In India, it is difficult to envisage a party-less or a one-party system.
Parliamentary democracy has not yet lost its charm for the Indian parties. <span
class=SpellE>Parliamentarianism</span> did not start with independence. There
was a long experience of legislatures, going back at least to the <span
class=SpellE>Minto</span>-Morley Reforms, if not to Lord Cross’s Act. Apart
from the perplexities of parliamentary practice, as codified by May, and the
difficulty of translating them into Indian practice, the political parties know
that parliamentary democracy permits any amount of scope for the growth of
local self-governing institutions, and there is already a wide-spread <span
class=SpellE>panchayat</span> base throughout the country. The democratic
pattern, suggested by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> Narayan and
others, does not provide answers to many economic problems; and, if there are
answers, it is possible to find them also in the present system. They seem to
have over-simplified human and economic problems which are the basis of
political problems. Gandhi, <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span>, Nehru and <span
class=SpellE>Dhebar</span> have at various times made the suggestions which Mr.
<span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> Narayan has incorporated in his thesis.
But political </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>systems cannot be created on the basis of a
thesis; they have an organic </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>growth of their own. The present system
combines the traditional pattern of <span class=SpellE>panchayats</span> and
the recent experience of legislative working at the national and State levels.
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> Narayan is partly right in thinking
that the parliamentary system was a by-product of industrialism; but, if he
carries his thesis to the extent of denying industrialization, by denying a
parliamentary system he is not providing a solution for the main problems of
Indian democracy. Nor does he improve his thesis by uncritical references to
what he calls ‘the basic democracies’ of the United Arab Republic, Indonesia
and Pakistan. This is not for the first time that he and others have shown a
startling lack of faith in the people and their economic or political sense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

would be useful to examine some of the basic issues of democracy, which have
arisen in an epidemic form in Asian countries. They have arisen from time to
time in European countries, and have been present in an almost permanent form
in Latin American countries, though often complicated by military factors. The
present propagation of basic or guided democracy, in countries as various as
the United Arab Republic, Indonesia and Pakistan, can be separated from the
issue of absolutism or arbitrariness. In constitutional terms, the issue is
between the parliamentary executive and the non-parliamentary executive.
Constitutions have a political basis and, where they endure for some time, an
economic and social basis. The non-parliamentary executive or, as it is
popularly called, the presidential executive was first adopted in the United
States, on the basis of the theory of separation of powers, based in turn on <span
class=SpellE>Montesquieu’s</span> exposition of the British Constitution in his
famous book, “Esprit des Lois”. <span class=SpellE>Montesquieu</span> had
misread the British Constitution as it was functioning in the middle of the
eighteenth century, but his theory survived in a compact form for nearly a
hundred years. The horse-and-buggy constitution which the American founding
fathers prepared has been found to be adaptable to the gigantic dimensions of
American democracy; and the American practice has been copied crudely in other
countries and on the American continent, except in Canada. The
non-parliamentary executive is not necessarily an unpopular executive. The
American President, who was once elected by limited electoral colleges, has
come to be popularly elected. In France, Louis Napoleon adopted the device of
plebiscite for popular election. Mussolini and Hitler were his latter-day
forms. Constitutions which were prepared to suit <span class=SpellE>Bonapartism</span>
provided for strong executive governments which could go on without being
responsible to the legislature. President de Gaulle’s Fifth Republic is the
up-to-date European version of the non-parliamentary executive. The Fourth
Republic was destroyed because in it the executive was responsible to the
legislature. In recent days, the apologists of colonialism have been suggesting
non-parliamentary executives to the African peoples, to divert them from the
principle of “one man, one vote” and the rule by African majorities. In
America, where the non-parliamentary executive of is familiar, President <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span> Khan is understood and even admired. The parliamentary
executive necessarily means the party system. It is the party system and the
political corruption involved in it, in the absence of long traditions and
standards of rectitude, and the dilatory processes involved in owing
responsibility to the legislature, and the inexperience of under-developed
countries which have brought the parliamentary executive into contempt. The
non-parliamentary executive in countries like the United States has its
dilatory aspects too and even President de Gaulle is not able to solve a
problem like the Algerian problem easily. It is not necessary to examine the
limitation and advantages of either the parliamentary executive or the
non-parliamentary executive to judge what is at stake for democracy in the rise
of the phenomenon of President <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span> Khan. He and his
advisers have proceeded on the assumption that democracy should be build from
the bottom; but, though Pakistan’s ‘basic democracy’ is based on adult
suffrage, there is too much of a mixture of elected and nominated members,
while President <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span> Khan has been elected President
before the Constitution has been prepared and is practically dictating<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the Constitution. The people of India may
have varyingly understood the constitutional and political aspects of the
widely propagated concept of <span class=SpellE>partyless</span> democracy. The
non-parliamentary executive may seem advantageous from the point of view of
administration and, if untrammeled by the democratic processes which prevail in
a country like the United States, may seem to achieve the smoothness and
efficiency of the one-party State. In the one-party State which prevail in
communist countries, the party processes are parallel to the State processes,
and are even paramount. The people of India have to realise, in these troubled
times, the implications of their own Constitution. It was made by the products
of British experience: it is not only for that reason that the parliamentary
system may seem to exist in this country in a respected form. It can also be a
matter of choice, knowingly made. The Indian Parliament is paramount even for
the amending process, and the power of judicial review of the Supreme Court is
limited for the sake of smoothening processes. But, as long as the people vote
for symbols, their political power may not seem real. The question is whether,
after two general elections, they are realizing their power. The success of the
parliamentary system will depend not only on the social and economic progress
made but on the checks which it will impose on the executive till the
politically ill-educated mass becomes politically educated. With growing
experience, the electorate can be certain that it can do away with legislatures
in league with a corrupt and inefficient executive, but it cannot be confident
that it can remove an executive, which, though elected is not subject to the
control of the elected representatives. In countries like Pakistan there is
much talk of formulating constitutions which will suit national tradition. But
the much-talked-about tradition is a mirage of the past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

features of the Indian economy, at present, which give a </span><span

of progress towards socialism are the emphasis on <span class=SpellE>industrialisation</span>,
particularly heavy industry, the extension of the public sector, the importance
given to the co-operative sector, and the controls and regulations imposed on
the private sector. Industrialization is desperately important for an
under-developed economy; and, while heavy industries, which alone can enable a
country to possess the means of producing the means of production, and to put
an early end to dependence on other countries, is important even in a
capitalist economy, it is rightly considered more important for an economy
developing in a socialist direction, for there is always need for small-scale
and cottage industry, and heavy industry will only ensure the necessary
framework and the basic means of self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, progress in
co-operation has been slow and unreal, though the co-operative sector can not
only be a buffer between the expanding public sector and the private sector,
but offers the best and easiest forms of social and economic democracy. The
Co-operative Movement, which required official initiative but only achieved
excessive bureaucratization, has to be rescued and made a broad base of
socialist transformation. Nor </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

drawn attention to public corporations. This system has been borrowed from
Britain where the post-war <span class=SpellE>Labour</span> Government made
large experiments in it. It is agreed that it is only one form of public
ownership, that there can be no hard and fast rules for the working of public
corporations, and that only experience can provide wisdom. The experimentation
is, of course, subject to public accountability. Parliament is bound to
investigate, fully, the nature and the working of public corporations which
have grown in an <i>ad hoc </i>manner in this country. It is not, however,
sufficient to think in British terms or even in parliamentary terms. The public
corporation form has to be related to new social and economic forces and to
progress towards socialism; and, while the production aspect is important, and
defects in the system can be reduced, the growing proletariat cannot be treated
merely as a part of the industrial relations structure. It has to become an
integral part of the productive processes, investing in the public sector the
spirit of social and economic democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

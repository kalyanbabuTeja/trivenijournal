style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
our rivers, the Tamraparni is said to be the home of pearls, of a kind
considered priceless, in ages when the pearl was greatly prized. Among the
human pearls that emerged from its banks was Nammalvar in the remote past, and
the late Sri V. Narayanan in the recent past. Nammalvar had to wait for
centuries before one who had poetry in his soul and was thus uniquely endowed
to interpret him, came along in the person of Narayanan. In the neighbourhood
of Tamraparni, is the sacred mountain from which arose the father of Tamil, the
sage Agastya. Narayanan resembled Agastya not only by his stature, but also by
repeating Agastya’s feat of drinking up the twin oceans of Sanskrit and Tamil.
Venkatanatha (Vedanta Desika) who hailed from the banks of the Vegavati, paid
his homage to Nammalvar when he named him <i>the Muni </i>and his work the <i>Dramilopanishad
</i>and ranked it higher than the Veda; and lest anyone should perversely
dispute his opinion, well on to add that “when a puny cloud threatened a
pompous downpour over Agastya, who had drunk the sea dry, the river Tamraparni
broke into a pearly smile.”<sup>1</sup> Venkatanatha was one of the intrepid
defenders of the ‘Divyaprabandha’ and he helped to give the Tamil language its
place in our life and culture. But his approach was religious and philosophic.
Narayanan, whose approach was artistic, discovered Nammalvar quite
independently; and he made his own significant contribution to Tamil letters
when he undertook to interpret the Tamil classics, for which his gifts and
equipment so eminently fitted him. He loved Tamil and wooed her like a lover.
But like the fabled Chakora that subsisted on moonbeams, and Parikshit who took
no other food than the ambrosia of Saka’s words, Narayanan drew his nourishment
from Valmiki and Nammalvar almost exclusively. One may say that he had
dedicated himself to these so wholly, that he outgrew his taste for anything
else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only son of his father, he married the only daughter of the late Justice P. R. Sundara
Iyer, a recollection of which he has preserved in the wistful reverie
‘Ayyarval’s son-in-law’ after he had lost his wife and become ‘visarada’. The
saintly lady passed away in 1936, and till then she had taken sole charge of
the family and the domestic responsibilities, relieving Narayanan completely
and leaving him free to his harem of books and dream-children. At the time,
Narayanan was such a stranger in his own house and was so seldom seen, that his
children addressed him as ‘Sir’ when he did appear. But when she passed away,
he replaced her, playing the role of Tayumanavar (Matrubhuta) so wholly and
tenderly that the children never missed the mother, and when they were a little
older, he combined the role of father and mother like Siva Ardhanariswara. In
the reverie referred to above, he relates how he handed over his marriage
invitation to his teacher, who did not even remember his name and who was
greatly surprised to learn that his humble pupil had been chosen as the
son-in-law of a High Court Judge. One can imagine the young Narayanan,
diminutive and demure, with felt cap on big head and a pair of goggly
spectacles, chuckling to himself at the teacher’s discomfiture. It was a habit
so characteristic of him; he would express the most devastating opinions in a
grave and apologetic manner, laughing in his sleeves all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had already taken his M. A., and M. L., with distinction after a brilliant
academic career. He practised law for some time rather perfunctorily. I
remember him in his legal garb with watch and chain, turban and brief-bag,
appearing in a literary case where a copyright was involved; but I do know
Narayanan got far more deeply involved in the labyrinth of Kadambari. His heart
belonged to literature and not law. When years later he joined the Tamil
Lexicon, he got work that found an outlet for his knowledge of languages. Sri
N. Raghunathan justly praises his accurate scholarship and appreciation of the
nuances of meaning and overtones of suggestion, that found full play when Narayanan
played the role of Dr. Johnson, for a while, at the Lexicon. The Tamil Lexicon
was one of the sagas of our time and had a long and chequered history. But that
portion of it with which Narayanan was connected, bears the stamp of his genius
and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>learning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

also remember his depredations of the <i>Hindu </i>office, annexing an enormous
booty of miscellaneous books, which he would review with the patience and
fortitude of a Job. He loved the dingy old <i>Hindu </i>building of which he
had very pleasant memories; one of the reasons why he joined the <i>Indian
Express </i>later was perhaps because it was located in that dear old building.
But he </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>did not admire the then new sky-scraper of the <i>Hindu,
</i>which he considered lofty and American. In those days, I was one of those
who considered, early rising immoral. Narayanan, an authority on the ethics and
aesthetics of early rising–<i>vide</i> his discourses on Palliyezhuchi–and the
sacred month of Marghazhi, was a confirmed early bird. Almost every day
Narayanan would arrive on his bicycle and, with an agility worthy of a better
cause, clear the stairs at one bound, accompanied by his war-cry ‘C-M’ (an
abbreviation of my nickname–Caveman–because I always kept indoors) and be at my
bedside, leaving my wife to scamper off as best she could–a heroic attempt on
the part of Narayanan to set our crooked habits straight, though not a very
successful one. The bicycle was his favourite vehicle and his daily routine
(which was of course subject to variations) was to inject Prof. K. Swaminathan
with his theory about the text of the Ramayana, because he was his neighbour
and nearest to him; then invade Perungulam House at Elliot’s Road and spar with
Sri Anantanarayanan, I. C. S., over his father-in-Law’s Ramayana theories and
exchange compliments with M. Krishnan who was just winging for the stellar
height where he now is; drop in at Prof. Kuppuswami Sastri’s for a sloka or
two; hold up Sri N. Raghunathan for at least half an hour before he left for
office; and to peep in at the ‘Asrama’ to clear his accounts of the funds of
the Sanskrit Academy of which he was the Treasurer. The beach and the evening
he reserved for Tamil and friends like Somasundara Desikar, Pundit Rajagopala
Iyengar, who edited ‘Ahananooru’, and Sri Vayyapuri Pillai. In between he used
to look up his relations, of whom there were quite a number, irrespective of
their worldly success and importance, and attend to their wants, as in duty
bound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Besides
the literary page of the <i>Hindu, </i>he was a prolific contributor to the
‘Everyman’s Review’, ‘Triveni’, ‘Journal of Oriental Research, ‘Vedantakesari’,
‘Bharatamani’, and ‘Silpasree’. He also gave some very valuable talks under the
auspices of the Archaeological Society and the Sanskrit Academy. Prof. K.
Swaminathan said that “about a dozen associations and two or three dozen
journals exploited his goodness and learning”. But Narayanan never considered
himself so exploited. Out of his innate goodness, he scattered the gems of his
thoughts far and wide to whoever wanted them, and even to those who did not
want them. If I may be permitted to say it, the late Prof. P. T. Srinivasa
Iyengar, who was himself a very good scholar, was not above borrowing ideas
from Narayanan. Narayanan was therefore a scholar sought out by other
scholars–the scholars’ scholar, so to say. He gave cheerfully and he gave
lavishly without any </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>motive of gain or fame. Equally
disinterested was his pursuit of knowledge. He threw himself heart and soul
into the functions of the Sanskrit Academy, and was ebullient and beside himself
with happiness when scholars of the stature of Pundit Raghava Iyengar, the
Elder, were honoured. For Raghava Iyengar whose outlook was very similar to his
own, and who was the one man who could understand his own work, he had genuine
affection, which he has given expression to in an essay describing a visit to
him. Once he sat up a whole night to prepare a Tamil version of
‘Swapna-Vasavadatta’ because the All India Radio wanted it urgently. It can
never be said that Narayanan was a recluse who kept to himself; not only did he
take considerable interest, but also participated with gusto in contemporary
life. He was never idle, but was always reading or writing or discussing
literature and art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the make-up of Narayanan was an excess of modesty <i>(vreeda) </i>which ripened
and mellowed into a saintly humility as he grew older and which completely
masked the prodigious range of his attainments. He had so much to say and said
so little of it, that I gave him the nickname ‘Iceberg’ which was mostly
submerged under water, the top alone being visible and a month before he passed
away, in a tragic flash of illumination, he wrote to me that the ice was
thawing and on its way to join the ocean. If ever there was a man without trace
of vanity, it was Narayanan; he never talked about himself nor allowed others
to talk about him. Even the little appreciation he did get appeared to delight
him, as though he had partaken of a banquet. Rich in contentment and equipoise,
he never seemed to regret the lack of recognition, and went about his work as
cheerfully and nonchalantly as ever. He wrote just to disburden himself of some
divine discontent and not to canvass for fame and name. He had a genius for
friendship and a good assortment of talented friends. He took pleasure in reading
poetry with friends; and some poems he was never tired of reading again and
again. Needless to say that I learnt a good deal from his readings and
conversation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was Sri Aurobindo Ghose who thought that the ‘Uttarakanda’ was a late addition
and pleaded for its exclusion from the Ramayana, as also the other patent
interpolations in the other ‘Kandas’. But it was Narayanan who studied the
Ramayana in close detail and tabulated the various species of interpolations
that the Poem invited in the course of ages from various agencies. Relying on
the Alvar he would quote ‘<i>Uruttezhhli vali Marbil O</i></span><i><span

quelled by a single arrow. From the beginning of the ‘Aranyakanda’, the theme, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>according
to Narayanan, was the prowess and heroism of Rama which rose in a crescendo and
reached its climax in the defeat and destruction of Vali. What a pity that
before he could restore the pure gold of the quintessential Valmiki, Narayanan
was snatched away! How invaluable would have been <i>his </i>masterpiece on the
masterpiece of Valmiki, had he been spared to write it! His favourite passage
was Sita’s message to Hanuman, in the course of which she breaks down in a
hallucination and addresses Rama in the first person, as though she saw him
bodily there. When Narayanan read it, his voice would falter and choke, and
tears flow down his cheeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In a moving narrative Narayanan has
recounted how his deeply religious father and mother came under the spell of
Sarada Devi, wife of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, whom they actually
entertained in their house and from whom they took lessons in spiritual
discipline. Later Narayanan made a pilgrimage to the village where the lady
was, near Calcutta, along with his mother; and there he was fascinated by an
image of Rama. The saintly lady, reading his unuttered thoughts, bathed him in
the nectar of her eyes and initiated him into the worship of Rama. The incident
throws light on Narayanan’s subsequent outlook and development. He was an
intimate devotee of Sree Rama; and it was his faith that sustained him in his
hour of trial when he lost his wife, and forged a new link between him and the
Ramayana. In an early essay, he speaks of the sacred ladies of his harem. As<i>
</i>one who understood him, may I take the liberty of unveiling the principal
Goddess there–his <i>Bhakti. </i>The other Goddess who was part of
him–Modesty–I have already uncovered. In another mood he described “the
solitude of star-lit nights on seashore with the billows sweeping over the
sand, while the immensity beyond glowed in the phosphorescent curl of the wave
where he met infinity face to face”. So this shy young dreamer saw the Pilot
face to face even before he had crossed the bar! How tellingly he expresses
himself and his exaltation! Delicious are some of his early essays, revelling
in the impish perversities of paradox caught from Chesterton, as in his plea
for the cult of unintelligibility and his defence of failure, and the one on
the folly of wisdom. In the last, he tilts against Tagore whom he had seen at
‘Santiniketan’, Mylapore, decked out all in velvet. In another piece he rewrote
the map of the world, replacing the geographical features with the intellectua1
and spiritual creations of the respective regions. One of the most charming was
his dissertation on ‘the lamp’ in the course of which he compared the
light-house to the “one-eyed Cyclops rolling his big eye round the broad sea at
his feet”. All this was excellent writing,–‘angelic’ as Sri K. Chandrasekharan
calls it, from a young man just out of college. If Narayanan had stuck to
English, he might have achieved distinction as a master of the personal essay.
But the lure and challenge of Tamil and Sanskrit proved irresistible and he turned
his back on English to seek his fulfillment elsewhere. Such a step was in
harmony with our own outlook and tradition, which reckon achievement as
something impersonal and work as higher than the man. But it did deprive him of
his share of contemporary appreciation to an extent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had the capacity to do easily what others found it difficult, and attempt
things that no one had attempted before. Like Arjuna he was ambidextrous and
could formulate with one hand a new approach to the problems of Federation and
throw off a formidable thesis on Ramanuja’s indebtedness to ‘Tiruvoymozhi’ with
the other. He could hold forth on the doctrinal differences between
Kumarilabhatta and Prabhakara Misra and pile Ossa on Pelion to scale the
Upanishads. Among his papers are excellent studies of the early Alvars and

his thesis on ‘Chola Polity’, of unique value to those who wish to read and
understand history aright. He begins by criticising the method of
reconstructing history from the records of foreign travellers and
cross-sections of dynastic lists and lexicons, without taking account of the
basic concept and philosophy of life of the people. The Solar Race was the
ideal of the Cholas; if Bhagiratha brought down Ganga from heaven, so did
Kavera bring down Kaveri; the Cholas were ‘Adityas and Vijayalayas and
resembled Vishnu; likewise did the eyes of the Chola Kochenganan tinged red
with grace resemble Vishnu’s; if Dasaratha went to help Indra, so did the Chola
Muchukunda; Raja </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>raja (a title of Kubera) not only resembled
Kubera by his boundless riches, but also by his devotion to Siva; Karikala bore
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>the name of Siva who tore asunder the elephant and did not
get his legs burnt to a cinder in an attempt at firewalking. The line<i> </i>in
the Chola inscription <i>‘Kanthalurchchalai kalamaruttaruli’ </i>is responsible
for a number of amusing deductions on the part of the professional historians.
‘Kalam’, according to the Tamil dictionary, means a boat or ship or eating
vessel; and ‘chalai’ is a road or Oottupurai. One school of historians claim
that the Chola smashed a fleet of ships in the harbour of Kandalurchali; the
other claims that the Chola broke all the eating vessels in the Oottupurai.
This is history indeed with a vengeance! If Mohamed Ghazni smashed images, the
noble Raja Raja smashed pots and pans in a hospitable eating house! Narayanan
said that the Chola, like Vishnu, got rid of the pest of wicked men (khala) and
established Dharma in that region, especially because in the first two lines ‘<i>Thirrumagal
polap perunilach chelviyum thanakkeyurimai poondamai Manakkola</i>’<i> </i>the
Chola is said to have made the wide earth, along with Lakshmi, his very own
like Vishnu. The word ‘aruli’ denotes an act of grace and the historians,
unaware of the poetic approach of the king to his duties, not only miss the
significance of the reference, but misread and distort it. What a vista of happy
circumstances does the title ‘Sungamtha</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>virthapiran’ of
Rajendra, evoke! But it has meant nothing to the historians, because they are
not students of literature and fail to read the overtones of the poetic title.
Besides, the Vaishnava </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>commentaries of the middle ages represent
untapped sources for reconstructing social history, which no historian seems to
have utilised. Narayanan concludes, “Every brick in the edifice of history must
be truth-moulded and put in proper place with utmost care, or the edifice will
tumble down. This is specially so in Chola history, as Chola Polity was
suffused with poetry and philosophy which moulded the life of the people of
that great epoch.” His incursion into historical research was not unlike the
advent of the bull in a China shop. But what a valuable lesson he taught when
he said that history, no less than literature, needs men of creative
imagination and taste! How one wishes that the research scholars benefit by his

note on ‘Tamil Civilisation’ in ‘Triveni’ was a closely reasoned argument.
Beginning with a reference to the late R. Swaminatha Iyer’s thesis that the
peculiarities of Tamil grammatical form and construction were features common
to most prakrits, and that the early Tamil vocabulary bears close affinity to
Vedic vocabulary and that of the early prakrits of the Punjab, Narayanan passes

interpretation of the word ‘Sanga’ as the variant of ‘Sanghata’ <i>i. e. </i>Anthology,
and his suggestion that many of the poems” of ‘Purananooru’ represented the
speeches of characters from old Tamil dramas playing the parts of poets and
kings, started a new era in the understanding of Tamil poetry and chronology,
and were as sensational in their own way as Prof. Dubreuil’s discoveries in
Pallava history. According to him the Sangam Anthologies represented a literary
dialect like Sanskrit, that found favour at Royal Courts and was confined to a
specific literary group that adhered to a specific set of literary conventions;
it was therefore but a segment of the Tamil literature. There must have been
and were other groups earlier and later who did not conform to the conventions,
or chose themes with which the conventions did not fit in, or chose a different
diction altogether. Indeed there was more than one school of literary
conventions that flourished side by side when Tamil was a creative language.
Narayanan therefore thought that an intensive study of Tamil literature as a
whole was more immediately needed than deductions based on a segment of it. I
am yet to find a scholar who studied Tamil as Narayanan did, or summed up his
findings as neatly and succinctly. Whether it was history or literature, his standard
of truth in investigation was very high. Unfortunately for him, the world of
Tamil was more bleak and lonely than history; and where he expected a multitude
of voices for and against him, he was disconcerted by listening to just one
voice and that was his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who sustained and kept the journal going. He wrote on how to rejuvenate Tamil
and prescribed some ‘kayakalpa’ treatment for it. Out of the many fine things
he wrote, I would single out the Playlet ‘Natakavataram’ portraying the origin

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri N. Raghunathan has said that ink was in
Narayanan’s blood; I am Sure that at least some of that ink was of the indelible
kind–the kind that survives, unlike that which vanishes. Sri Raghunathan hit
him off when he said that literature was his passion and that, once started,
his non-stop discourses delighted more prosaic souls by the serenity with which
he ignored the importunities of the clock! And who does not share his regret
that Narayanan is not here to waste one’s time by his genial buttonholing way?
The late K. S. Venkataramani wrote that “in the last five years Narayanan was
ripening so perfectly that every hour I spent with him was a great fertiliser
to me. In any other society he would have been gratefully used for a higher
purpose and honoured and recognised as a dynamic hermit, a Karma Yogi saturated
in the culture and traditions of our life”.</p>

deserve it. The infant mortality of journals like ‘Everyman’s Review’ and
‘Silpasree’ and the lifelong martyrdom of ‘Triveni’ are eloquent of a malady
for which no treatment has yet been devised. The romance of archaeology ought
to tempt people, but at the Society where Narayanan lectured, the audience
consisted of about seven people, of whom two must have been the peons waiting
in impatience for the speaker to cease, so that they may close the doors the

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In a determined effort to reform the Congress
organisation, the ruling party in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> empowered the Prime Minister
to accept resignations of senior Ministers of the Central Cabinet and of Chief
Ministers of some of the States. This was meant to be the first step in the
process of winning for the Congress the affection and the confidence of large
sections of Indian citizens who had expressed doubts about the ability of the
Congress Governments at the Centre and in the States to administer the affairs
of the nation with some degree of altruism. The reverses sustained by the
Congress in important by-elections brought matters to a head. While these
defeats did not materially alter the party position in the Central Assembly,
they lowered the prestige of the Congress and fostered the impression that the
Party was fast losing its hold over country. The opposition parties could not successfully
challenge primacy of the Congress nor provide an alternative Government. But
they could urge that the Congress had ceased to be the puissant body which won
freedom for the country, and that opposition to its policies and programmes was
on the increase. For the first time after the dawn of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>, a no-confidence motion against
the Nehru Government was discussed in Parliament and the weaknesses and the
lapses of that Government were prominently mentioned. The resignations of
Ministers were <span class=GramE>not,</span> however, the outcome of this
heated debate in Parliament. They were due to the plan sponsored by Sri <span
class=SpellE>Kamaraj</span>, the central feature of which was the strengthening
of the <span class=SpellE>organisational</span> branch of the Congress by
drafting into it leading Congressmen from the Parliamentary branch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the start, the plan had a striking effect. It was unusual for the leading
lights of the ruling party in any democratic country to quit office voluntarily
with a view to serve the party outside Parliament. But there were indications
of dissent in which some of the ex-ministers, notably Sri S. K. <span
class=SpellE>Patil</span>, joined. These related to the manner in which the
resignations were accepted by the Prime Minister, and it was vaguely hinted
that the opportunity was availed of to get rid of particular individuals who
had forfeited the Prime Minister’s good opinion. This was an unwarranted
accusation against the Prime Minister and it gained no credence in circles
noted for their impartiality. A more serious and disturbing feature was the
wrangle for power between rival Congress groups in most of the States which had
to select new Chief Ministers. In the beginning it was hoped that the choice
would be unanimous but even the friendly intervention of the Congress High
Command and its special ‘observers’ could not stifle the voice of the
dissidents. In most States there is a rift between the Legislative Party and
the Pradesh Congress Committee, and within each of these there are groups
pulling in different directions and seeking to seize power in both spheres.
Even where no Chief Ministers had to be chosen, in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh
particularly, these group loyalties have fostered a spirit of chronic
hostility, and there are constant confabulations between the High Command at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> and the leaders of the
rival groups in the various States. All this has caused great mental distress
to the Prime Minister and to all those who wish the Congress well and would
love to see it restored to its position of the first few years following <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is likely that most of the problems now
exercising the minds of leading Congressmen will be solved before the next
session of the Congress in Orissa. The choice of Sri <span class=SpellE>Kamaraj</span>
as President is calculated to pave the way to greater harmony within the
Congress and to a more effective implementation of its programmes in the
administrative sphere. The nation as a whole is concerned more with the latter
aspect. The leaders of the opposition parties including the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
and the P. S. P. have questioned the wisdom of planning far beyond our means,
and of the attitude of non-alignment in the international sphere. There is
pronounced hostility in some quarters to legislative measures like the
Seventeenth Amendment. A mere strengthening of the Congress can only mean the emergence
of an all-powerful single party which can overcome all opposition and wield
power for an indefinite period. If Parliamentary democracy is to be a success,
it ought to be possible for at least one other party, pledged to the democratic
process, to win nation-wide recognition as a possible successor to the
Congress. The Socialist pattern, which in actual practice may lead to State
Socialism and stifle individual initiative, is not the final word in social and
economic growth, and human nature needs wider opportunities for the expression
of whatever is in consonance with its higher Being. The element of compulsion
and regimentation in diverse fields of national <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>
may rob the nation of the richness and variety which indicate the flowering of
the best in the nation. From time to time, and notably at the time of a general
election, the citizen must be in a position to make a free choice between the
rival programmes of two or more political parties. This will provide the needed
corrective to the growth of authoritarianism, which will spell the ruin of
democracy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
while the average citizen welcomes the present move to make the Congress more
efficient as a party organisation, he would also welcome the rapid growth of
other democratic parties with well-defined aims and programmes, so that the
political education of the public may not be one-sided, and the leading party
may not be tempted to perpetuate its power, brushing aside all opposition as
irrelevant or unpatriotic. This tendency has been growing among Congressmen in
recent years, and is responsible for some of the evils which have crept into
the organisation. Well-<span class=SpellE>organised</span> political parties
with a nation-wide following and clear-cut rival programmes are the truest
safeguard of democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on">Central <span class=SpellE>Akademi</span></st1:place>, in
collaboration with the UNESCO, has sponsored a programme of translation of
world classics into </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

important part of the <span class=SpellE>Akademi’s</span> work. As far as
possible, the translations have been made direct from one language into
another, and where this has not been possible, the aid of a common language
like English or Hindi has been taken. Classics like Plato’s <i>Republic </i>and
Machiavelli’s <i>The Prince </i>had to be rendered from the <span class=GramE>standard</span>
English version, because a knowledge of Greek or Italian is not common among
our scholars. And yet, the translations of these two treatises on Politics into
Telugu are admirable and convey something of the </span><span style='font-size:

It is their way of communing with the Divine, and at the moment of creation

That a person of his stature and nobility of aim and <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>
should have <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> the careers of innumerable young
men and women is a matter for grateful recognition and rejoicing in the <st1:country-region

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He was
also a member of the Madras Legislative Council. But it was not office or power
that attracted him. His heart was always with the poor and the down-trodden,
the widows and the orphans. Several of these were taken care of by him and
treated as members of his family. A widower and without children of his own, he
bestowed affection on many to whom he was mother as well as father. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fortunately with us still, Krishna Sastri, the poet and dreamer, who has agreed
to write a full-length biography of his Guru. The public will look forward with
eagerness to what promises to be one the greatest biographies in Telugu, full
of devotion and understanding, and in a prose style revealing Sri <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art,
in its pure and exalted form, is the greatest gift of the gods to mankind. In
spite of its seeming diversity and its elastic and pervasive background, it
epitomises all the elements that appeal to the eye and ear and enthrall the
heart, whatever form the release of the emotions may take. The Artist pours
forth his soul in matchless lines on the canvas, or draws out of his flute or
violin the song of his heart in cascades of melody, and forgets his identity in
the serene contemplation of nature’s handiwork. He has flashes of Illumination
and shares its glow and warmth with others. The painter plies his brush while
the musician wields his magic wand. The painter is never satisfied unless you
share the joy and beauty of his creation, while the musician feels dejected if
you remain irresponsive to his ecstatic moods. What is, therefore, the basic
background of all this emotional reciprocity and responsiveness is the unique
appeal which art in any form makes to the human mind. In every sphere art
preserves past traditions and also rescues them from premature </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>decay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
those who have preserved past traditions in all their pristine purity and
brought to bear their influence on their art, Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu is one
of the foremost. Prof. Naidu has rescued instrumental music from the ruts into
which it had fallen, due to a too rigid subservience to out-moded conventions.
He has also given new life and freedom to the instrument he wields with
consummate ease. Under the deft touches of his fingers, the bare strings, dumb
and immobile by themselves, spring into life, and the bow which wrings rare
symphony and melody out of them does the rest of the miracle. Prof. Naidu had
the making of a genius even in his youth; his zeal and natural flair for music
was quite in unison with the traditional love of his family for the fine arts,
and these found ample fulfilment in the young and ambitious boy as he grew into
manhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Born
in 1893 in the congenial atmosphere of Bangalore </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cantonment,
Prof. Naidu was lucky to have a father and brother deeply devoted to the
worship of the fine arts. He tried to study books but the monotony of them
scared him away. He found the greatest joy in hearing his father or brother
practise on the violin. The soft and captivating timbre of the violin so won
his tender heart that he preferred its charms to poring over textbooks. Very
early in life, he put away his school books; and he found a ready and
sympathetic response from his brother, Krishniah Naidu, who was himself a good
violinist. With an inborn ear for the subtleties of sound and an intuitive
aptitude for the arts, young Naidu devoted all his time and energy to the
practice of the violin under the loving care of his brother. At this time, the
Naidu family had to migrate to Visakhapatnam, but the young violinist had
already mastered the fundamental technique of this art, and even developed a
distinctive slyle in the handling of the bow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
he mastered the beginner’s routine, he blazed a new trail. He brought to bear
on his exposition an uncommon skill and originality. No wonder Prof. Naidu rose
in public esteem and was hailed as a prodigy. Today he is universally acclaimed
as the supreme master of melody, equally at home in Oriental and Western modes.
He combines in his style the finer points of both, without sacrificing the
basic background of Carnatic music. Here is a synthesis of both Eastern and
Western styles of music, perfected by his own daring genius.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
undergone preliminary training under the loving care and guidance of his father
and brother, Prof. Naidu foresaw the great potentialities that lay hidden and
untapped in this art, and concentrated on probing into its mysteries with the
thoroughness and fervour of a votary. Early in his career, he had rare chances
of listening to the music of famous artists like Anantharama Bhagavathar,
Konerirajapuram Vythianatha Aiyar, and Sangameswara Sastri, including
violinists like Thirukodikaval Krishna Aiyar and Trichy Govindaswami Pillai.
Fortifying himself with these inspiring experiences at an impressionable age,
he began to sharpen and quicken his own <i>manodharma, </i>fixing his peerless
vision ahead. His fame began to spread in his own Province. From far-off
Vizianagaram to Bezwada, his name became a household word and everyone talked
of the amazing precocity of the young violinist who could reach the heights of
the old giants at such an early age. The Maharaja of Jeypore, a discerning
patron of arts, was one of the earliest to recognise the genius of Prof. Naidu
and he presented him the first of a series of gold medals that were heaped by
the public on this young rising star. In 1919, he was appointed Professor of
Violin in the Maharaja’s Music College at Vizianagaram and later succeeded the
famous Narayanadas in the Principalship. By this time his fame began to spread
to South India which is the acknowledged nursery of all that is best in
Carnatic music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the early period of the present century, Kakinada provided an ideal forum,
through the Saraswathi Gana Sabha, for all young and aspiring artists to show
their skill and enlist public approbation. Young Naidu gave his first public
performance under the auspices of this Sabha and he at once attracted the
attention of all music-lovers. Thereafter, Prof. Naidu became a rage in all
music Sabhas at Madras and elsewhere and accompanied several great artists of
the South. From 1920 onwards, honours and tributes came to him unsought;
medals, titles and civic receptions were poured on him from one end of the country
to the other, indicative of the love and esteem the art-lovers of South India
had for this unique exponent of instrumental music. The biggest honour that any
artist could covet came to him in 1957 when he was awarded the title of “Padma
Sri” by the Central Government in recognition of his supremacy in violin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Prof. Naidu has not allowed this growing public esteem either to disturb his
concentration or induce him to rest on past conquests. His mind is a vast
store-house of dynamic energy from which he draws the thread of his music
almost to a point of ecstasy. The more you hear him the more you feel the
impact of the depth and vitality of his imaginative power which revels in
subtleties and naive interpretations of the beautiful and the sublime. He is
never satisfied with merely repeating the most obvious: he recreates and
embellishes the core and the outlines of a raga with a rare glow. His art is of
the type that grows and thrives on hitherto uncharted fields and through the
magic wand of his bow he produces a striking pattern of symphony. He has the
skill and deftness of a born artist: he communes with the gods and brings down
paradise to earth in his delicate and adroit delineation of the finer and
subtler aspects of a raga. In a sense, he strikes a casual listener as the very
antithesis of the old orthodox type born and nursed in air-tight compartments,
and he invariably breaks away from hidebound traditions only to replenish his
art with fresh beauty and fragrance. He is an artist every inch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were giants in this field before the advent of Prof. Naidu, like Subbaraya
Aiyar, who had the unique privilege of accompanying renowned artists like
Coimbatore Raghava Aiyar and Mahavaidyanatha Aiyar of immortal fame. Following
in their wake came Thirukodikaval Krishna Aiyar, another titan among
violinists, and after him it looked as though there was an abrupt end to the
illumination fostered under the leadership of Patnam Subramania Aiyar. Luckily
for us, the music tradition has not ceased to percolate, though the hiatus
between one milestone and another lingered for a while, only to yield place to
another saga of musical lore with all its freshness and variety, handed down to
us by Coimbatore Raghava Aiyar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
loving loyalty, the link with the hoary past has been kept alive by the artists
of the present generation, of whom Prof. Naidu is one of the foremost, Endowed
with a keen and receptive mind, Prof. Naidu, solely guided by his own <i>manodharma,
</i>has developed a technique which constitutes a happy synthesis of all that
is appealing to the ear, whether it is purely a Carnatic or Western brand or an
amalgam of both. And very early in his career he gave up accompanying any
musician on the violin; being an individualist, he always prefers a solo performance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps
it may be considered a wrong approach to compare Prof. Naidu with other artists
in his line, but a study of their methods is worth recording in assessing the
art of this great master. A gifted artist, Thirukodikaval Krishna Aiyar wielded
his bow like Arjuna, keeping rigidly within the ambit of his versatile
scholarship. His imagination so overpowered the pure artist in him that he
would stop and sing for a few seconds and resume the bow again to continue his
overtures with the Muse. He was an outstanding genius with a distinctive
personality of his own. While Krishna Aiyar invited you to share the joys with<i>
</i>him in his flights of imagination, Prof. Naidu is content to withdraw
himself and allow his art to speak for itself. The volatility of the one is
only equalled by the controlled emotion of the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Govindaswami
Pillai was the doyen among the violinists of his day. Almost unrivalled in this
art, he held the field as the most virile exponent of a style in which he
combined melody with astute handling of the bow. His interpretation of <i>ragas
</i>was daringly original both in conception and portrayal and was a faithful
projection of his own bonhomie personality. He revelled in short, crisp,
vibrating notes, sparkling chips hewn and perfected from his anvil, and
overpowered us with the ecstasy of an animated being. Prof. Naidu is almost
Pillai’s equal in this respect, with this small difference, that one drew
largely his inspiration from the art itself, while the Professor merges himself
into the very core of the sound, builds his picture out of the stirrings of his
soul and invests it with promethean fire. Both these artists belong to the same
class and have achieved distinction by their individuality and style.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Judged
even by the most rigorous standards, Prof. Naidu is entitled to a foremost
place among the contemporary exponents of instrumental music. Apart from his
unrivalled mastery in play, which by itself is no common achievement, he has
given to us an enchanting poem through his instrument. A story was current that
Prof. Naidu’s supremacy is mostly due to the violin which he is alleged to have
purchased at a fabulous price in an European market. This fiction was easily
swallowed, since this instrument is of foreign origin and lends colour to the
story. But the truth is that Prof. Naidu purchased the violin he is using even
today for a bare Rs. 10 at some public auction. There is no witchcraft or
sleight-of-hand in his play, nor is there any hidden secret which he alone can
tap from the instrument to the amazement of his audience. Only, God has endowed
him with an ingenuity to make the violin reveal the grand epic of his soul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
striking contrast to the hypnotic spell he casts over his audience, Prof. Naidu
is a man of utmost simplicity. Reserved by nature, he prefers to commune with
himself and his art to any academic dissertation on music except with a chosen
few. He strikes one as a lonely man immersed in the depths of his own soul,
building up, remodelling and replenishing his <i>manodharma </i>and sharpening
and concentrating mainly on ‘laya’ and ‘sruti,’ the very apotheosis of
classical music. There is no set pattern in his delineation of any <i>raga </i>or
song: it varies with his moods like a rainbow. Those who have heard his
interpretation of ‘Subha Pantuvarali’ or ‘Mukhari’, ‘Bilahari’ or ‘Varali’, or
any other <i>raga </i>for that matter, cannot miss the artist’s craftsmanship
in touching the very springs of a piece and releasing a sparkling flood of
melody therefrom to the delight of every one. Prof. Naidu is a true worshipper
of <i>Nada </i>and his art is a faithful reflection of his unswerving devotion
to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has not abated his ardour, nor has the suppleness of his fingers suffered in
vigour or vitality in spite of advancing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>age. His handling of

is always refreshing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

invariably perceive sparks of originality in his development of a <i>raga </i>or

his heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

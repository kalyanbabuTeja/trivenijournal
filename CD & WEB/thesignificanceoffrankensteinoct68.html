Shelley’s <i>Frankenstein </i>is an extraordinary novel in many ways. It was
the first novel of a nineteen-year-old girl with an unusual background. Mary’s
mother was the author of the first feminine document <i>Vindication of the
Rights of Woman. </i>Her father’s <i>Political Justice </i>influenced the
thought of his time considerably. Her husband was reputed to be an atheist and
a socialist. Among her friends was Lord Byron. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=GramE>A multiplicity of themes from a variety of sources <sup>1</sup>
are</span> fused in it by linked analogies and repetitive patterns in structure
and action. The alternate title, “The Modern Prometheus,” focuses our attention
on a dominant theme of the novel. Prometheus stole fire from the gods to
preserve mankind. Thus he had usurped the powers of the gods and rebelled
against oppression. The poet Shelley was fully deeply impressed by this spirit
of liberty and used this myth in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

modern counterpart, Frankenstein, “stole” another vital secret of the gods by
animating a corpse through scientific experiments. He was motivated by a desire
for knowledge: “….if I could bestow animation on lifeless matter, I might in
process of time...renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to
corruption.”<sup> 2</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he viewed the moment of his triumph as a “catastrophe.” He racked by guilt and
fear because of his subconscious realization of his crime against God’s
creation. His sense of guilt becomes accentuated with every incident in the
novel. Because of bitter remorse he abandoned making a female companion for the
Monster. He had realized the “wickedness” of his deed, repented for it, and
tried to annihilate the Monster. In this, the modern Prometheus is rather
different from the ancient one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

theme of <i>The Ancient Mariner </i>into the novel. The hero in <span
class=SpellE>Coleridge’s</span> poem had killed an Albatross and had brought
swift retribution upon himself and his companions. The burden of the lonely
mariner’s guilty soul could be relieved only by confessing his wicked deed and
by communicating his agony to a sympathetic listener. Frankenstein is another
version to the travelling mariner. He had not killed any of God’s creatures.
But he had broken the same divine law indirectly. The Monster was <i>his </i>creature
and the Monster’s crimes were <i>his </i>crimes. His anguish and alienation
increase with every murder committed by his creature. When innocent Justine was
condemned to death for supposedly killing his brother, Frankenstein says:
“Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell
within me, which<i> </i>nothing could extinguish.” (p. 73) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

by “deep, dark, deathlike solitude.” William, Justine, <span class=SpellE>Clerval</span>
and Elizabeth were taken away from him by his own creature. He was desolate.
His redemption also came through suffering. The <span class=GramE>death of his
relatives and friends, imprisonment, illness, isolation and mental distress
have</span> cleansed his soul somewhat. He unburdened guilt-ridden soul like
the ancient mariner by telling his story Captain Walton. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

alienation from society may be interpreted as a punishment for his attempt to
cross human limitations. His intellectual curiosity tempted him to seek
forbidden knowledge even as Adam was tempted to eat the fruit of the forbidden
tree. Adam lost paradise for his sin. Frankenstein lost his happiness and
became a pitiable wanderer. Adam’s salvation comes through suffering and
confession. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but
his state was far different from mine in every respect. He had come forth from
the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial
care of his creator; he was allowed to converse with, and acquire knowledge
from, beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often,
like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors [the cottagers] the bitter
gall of envy rose within me. (p. 112) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Monster is clearly meant to be an unusual combination of Adam and Satan. He had
epitomized the long, slow development of man’s civilized life of many millennia
into a few months and had learnt many things very fast. He had developed a
thirst for knowledge and was self-educated. Tender feelings of affection welled
up in him and he craved for companionship. He had made desperate attempts to
befriend the cottagers and others. But his physical appearance terrified and
repelled others. Even the cottagers who were themselves victims of injustice
denied him friendship. His alienation is even more terrible than his maker’s.
So he complained bitterly: “Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire
and encourage him; but I am solitary and abhorred.” (p. 112) As for Adam, Eve
was there to comfort him. But the Monster was shunned and despised by all
mankind including his “father”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

isolation were blamed on his creator. His benevolent actions like saving a

and the Monster represent a psychological conflict between parent and child.
The Monster’s revolt and vengeful chase of his maker is a rebellion of creature
against creator, a re-enactment of Satan’s rebellion against God, a repetition
of Adam’s disobedience, a reflection of Frankenstein’s own violation of the divine
law. The Monster had probably greater reason to revolt than any of the others,
for as he complained, be did not have any of the advantages that all of them
have had. By demanding a female companion, he had asserted his right to
happiness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

chapter V to the end, pursuit is another important theme. In the beginning, the
Monster follows Frankenstein wreaking vengeance on him by killing three of his
dearest ones. But the murder of Elizabeth, Frankenstein’s bride, reverses their
roles in the pursuit. It is now Frankenstein who sought out the Monster over
ice-bound lands and oceans. While the Monster’s vengeful murders and his sudden
ghost-like appearances do not look like a consistent pursuit, Frankenstein’s
difficult journey is presented as a continuous hunt in the last few chapters,
Curiously, the hunter was urged and sustained by the hunted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is in the course of this two-way chase that we become aware of yet another
theme. Frankenstein and the Monster are not really two independent entities.
They are “complementary” and “antithetical.”<sup>3</sup> The creature is an
extension of the creator in that he represents the destructive potentialities
latent in Frankenstein. The two may be seen as two aspects of a disintegrated
personality, an anticipation of the theme of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Jekyll</span>

dangerous experiment. He becomes more of an emotional and imaginative person

compassion made him save a drowning child. He revenges himself on Frankenstein

the Monster is Frankenstein’s own reflection, or at least some aspect of him,
Captain Walton is a projection of Frankenstein. He too has something in common
with Frankenstein. He was bound for “the unexplored regions” in search of
dangerous and forbidden knowledge. His quest parallels Frankenstein’s earlier
quest for the secret of life. Therefore, Frankenstein counsels the Captain: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

narrative structure of the novel is also significantly based on these three
principal figures. Captain Walton who was literally on the rim of the world
represents the external reality and he starts telling the story of his quest
and his encounter with Frankenstein. Then Frankenstein tells his story from
chapter I through chapter X. The core of the novel, chapters XI through XVI, is
told by the Monster. This narrative pattern may be likened to a series of three
concentric circles. The innermost circle represents the Monster and his
horrors. The outermost circle represents reality. This Chinese-box structure in
the narrative underscores the merging of themes and characters on yet another
level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

foregoing discussion of the themes, characters and structure or <i>Frankenstein
</i>brings us to the question: Is this a Gothic novel? It has few of the
conventions and devices of that genre of fiction. In a Gothic novel, the action
takes place in the past, usually in the Middle Ages, in and around a haunted
castle. The action in Mrs. Shelley’s novel is not in the past, nor is it
located In a medieval castle, though some critics tried to establish a tenuous </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>link
between it and Frankenstein’s laboratory. There is no ghost, though the Monster
is ghost–like in his demeanor. There is no monk, no magic and no witchcraft in <i>Frankenstein.
</i>There is no incest. There are no clanking chains, no trap doors, no
underground passages, and no charnel houses in this novel. There are, however,
terror and horror, but they are not of the melodramatic variety as the typical
Gothic novel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the novel is a powerful tragedy. It is Frankenstein’s tragedy presented
somewhat in the Greek manner. Frankenstein<i> </i>is exceptional in his
intelligence and makes a significant choice, accomplishes something unique with
completely good intentions. But once his goal was reached, he swelled with
pride on his own admission. It is this <i>hubris </i>which, in his judgment,
led to his fall. </span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

of a Greek tragic hero, his destruction was brought through mental anguish.
Frankenstein’s reanimation of a dead body was a blasphemous act just like
Prometheus’s act of stealing fire from Zeus or Captain Ahab’s vengeful pursuit
of a dumb brute. <i>Frankenstein </i>also evokes the emotions of pity and fear,
pity for the hero’s plight and fear or<i> </i>the monstrosities of his
creature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

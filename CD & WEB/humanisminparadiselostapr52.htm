style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
three centuries “Paradise Lost” has held its place as the greatest poem in the
English language. It has been the touchstone of literary appreciation, the test
by which the reader’s taste and understanding have been judged. It came into
the world unheralded and unsung, but within a few years it cut out, as Dryden
remarked, all its contemporaries and the ancients too. To what amazing quality
or combination of qualities can this supreme triumph be attributed? Many would
answer: the style; and in</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the English language with such superb and dignified mastery, with such unerring
skill </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and such sonorous effect as Milton. But no work
of art survives merely because of style; it is the perfect combination of
manner and matter, the language and the thought-content, which gives such a
work immortality and raises it to the rank of a classic. While critics have
almost unanimously succumbed to the fascination of Milton’s rolling harmonies,
they have not been equally convinced of the value of the poem’s message, nor
for that matter, have they agreed on what the poem means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
his Puritan contemporaries <i>Paradise Lost </i>was essentially a religious
poem. It took its place in many an English household alongside of the Bible,
Bunyan’s ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ and Foxe’s ‘Book of Martyrs’. It was Milton’s
imagery rather than anything the Bible says which produced the popular
Christian ideas of Heaven and Hell. It employed the machinery of celestial and
infernal worlds, and moved familiarly with angels and demons, the creator of
Heaven and Earth, and the Son of God. It reduced to poetry the intractable
material of Christian Theology and it sought to justify the ways of God to men.
So <i>Paradise Lost </i>was looked upon as a book of sermons, and its text was
God. Therefore, say the critics, as the theological framework, so essential to
the poem, becomes out of date, as thoughtful men cease to believe in angels or
devils, the poem will lose its validity, its appeal to the modern </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>man,
and become one of those monuments of art whose interest is purely antiquarian.
Its essential weakness, they would assert, is that <i>Paradise Lost </i>is
built on a fable which the modern mind rejects and which is, in the words of
Satan, “worth your laughter”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it seems to me, to argue thus is to miss the whole point of the poem. The theme
of <i>paradise Lost </i>is not God, but Man. I wonder if my listeners have
noticed, what I have always felt, that there is an essential unity in Milton’s
work, that from the first poem he ever wrote to the last, every one of his
writings–Prose or Poetry–has but one theme, viz.–Milton himself. Is there any
other instance in the whole realm of English literature of such unashamed
egotism? Yes, egotism if you like, but as Coleridge said, the egotism of such a
man is a revelation of spirit. Milton himself is the theme of his works, but
Milton as representative man, Milton as embodying the eternal conflicts which
flesh is heir to, Milton as forming the crowded arena where that immortal
garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat. It runs like a golden
thread–this concentration on himself–and illumines his writings like a candle
in a dark world. From the <i>Vacation Exercise at cambridge </i>to <i>Samson
Agonistes</i>, Milton’s poetry deals with the human problem, as fought out in
the throbbing brain and pulsating spirit of one man, and it is as a humanist,
as a champion of Man, as the knight in shilling armour fighting our battle and
reaching the end of the day, without fear and without reproach, that Milton
must ultimately be judged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
what, it may be asked, is this human problem? If I can put it in one sentence,
I would say it is the story of Man’s struggle with himself. Man is placed in a
world of beauty and exhorted to enjoy himself. All things subserve his purpose
and seem to be made for him. And as he sets out to be happy in this garden of
bliss, he discovers that there is a snag about it somewhere: the moral law
obtrudes itself and the question of right and wrong arises. Across his path he
finds a banner with a strange device: “Thou shalt not”, and, as he looks up, a
forbidden fruit dangles before his eyes. And deep within him he finds something
responding to this moral challenge, something which tells him that while he
would like to sport with Amaryllis in the shade and with the tangles of
Neaera’s hair, there is something else which raises the clear spirit, to scorn
delights and live laborious days. Then the conflict begins:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was this inner struggle that Milton endured, the hell through which he passed,
and the price he paid for his poetry. For no great work of art can be born
until its creator has been crushed and ground in this wine-press of conflict
and his life blood has watered the earth. On the one hand Milton was an artist.
From his youth upwards he had been peculiarly sensitive to the appeal of beauty
whether it came in the form of some rustic Horton girl or the more seductive
dark-eyed maidens of Italy or the more mature charms of a Delilah. This world
of beauty–primeval, amoral, aesthetic–waved its snow-white arms and sang its siren
songs to him. It tells him in <i>Lycidas </i>not to waste his youth. It
promises in <i>Comus </i>that<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

stir up joy as this. It offers, him the apple–and the apple in the fair hand of
Eve–in <i>Paradise Lost </i>and the luscious banquet in <i>Paradise Regained. </i>In
<i>Samson Agonistes </i>it takes the form of Delilah and produces the caustic
comment of the Chorus: yet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power. But
Milton was more than artist. He was a Puritan who desired to live as ever in
his great Task-Master’s eye. He had to serve the nation and fight for her
cause. He was the chosen instrument of God to effect His purpose for his
beloved England. He could not afford to linger in the lap of dalliance when
duty called him. And this became the greatest problem of his existence: to
reconcile the demands of his aesthetic nature with those of his moral life and
to win for himself that calm of mind, all passion spent, which was his ideal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This, then, is the answer to those who ask why
Milton, the humanist, chose the theme of the Fall of Man for his greatest work.
For Milton was indeed a humanist. He was brought up in the tradition of Plato;
the speculations of the Greek philosophers were his rod and staff, the dramas
of the great tragedians his daily bread. He was a Renaissance scholar who had
discovered afresh the vitality of the Greek outlook. The stories of Greece were
parables that spoke that his inmost being. Like Orpheus he had found a lyre
whose music could wring feeling from wood and stone; like Actaeou he had gazed
on Nature’s naked loveliness; like Proserpin he had gathered flowers in the
fair field of Enna. He had the Greek thirst for knowledge, the Greek love of
beauty, the Greek devotion to liberty, the Greek insistence on the primacy of
man. He was of the breed which strove with gods outside the walls of Troy and
on the high seas. And when he decided to put himself wholly into one mighty
utterance which the world would not willingly let die, he chose a theme which
would have delighted his Greek predecessors. It had just that slightly ironic
flavour which they appreciated, that emphasis on a human problem, that wide
sweep which covered the three worlds that are found in the writings of the
Greek masters. But Milton had something which the Greeks did not have–the
assurance that the problem was not insoluble and–if only the Greeks would
understand–it was a solution which continued to uphold the dignity of man, for
one greater Man–yes, a Man, could restore us and regain the blissful seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
in <i>Paradise Lost </i>we see the fruition of the humanist outlook. The story
revolves around that weak, helpless creature called Man. But, in spite of his
frailty, he is the centre of the universe. For him a whole cosmogony has been
devised, for him worlds have been created, and his welfare concerns regions
beyond </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ours. For his salvation councils are held in
Heaven and for his destruction pandemonium prevails in Hell. This gives Man a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dignity
and a status which is entirely different from the position afforded to him in
Greek epic or drama. For in <i>Paradise Lost </i>Man is not the victim of some
inexorable, inexplicable fate against which he is pitted in unequal struggle,

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Adam’s
position in <i>Paradise Lost </i>has been much misunderstood, though Eve’s role
has been better appreciated. But Adam represents the real human element. He is,
as his name implies, truly a man. In his long conversations with the
angels–much derided by short-sighted critics–are the questions which have
always troubled man: Who am I, whence have I come, and what is my destiny? With
the creation of the new and strangelty fascinating creature Eve, a whole realm
of problem and perplexity bursts upon Adam; love, without which man cannot
exist which does not enter alone; for in his train are tears and doubts and
immemorial pain; and companionship, failure and forgiveness. With the bitter
experience of Eden comes the hard lesson that humanity refuses to learn but
must learn, if it should survive in God’s universe–that obedience to the moralo
law is the guarantee of peace and security and that the price of disobedience
is the loss of Paradise, the Paradise of an innocent and undefiled mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
readers of <i>Paradise Lost </i>have been perplexed by one difficulty, that
Milton seems to be on the side of Satan; in the titanic struggle between good
and evil he seems to admire the infernal enemy rather than the All-wise and
All-good. While it is true that much of Milton’s colossal energy has gone into
the creation of Satan, it is not correct to say that he is on Satan’s side. He
is interested in Satan more perhaps than in God, because in Satan he finds the
same conflict as in Man, the same dualism, the same upsurging of the good, the
same repressal of it and conscious choice of evil that have disfigured
humanity. Indeed it is an intensely human Satan that Milton has created, a
being who can feel the pangs of envy when he sees Adam and Eve imparadised in
one another’s arms and realises that he can never know that bliss. So, in this
sense, Milton is Satan, Milton is Adam, as Milton was later to be the suffering
Samson, now eyeless in Gaza at the mill with slaves, and now the triumphant
instrument of God’s punish</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

to all lovers of humanity, to all believers in the dignity of the human race,
to all champions of human rights and liberties, Milton has left his legacy–the
soul-stirring, challenging, elevating message of <i>Paradise Lost. </i>That
such a challenge is needed more than ever today we need not doubt. Nor do we
need to question Milton’s answer to our perplexity, that human problems cannot
be solved merely on the human plane. In the acceptance of this truth lies our
only hope, and the fulfillment of Milton’s vision of a new Heaven and Earth

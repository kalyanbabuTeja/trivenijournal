<P ALIGN="CENTER">BY AVVAI</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">(Rendered from <B>Tamil </B>by P. N. Appuswami)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[This small poem is taken from the anthology, <I>Pura-nanooru. </I>It is, perhaps, two thousand years old. Its author is Avvai, the poetess.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The story of the poem is stated thus: Avvai was once sent by her king, Athiyaman Anchi, as an ambassadress to the court of a neighbouring king, Thondaiman. He did her the honours; and, to impress her with a show of his might, took her round his well-furnished armoury. But when he looked at her for appreciation, he got this song instead. It shows us how sharp-tongued she could be, and how smooth and well-oiled words can lash and sting.]</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These </I>are plumed with peacock feathers, and are decked with garlands. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their thick strong handles are finely wrought;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are nicely oiled,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And are housed in a well-guarded and spacious mansion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But <I>those, </I>through goring his enemies, have their edges blunted, tip and side;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And ever lie at the blacksmith’s little smithy– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They, the sharp pointed spears of our king,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who, when he is affluent, distributes rich food;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And when he is not, shares his food with us;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The liege lord of all the poor and their kinsfolk,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The noble one.</P></DIR>

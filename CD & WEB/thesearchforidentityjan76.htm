survey of American fiction written since the Second World War reveals most of
the protagonists of the novels searching for a sense of identity and selfhood.
The forces making for the anonymity of man in an industrialized society like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and
the tensions to which minority groups like Jewish-Americans are subject, lend
poignancy to this theme in contemporary American fiction. It figures
prominently in the fiction of the Jewish-American novelists of the last three
decades, especially in the work of Saul Bellow and Bernard <span class=SpellE>Malamud</span>.

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is the first of <span class=SpellE>Malamud’s</span>
novels and is about the attempts of a talented baseball player, named Roy
Hobbs, to win recognition and wealth. The novel is divided into two parts, each
tracing a broadly similar pattern of events in the career of the hero. In the
earlier part entitled “Pre-Game,” <st1:City w:st="on">Roy</st1:City> is an
adolescent being taken for a “try-out” in baseball to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. In this part there are two crucial
situations which indicate the chief weaknesses and virtues of the protagonist.
These are his defeating Walter <span class=SpellE>Wambold</span>, the reigning
baseball hero, and his succumbing to the physical beauty of a mysterious young
woman named Harriet Bird, who happens to travel by the same train. The former
incident indicates his heroic potential, while his sensual response to Harriet
indicates his sensuality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

chief features of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>’s
character emerge fairly clearly by the end of the first part. These are his
potential for heroism, and, coexistent with it, a self-<span class=SpellE>centredness</span>
which constricts and distorts his ideals, and thwarts his quest. Through the
second and larger part, we see <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>
battling against the negative side of his self. The moral condition of <st1:City
w:st="on">Roy</st1:City> at the beginning is symbolized by his reflection in
the window-pane of the train to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>.
We see his face reflected in the light of the lighted match, surrounded by
darkness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the beginning, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>’s
vision of heroism and identity is inadequate, and his ambitions petty. He longs
for the pleasures of the flesh, and seeks to be “the best there ever was in the
game” (p. 32). At the end of the first part, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City> is shot and wounded by Harriet Bird for
his overweening ambition, on the night before the “try-out” match. His baseball
career is ended even before making a real start. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

luck at the beginning of the second part than he had enjoyed so far. His talent
is spotted and he joins a team named ‘The Knights’ headed by a retired baseball
player named Fisher. But his career is a pattern of alternate triumphs and
reverses. On each of these occasions, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>
confronts either himself or “Pop Fisher,” and each is an opportunity for
acquiring self-knowledge which in turn defines his identity. It is an
indication of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>’s
immaturity that he fails to recognize and grasp these opportunities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

integrity and self-confidence is his refusal to submit himself along with the
others to the hypnotic treatment of Dr <span class=SpellE>Knobb</span>. But his
victory in this confrontation unfortunately finds expression in the inflation
of his ego. This situation brings to light another aspect of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>’s quest–his rebellion against a
father-figure. In each of the two parts, we see two father-figures in relation
to the hero–one authoritarian and the other benign. He rebels against the
authoritarian figure, but succeeds in killing, at least figuratively, the
benign figure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

primary requirement for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>

passionate longing <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for<i> </i></span>Pop
Fisher’s niece Memo Paris prevents him from doing this. Because of his

unconscious resistance retards <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his
quest. The former is dramatized in his smashing the clock at </span><span
class=SpellE>Ebbetsfield</span> stadium with one of his hits. He wishes to
attain immortality in baseball by establishing all-time records <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the game. This search for immortality
has elements of both solipsism and search for integration. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

lost </span>unity within the self”.<sup>2</sup> <span class=GramE>This</span>
search for identity impels him to try to repudiate his past and recreate
himself with a new identity. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>’s quest for love
should have aided his quest for identity as his capacity to love somebody makes
a man of him, and thus gives him identity. But his choice of the wrong woman
vitiates and obstructs this quest. He recognizes the pernicious influence of
his association with Memo on his playing ability, yet perversely continues to
long for her love. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his own as well as Pop Fisher’s failures with it. But his sense of insecurity
and his impatience to establish himself as a hero prevent him from effecting
the necessary curtailment of his ego. Luckily for Roy, his rival <span

attempt to match <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Roy</st1:place></st1:City>’s

egoistic declaration that he wishes “to be the best there ever was in the game”
(p. 108). We also notice the persistence of his purely physical view of love.
Despite unmistakable indications of her <span class=SpellE>unnaturality</span>,

visualizes a social purpose for his abilities, but is as yet incapable of the
self-discipline necessary to subordinate his ego to the interest of the team as
a whole. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lemon effects a qualitative change in his personality. He becomes capable of
social commitment and of using his talent for the benefit of others. At a time
when his performance is at the worst, he is requested by the father of a
desperately sick young fan to hit a “homer” and save the life of the boy. He
feels quite incapable of keeping such a promise, knowing that the boy would be
listening to the commentary on the game. Yet, to save the life of the boy, he
promises to try to hit a homer. This release from altruism enables <st1:City

life-saving homer. At the moment of hitting the homer, he has an insight into
the true nature of Memo. Despite this, however, he continues to adopt a
negative view of suffering, and seeks to evade it. This attitude of mind renders
him incapable of appreciating the truth of Iris Lemon’s advice that suffering
makes good people better and “brings us toward happiness.” (p. 149) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

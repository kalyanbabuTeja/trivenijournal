<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
modern leader, if he glances through the pages of the English periodicals of
the last decade of the last century, is struck by the many complimentary
remarks made there about Mrs. Flora Annie Steel’s novels of Anglo-Indian life. <span
class=GramE><sup>l</sup></span> As a novelist, she seems to have come rapidly
to the fore. Whenever a new novel appeared, it was received with a sense of
pleasurable anticipation. The reviewer almost always expressed with confidence
the hope that the new book would not fall short of expectations. <sup>2</sup>
Even if it was feared that a new novel might not add much to the author’s
reputation, that it was less effective than the best of the earlier works, the
reviewer was apologetic in tone.<sup> 3</sup> He was not slow to admire the
many other merits of the novel, and hoped to be excused for the severity of his
remarks on the plea that Mrs. Steel’s work had always been so excellent, that
she had been so exceptionally gifted, that the readers justly felt impatient
when they saw her decline into cheap effects and hasty workmanship.<sup> 4</sup>
<i>On the Face of the Waters </i>was praised so highly that a reviewer was
inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses merely for the sake of a change.<sup>5</sup>
Obviously, Mrs. Steel must have been a noted and popular novelist in her day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:26.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
of the contemporary reviewers were eager to point out that she was superior to
other Anglo-Indian writers. <i>The Spectator </i>said: “Mrs. Steel as an artist
is far beyond Miss <span class=SpellE>Frere</span>, whose old<i> <span
class=SpellE>Deccan</span> Days </i>is limited in scope, or Major Meadows
Taylor, <span class=GramE>whose</span> <st1:place w:st="on"><i>Tara</i></st1:place><i>
</i>gives only one side of Indian character, or the author of <i>A Rajah’s Heir
</i>whose remarkable insight has penetrated the dreamy </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>depths
of Hindu society, but has, so to speak, been captured there.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
6</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Compared with the Anglo-Indian novelists, Mrs.
Steel exhibits many points of contrast.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 7</span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Most of them did not hide their dissatisfaction with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Sir Arthur <span
class=SpellE>Lyall</span> named <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE>,</span>
the “land of regrets” for it </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was to him a land of “trial and woe, the
land of tall dark monuments and vainly proud sepulchral possessions.” Delafield
Arnold in his <i>Oakfield </i>depicted the feeling of revulsion at the
dissipation of the Anglo-Indian community and their total indifference to
native welfare. Even Rudyard Kipling, portraying the sorrows and cruelties of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, called
her “the grim step-mother of our kind.” Mrs. Steel strikes a new note
altogether with her open avowal of love for India.<sup>8</sup> If her
contemporaries<sup>9</sup> confined themselves to the theme of the tragedy of
Anglo-Indian novels, Mrs. Steel’s novels embrace a wider scope. If the Indian
background in Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Savi’s</span> novels is merely
ornamental, in Mrs. Steel’s it forms an intrinsic part. <span class=GramE>If
Mrs. Bell’s Anglo-Indian women<sup>10</sup> mix with the Indian people in order
to maintain the prestige of the “sahib-<span class=SpellE>logue</span>” in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Mrs.
Steel’s<sup>11</sup> mix freely with the Indians without any such motive.</span>
The Indian women, depicted in the novels even of the Anglo-Indian women
novelists<sup>12</sup> are usually strange, unreal creatures. Mrs. Steel is
perhaps the only Anglo-Indian novelist whose Indian women are convincing.<sup>13</sup>
Mrs. Penny<sup>14</sup> thinks that a Hindu woman is either a cook in the
kitchen or a mother in the nursery. She is a bitter critic of the materialism
of a Hindu wedding regarding it as “the union between a <span class=GramE>couple</span>
of well-bred animals.”<sup>15</sup> Mrs. Steel has better knowledge of Indian
life and so she admires the Hindu marriage based not on personal pleasure but a
duty to the unborn. Her Indian widows<sup>16</sup> evoke our respect by their
austerity, filial love and sacrificing nature; her Indian wives are selfless
and devoted to their husband’s family.<sup>17</sup> In other Anglo-Indian
novels<span class=GramE>,<sup>18</sup></span> when an Englishwoman marries an
Indian, the problem is quickly solved by convenient happenings such as the
dissolution of the marriage, the Englishwoman discovering a former wife of her
Indian husband to be still alive. Mrs. Steel’s Chris Davenant<sup>19</sup>, the
cultured Hindu Barrister, claims our sympathies more than the vulgar,
uneducated, white woman he has married, mistaking her for Shakespeare’s Portia
or <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> Lady. In the matter of politics, <span class=SpellE>Mrs</span>,
Steel’s attitude is much more liberal than that of other contemporary
novelists. If Mrs. Savi<sup>20</sup> Mrs. Penny<sup>21</sup>, Beresford<sup>22</sup>,
and Sir Henry Cunningham blame the English rulers for surrendering to Indian
wishes, and allowing the <span class=SpellE>Swadeshi</span> movement to
progress, Mrs. Steel, on the other hand, is keen on the progress of the Indian
peasant and the revival of indigenous Indian arts and crafts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
in her choice of themes, her depiction of the Indian scene, her complete
identification with the Indian characters, her knowledge and understanding of
India and finally in her sympathetic attitude to this country, Mrs. Steel
stands apart from other contemporary Anglo-Indian novelists of her time.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the real test of a great novelist lies in revealing human nature to her reader.
“….it is the function of the novelist to reveal the hidden life at its
source....”<sup> 23</sup>, says E. M. Forster. The final estimate of Mrs. Steel
as a novelist will be decided by her success in revealing Indian character. “<st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> will be
revealed one day to Englishmen, if it is ever revealed in a novel…..” so had <i>The
Spectator</i><sup>24</sup><i> </i>observed. Mrs. Steel wrote with the sole
object of revealing <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to her countrymen. She did succeed in removing the Englishman’s ignorance of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, and increasing his respect for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s past
heritage. But her success in this regard will depend mainly on the creation of
Indian characters that are unveiled to the English reader. Though her
characterization is generally less individual than Kipling’s she has created
some Indian characters that she alone, with her complete knowledge of the East
and the west, could delineate. Her portrait of that secluded woman, ‘Glory of
Woman’, Kipling could never have drawn. With her close knowledge of the Indian
women, she could bring home to the English reader the sorrows of a childless
Hindu wife. Knowing from close knowledge the simple, poor, yet honest and loyal
people of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
she could delineate the simple Brahman <span class=SpellE>Gopal</span>, ‘the
Village Legacy’ <span class=SpellE>Nuttia</span>, the aboriginal <span
class=SpellE>Gu-gu</span> and <span class=SpellE>Nagdeo</span>, and the
unfortunate ‘Shah <span class=SpellE>Sujah’s</span> mouse’. Having lived with
Hindu families<sup>25</sup> she could describe the happy and irresponsible life
of a young married Hindu girl<sup>26</sup> living in a joint family, <span
class=GramE>Her</span> whimsical Jan-Ali-Shan is a Dickensian character; her
sketch of small Jerry<sup>27</sup> evokes comparison with Kipling’s ‘<span
class=SpellE>Bootles</span>’ baby’. By creating Jerry as also Blazes<span
class=GramE>,<sup>28</sup></span> Mrs. Steel has proved her ability to do the
difficult thing–viz., delineate a child. Though there are examples of
unsuccessful characterization in her novels, <i>The Law of the Threshold, The
Curse of Eve </i>and <i>The Builder, </i>though some of her successful
presentations of the Indian money-lender and the Indian servant are types, she
has also created some individual characters that will stand comparison with
Kipling’s creations. <span class=SpellE>Khojee</span>, Mrs. Boynton, <span
class=SpellE>Moolraj</span> and <span class=SpellE>Raby</span> are some of her
individualized characters. <span class=GramE>Mrs. Boynton ranks<sup>29</sup>
with Kipling’s Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Hauksbee</span>.</span> Her ability to
delineate poetic characters is revealed in her successful portrayal of <span
class=SpellE>Abool</span> <span class=SpellE>Bukre</span>, the mad potter, and
Jan-Ali-Shan. All these poetic characters recall Scott’s Madge Wildfire, for
like her, it is their talk interspersed with snatches of poetry this gives them
a touch of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet,
with this acknowledgment of her ability to create life-like characters, we must
admit that Mrs. Steel has not been able to create an Indian who is a consistent
and reasonable being, his apparent inconsistencies being linked together by
some mental thread. She has described his inconsistencies wonderfully, but the
reader tries in vain to find the mental thread that holds them together. Some
ray of light is missing. Mrs. Steel’s educated Indians are not entirely
convincing, because she could not completely understand the aspirations of the
educated Indians for freedom, though she could imagine the mental conflict that
broke their brave spirits. She must be congratulated on giving a touch of real
kingliness to King Bahadur Shah <sup>30</sup> which <span class=GramE>even</span>
his “evil genius”<sup> 31</sup> <span class=SpellE>Zeenut</span> <span
class=SpellE>Maihl</span> could not wholly govern. Yet these characters, as
also that of the profligate <span class=SpellE>Abool</span> <span class=SpellE>Bukre</span>,
with their varied merits, remain unsatisfying to the reader of her <i>On the
Face of the Waters. </i>We do not feel entirely convinced that these historical
characters were murderers; we cannot accept the <span class=SpellE>authoress’s</span>
explanation that the Mutiny was a mere palace conspiracy. We fail to catch the
secret spring that set the Indian multitudes in motion in a half-successful
effort to overthrow the foreign yoke. The reason of this failure is that with
all her sympathy, tenderness, close observation and deep knowledge of Indian
life, Mrs. Steel was unable to understand the political aspirations of the
Indian. But we need not blame her much for this inability. She was too early in
the day to do so. Only a novelist who knows <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
as Scott did <st1:country-region w:st="on">Scotland</st1:country-region> or
Thackeray did the English society, one who is Western in thought but Eastern in
sympathies, who knows the women of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, can perform the difficult
task. In the absence of such a genius, let us be content with Mrs. Steel whom <i>The
Spectator </i>described as “...the nearest approach to such a one”<sup> 32</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>E.
M. Forster’s <i>Passage to India </i>is considered a thought provoking book on
Anglo-Indian relationship, and a comparison of our authoress with Forster will
not be irrelevant. The two pictures of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> as they emerge from the
writings of the two novelists present many points of contrast. Mrs. Steel gives
her readers a larger and more comprehensive picture of Indian life than does
Mr. Forster. But then, Mrs. Steel’s knowledge of this country was deeper and
fuller, because it was the result of a long residence of twenty-two years. Mr.
Forster’s acquaintance with <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
was the outcome of his two visits to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, one in 1912, and the other
in 1922. From a variety of literary forms such as novels, short stories,
histories and descriptive treatises on India, emerges Mrs. Steel’s picture of
India, which consequently is more vivid and varied than Mr. Forster’s whose
observations are limited to the confines of one single novel. Mrs. Steel’s <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> is the <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
as it existed before 1900; Mr. Forster’s <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
represents the country in the year 1912 and this also accounts for some of the
points of difference noticed in their two portrayals of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Steel’s works give us a true picture of the teeming millions of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Mrs.
Steel’s <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is picturesque and romantic; though the atmosphere is frequently disturbed by
rebellions and risings it regains its balance within a short time. The revolts
in her novels are the result not of any conscious, patriotic effort on the part
of the Indians to free <span class=GramE>themselves</span> from a foreign yoke;
it is a handful of mischief-makers that arouse the peace-loving but
dissatisfied ignorant masses against their masters. The fault lies with the masters
also, since their complacency and ignorance of the subjects is one of the
causes of the rebellion. Mrs. Steel’s <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, in spite of these frequent
disturbances, is a peaceful country; its people are lovable and honest. Her <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a
beautiful country which a foreigner would like to visit again and again.
Probably <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was such a place for the English people before 1900, when the Indian national
movement was still in its infancy and the British power was at its zenith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Forster’s <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
on the other hand, is not a very likable place. The novel gives the impression
of the restlessness and suspicion that existed in the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> of 1912
or thereabout. The partition of Bengal, though later cancelled, had aroused a
fire of angry protest from all quarters of educated <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Many of the earlier patriots
had lost their faith in the British sense of justice and had turned fanatics or
terrorists. Mr. Forster’s Dr. <span class=SpellE>Aziz</span> represents this
class of patriot, who, once a friend of the Englishman, has turned his enemy. The
social relationships of the Anglo-Indian community and the Indian people have
been ruptured beyond repair, and as the end of the novel proclaims<i> </i>can

characters of the two novelists present sharp contrasts. Mrs. Steel’s Chris <span
class=SpellE>Davenant</span> is a refined gentleman representing Hindu culture
at its best. Like a truly learned man, he is not dogmatic about anything, but
is constantly in doubt. So are Mrs. Steel’s other educated Indians like Maya
Day, <span class=SpellE>Ramanund</span>, <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span>,
while her Brahman philosophers are some of the most peace-loving and learned
people in the world. Mr. Forster’s Dr. <span class=SpellE>Aziz</span> is a
fanatical Muslim while Dr. <span class=SpellE>Godbole</span> lacks the
broad-minded outlook of Mrs. Steel’s Chris <span class=SpellE>Davenant</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Akas</span> Ram or <span class=SpellE>Ramanund</span>. Mrs.
Steel’s Anglo-Indians are well-meaning and straightforward. They admire gifted
Indians like Maya Day and Chris <span class=SpellE>Davenant</span>. Their
attitude to the Indian people is not jingoistic and supercilious as is that of
some of Mr. Forster’s Anglo-Indians. But then, we must realize that Mr. Forster
is describing people as they behave when faced by a war. The two communities,
as Mr. Forster saw them in 1912, were haunted by fears and suspicions of the
enemy such as are noticed in every war. Mr. Forster’s Anglo-Indians and Indians
would behave differently when the war was over, and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> gained her independence. But
he has certainly given us a truer picture of educated <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> than does
Mrs. Steel. If her picture is romantic, his is realistic. He has tried to enter
the mind and heart of the patriotic Indian, and diagnose his malady. Mrs. Steel’s
educated Indians are not entirely convincing because she has failed to
understand their aspirations towards freedom; the historical Indian characters
in her famous novel <i>On the Face of the Waters </i>are not completely
satisfying, because the authoress did not realize that the Mutiny was not
merely a palace-intrigue but an attempt to free the country from foreign
bondage. Mr. Forster is one of the very rare Englishmen who have been able to
appreciate the educated Indian’s longing for, freedom. Mrs. Steel, unlike most
of the Anglo-Indian writers including Mr. Forster, is not interested so much in
Anglo-India as in native India, and in her depiction of native Indian life
there will be very few Anglo-Indian writers to approach her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is Rudyard Kipling with whom Mrs. Steel’s work must be compared before a
niche is carved for her in Anglo-Indian fiction. For Kipling is “probably
destined for many years to be the colossus, beneath whose huge legs other
literary Anglo-Indians must crawl...”<sup>33 </sup>It has been shown how her
work was often compared by her contemporaries with that of Kipling. Oaten<sup>34</sup>,
comparing her with Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Croker</span> and Mr. Edward Cotes,
observed that she was the greatest of the three. He called Mrs. Steel “The
greatest novelist, in the strictest sense of the word”<sup> 35</sup>, of whom
Anglo Indian literature could boast. Oaten bracketed Mrs. Steel with Rudyard
Kipling and Sir Alfred <span class=SpellE>Lyall</span>, with the remark that

the truth of representation, Mrs. Steel is undoubtedly Kipling’s superior.
Kipling arrived in India when he was 17 and left it for good at the age of 24.
Kipling’s was a boy’s eye-view of India described with a boy’s gusto. That is
why he was attracted by soldiers and animals, jungles and the frontiers. The
higher thoughts that appeal to the mature mind, the religious and spiritual
aspects of India, remained unnoticed by his boyish mind. On the other hand,
Mrs. Steel had lived for 22 years in close contact with the Indian people in
lonely out- stations where no European company was available, so that she was
able to obtain a mature insight into native India, thanks to her maturity,
close observation and deep interest in the people of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
such wide difference in their experience of Indian life, it is not surprising
that their conception of India shows divergence. Kipling’s India was divided
into two classes, “the sahibs” and “the natives”. Between these two classes
were the Eurasians, the <span class=SpellE>sepoys</span> and the university-trained
educated Indians whom Kipling called “hybrid” in a contemptuous manner.
Kipling’s experience of India was not only short and superficial, it was also
restricted. He was a man whose activities were essentially male; it was
difficult for him to understand women. It was said that he saw women through
the eyes of other women. As Cyril Falls remarked, his women were mysterious,
undependable and difficult to understand. It is possible that because he did
not know women<sup>36</sup> at first hand, he attributed to them supernatural
and mysterious powers. Critics who admired his private soldiers were
disappointed when they found that those soldiers did not exist. Sir Francis
Younghusband<sup>37</sup> went further and said there were never such soldiers.
Le <span class=SpellE>Gallienne</span> and Bernard Shaw thought that Kipling
lived in an out of-date world. Turning to Mrs. Steel, the reader finds that he
has come to a totally different novelist. Though she was a woman, outdoor
adventures like wars, revolts, riots and camp-life were as familiar to her as
the domestic life of native India. She had not been a mere tourist; but as a
social worker, medial adviser and educationist, she had mixed with the Indian
people and worked for them. Being a woman, she could observe from close
quarters the life of the secluded women of India. Mrs. Steel is therefore in a
position to give us a complete picture of native India; her intimate knowledge
of the orthodox customs in Hindu and <span class=SpellE>Mahomedan</span>
households as also the details of Indian rural life enable her to give a
faithful representation of the real India, inhabited not only by sahibs,
soldiers and servants but by many others who make it a country of teeming
millions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mrs. Steel is Kipling’s superior in the truth of representation, she is also
more generous in her outlook and attitude to India. Kipling accepted as
principles mere statements whose validity he was too lazy to examine. He was a
reactionary in politics and never thought that India could be governed by
Indians. His picture of India is unreal; his soldiers are said to be out of
date. And yet, such is his creative art that, in spite of all these shortcomings,
he is regarded the greatest writer that Anglo-India has produced. If his
soldiers were fictitious, a few years after they were created, the real
soldiers talked exactly as Kipling had taught them to do in his stories. If his
soldiers spoke in a language that was never used by real soldiers of the time,
those that followed in later years even in the First Great War spoke the
language of <i>Barrack-room Ballads. </i>In a fleeting moment, he makes us
believe that his characters lived and did the things he puts in their mouth;
all the incongruities pass unnoticed. If his subject-matter is unreal, he
identifies himself with it in such a manner that it acquires unique vitality.
That he could ‘tell a lie’ in such a triumphant manner means that he was a
great imaginative artist. In literature, the illusion of reality is more
important and more difficult to achieve than faithful imitation of reality.
Mrs. Steel achieved the latter. Her depiction of India is a faithful rendering
of reality. But her characters are not as convincing and life-like as Kipling’s
and in this respect Kipling is the master.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
regard to the art of writing, the two Anglo-Indian writers stand on different
pedestals. Kipling’s work shows uniform excellence while Mrs. Steel’s is
unequal. If hurry and carelessness mar some of Mrs. Steel’s writing, Kipling’s
work exhibits the care he bestowed on it. He polished and republished his work
till he could polish no more. But mere polishing will not account for the high
level of excellence maintained by his Indian stories which were not kept long
enough to be polished again and again. We have therefore to acknowledge the
fact that Kipling was one of the born artists who require no apprenticeship. In
the matter of language, he had a copious vocabulary. At times, when he was
carried away by gaudy words, he painted with a spade. But usually, his touch
was deft. Mrs. Steel shows Kipling’s defects oftener. Kipling generally <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> economy and was only sometimes extravagant with
words. Mrs. Steel is many times profuse with words. In perfect and deliberate
patterning of sentences, he was not <span class=SpellE>equalled</span> by Mrs.
Steel. Kipling was attracted by technical jargon and oddities of language; he
used various dialects boldly–Irish, Scot, Yorkshire, Cockney, German and English.
In the latter respect, Mrs. Steel resembles him, but while she was always
accurate<sup> 41 </sup>he made mistakes which none but an expert could detect.
The rush and the sweep of his narrative was such that even an expert was
carried through it, blinded to the mistakes of the language. Kipling could use
the illuminating word or the pregnant phrase with effect; Mrs. Steel also
exhibited this quality in some of her best short stories. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had a gift for aptly chosen and arresting names while she was happy in the choice

pictorial writing, but the danger of its turning into a purple passage rarely
occurred in his case. He was a great story teller, which we cannot say about
Mrs. Steel. Like her he excelled in descriptions rather than dialogues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

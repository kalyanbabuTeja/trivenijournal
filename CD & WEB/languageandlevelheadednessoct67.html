behoves this privileged Hindi section of the people to see that their non-Hindi
brethren do not suffer disadvantages deriving from a geographical incidence.
The fact that the English Schedule to the Constitution mentions all the
fourteen languages as national languages is a pointer in this direction. The
blessing and the boost Hindi received gave a lever to a section–a sizable and

Nehru had abundant common sense whatever his other virtues might have been.
While he was emphatic as a free nation should have our own national language,
he was quick to realise that the introduction of Hindi as the official language
should in no way prejudice the interests of non-Hindi people. Speaking in the
Lok Sabha on August 7, 1959, he said that English would be retained as an
associate official language “as long as people require it, and I would leave
the decision for that not to the Hindi-knowing people but to the
non-Hindi-knowing people.” And Lal Bahadur Shastri who, as Railway Minister,
refused to present his budget in English and even before he succeeded Nehru as
Prime Minister, also realised the injustice that would be engendered by
replacing English with Hindi. Speaking at the convocation of all-India Youth
Congress in September, 1962, he observed: “English is more or less a common
language of all states, and communication between the states and the centre is
in English: and if English were to be dropped, India would be divided into
water-tight compartments and the country would be disintegrated. The question
of language should be considered in the wider context of national integration.”
For their part, non-Hindi States who had originally demanded a constitutional
amendment for making English an associate official language came down as a peg
and were prepared to accept the proposed Official Language (Amendment) Bill
which has yet to be introduced in Parliament. Countries like Canada, Belgium
and Switzerland have plurality of official languages. There is no reason why
India should hesitate to accept English as an associate official language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pave the way for emotional integration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

suggestion to retain English and international terms will be treated by some
purists as <i>infra dig </i>as it would undermine our languages. But adoption
and adaptation of foreign words cannot in today’s one-world concept and
context, be completely avoided nor an ostrich-like attitude can automatically
put our nationalism on a high pedestal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

English, today, is such a rich language, it is largely, or even wholly, because
of its ever-willing readiness to borrow words from other languages including
those of India. In an article on “Linguistic wealth from the Indies,” Lincoln
Barnett observes that while some individual English words have worked their way
into the various Indian languages, “the reverse process has been of quite a
different order. The Oxford English Dictionary lists 900 basic words derived
from India, plus thousands of derivatives.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is pertinent here to recall that the so-called
Arabic numerals, which are used all over the world, originated in India and
were carried westward by the Arabs. No nation is incapable of “manufacturing
its own numerals. Circumscribed feelings of nationalism have not blinded other
nations to the convenience of continuing the foreign numerals. Reciprocally,
therefore, our advocates of pure Swadeshi can feel proud that we too have
contributed a vital aspect of life to the world. Accordingly, we need not shut
our doors to “foreign” technical terms. </p>

us realise that acquisition of knowledge and its application to the welfare of
mankind is more important and urgent than squabbles over whether a word here or
a phrase there is our “own” or not. After all, are we not already using many
commonplace English words like “bus”, “road”, “rail” and ever so many English
names of implements like “wrench”, “screw”, “nut”, etc.? Let us not become back
numbers by trying to treat English words as “untouchables.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the passing of Jawaharlal Nehru, as with the passing of King Arthur of Ancient
Britain, “the old order <span class=SpellE>changeth</span>, yielding place to
new.” Next to Gandhiji, Nehru was the prime architect of India’s destiny.
During the freedom struggle, he was among the foremost of Gandhiji’s
lieutenants. Along with senior stalwarts like C. R. <span class=SpellE>Das</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Sardar</span> Patel, Rajendra Prasad, and his own father <span
class=SpellE>Motilal</span> Nehru, he played a significant role in the
three-decade fight for Indian Independence. He gave a new form and content to
the concept of freedom by urging, firstly, the case for complete Independence,
and secondly, by pleading for Socialism as a way of life. During the seventeen
years of his Prime <span class=SpellE>Ministership</span>, he laid the
foundations of the New India of his dreams of her democracy, her economic and
social structure, of her dedication to the ideal of international peace and
goodwill. </p>

none;text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Not
since the assassination of Gandhiji has the nation sustained a loss comparable
to the sudden collapse of Nehru. And all nations have shared India’s grief, and
offered reverential homage to his memory. Scholar and statesman, lover of
humanity and champion of the rights of nations yearning for freedom, Nehru
occupies an exalted place among the immortals of recent centuries. He was
endowed with rare gifts of personal charm, and supreme ability as a speaker and
writer wielding words of winged power. He won the affection of millions of men,
women and children of all lands and of all faiths. </p>

have cleared all the files,” were almost his last words, as he attended to his
official work far into the night after returning from his brief holiday at <span
class=SpellE>Dehra</span> Dun. He may not have had any premonition of the end
of all earthly striving; but the words were prophetic. They represent too his
attitude to all work–as a joyous <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> of
self-chosen tasks. On the morning of the 27th of May he sank into an
unconscious state following a spasm of pain. Within a few hours the Light went
out, in the presence of his dearly loved daughter <span class=SpellE>Indira</span>
<span class=SpellE>Devi</span> and the comrades who had a glimpse of his
visions. </p>

class=SpellE>Dehra</span> Dun he had met, for the last time as it turned out,
his life-long friend Sri <span class=SpellE>Prakasa</span>. That meeting was
memorable, between the hero who was still at the helm and his erstwhile
colleague, who had chosen to drop the oars and let the placid stream of life
glide on its way to Eternity. The son of <span class=SpellE>Motilalji</span> of
<span class=SpellE>Prayag</span> and the son of Sri <span class=SpellE>Bhagvan</span>
<span class=SpellE>Das</span> of <span class=SpellE>Kashi</span>,–they formed
an inevitable pair–trained to the profession of Law but abandoning it at the
call of the Father of the Nation, they worked in close co-operation to <span
class=SpellE>energise</span> the national movement in their home Province of U.
P. In 1930, Nehru was the President of the Congress and Sri <span class=SpellE>Prakasa</span>
the General Secretary. And now, after half-a-century of unbroken friendship,
they fell to comparing notes in Sri <span class=SpellE>Prakasa’s</span> quiet
home, far from the busy haunts of men. One has only to recall that scene to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> the intensity of the abiding love which invested
their lives with the halo of a medieval romance. And let us remember that this
was but one of many such links which bound Jawaharlal Nehru to his friends of
early days. </p>

none;text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
leader of a nation was intensely poetic, responsive to the appeal of literature
and the fine arts, and moved to his depths in contemplation of sunset and dawn,
the wide expanses of green fields, the surging ocean and the swift-flowing
river. The lofty snow-clad Himalayas held him in thrall. He was an artist to
his finger tips: his <i>Autobiography </i>is replete with passages which, in
imaginative <span class=SpellE>splendour</span> and poetic expression, deserve
to rank with the best in English Literature. He <span class=SpellE>realised</span>,
as few had done, the cultural unity of India. As President of the Sahitya <span
class=SpellE>Akademi</span>, he made this affirmation of faith: “We are busy
with the econo­mic development of our country...But it does not cover the whole
of life. Without art and literature, life would be rather a dull and uninspiring
affair. It is largely in art and literature that a nation gives expression to
its inner feelings.” It was this faith which drew him to Rabindranath Tagore
and his <span class=SpellE>Visva</span>-Bharati. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While
at school in Harrow, young Jawaharlal received, as a prize, one of <span
class=SpellE>Trevelyan’s</span> famous books on Garibaldi. This led to his
study of the great movement for the freedom and unification of Italy–the <i>Risorgimento.
</i>It is worthy of note that Nehru combined in his own nature the heroism of
Garibaldi, the idealism of <span class=SpellE>Mazzini</span> and the wise
statesmanship of <span class=SpellE>Cavour</span>. But the nearest parallel to
the commanding position occupied by Nehru in modern Indian life is that of <span
class=SpellE>Pericles</span> of Athens, the builder of Athenian democracy and
the embodiment of all that was noblest in the Golden Age of Greece. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
that the towering personality of Nehru has been removed from the Indian scene,
we begin to perceive the contours of the new order. The most striking of these
is the emergence of a Prime Minister of India who is but “the first among
equals” in his Cabinet. After the passing away of <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>
Patel, there was none among Nehru’s colleagues who could be even a good second
to him, and this situation led to the incessant demand that Nehru should
nominate his successor. But Nehru wisely declined to name his heir, for he felt
that a well-ordered democracy could not fail to discover its leader. The manner
in which Sri Lal Bahadur was chosen is a striking testimony to the vitality
that persists in the Congress organisation, despite its weaknesses and its
tendency towards <span class=SpellE>groupism</span>. There is a widespread
feeling, however, that the correct procedure was to let the Parliamentary Party
of the Congress make a free choice without interference from the <span
class=SpellE>orga­nisational</span> wing of the Congress Party, represented by
the President of the Congress and the Working Committee. The choice might have
been the same, but it is necessary to keep the distinction clear between the
Congress as a Party organisation which wins the elec­tions and outlines the
main features of the Party’s policy, and the Cabinet which represents the
majority of the Congress members of Parliament. The Prime Minister and his
Cabinet ought to be in complete control of the governance of the country and
the actual implementation of policies and programmes. Any intrusion by the
Party bosses outside Parliament into this sphere is apt to result in mischief
and confusion in public affairs. Once a Prime Minister of the Indian Union or
the Chief Minister of any State is installed in office by virtue of his election
as the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party at the Centre or the State
Legislature Party in a State, the President of the all-India Congress organisa­tion
or the President of the Pradesh Congress Committee ought not to meddle with the
day-to-day administration. The executive Head of the Indian Union or of a
component State must be supreme in his own sphere and be responsible solely to
the majority of the members of the Legislature belonging to all Parties, the
Government or the Opposition. That the head of Party organisation should seek
to control him at every stage is definitely a disturbing trend in Indian public
life. </p>

none;text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
welcome feature of the new order is the enhanced prestige and moral influence
of the President of the Indian Union. It is being gradually <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
that the <span class=SpellE>Rashtrapathi</span> is the constitutional Head of
the Republic of India and a living symbol of its unity and majesty. No one
raised to this exalted position should be dwarfed by the Prime Minister who, in
consonance with the conventions of a democratic Constitution, should be content
to take the second place in the eye of the nation and of the leaders of the
nations with whom India maintains diplomatic relations. It is the President’s
right to <span class=GramE>advise</span>, to warn and to encourage the Ministers.
Being above all parties, he is capable of taking a national as opposed to a
Party view. </p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Tagore did not elaborate a theory of aesthetics for
himself. All the same, a careful reading of his critical works would seem to
reveal certain fundamental principles of art which inspired all that he wrote
on the subject. The first of these principles is unity. It is not merely a
unity of man with his fellow beings which Tolstoy, we remember, set down as the
function of all good art, but it is one that unites man with the vaster
universe, the life and nature around him. Starting from the principle of unity,
Tagore goes on to another, which is that literature must express man, the
inmost and the real in him,–not the actual person who is yet struggling to
transcend himself, but the ideal one that lives in our heart and draws us
above. To Tagore, the real is the ideal. This, again, leads him to a third
principle, that literature a help to self-realisation our self is the self at
one with all the rest of the world and it is the ideal we perceive we have
still to realise. Literature, we have seen, expresses these two aspects of our
higher self, and so it must help in self-realisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We have already said that Tagore never stated his
principles of art and literature schematically like professional philosophers.
The principles we have mentioned above have to be isolated from his critical
writings (which are more literary than philosophical) and their inter-relations
established after carefully finding our way through the mazes of his dazzling
literary arguments. These have a charm of their own, rich in metaphors and
similes, bright with happy concrete instances which illumine no less than they
confuse the bewildered reader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Let us take up his first principle of literature,
that of unity. One evening when he was on the river Padma and observing from
his boat the colours of the setting sun reflected on the clear waters, a fish
jumped up into the air quickly dived back into the water again. The poet then
thought of the of the joy of the silent world of living beings under the liquid
curtain, but his boat heaved a sigh and said, “Ah, what a big fish it was.” We
can well understand his feelings. Tagore says–“It may be said that his union
with nature was broken. His greed kept him pulled to the hollows of his
stomach. One cannot unite unless he forgets himself.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Man has many desires; one of them is to desire the
fish for eating. But there is a higher kind of desire–that to want <i>sahitya </i>or
union with the universe, to want to combine the ending day, gloriously lit by
the setting sun at the river’s side, with his mind and soul. This wish is the
wish to bring oneself out of his own inner obstacles.” (S.P.* Pp. 66-67). The
Bengali (also Sanskrit) word for literature is <i>Sahitya</i>. The root of this
word is <i>sahit</i> which means ‘to be with’. Tagore writes, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“From <i>sahit </i>arises the word <i>Sahitya</i>.
So, if the root meaning is considered, we can find a sense of union in the word
<i>Sahitya</i>.” (S. p. 109).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>So Tagore set it down that literature is the
expression of man’s innate desire to unite with the rest of the world. He
writes, “The consciousness of animals is mainly limited to biological living;
man’s consciousness is opening up paths of liberation in the universe; it is
spreading itself over the universe. Literature is one of these great paths.”
(S. P. p. 67).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>When man uses the world to serve some biological
need, he desires a part of it and rejects the rest, so that he disintegrates
it. “Gain comes from disintegration of the integral; true (aesthetic) delight
comes from integrating it.” (S. P. p. 16). Since literature is an expression of
this disinterested contemplation of things for their own sake, which serves to
unify man’s soul with, the world soul, an author should not be led by his
sensations only; he must have imagination. Tagore speaks of imagination thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“This imagination makes the path of union one which
is our own; it is through this imagination that a feeling of oneness is made
possible for us with that which is not our own; our spirit, entering even into
that, can make it all spiritual. This is man’s play (<i>lila</i>) and this is
his joy (<i>ananda</i>). (S. P. Pp. 70-1) The principle may be ultimately
traced back to the Upanisadic teaching, “Thou art That”. The soul and the world
are not external to each other but they are essentially one and the same. As we
gradually realise this fundamental identity, we feel the comprehension of our
so expanding and we are naturally delighted. “The function of our soul is to
fraternise (with others)”, says Tagore (in <i>Panchabhut </i>p. 32); due to
this fraternising, the soul is more and more at home with the rest of the
world. Literature is the expression of this rich experience made up of a
feeling of self-expansion (through assimilating to it more of the apparently
alien world of matter and life) and a feeling of joy that comes from
self-realisation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Now we come to Tagore’s second principle. It can be
deduced from the first. Since literature is the expression of our
self-expansion through assimilating to it more of what seems external to us, it
can also be said to the expression of our realisation of objects of this world
as our own, that of our intuitive vision of them in which we are one with them.
Thus only, one wins over nature bit by bit and comprehends it within his greater
self. In this realisation of a particular thing, since there is a close union
of the mind or spirit of man with the object, the truth about the object is not
different from that about the subject that knows it. “Here the revelation of
object and the revelation of my mind mean the same thing” (S. P. p. 45). So
that in literature we have the expression of man’s self along with the
impression of the things he intuits and expresses. “Science is engaged in
knowing some object. Science seeks to keep human personality apart from this
knowledge. Literature is engaged in man’s self-knowledge. Its truth depends on
man’s own realisations, not merely on the truth of objects.” (S. p. p. VIII).
The outer world is humanised by the artist’s mind which mixes its own feelings
of joy and sorrow, surprise and terror, with the manifold qualities of colour,
sound etc. of the world (see S. P. p. I). This nature humanised becomes the fit
material for literature (S. p. 2). Literature can thus be regarded as the
representation of man. Tagore writes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“The main indication of literature lies in its
relations with human life. Where is the mental life of man? It is there where
our intelligence and feelings, desires and experience, all melted into one,
have achieved a perfect unity of being; where our intelligence, instincts and
tastes work harmoniously together, in a word, where the real man is. It is
there that literature takes its birth.” (S. P. p. 163). Literature reveals this
real man. But the real in man cannot always be quite inferred from his actual
state; he has many weaknesses of which he is ashamed and which he fights to
overcome. His ideals and aspirations must also be considered as parts of his
personality. His potentiality or the nisus in him for the higher man must be
held as characterising the real in him. Again, the real is the ideal. Tagore
loved man and he respected him. He could never think of man as essentially weak
and degraded; he was ever an optimist with regard to man’s future. And he
believed that man expresses his purest aspirations and ideals, that is, real
self, in his arts and literature. He wrote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Thus it is that whatever is great in man, whatever
is permanent and cannot be exhausted through his action, is captured in
literature, and this naturally builds up the greater aspect of mankind.” (S. p.
63).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Again, “The picture of himself nearest to his
heart’s aspirations is in literature and arts–through this shape he can have
the comprehensive truth about himself in the midst of a multi divided life; he
can recognise himself. In great epics and dramas man has been collecting
knowledge of his own self and, transcending himself, he has been searching for
the object of his satisfaction. This is his art, his literature. In every
countryman has been protecting his true nature from the hands of his untrue
degradation. Man, even though he knows his destitution and distortion as facts,
does not yet believe as true. He establishes his truth in his creations.” (<i>Sahityer
Svarup</i>. p. 63).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus Tagore offers us an exalted conception of
literature. It has far deeper significance than what Matthew Arnold, for
example, could discover as ‘criticism of life’, ‘disinterested contemplation’
or ‘expression of sweetness and light’. In this respect Tagore’s conception of
literature may only be compared with Shelley’s idea of poetry. But Shelley’s
thought could not move beyond conceiving a poet as a prophet, the happiest of
men. Tagore regards a poet as some kind of <i>Yogi </i>who realises his higher
self and expresses this to his fellow men, one whose self is at one with the
universal soul. The poet places before his readers the highest ideals to which
man is moving and thus makes them conscious of the goal of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>So we pass on to Tagore’s third principle of
literature. This lays down that literature is not merely a light-hearted play
of imagination; it is also a <i>sadhana</i>, a mental and spiritual discipline
which leads one to self-realisation. “When my individual self realises the
infinite Self by uninterrupted intuition, realises through my heart, mind and
soul, he realises in Him his own self also. This principle of spiritual
discipline can be brought down to the field of literature.” (S. P. p. 53). This
infinite Self, which is dear to us, and which we seek to recover in us, finds
its expression in literature. Self-expression is thus a kind of
self-realisation. And since the self is the highest truth about man, literature
may be said to express this human truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Since the function of literature and the fine arts
is to express, therefore its main task is to give us a taste of truth, making
facts its medium. ‘I am an individual,’–this speaks of my limitations; here I
am separated from the extensive one. ‘I am a Man’,–this speaks of my direction
towards the Infinite; here, united with the great One, I am self manifested.”
(S. P. p. 20).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus it is that to Tagore literature has a great
significance with regard to the spiritual culture of mankind; it is more than
an instrument of social good, so dear to moralistic or political minded
authors. It is a means in the hands of a true prophet of bringing about a
spiritual awakening through the revelation of man’s higher self to man, a means
that is an end in itself. And this literature is optimistic, accompanied with a
delight that comes from the revelation of the real human self, which is to be
achieved and which is the ideal. This is at once our individual and social
objective, and so, literature, where it best fulfils its proper end, serves at
once the individual and social interests of man. It will not be incorrect to
characterise Tagore’s conception of literature as humanistic. Some may object
to this and would like to call it mystic. But it must be said that his
mysticism is not that of a pure philosopher or a <i>Yogi</i>, a mysticism that
borders on an abstract nihilism; it is that of a poet who rejoices in man and
who has the vision of higher and nobler human self, towards which man is
reaching slowly, over-coming the barriers of his lower self. It is a mysticism
that is full of hope and courage and is inspired by a feeling of love for man.
For Tagore, man is the primary truth; and if he believes in God and other
spiritual entitles not given in direct experience, he does so only for man, to
know and love man better. Tagore’s conception of literature, we repeat, is
essentially humanistic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

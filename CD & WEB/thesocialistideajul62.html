style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
can think of two very different ways of studying socialism. We can see it as a
scientific doctrine of the nature and evolution of societies in general and,
more specially, of the most civilized contemporary societies. In this case, the
analysis does not differ from that to which scholars submit the theories and
hypotheses of their respective sciences. They are considered abstractly,
outside of time, space, and of future history, not as something whose genesis
one attempts to find, but as a system of propositions which express, or are
seemed to express facts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Socialism,
on the contrary, may be conceived as something entirely oriented toward the
future, a plan for the reconstruction of societies, a, programme for a
collective life which does not exist as yet, or in the way it is dreamed of,
and which is proposed to men as worthy of their preference. It is an ideal. It
concerns itself much less with what is or was than what ought to be.
Undoubtedly, even under its most utopian forms it never disdained the support
of facts, and has even, in more recent times, increasingly affected a certain
scientific turn of phrase. It is indisputable that it has thus rendered social
science more service, perhaps, than it received from it. For it has aroused
reflection, it has stimulated scientific activity, it has instigated research,
posed problems, so that in more than one way its history blends with the very
history of sociology. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, there cannot be a scientific Socialism. Because, were such a Socialism
even possible, sciences would be necessary that are not yet developed and which
cannot be improvised. The only attitude that science permits in the face of
these problems is restraint and circumspection, and Socialism can hardly
maintain this without lying to itself. And, in fact, Socialism has not
maintained this attitude. Note even the strongest work–the most systematic, the
richest in ideas–that this school has produced: Marx’s <i>Capital. </i>What
statistical data, what historical comparisons, what studies would be
indispensable to solve any of the innumerable questions that are dealt with
there! Need we be reminded that an entire theory of value is established in a
few lines? The truth is that the facts and observations assembled by
theoreticians anxious to document their affirmations are hardly there except to
give form to the arguments. The research studies they made were undertaken to
establish a doctrine that they had previously conceived, rather than the
doctrine being a result of the research. Almost all had developed before asking
science for the help it could lend them. It is fervour that has been the
inspiration of all these systems; what gave them life and strength is pity for
the misery of the working classes, a vague sympathy for the travail of
contemporary societies, a thirst for a more perfect justice, etc. Socialism is
not a science, a sociology in miniature–it is a cry of grief, sometimes of
anger, uttered by men who feel most keenly our collective <i>malaise. </i>Socialism
is to the facts which produce it, what the groans of a sick man are to the
illness with which he is afflicted, to the needs that torment him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
this is so, then to study Socialism as a system of abstract propositions, as a
body of scientific theories, and to discuss it formally, is to see and show a
side of it which is of minor interest. Those aware of what social science must
be, of the slow pace of its processes, of the laborious investigations it implies
to resolve even the narrowest questions, cannot be fond of these premature
solutions these vast systems so summarily sketched out. One is too clearly
impressed with the discrepancy that exists between its simple methods and its
elaborate conclusions, and one is consequently prompted to scorn the latter.
But Socialism can be examined in an entirely different light. If it is not a
product of science, it is an object of science. As such, we do not have to
borrow from Socialism such and such a proposition ready made; but we do have to
know Socialism, and to understand what it is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
only does such an investigation have its usefulness, but it should prove in
other respects more fruitful than the usual examinations to which Socialism is
subjected. When studied only in order to discuss it from a doctrinaire point of
view, since it is based only on a very imperfect science, it is easy to show
how far it goes beyond the very facts on which it leans, or to oppose contrary
facts to it, in a word to criticize all its theoretic imperfections. One can,
without much difficulty, review all its systems; there is none whose refutation
is not relatively simple, because none are scientifically established. But as
scholarly and as well-conducted as it may be, such a critique remains
superficial, for it avoids what is essential. It concerns itself only with the
exterior and superficial form of Socialism and so does not perceive what gives
it depth and substance, namely collective diathesis, the profound uneasiness of
which the particular theories are merely the symptoms and episodic
superficialities. When one has sharply disputed the theories of Saint-Simon,
Fourier, or Karl Marx, one is not, for that, especially informed on the social
conditions which created them, which have been and still are there <i>raison
d’etre, </i>and which, in future, will produce other doctrines if these fall
into discredit. All these fine refutations are a veritable work of Penelope,
endlessly beginning again, because they touch Socialism from without, and
because what is within escapes them. They blame the effects, not the causes.
But it is the causes that must be attacked, if only to understand the effects.
For this purpose, Socialism must not be considered in the abstract, outside of
every condition of time and place. On the contrary, it is necessary to relate
it to the social setting in which it was born. It is essential not merely to
subject it to dialectic discussion, but rather to fathom its history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
all definitions, the one which is perhaps most consistently and generally
brought to mind whenever there is a question of Socialism, is that which has it
consist of a pure and simple negation of private property. I do not know, it is
true, of any passage by an authoritative writer where this formula is expressly
proposed, but it is found implicitly at the base of more than one of the
discussions that Socialism has occasioned. For example., Mr. Janet believes, in
his book on <i>Les Origines de Socialisme </i>(page 2) that, to firmly
establish that the French Revolution had no socialist character, it is
sufficient to have it understood that “it has not violated the principle of
property.” And yet one can say that there is not a single socialist doctrine to
which such a definition applies. Let us consider, for example, the one which
most limits private property–the collectivist doctrine of Karl Marx. It indeed
withdraws from individuals the right to possess the means of production, but
not to every form of wealth. They retain an absolute right over the products of
their work. Can this limited restriction of the principle of private property
be considered characteristic of Socialism? Our economic organization now
presents restrictions of the same kind, and in this regard is distinguished
from Marxism only by a difference in degree. Is not everything which is
directly or indirectly a monopoly of the state taken from the private domain?
Railways, post office, tobacco, manufacture of money, etc., cannot be carried
on by individuals, or can be only by virtue of an express concession of the
state. Shall we say then that in reality Socialism starts where the practice of
monopoly begins? If so, then it is everywhere: it is of all times and
countries, for there never has been a society without monopoly. This definition
is far too broad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further,
we can say as much of the concept–no less wide-spread–according to which
Socialism consists of a subordination of the individual to the collectivity of
the people. “We can define as socialist” says Adolphe Held, “every tendency which
demands the subordination of individual welfare to the community.”<sup>1</sup>
In like manner, Roscher, mixing judgement and criticism with his definition,
calls socialist those tendencies “which claim a consideration of the common
good above what human nature permits.”<sup> 2</sup> But there has never been a
society in which private interests have not been subordinated to social ends;
for this subordination is the very condition of all community life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there is also a definition which seems more suited to the object described.
Very often, if not always, Socialism has had as its principal aim the
amelioration of the condition of the working classes, by introducing greater
equality into economic relations. That is why it is called the economic
philosophy of the suffering classes. But this tendency of itself, is not
sufficient to characterize it, for it is not peculiar to it. Economists also
aspire to lessen inequality in social conditions; they believe, however, that
this progress ought to be made by the natural play of supply and demand and
that every legislative intervention is useless. Shall we then say that what
distinguishes Socialism is that it wishes to obtain this same result by other
means, namely by legal action? This was the definition of Laveleye. “Every
socialist doctrine,” he says, “aims to introduce more equality into social
conditions, and, secondly, to realize these reforms by action of the law or the
state.” <sup>3</sup> But, on the one hand, if this objective is distinctively
one which these doctrines pursue, it is necessary that it be theirs alone. And,
on the other hand, the connection between the state and large industries, great
economic undertakings, which by their importance embrace all of society, mines,
railways, banks, etc., has as its aim the protection of collective interests
against certain private influences, not the improvement of the lot of workers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Socialism
goes beyond the workingman’s problem. In certain of the systems it occupies
only a secondary place. This is the case with Saint-Simon, who is regarded as
the founder of Socialism. It is the case also with the academic socialists, who
are much more concerned with safeguarding the interests of the State than with
protecting the disinherited. On the other hand, there is a doctrine which aims
at realizing this equality much more radically than Socialism; it is Communism
which denies all private property and by that all economic inequality. But,
although there has often been this confusion, it is impossible to regard
Communism as a simple variant of Socialism. We will return shortly to this
question. Plato and More, on the one hand, and Marx, on the other, are not
disciples of the same school. <i>A priori, </i>it is not possible that a social
organization, conceived in contemplation of the industrial societies we
actually have under our eyes, could have been imagined when these societies had
not yet been born. Finally, there are many legislative measures which one could
not regard as exclusively socialist and which nonetheless have the effect of
diminishing the inequality of social conditions. The progressive tax on
inheritance and on income necessarily has this result, and nevertheless is not
a concomitant of Socialism. What should one say of the foundations granted by
the state, of the public welfare and loan institutions, etc.? If one labels
them as socialist, as sometimes happens in the course of running discussions,
the word loses every kind of sense, so broad and indefinite a connotation does
it take. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
denote as socialist every doctrine which demands the connection of all economic
function or of certain among them, which are at the present time diffused, to
the directing and conscious centres of society. It is important to note at once
that we say connection, not subordination. In fact, this bond between the
economic organisation and the state does not imply, according to our belief,
that the direction in every action should come from the latter. On the
contrary, it is natural that it receives from it as much as it gives it. One
can foresee that the industrial and commercial life, once put in permanent
contact, will affect its functioning, will contribute to determining the
manifestations of its activity much more than what it is to-day, will play in
the life of the Government a much more important role; and this explains how,
while complying with the definition we have just obtained, there are socialist
systems which tend to anarchy. It is because, for them, this transformation
must result in making the state subordinate to economic functions, rather than
putting them in its hands. Although Socialism is a common issue, we have been
able to see by the definitions given of it how inconsistent and even
contradictory is the notion commonly held of it. The adversaries of the
doctrine are not the only ones to speak of it without having a clear-cut idea.
Socialists themselves often prove–by the way they understand the word–that they
know only imperfectly their own theories. It constantly occurs that they take
this or that particular tendency for the whole of the system, for the simple
reason that they are personally impressed with one detail or the other.
Although the conflict of ideologies confuses the problem of Socialism and
leaves us without any clear-cut idea about it, we can still draw some
conclusions regarding its aim and method on the basis of our analysis of the
various socialist principles. We can maintain that Socialism stands for
equality, particularly for economic, social and political equality, dignity of
labour, and the general amelioration of the weaker sections of human society.
Strictly speaking, it not only tries to safeguard the interests of the workers
as Marxists and Syndicalists believe, but its efforts are directed towards the
progress of the whole society. It aims at eradicating from human society,
inequality of wealth and opportunities, poverty, ignorance, and every type of
exploitation by one class or another. It endeavours to free every individual
from want and frustration through fair distribution of wealth and chances, and
as such it attempts to promote justice in society. Further, it views society
not as monolithic, but as pluralistic in character, and to that effect it
attempts to preserve its diversified life by organizing workers’ and consumers’
guilds and trade unions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
achieve these aims, we cannot concede the Marxist or state-collectivist idea of
transferring all the powers to the state. With a view to safeguarding the
federal character of society, we cannot accept the state as an all-absorptive
and all-powerful authority. The acceptance of such a state, for the purpose of
Socialism, would mean the complete subordination of the individual initiative
and activity to the commands of those who actually wield the power of the
state. If Socialism stands as much for the collective life as for the
individual life, we then have to decentralize the state authority and transfer
most of its power to the masses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
the I World War there has been a general reaction against the authority of a
too-powerful state. The birth of pluralism may be traced as a reaction against
such a state. Even within Socialism we see various theories, such as
Syndicalism, Guild Socialism, and Trade Unionism, which have reacted against
the tendency of regarding the individual as a mere adjunct of state machinery.
All these theories support as much the idea of individual freedom as of group
and trade union activities in human society. There are various recent political
proposals for a decentralized application of social control. There are, for
example, the proposals to give greater recognition to vocational groups within
the Government service, by enlarging the powers and responsibilities of
association of public employees; the projects for re-invigorating local
governing units by enlarging their functions and increasing their
administrative autonomy, and the suggestions that the state, in recognising the
control of industry so as to bring about a fairer distribution of wealth and
broader opportunities of self-expression, should enlarge private systems of
joint control under state auspices rather than establish a direct governmental
administration or regulation of industrial enterprises. Most proposals, in
modern time, for state ownership now include plans for a considerable
devolution in the ordinary administration of the socialized industries. The
principle behind this is that a state-owned enterprize should be managed not by
politically-minded ministers, but by boards selected by the groups particularly
concerned in the efficient and equitable operation of the enterprise. Another
reaction against the all-inclusive centralized authority has been in the
direction of a greater localization of governmental control. The aim is to
preserve popular self-government against control by a Central Government which,
however, democratically constructed as to suffrage and the distribution of
representation, is too far away from the mass of citizens to know their needs
and opinions. Nowadays the vocational groups are taking an increasing part in
determining the action of formal governing bodies. This appears in the lobbying
activities of associations of labourers, professional </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>men,
farmers, manufacturers, traders, bankers, etc. All such proposals and group
activities clearly reflect the recent tendency of the human mind towards a
decentralized state authority. It is, therefore, necessary that authority
should be federalized and mass participation in political activity be
increased. Socialism cannot disregard this demand of the modern time. There is
always a danger in a powerful state that the agents through whom the state’s
purpose is expressed might misinterpret that purpose or pervert it to their own
ends. Prof. Laski remarked that “it is the clear lesson of history that no
class of men can retain over a considerable period of time sufficient moral
integrity to direct the lives of others. Sooner or later they pervert those
lives to their own ends.” </span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>4</span></sup><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Hence the only
way to guarantee that the government in any state will actually carry out the
purpose of the state is “to take steps to see that the decisions made by the
state take full account of the interests that will be affected by those
decisions……The sovereign power must be compelled, <i>a priori, </i>to make a
comprehensive effort to embody the wills of those over whom it rules in its
will before it is entitled to act upon them.”</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, the system of government must be democratic even in a socialist society.
In a democracy, where there are regular opportunities for the people to change
their rulers, the interests of those who wield power are more securely liked
with the interests of the people than under any other form of government. It is
not only the economic security that men need in life, but, at the same time,
they also want to participate in the process of administration. They should,
therefore, be allowed to express their opinion and judgement on almost all
social, political and economic questions. No doubt, a considerable degree of
central control is indispensable, but, to the utmost extent possible, there
should be devolution of the powers of the state to various kinds of
bodies–geographical, industrial, cultural–according to their functions. The
powers of these bodies should be sufficient to make them interesting, and to
cause energetic men to find satisfaction in influencing them. Bertrand Russell
remarks that “nothing is so damping and deadening to initiative as to have a
carefully thought out scheme vetoed by a central authority which knows almost
nothing about it and has no sympathy with its objects.”</span><sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
6</span></sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Therefore, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a more elastic and
less rigid system of government is needed if the best brains are not to be
paralysed. And it must be an essential feature of every democratic and a
socialist system that as much as possible of the power should be in the hands
of men who are interested in the work that is to be done. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
such, Socialism, to attain its desired goals of individual freedom, equality
and dignity of human labour and mind, must rely on more and more self-government
in industry and mass participation in the work of administration. G. D. H. Cole
was right when he said that democracy and Socialism had failed, not because
there was an appalling poverty among the masses, but because there was no
self-government in industry and we relied too much in state powers. As a matter
of fact, there is not much difference between the goals of democracy and
Socialism. Both strive for the progress of human society. Hence it is necessary
for the socialists that they should realize the new demands of the fastly
changing society without wasting their energies in the ideological differences
and work strenuously and sincerely for raising the economic, political and
educational standards of the masses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

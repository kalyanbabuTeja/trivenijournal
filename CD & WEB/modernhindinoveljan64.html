style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Any
review of Hindi fiction cannot fail to take into account the achievements and
contribution of <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span> in this field. If </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>one
looks at the vast panorama and the progressive march of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hindi
fiction one finds <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span> standing in all his glory
like a majestic tower in the middle of the road which all the previous forces
culminate to and the future takes a start from. He was the first novelist to
bring Hindi fiction into close contact with life and forge through its medium a
form capable enough to give adequate expression to life’s hopes and
aspirations. Above all, he was a beauty expert of Hindi fiction which achieved
a structural unity in his hands. We use the term structure to mean the
arrangement and interrelation of all the elements in the book governed by the
general character of the whole. <span class=SpellE>Premchand’s</span> novels
may be populous and extensive in spatial designs, they may contain a number of
episodes but they are well knit as intimate cause and effect into a single action
in obedience to a single impulse from start to finish. <span class=SpellE><i>Godan</i></span><i>,
<span class=SpellE>Sevasadan</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Gaban</i></span><i>,
</i>besides bringing down fiction from the blood-curdling height of horrors and
mystery to the ordinary flow of life, have positively established the reign of
structure and negatively raised a strong barrier against a <span class=GramE>repetition</span>
of the loose-structured novels of the pre-<span class=SpellE>Premchand</span>
era. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Modern
Hindi fiction has developed mostly as a reaction, to <span class=SpellE>Premchand’s</span>
art, for or against. <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span> had adopted in his
fiction, the point of view of an <span class=SpellE>ominiscient</span> author
who enters into the mind and thoughts of his characters, having a full control
over his narrative, commenting and interpreting in his own person as it suits
him. If we look to the core of the novels published year after year, not in
Hindi only but in European literature also, we will conclude that the
convention of the author’s omniscience has remained predominant, clear down to
the present day. There might have been some minor variations, the authors might
have tried to corporate in their plots certain special phenomena, cropping up
with the evolution of society and unknown during <span class=SpellE>Premchand’s</span>
day; but they are not entitled, on this slender basis, to any claim </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as
contributors to the art of Hindi fiction. We do talk in terms of post-<span
class=SpellE>Premchand</span> era, but the fact is that <span class=SpellE>Premchand’s</span>
influence is still very predominant and most of our novelists take inspiration
from him and thus pay a high compliment to <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span>,
the father of the Hindi novel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
the Hindi writers have not remained mere dummies, passively exposed to any
outward influence, foreign or indigenous; they are vitally alive, ready to make
a creative use of anything which suits their end or needs. The reaction against
<span class=SpellE>Premchand’s</span> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>method set in sooner
than later. There grew up a band of a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>young novelists who,
though sitting at the master’s feet and getting mental nourishment from him,
refused to be bullied into the belief that <span class=SpellE>Premchand’s</span>
was the last word in the art of fiction and the ‘orderly unfolding of plot’ was
the only form for fiction to assume. <span class=SpellE>Jainendra</span>,
through his novels <span class=SpellE><i>Tyagpatra</i></span><i> </i>and <i>Kalyani
</i>weakened the myth of plot to a great extent, if he did not actually
demolish it. He showed the way how a brilliant novel can be constructed with a
negligible amount of story element in it. The story qua story was relegated to
a subordinate position. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
does not amount to saying that <span class=SpellE>Jainendra</span> completely
ignores the structure-value of fiction. <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span> has
made this position impossible to be taken. With all the ingenuity and force of
originality at one’s command, it was not possible to revert to the ‘Chinese-box
days’ of fiction. But there came a change in the very conception of structure. <span
class=SpellE>Premchand</span> conceived of plot in terms of logical
continuities, in terms of relations of cause and effect, in terms of a
particular consequent under a given set of antecedents. Chronology dominates <span
class=SpellE>Premchand</span> with action or plot as an <span class=SpellE>organising</span>
factor in it. But <span class=SpellE>Jainendra</span> models his novel on the
operative character of consciousness as such. Not action but psychology and the
subjective aspect of experience controls form and <span class=GramE>maintains</span>
unity in the novels of <span class=SpellE>Jainendra</span>. The novelty of <span
class=SpellE>Jainendra’s</span> method will be clear by reading the plot-ridden
novels of <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span> side by side with his novels with
the relative unimportance of Plot in them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
<span class=SpellE>Jainendra</span> has done one thing more. He has tried his
best to convince his readers that he is telling nothing but the truth and thus
he falls here in line with the school of English novelists beginning with <span
class=SpellE>Defoe</span> who employ ‘documents, memorandums’, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>letters
etc., in order to create a sense of verisimilitude and increase the illusion of
verifiable fact. Nothing definite can be said of where <span class=SpellE>Jainendra</span>
got his clue from but two of his novels <span class=SpellE><i>Tyagpatra</i></span><i>
</i>and <i>Kalyani </i>(and <span class=SpellE><i>Jaivardhan</i></span><i>, </i>the
latest one) have been imposed upon readers as nothing but a reproduction of
documents fallen, by chance, into the hands of the author. In <span
class=SpellE><i>Banbhatt</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>ki</span> <span
class=SpellE>atma</span> <span class=SpellE>katha</span>, </i>one of the most
successful novels in Hindi, its author <span class=SpellE>Hazari</span> Prasad <span
class=SpellE>Dwivedi</span> has tried to trick readers into the belief that it
is a transcript of an old document unearthed by an old Austrian <span
class=SpellE>Indologist</span> and it has worked so successfully as to lead
some historians of Sanskrit literature to say that a new light was being thrown
upon the life of <span class=SpellE>Bana</span>. However, modern criticism does
not appreciate this factual orientation of novels so much. It is a relic of the
past when fiction enjoyed no rights of its own and could bask only in the
reflected glory of facts. Now the situation has completely changed. Creation
has <span class=GramE>risen</span> so much in critical esteem that facts
themselves are being fictionally oriented. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Agneya</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> is another novelist
to take Hindi fiction out of the beaten track of simple narrative and bring
about a freshness of vision and approach to bear upon it. It is in his novels,
and those of <span class=SpellE>Jainendra’s</span>, that the influence of
modern psychology has begun to be appreciably felt. Words like ‘projection’,
‘transference’, <span class=GramE>‘inferiority</span> complex’ become of
frequent occurrence in the body of the novels. Sisters begin playing an
important part in shaping the life of brothers and the father becomes a rival
of his son in winning the mother’s love. This tendency has become very
predominant in <span class=SpellE>Ilachand</span> Joshi’s novels like <span
class=SpellE><i>Pret</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>aur</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chhaya</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Parde</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>ki</span> <span class=SpellE>Rani</span> </i>which appear to have
been written with a copy of a book of psycho-analysis in his pocket. The merit
of <span class=SpellE>Agneya’s</span> fictional art lies in the fact that he
has depicted the progress of his story from a limited point of view, a single
point of view i.e., of <span class=SpellE>Shekhar’s</span> in <span
class=SpellE><i>Shekhar</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>ek</span> <span
class=SpellE>Jivani</span> </i>and a multiple point of view in <span
class=SpellE><i>Nadi</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>ke</span> <span
class=SpellE>dweep</span> </i>i.e., of the four characters whose life drama has
provided the material for the novel. The space at our disposal forbids
discussion of the comparative merits of the two points of view i.e., those of
author’s omniscience, and limitedness of viewpoint, but there is no denying the
fact that the latter has a peculiar charm of its own. Here the author has full
control over the tempo of the story and is in a privileged position to dole out
each part of the story at a properly rationed rate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

great length in limbering the stiff machinery of novels. But no review of

trend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

soil is particularly suited for the regional novels to thrive on, because it is
here that so many different cultures, races, religions, with their diversities,
corresponding to geographical division, are living side by side under the aegis
of a national culture. With the achievement of independence and the consequent
release of genius, this side of the novel could not have been neglected for
long. Many factors might have combined to bring about a sudden flowering of
regional novels at present in Hindi but one reason, paradoxical though it may
appear, is that regionalism is becoming less regional and is being reoriented
to nationalism, thus making one more conscious of one’s own region. A fuller
consciousness of individuality dawns upon a man when he comes in contact with
others. Every inch of English soil has received the illuminating touch of its
genius and has been celebrated in English literature. Why should Indian genius
be found wanting in this respect? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Chief Justice of India opened at the Allahabad
High Court on 26th November 1966, an exhibition of old papers, documents and
historical papers, in connection with the Court’s Centenary Celebrations. A
notable fact about all these documents and historical papers, which are dated
from the time the East India Company established its rule over the old NWP
(North Western Provinces), that is 1775, is that almost all of them are in
Persian. Muslim rule, beginning in Northern India in the eleventh century,
lasted about 700 to 800 years, and I imagine that ever since its commencement
Persian was used as the official language of administration. With the coming of
the British, Persian was succeeded by English and Urdu. Yet I wish to draw
attention to the fact that, despite the long period of official disregard and
neglect, Sanskrit continues be the vehicle of all our religious and other
sacred literature and our ancient cultural traditions. It is not difficult to
find out why this is so. At the root of the tremendous power of survival of
Sanskrit is the love and devotion of the people for their own original mother
tongue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is true that all these days illiteracy has been rampant in land, and even
elementary education and literacy has been confined to the so called higher
castes. Learning and scholarship really widespread only among, Brahmins, and
the regional languages must have governed the daily lives of the people. But
acquaintance with such languages must have prevailed only among the residents
and natives of the local regions. Only Sanskrit must have served the purpose of
communication and intercourse between the literate people belonging to, and
hailing from, the different parts of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Muslim rulers do not appear to have established any educational institutions
for the instruction and education of the people. Education in those days was
also of a purely literary description, and owing to the absence of the modern
printing and non publication facilities, the number of books available for use,
even in educational institutions like the Pathshalas and Maktabas, must have
been exceedingly small. The people must have therefore generally lived what I
may call a literature-free life untroubled by libraries, reading-rooms,
newspapers and journals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
British almost right from the commencement of their administration began
establishing primary and other schools and even colleges. Of course their main
aim was to spread knowledge of the English language. But the regional language
was the medium of instruction in all the lower classes, and alongside Sanskrit,
Persian and Arabic were also taught. This way knowledge of Sanskrit once again
began spreading in India, particularly among the Hindus. With the growth of a
spirit of nationalism during the last 100 years, and particularly from the time
of the establishment of the Indian National Congress in 1884, love of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sanskrit
has deepened in the land. The advent of independence </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>forthwith
raised the question of fixing and developing a national language for India as a
whole and, perforce and instinctively, the case of Sanskrit came before the
mind. Knowledge and use of English among the Indian people even in their social
and community life became a familiar feature. Suggestions were even made to
treat English as the national language of India. But that was an impossible
proposition because outside the educated middle classes living mostly in urban
areas, neither knowledge of English, nor liking and love for it, had penetrated
into the hearts and minds of the masses of India. The British ruled India
mostly through Indian agencies. The Britons served for a limited number of
years in India and on retirement went back to England. There was thus no
sizable group of people in India, after the British had left, who could call
the English language their own. The result is that the English language has, on
its own merits, taken no deep roots. There is no doubt that in. course of time
English will become useless in India except for international purposes and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>intercourse.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the Constitution of India was being framed the question of national language
was widely discussed and it was ultimately decided, as indicated by Articles
343 and 346 of the Constitution, that Hindi would be the official language of
the Union, and the language of communication between the Central Government and
the States, and between the States <i>inter se. </i>There is however no
provision in our Constitution declaring positively, and in so many words, that
Hindi should be treated and regarded as the national language of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Past
experience has, however, shown that the use of any language as the official
language by the Government, or as its spoken language </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
the ruling community of the day, does not necessarily lead to its adoption by
the people of India for their common, family or </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>community
intercourse, as their national language. Even under the most favourable
conditions and in spite of its extensive use by Government and semi-Government
agencies, trade, business and other organisations, English has failed to reach
the hearts of the masses. Hindi starts with many advantages in its favour but
we have to consider its appeal in the non-Hindi-speaking areas. This appeal, it
now appears, has not been very encouraging. Even its adoption as the official
language of the Union has caused some dissatisfaction, and many consider that
the selection of Hindi as official language has led to a sense of paramountcy
among the ‘Hindi-speaking people over their non-Hindi-speaking brethren. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The existence of such a feeling is a very disturbing
feature of this language controversy. It is of the highest importance, and in
the national interest, that a sense and feeling of unity and integrity of India
should prevail all over the country, and nothing should be done to create any
desire for disintegration of India or the growth of a parochial feeling on any
account whatsoever. It is on a consideration of all these different aspects
that I have myself since 1947, pleaded the cause of Sanskrit, and even
suggested that, as it has already won for itself since ages past the position
of the national language of India, it should be recognised as such. </p>

any individual, well-versed in Sanskrit acquisition of knowledge of all the

Indian people have stuck to Sanskrit with matchless devotion and affection. And
now that they have become their own rulers, instruction in Sans</span><span

voluntary choice of the people, become </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

years ago it was sometimes said that Sanskrit is a dead language. Even then it
was a thoughtless, groundless assertion, but now in free India Sanskrit has
risen again in all its glory and majesty. Just as we are proud of living with a
culture which today is the most ancient in the world, with its roots in the
hoary past, so let us also claim that our national language is of ancient
origin, having links with our past history and traditions, and that it is a
language which has continued throughout the ages to govern the literary and
cultural life of this great sub-continent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the death of Bertrand Russell, a dazzling flash of light on the contemporary
horizon is extinguished. It marks the end a ninety-seven year career of “one of
our time’s most brilliant spokesmen of rationality and humanity, and a fearless
champion of free speech and free thought in the West,” as the committee for
Nobel Prize for Literature in making the award described him. Mathematician at
30, philosopher at 50, apostle and prophet at 80 Russell was a sociologist and

Russell was born at <span class=SpellE>Trelleck</span>, in <span class=SpellE>Monmouthshire</span>,
on May 18, 1872. His father was Viscount <span class=SpellE>Amberley</span>,
son of Lord John Russell famous for the first Reform Bill of 1832. His mother
was Kate Stanley, daughter of Barn Stanley of <span class=SpellE>Alderly</span>.
His earliest love was mathematics. His interest shifted to philosophy
particularly theory of knowledge, and <span class=GramE>then</span> to science
education, sociology and, finally, politics. In each of these subjects Russell
has written books of great originality and incisiveness. He developed a style
of his own, distinguished by urbanity, lucidity and genial wit. He became, one
of the most widely read of authors and wielded an all-pervasive influence on
the climate of thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

which he prefers to call “logical atomism” is the basis of Russell’s
philosophy. He was a consistent monist and a philosophical materialist, with
some leaning toward <span class=SpellE>behaviourism</span> and pragmatism.
Russell became an unbeliever and agnostic at a very early age and remained so
to the end. This agnosticism, however, left room in him for a large measure of
what can only be termed the essence of the religious spirit. Russell was
educated at home by tutors and later went to <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Trinity</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

Dickinson. Alfred North Whitehead was his teacher, and later, his collaborator
in the writing of that monumental work, the “Principia <span class=SpellE>Mathematica</span>”.
Between 1900 and 1910, was his arduous work on Principia <span class=SpellE>Mathematica</span>,
published in three volumes from 1910 to 1913. In 1908, Russell was made a
Fellow of the Royal Society, one of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s highest bodies dedicated
to advanced knowledge. He was intensely interested in the politics of his time

outspoken in the expression of his views, Russell got into trouble with the
authorities during the First World War. He was fined £ 400 and was dismissed
from his college post for <span class=SpellE>criticising</span> a two-year
prison sentence on a conscientious objector. In 1918, he was himself sentenced
to six months imprisonment for writing a pamphlet containing pacifist views and
<span class=SpellE>criticising</span> the American army for suppressing
workers’ strikes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

visited <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and saw the people in travail. His book, “The Problem of China”, reveals his
passionate love for the Chinese people and his concern for the preservation of
political freedom in that country. The following years were spent in travelling
and lecturing in <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> and
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

increasingly drawn <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>into </span>the
crusade against atom bomb and was a vigorous participant <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the ‘Ban the Bomb’ demonstrations.
From classroom and lecture platform, no matter how serious his subject, he has
kept innumerable audiences from going to sleep for fear of missing the fun.
When he speaks, his sentences are apt to be short and his words clipped. He

error and more cranks take up unfashionable errors than unfashionable truths.”

little contemptible about a man who cannot face the perils of <span

May 18, 1962, Russell’s ninetieth birthday was celebrated. In the speech which

greeted the publication in March 1967 of the first volume of his Autobiography.
Two other volumes soon followed. The Autobiography was not intended by him to
be published <span class=SpellE>untll</span> after his death, but the
publishers prevailed on him to change his mind since he had outlived most of
the people named in it. In the Prologue to his Autobiography he says three
passions had governed his life: “The longing for love, the search for knowledge
and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great
winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean
of anguish, reaching to the verge of despair.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

like him and to return to him again and again. No writer that I know of is so
consistently rational and stimulating. The picture of him as an old
metaphysician stimulates each and everyone alike. His very piercing eyes emit
philosophical luminosity. His work, in the words of A. E. Taylor gives a
magnificent example of the reduction of mathematics to rigorous deduction from
expressly formulated logical principles by exactly specified logical methods.
It is a scrutiny of thought, a self-criticism and self-correction of thought to
which Plato gave the name, dialectic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“What I Believe”. It has stayed with me ever since and comforts and sustains

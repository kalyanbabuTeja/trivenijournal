mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>From Jaipur to Benares! Such was the title selected
for a symposium on the All India Writers’ Conference sponsored and ‘staged’ by
the P.E.N. All India Centre at Benares from October 31 to November 4, 1947.
Evidently it was intended to mark the progress made in the country’s creative
writing during the last two years which had elapsed, since the ever-memorable
First All India Writers’ Conference was convened at Jaipur in the autumn of
1945. But no striking achievements were recorded in this direction; nor were
there as many highlights at the present Conference as had heralded its
predecessor. Therefore, in a certain sense, no new or further milestone was
covered by the sponsors. Both in enthusiasm and in actual achievement, as seen
in the Delegates’ Camp, we appeared to move in the shadow of the mile. stone,
which the sponsors had set up at Jaipur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>However, for this lack of lustre, the organisers
are not at all to blame. They did their part well within the framework of their
abiding faith in the eternal visions and values of the undying human spirit. It
was the prevalent sense of panic and the fear of insecurity which prevented
many a member of the P.E.N. from attending the Conference, and quite a number
of those announced in the programme from participating in the proceedings. And
as regards the general public, the undercurrent of opposition to English as the
medium of deliberations seemed to have kept a large section of it away from the
Gaekwar University Library of the Benares Hindu University–the venue of the
Conference, thanks to the cordial invitation of its well-known Vice Chancellor,
Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, to have free access to the University’s premises and
personnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was against such a bleak background that the
Benares Conference was held. But what was wanting in warm-hearted fervour was
more than made up in large-range faith in the potency of the written word as an
indispensable harbinger of hope and harmony in our strife stricken and despair
darkened world. It was therefore but in the fitness of things that the
axiomatic truths, that Indian culture is one continuous, indivisible whole and
that English has a definite role to play in the emerging Independent India of
today and tomorrow, were reiterated and reaffirmed by the President, H.E.
Srimati Sorojini Devi, the Deputy President, Srimati Sophia Wadia, Dr. Mulk Raj
Anand, and several other delegates. For implementing our faith in the cultural
unity of the country, the need of fostering translations from one Indian
language into another was stressed, as also the writer’s special.
responsibility in these days of parochialism and partisanship. It was
recognised that the basis for the exercise of freedom of expression was
self-restraint. The danger of reportage to creative writing was visualised in
its proper perspective by Sri K. Srinivasan, late of <i>The Free Press Journal </i>of
Bombay–a rich find of the sponsors of the Conference, for what with his
rapier-like reasoning out of an issue under consideration, and his ever-alert
sense of humour, he gave a touch of liveliness as well as luminosity to the
proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This much on the credit side. On the debit side,
there was a feeling it that the Conference had been more of an audience or
auditorium than of an opinion-exchange, inasmuch as vital issues were only set
forth but not sufficiently descanted upon. There were also two other friendly
criticisms which were leveled against the Conference: firstly, that it had
afforded more of (sweet) meat-eating (every evening there was a tea-party in
the right royal fashion than of meeting one another with a view to reinforcing
one’s own aspirations and efforts by coming to know others in the same field
intimately; and, secondly, the deliberations were not dynamic enough to enthuse
the writers assembled that their <i>dharma </i>is to set right what is wrong
with the mentality of the modern man who likes to sup on horrors and
half-truths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The <i>Bharata Natyam </i>performance of Srimati
Radha N. Sriram, the musical soiree of the dramatic soprano Janina de Witt, the
visit to the <i>Kala Bhavana </i>with its gallery of paintings, ancient as well
as modern, were items in the Conference programme on which the delegates would
love to dwell reminiscently for many a long day, even as they would on the
cordiality shown to them by the members and workers of the Reception Committee,
drawn mostly from the elite, the intelligentsia and student community of the
holy city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>An assembly of writers in a place like Benares,
hallowed by memories of centuries of striving to fulfil the truth that “the
word was God and with God” is expected to act as a stimulant to the cultivation
of the sublimities of the soul. The sponsors stood up in the public square, the
lights of which have been dimmed, and exclaimed within the hearing of the
Eternal Ganges, “We believe wholeheartedly in the existence of the ever-shining
Light in the soul of Man.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

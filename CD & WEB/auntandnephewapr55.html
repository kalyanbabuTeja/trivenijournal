Pabitra and Amiya had their breakfast, a little of the tea, served to them, was

poured the tea into her own cup. Mahimamoyee scraped off with a spoon the <i>suji
</i>that was still sticking to the bottom of the pan, made a lump of it and
gave it to Tarbari. It hardly made a mouthful. After finishing the tea in small
sips, Tarbari cast a nervous glance at her mistress and said, “Haven’t you got
last night’s stale rice? Give me some of it, mistress.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was not ignorant of the fact that in the kitchen there was still some rice kept
overnight, and Tarbari had no need to remind her about it. Had there been only
a handful or two of it she would not have bothered about parting with it. But
the quantity was enough to make her mid-day meal. How could she allow her to
eat up the whole lot in the morning? Mahimamoyee gave her a sharp rebuke and
said, “Ah, what a glutton this woman is! Hadn’t you enough <i>suji </i>only a
while ago? What have you got–a belly or a shelf? Go now and get the utensils
washed.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Servants did not last long with Mahimamoyee. They survived
not more than a month or two, or three months at most, after which they moved
elsewhere. Of hard words they got enough and to spare, but even the hard,
half-boiled rice that fell to their lot never relieved their hunger. Only a few
days ago Gopal, the boy-cook of the household, went out in the morning never to
return. The previous night Mahimamoyee’s brother and sister-in-law had come to
visit her. After meals were served to them and other members of the family,
Gopal found that there was nothing left for him. When the mistress of the house
was told about it she said callously, “You needn’t burn fuel now to cook your
meal. If you miss a night’s meal, you won’t die!” Gopal managed to pass the
night and showed a clean pair of heels in the morning. From then onwards
Mahimamoyee herself did the cooking. For Tarbari, however, escape was
impossible. She was in the employ of Mahimamoyee as pawn for the advance of
sixty rupees which her father had taken from Mahimamoyee. At the rate of six rupees
a month, she would have to drudge for ten months to clear off the debt. She had
completed only three, and there was yet another seven months to go.</p>

was head-clerk at the Bakulban tea estate somewhere near Tezpur. His wife, with

year or so before, Ananda had bought a plot of land at Gauhati and got a house
of his own built there. Occasionally, when it suited him, he paid week-end
visits to Gauhati but did not stay more than a day. And some month or other he
would not come at all. But he kept himself posted with news from his family
through a regular exchange of letters. That the children should be spared the
slightest discomfort was a point which he never failed to impress upon her in
most emphatic terms whenever he wrote to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ananda
paid Mahimamoyee liberally enough towards the up-keep of the household. His
extra takings brought him more money than his salary. A generous and ready
spender, he took delight in spending. Epicurean in his tastes, he lived in
excellent comfort in the garden, ate heartily and well, and at the same time
kept open house for friends and visitors. And, a fashionable man too, he owns
as many as seven pairs of shoes, all shining with polish. Two private tutors
were engaged by him to look after his children’s studies, one for Amiya in the
morning, and the other for Pabitra in the evening. He had also purchased a pair
of cows so that his children might be spared the necessity of drinking the
milk, adulterated with water, which was sold by milkmen at Gauhati. His
standing instruction was that there should not be the slightest deterioration
in the quality of food which Pabitra and Amiya were accustomed to while in the
garden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on the other hand, thought that it was nothing but sheer waste to invest so
much in eating alone. In the garden everything was managed by Ananda, and she
had no alternative but to carry out his instructions meekly. But her husband
was not at Gauhati to boss over her, and there was nobody to prevent her from
tightening the purse-strings firmly. Frugality always pays good dividends in
the form of a surplus budget, and very soon Mahimamoyee could afford to open an
account in the post-office to put by her monthly savings. And as the deposits
piled up, she became all the more keen to add </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
business of paying the tutors never failed to give Mahimamoyee a nasty wrench.
Each of the two tutors got twenty rupees a month, and thus, between them, they
made a clean sweep of forty rupees. If she could only deposit this amount in
her account every month, she would have gained at the end of the year a tidy
sum of four hundred and eighty rupees, falling short by only twenty rupees of
the respectable figure of five hundred. And in four years she would have been
richer by nearly two thousand. It was along such lines that Mahimamoyee made
her calculations. And sometimes she would debate within herself. “Do all boys
have a private tutor? Why shouldn’t our children manage without theirs?” That
such arguments would not cut ice with Ananda Mahimamoyee knew only too well,
and, therefore, she had to bear her wrath in silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pabitra’s
tutor was once taken ill and he was forced to suspend work for three days. And
a sum, proportionate to the period, was clipped off from his monthly salary. On
two other occasions again the tutor could not do his duties because Pabitra was
ill. That also cost him two days’ wages. He had protested against the injustice
but no heed was taken of his complaint. There was a break of two days in
Amiya’s studies but her tutor proposed to make good the loss by giving tuition
on Sundays, so that Mahimamoyee might condescend not to make any deduction from
his salary. But Mahimamoyee’s reply was, “You needn’t teach her on Sundays.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the joy his arrival was greeted with by Pabitra and Amiya. No less was
Nabin’s delight at this reunion with his little cousins after long separation,
and even his most affectionate caresses could hardly express it. His impression
of the new house at Gauhati was derived solely from occasional letters received
from his maternal uncle, and the visit gave him an opportunity to see it for
himself. It was a brick house of large, spacious rooms with a bath attached to
it. Even the kitchen was built of brick. Pabitra and Amiya kept up a
ceaseless<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>conversation, teasing him
with a thousand little questions and never let him alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was however not the least happy over Nabin’s arrival. The household budget for
the month had already been upset. There were yet ten more days for the month to
be out, but the expenses had already outstripped the previous month’s. A
tea-party which her husband gave to his friends on the last Sunday had put her
to some additional expense. Again, only the other day a cup was broken and she
would have to find money for a new pair. To cap it all, there was now Nabin
holidaying at Gauhati.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of grievance over Nabin’s belated visit to Gauhati and his omission to bring
his mother with him. And piece by piece she extracted from him all information
about his family; of course she did not neglect to make the vital inquiry about
the exact amount of monthly remittance made to him by his maternal uncle. She
tried to trip him into inadvertently revealing, in the course of the
conversation, the time-table of his current sojourn, but here she did not
succeed for lack of a favourable opportunity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

services. Now that he was ready, how could she dissuade him from going? All the

would have to trudge all the distance to Fancy Bazaar. Wouldn’t that mean a lot

wasteful habits. Her head began to whirl with wild misgivings and she became
restless. The little Amiya, thinking that her mother’s headache was worse,
carpe near her and began gently rubbing her forehead. But Mahimamoyee sent her

her purse in the last few days was beyond her wildest fears. She was only
waiting for them to go, and then she must set about a thorough stock-taking of

an extraordinary stomach for rice!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>DR M. C. SAXENA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
a special literary type the short story is of a recent origin. It began
primarily in America with Edgar Allan Poe. It is a peculiarly American form. In
England there was hardly any encouragement to a writer of short fiction at the
turn of the 19th century. Book publishers desired novels, preferably in many
volumes, because these were in great demand. Moreover, the novels suitable for
the sensibilities of novel reading ladies, whose appetite for reading novels
dealing with more or less innocently amorous relationships among the higher
classes was voracious, were in great demand. The periodicals also preferred
long fiction which they could serialize.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
authors who turned to writing short fiction were also novelists who thought
short story-writing to be an exercise in the novelist’s craft. The 19th century
English novel, says W. B. Harris “from Scot onwards depended essentially on the
creation of a little world, whether on the Scottish boarder, in the labyrinth
of London, or in a quiet cathedral town, and a tracing of the life of its key
characters through a varied sequence of incidents and moods”.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Such
a fictional world cannot be created in a short story. A novel can have a
panoramic view, but in a short story the panoramic is likely to dull the edge
of interest the plot may have. If one looks at the short stories of Dickens,
Collins, Mrs. Gaskell, Trollope and <span class=SpellE>Thackery</span>–all of
them were primarily novelists–one can discover a “diffuseness that displays
itself in lack of economy and un­certainty of tone”<span class=GramE>,<sup>2</sup></span>
while the outstanding characteristic of a short story is ‘unity of effect.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is an accepted assumption of Poe scholarship that Poe’s primary aim as a writer
of tales was to create a ‘unity of effect.’ It should be remembered that Poe
was a journalist, and his critical opinions are scattered all over his reviews
and other critical writings. Although he never had time to formulate a
systematic theory <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the ‘unity
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>effect’ his opinions are
sufficiently well articulated. Poe was the first conscious artist who tried to
set standards for the short story. His statement that ‘unity of effect’ is
necessary in a tale constituted an innovation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
first extent reference <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>the
concept <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of ‘</span>unity <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>effect’ occurs in Poe’s review <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of<i> Tales of Peerage and Peasantry</i></span>
“edited” by Lady <span class=SpellE>Dacre</span>. He praises the ‘unity <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>effect’ achieved by Lady <span
class=SpellE>Dacre</span>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>An
everyday writer would have ended a story <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>continued sorrow and suffering, with a bright gleam of unalloyed
happiness and sunshine–thus destroying, at a single blow, that indispensable
unity which has been rightly called the unity <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>effect, and throwing down, as it were, in a paragraph what
perhaps, an entire volume has been trying to establish.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
next reference <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>the theory <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>‘unity <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>effect’ is in his review <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>the poems <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>Mrs.
Sigourney. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Mrs. </span>Sigourney was
in the habit <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>prefixing
epigrams to her poems. This gave Poe an excuse to dwell upon the principle <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of ‘</span>unity of effect:’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
poems <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>magnitude the mind of
the reader is not, at all times, enabled <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to
</span>include in one comprehensive survey the proportions and proper
adjustments of the whole. He is pleased–if at all–with particular passages; and
the sum <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>his pleasure is
compounded by the sums of the pleasurable sensations inspired by these
individual passages during the progress <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>perusal. But in pieces of less extent–like the poems <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>Mrs. Sigourney–the pleasure is <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>unique, </span>in the proper acceptation of
the term–the understanding is employed, without difficulty in the contemplation
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the picture as <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>a whole </span>and thus its effect will
depend, in a very great degree, upon the perfection <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>its finish, upon the nice adaptation of its constituent
parts, and especially upon what is rightly termed by Schlegel, “the unity <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or </span>totality of interest.”... Mrs.
Sigourney is utterly at variance with this unity. By the initial motto–often a
very one–we are either put in possession of the subject of the poem; or some
hint, historic fact, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or </span>suggestion
is thereby afforded, not included in the body <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>the article, which, without the suggestion, would be utterly
incomprehensible. In the latter case, while <span class=SpellE>peruing</span>
the poem, the reader must revert; in mind at least, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>to </span>the motto for the necessary explanation. In the former, the
poem is being a mere paraphrase <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the
motto, the interest is divided between the motto and the paraphrase. In either
instance the <i>totality</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>of
effect is annihilated.<sup> 4</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
concept remained essentially the same, although Poe shifted emphasis from
structural unity to the unity of emotional effect, as the situation demanded.
Almost six years later, Poe again repeated this passage – in his review of
Longfellow’s <i>Ballads and Other Poems </i>– and the changes he made from this
passage are rather insignificant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Just
as Poe condemned the practice of Mrs. Sigourney, Cole­ridge said that nothing
that is ‘super added’ only for ornament or decoration can really please in a
poem. For Coleridge a legitimate poem is one in which the parts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>...mutually
support and explain each other; all in their proportion <span class=SpellE>harmonising</span>
with, and supporting the known influence of material arrangement. The
philosophical critics of all the ages coincide with the ultimate judgement of
all countries, in equally denying the praises of a just poem, on the one hand,
to a series of striking lines or <span class=SpellE>distichs</span> each of
which absorbing the whole attention of the readers to itself, disjoins it from
its context, and makes it a separate whole, instead of an <span class=SpellE>harmonising</span>
part; and on the other hand, to an <span class=SpellE>unsustained</span>
composition, from which the reader collects rapidly the general results, un
attracted by the compo­nent parts. The reader should be carried forward, not
merely or chiefly by the mechanical impulse of <span class=GramE>curiosity,</span>
or by a restless desire to arrive at the final solution; but by the pleasurable
activity of the mind excited by the attraction of the journey itself. <sup>5</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Coleridge
used the ‘unity of effect’ in the service of organic unity, while Poe invoked
it to demand autonomy for the poem or the tale itself. Schlegel too insisted
upon organic unity –­ for him the formal unity of the neo-classicists was of no
value. He likened a work of art to life, in which unity is apprehended not by
the eye and the ear alone, but by intuition which could produce a joint
impression on the mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
offered Dickens’ tale “The Pawnbroker’s Shop” as an illustration of the concept
‘unity of effect’ and made the claim that each sentence in that tale gave a
fuller view of the picture Dickens was trying to paint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
concept ‘unity of effect’ received its final crystallization in his review of
Hawthorne’s <i>Twice Told Tales </i>and “The Philosophy of Composition.” The
theory of ‘unity of effect’ was the governing principle of Poe’s theory of
short story and it received a philosophical reorientation in <i>Eureka.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
a reviewer for the <i>Southern Literary Messenger </i>Poe had to deal more with
novels than with short stories for the simple reason that it was the more
popular genre. Although he was prepared to praise individual works highly he
did not like the form. Elaborat­ing his theory of ‘unity of effect’ Poe
developed his theory of single sitting, and applied it equally to poetry and to
fiction:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Were
I bidden to say how the highest genius could be more advantageously employed
for the best display of its own powers, I should answer without hesitation–in
the composition of a rhymed poem, not exceeding in length what might be pursued
in an hour. Within this limit alone can the highest order of true poetry <span
class=GramE>exist.</span> We need only here say, upon this <span class=GramE>topic,
that</span> in almost all classes of composition, the unity of effect or
impression is a point of the greatest importance. It is clear, however, that
this unity cannot be thoroughly preserved in productions whose perusal cannot
be completed in one sitting. (VII, 29-30)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>According
to Poe the effect of the totality or unity can be created in a sufficiently
brief piece. This leads him to call a long poem a paradox: “All high
excitements are necessarily transient. Thus a long poem is a paradox. And
without unity of impression, the deepest effects cannot be brought about. Epics
were the <span class=SpellE>offsprings</span> of an imperfect sense of art, and
their reign is no more.” (VII, 30) However, too much brevity also mars the
effect:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
poem <i>too </i>brief may produce a vivid, but never an intense or enduring
impression. Without a certain continuity of effort – without a certain duration
or repetition of purpose ­–the soul is never deeply moved... Extreme brevity
will degenerate into <span class=SpellE>epigramatism</span>; but the sin of extreme
length is even more unpardonable. (VII, 30)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
a novel cannot be read at a single sitting the immense force derivable from
totality is lost. If a work of art is read at more than one sitting, worldly
interests “modify, annul or counteract” the impressions the author tries to
create; even a simple cessation of reading will, of itself, Poe says, “be
sufficient to destroy the unity.” (VII, 31)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
principle of brevity is directed toward the proper manage­ment of the response
of the audience or reader toward the unity of impression. Brevity, for Poe, was
in direct ratio to the intensity of the desired effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
qualitative subordinate of the theory of ‘unity of effect’ is the principle of
originality. It is there for the proper management of the audience psychology
to the unity of impression. We are reminded at once of Poe’s remark that <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>a </span>to originate is <span class=GramE>to</span>
carefully, patiently, and understandingly to combine.” (VII, 102) The
originality of a piece of writing is to be judged not by the subject-­matter or
theme, but by the manner in which the writer handles the elements he chooses or
which are available to him. Poe speci­fically warns against using material that
is absolutely novel. Originality, thus understood, he says, “tasks and starts
the intellect, and so brings into undue action the faculties to which in the
lighter literature, we least appeal.” (VII, 23) “The true originality,” he
writes, “true in respect of its purposes–is that which, in bringing out the
half formed, the reluctant, or the unexpressed fancies of mankind,...thus
combines with the pleasurable effect of <i>apparent </i>novelty, a real
egotistic delight...the reader feels and intensely enjoys it as really novel,
as absolutely original with the writer and himself.” (VII, 23) For Poe
originality is based not on the novelty of the subject but upon novelty of
presentation and this novelty derives from a careful and deliberate attempt to
produce an effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=GramE>In “How to write a Blackwood Article” Poe talks about the ‘intensities.’</span>
<span class=GramE>These ‘intensities’ and ‘unity of effect’ cannot be attained
in a novel for the simple reason that a novel cannot be read at a single
sitting.</span> In the interval that is naturally caused between the first and
the second sitting many extraneous interests impinge on the mind of the reader.
It is only the short tale which “affords unquestionably the fairest field for
the exercise of the loftiest talent, which cannot be afforded by the wide
domains of mere prose.” (VII, 29)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
brief tale can be admired for its ‘unity of effect’ while a novel can only be
admired for the brilliance of its detached passages without reference to the
whole work. Poe was impassioned with the talk of ‘sustained effort’:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Commonsense,
in time to come, may possibly insist upon measuring a work of art rather by the
object it fulfils, by the impression it makes, than by the time it took to <span
class=SpellE>fulfil</span> the object, or by the extent of ‘sustained effort’
which becomes necessary to produce the impression. (VII, 27)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Only
a <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> few, if any, Poe believed, were possessed
of the sculptural taste needed to take in a novel’s ‘totality of beauty.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Emerson
R. Marks considers Poe’s antipathy to novel as one of his serious shortcomings.
He says, “Poe was curiously blind to the aesthetic value of a complex whole
that resides in a writer’s control of a great mass of material”.<sup>6</sup>
Marks, however, forgets that Poe was a journalist who was thinking in terms of
mass audience. He was in search of an art form appropriate for a monthly
magazine. One can agree with Robert D. Jacobs that “Poe’s concern about the
reading time of a prose narrative represents journalistic expediency as well as
practical psychology”.<sup> 7<o:p></o:p></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
not only tried to establish the short narrative, but between the short poem and
the tale he preferred the later as it was capable of a variety of treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
writer of a short tale, in short, may bring to his theme a vast variety of
modes and inflections of thought or expres­sion (the ratiocinative, for
example, the sarcastic or the humorous) which are not only antagonistic to the
nature of the poem, but absolutely forbidden by one of its most peculiar and
indispensable adjuncts; we allude, of course, to rhythm. (VII, 32) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
subjects that are suitable to the tales of effect, e. g., terror or passion
cannot be treated in a poem which is suitable only for beauty: “the author who
aims at the purely beautiful in a prose tale is <span class=SpellE>labouring</span>
at a great disadvantage.” (VII, 32)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
was not only a literary theorist but a practitioner of the genre, short story.
It was essential that he should reduce his theory to practice. After <span
class=SpellE>emphasising</span> the ‘unity of effect’ and elaborating the
theory of single sitting he continues:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has fashioned his
thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate
care, a certain unique or single <i>effect </i>to be wrought out, he then
invents such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect.
If his very initial sentence tends not to the upbringing of this effect, then
he has, failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no
word written, of which the tendency, direct or indirect is not to the one
pre-established design. And by such means, with such case and skill, a picture
is at length painted which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it with a
kindred art, a sense of the fullest satisfaction. The idea of the tale has been
presented unblemished, because undisturbed; and this is an end unattainable by <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>           </span>a novel. (VII, 31-32) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
careful perusal of the above statement will clear any doubt about priorities. ‘Incidents’
are created to bring about the desired effect. The structure, according to Poe,
is simply a means to an end – an end that a creative artist should always keep
in mind is the ‘effect.’ As a necessary adjunct to ‘incident’ comes ‘tone.’
After the creative artist has chosen a desired effect, he should consi­der “whether
it can be wrought out by incident or tone – whether by ordinary incidents and
peculiar tone, or the converse, by peculiarity both of incident or tone...” (V,
32)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus
according to Poe, incident or tone <span class=GramE>is essential to any work
of art desiring</span> ‘unity of effect’ and a predominance of one over the
other gives coherence to a work of art. In any work of art in which ‘incidents’
predominate, the unity of effect is achieved through unity of plot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
was always particular about plot. He was conscious of the fact that many good
novels did not have any plot at all. In the review, of Cooper’s <i>Wyandotte </i>he
wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Plot,
however, is at best an artificial effect requiring, like music, not only a
natural bias, but long cultivation of taste for its full appreciation; some of
the finest narratives in the world “Gil Bias” and “Robinson Crusoe” for example
have been written without its employment. (VI, 2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He,
however, adds a word of caution. The absence of plot cannot be regarded as
defect, yet “<span class=GramE>its</span> judicious use in all cases aiding and
in no case injuring other effects, must be regarded as of a very high order of
merit.” (VI, 2) Nevertheless “A mere succession of incidents, even the most
spirited, will no more constitute a plot than a multiplication of zeros, even
the most infinite, will result in the production of unit.” (VI, 210) In the
review of <span class=SpellE>Bulwer’s</span> <i>Night and Morning </i>he
developed his theory of plot: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The word <i>plot; </i>as commonly
accepted, conveys but an in­definite meaning. Most persons think of it as a
simple complexity; and into this error even so fine a critic as Augustus
William Schlegel has obviously fallen, when he confounds its idea with that of
the mere <i>intrigue </i>in which the Spanish drama of <span class=SpellE>Cerventes</span>
and Calderon abound. But the greatest involution of incident will not result in
plot; which properly defined, <i>is that in which no part can be displaced
without ruin to the whole. </i>It may be described as a building so dependently
con­structed, that to change the position of a single brick is to overthrow the
entire fabric.<sup> 8<o:p></o:p></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><sup><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
definition of plot is important because it is an improvement upon Aristotle. To
Aristotle, the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action
and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such, that if anyone
of them is misplaced or replaced, the whole would be disjointed and disturbed.
A thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference is not an organic
part of the whole. Poe exaggerates this requirement by <span class=SpellE>emphasising</span>
that any displacement or removal of a part would ruin the whole. In the “American
Drama” he said that a plot “is perfect only in as much as we shall find
ourselves unable to detach from it or disarrange any single incident involved,
without destruction to the mass.” (VI, 210-11) The <span class=GramE>artist</span>
who worked with a preconceived design, was like an architect who first drew the
blueprint and then started the actual construction. This conception of plot
found philosophic expression in <i>Eureka </i>where Poe calls the universe as
the plot of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
appreciates Robert R. Bird’s <span class=SpellE><i>Shepperd</i></span><i> Lee </i>because
“its incidents are well <span class=GramE>conceived,</span> and related with
force, brevity and a species of directness....” (VII, 88-80) On the other hand,
he finds fault with <i>Wyandotte: </i>“As for plot, there has been no attempt
of the kind. The tale is a mere succession of events, scarcely anyone of which
has any necessary dependence upon any other.” (VII, I)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tone
also plays a significant part in establishing the ‘unity of effect’. According
to Poe, Bird violated tone in <span class=SpellE><i>Shepperd</i></span><i> Lee.
</i>Norman Forester suggests that Poe regards tone” as the word itself suggests–as
the equivalent in prose for the music in verse, an element in which the theme
floats and is carried to the culminating effects”.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
declares that the opening sentence should strike the key­note of the story.
Unity of effect being; the object, the creative artist has failed if “his very
initial sentence tends not to the upbringing of this effect.” (VII, 31) The
very initial sentence should prepare the reader for the final sentence. What is
indicated at the beginning should be fulfilled at the end. This is the key to
the structural coherence of the composition. In “The Philosophy of Composition”
Poe asserts: “It is with the denoue­ment constantly in view that we can give a
plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the
incidents and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the
intention.” (VI, 31) Haying the denouement constantly in view the author should
write the story backwards. Godwin is famed to have written <i>Caleb Williams </i>backwards.
Godwin’s preface to <i>Fleetwood </i>asserted the advantage of carrying back
the invention from the conclusion to the beginning: “An entire unity of plot
would be the result; and the unity of spirit and interest in the tale truly
considered, gives it a powerful hold on the reader which can scarcely be
generated with equal success in any other way”.<sup>10</sup> These words
reinforce the way suggested by Poe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
unfolding of plot brings about effect. Poe’s ideas of effect have been taken by
many critics as some sort of contrived riddle. Certainly, in some cases Poe
seems to think that stories are designed to fool the unsuspecting reader. But
Poe was usually not playing games with his readers. He desired a bond of
sympathy with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poe
was a highly conscious artist who was confident of achieving in practice the
concepts which he put forward in his critical writings. He said: “...the theory
and practice are so much <span class=GramE>one, that</span> the former implies
or includes the latter. A theory is as good as such, in proportion to its
reducibility to <span class=SpellE>practise</span>. If the practice fails, it
is because the theory is imperfect.” (VII, 40) Critics generally agree with Poe
and maintain that his theory and practice are inseparable.</p>

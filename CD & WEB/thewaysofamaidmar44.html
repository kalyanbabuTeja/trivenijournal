you had gone into the village of Velanadi and asked about Elsie Mary, the
daughter of Maria Susai, the ground-nut trader, they would have told you that
she was an unschooled tomboy. Her step-mother–the virtuous Vyakula Mary–would
have pulled a long face (effortlessly, as her face was naturally long, which
made her look like a horse) and wailed that she was a regular hoyden, a trial
and an irritation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

father–but he was chronically drunk, so it would not have mattered what he
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Elsie had her own partisans. The young men of the village–the unsteady ones, of
course–swore by her and said she was a phantom of delight. Not in so many
words, for they did not know Wordsworth and, moreover, verbal ecstacy about unmarried
girls is not allowed, still, they would have conveyed the idea. Old Arokiasami,
who is as wise as an owl, would have cleared his throat noisily and classed her
definitely as good. But what is Arokiasami? A stone which has rolled over half
the known world and come back mossless, moneyless. His opinion, almost
certainly, would not have gone down with a Court but I shouldn’t brush it
aside. From all of which you will see that Elsie was quite a character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
any case, she was distinctly upsetting. As Nambikkai Mary, the Bible woman,
said, “She even made mass a mummery.” Father Gomez had to speak to the young
men very seriously about their behaviour in Church. But Elsie was unabashed.
Even the confessional had no terrors for her. She used to come out of Church on
Saturday evenings looking less like a repentant sinner than one who has been up
to some new devilment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was only one thing to do and that was to marry her off. Would that improve
matters? asked Sandana Mary, the catechist’s wife, a pale shadow of Vyakula
Mary’s. “She would, at any rate, be off our hands,” answered Vyakula.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“That’s
true. The responsibility would be someone else’s then.” Sandana Mary would
dutifully agree, like one saying the responses at </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
Vyakula Mary made her plans. She was rather an expert at them. The schemes of
mice and men might miscarry, but never Vyakula Mary’s. They hadn’t, so far. Did
she not manage her husband, the ground-nut business, the entire household, all
of it, except, of course, Elsie?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
surveyed the village mentally and fixed upon Sani Glass Odayan. (Sani Glass
wasn’t a species of glass but only Stanislaus, a more than middle-aged widower,
worldly-wise and well-to-do.) But. Elsie laughed so consumedly at the idea that
Sani Glass went off in a huff. Vyakula Mary, beside herself with vexation, went
to her husband and asked him to speak to Elsie. Maria Susai, good man, tried in
a lucid interval, but when did you hear of a piece of cotton-wool moving a slab
of granite? That was the beginning and, in one sense, the end. Vyakula Mary,
being a virtuous woman, did not complain loudly. She only tugged at her face
and went about looking horsier than ever. Other names were proposed by
well-meaning neighbours but Elsie only laughed and lollopped off to church,
tank or <i>shandy</i> according to the hour. Father Gomez intervened. “You must
marry, Elsie,” he urged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Elsie
caught herself with a jerk. Kindly Father Gomez she could not brush aside
lightly. She looked around her for a second and made as if to open her heart to
him. Then, apparently thinking better of it, she laughed. “No fear, Father,
marriage is not for me. I shall probably go into a convent.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Father
Gomez was not misled by the bantering tone. He had noticed the earlier movement
and its repression. He stayed his hand, intending to tackle her later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
strain increased in Maria Susai’s household. Vyakula Mary, for all her
reputedly silent suffering, used to say things which burnt into one’s
sensibilities like hot cinders. She starved,–or said she did,–kicked her brats
without provocation and slanged Maria Susai worse than ever, all in Elsie’s
sight. Things got grievously out of gear in the Maria Susai <i>menage</i> and
the ground-nut trade languished. “You are making your mother unhappy, Elsie,
and she has been more than a mother to you,” the friends of the family would
say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

added his voice; faltering and feeble, he said, “Why don’t you marry and be
done with it, Elsie? After all, you must marry some day.” “I suppose I must,
uncle. To please mother,” replied Elsie jestingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tor-sed his aged head. “Mother be hanged,” he said. “Marry to please yourself
and to run your own home, my dear.” He pounded a mouthful of betel and flicked
it into his toothless mouth. Then, drawing Elsie to him, he told her in a low
voice, “You mustn’t make yourself out to be worse than you are, dear.” “I do
not feel virtuous at all, uncle,” said Elsie, smiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

be silly. The rest of them are not a tenth as good as you, not by a long
chalk,” said Arokiasami and he Was seized with a violent fit of coughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was something in Arokiasami’s manner which touched a chord in her. He was her
oldest friend; when she was a little girl he used to take her on his knee and
tell her long stories about the march to Mandalay, the storming of Theebaw’s
Palace and give her his general service medal to wear round her neck. And he
had yet another claim to consideration. Was he not the uncle of Moses, the
motor-driver, that hefty youth, broad-shouldered and tall, who paid her silent
homage with his eyes, so unlike those anaemic, buttockless youths who grinned
and jabbered at the sight of her like the monkeys of the Velamalai forest? Moses
was not a he-man by any means but he was the sort of man one liked to go about
with at the <i>Pasco</i> festival at Eastertide, his broad back and shoulders
showing to advantage in his grey flannel–or, was it <i>khaddar</i>?–coat with
the twin bands running down the back. Elsie, for all her cool sophistication,
was given to much day-dreaming. In her mind’s eye, for some time past, there
had been the picture of a house, in fact, the creeper-covered two-roomed
cottage at the corner of the Cotton-growers’ Lane. In that Picture was the
figure of a man coming home to her with gifts of flowers and fruit and, in
special, of slabs of chocolate from the glass-fronted shop at Poppali, not the
gummy, sticky stuff they sold at Vazhamangalam. Supper over, they would sit in
the starlight and she would listen to the tale of his day’s doings and, by a
process of reverie, the steps of which she could not afterwards disentangle,
see herself nestling on his broad chest, while he imprinted warm kisses on her
all too-responsive lips. The figure was that of Moses, the motor-driver, and
her lips would quiver with those phantom kisses, so startlingly real did they
seem. To that cherished dream she would revert as to a haven or anchorage
whenever–and that was nearly always now–she wanted to escape from her
step-mother and that home of theirs which was–well, anything but a home. And
now, Arokiasami’s words set her thinking, if the sudden uprising in her mind of
the home of her fancy could be called thinking. She seemed to see the </span><span

bus careering down the street and drawing up in front of the creeper-covered
cottage at the corner of the Cotton-growers’ lane, and Moses coming in to her
in that grey flannel–or, was it <i>khaddar</i>?–coat with the broad bands at
the back. She was ready with coffee for him</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for,
were not motor-drivers notoriously fond of coffee?–in a brass tumbler. She knew
the very tumbler, the long brass one with the scroll-work which her mother had
brought home as a bride.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
thoughts were interrupted. That cough again. Elsie held Arokiasami’s head and
waited till he recovered himself. And, just then, as though her very thoughts
had materialised, Moses came driving his bus and Elsie, taking leave of
Arokiasami, left. “Think it over, Elsie,” Arokiasami called at parting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

might have been Kuringi or Kalasamangalam, but Kalparai was the end of the line

The aunt from Vazhamangalam, simple soul, not understanding the drift of it
all, begged her with tears in her eyes, to save herself and the family from
dishonour. But what played havoc with her resolution was the silent misery in
her father’s eyes. Hating it all, wishing she were dead, her mind all in rags,
she went into the box and told her tale–a fairy one. The gist of it was–and
they dragged it out of her as only lawyers know how to do–that Moses lured her
to the station at Vazhamangalam and then took her forcibly to Kalparai. Why did
she not shout? She was far too frightened. The words came out slowly and the
Judge could hardly hear her. Clever actor, said Moses’ lawyer in a stage
whisper. Stage fright, the Judge’s eyes seemed to say. Elsie, the picture of
injured innocence, stood with her eyes glued to the ground. The Judge, whom the
suspicion of tears on a pretty face was generally enough to knock off his
balance, believed her version and gave judgment against Moses. He did not
believe Elsie was a minor–“the prosecution case in that regard was an
exaggeration,” but he had “no doubts whatever that she had been forcibly
abducted by the accused who was a designing scoundrel.” He sentenced Moses to
twelve months’ hard labour. And Moses, with one last look at Elsie, sitting
under the <i>illuppai</i> tree, walked to the jail looking like a dog that had
lost its master.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Elsie really did not know. She only knew she did not want the egregious Sani
Glass. And she did want Moses, she wanted him more than ever. The picture of
her fancy, blurred for a while during the horror of the trial, came back to
her. With a difference, however. There stood Moses in the back garden, a look
of mild reproach in his eyes, and yet he gathered her in his arms, the same as
before. The tears welled up within her and she sobbed as she had never sobbed
before. Would her day dreams come true? Was it possible that her lover would
come back, take her in his arms and say, “I forgive you, child?” He had called
her ‘child’ at Kalparai: not child exactly, for the word dissolved in the
shower of kisses to which it was the prelude. She seemed to know the answer. It
was all a vain hope; it would remain an unrealised dream, an accusing
might-have-been. Even supposing, by a miracle, he relented, would they let him
marry her? The Church mightn’t allow it. Could she ask Father Gomez? No, she
daren’t. In her trouble she prayed to her patron saintess, Mary of Lourdes, to
heal her in mind and body, as Mary of Lourdes alone could do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Moses languished in jail. His hair was cropped close, they put him into a
convict’s uniform, but Moses did not mind all that. There were still six months
to run, six weary months of Elsieless dreariness, to be followed by, God alone
knew, how many years of Elsieless dreariness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in December there was trouble in the. jail. The reasons for it we need not
pause to explore; there was the very devil of a row and the revolting prisoners
smashed the jailor’s head. It would have been worse but Moses had intervened
and saved the jailor from an untimely end and the prisoners from hanging. Moses
was a favourite with the prisoners for he used to help them with their
clandestine letters and other enterprises barred by the jail code. The upshot
of it all was that a gratified Collector recommended the remission of the
unexpired portion of Moses’ sentence. And just before Christmas, Moses was
released from jail. And he made a bee-line for Velanadi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

now,” cheerily responded Elsie, as she stood on a rising bit of ground which
overlooked the Poppali-Vazhamsngalam road. Just then she saw a man approaching;
there was a forward lurch in his gait which was oddly familiar but no hair
clustered round his temples, so it must have been only her imagination. The man
came nearer and Elsie saw an all-too-familiar coat of grey flannel–or, was it <i>khaddar</i>?–with
the pleated pockets in front. Elsie sprang forward with a glad cry and the man
held out his arms, while his lips seemed to frame–for nobody heard–the magic
word, ‘Elsie’. And while Elsie snuggled and sobbed in those great big arms of
his, there were delighted shouts of ‘Moses, Moses’, ‘our Moses has come.’ And
though the good people of Velanadi did not generally approve of public
love-making, for once they forgot to be punctilious and looked on, some with
tears in their eyes. For Moses, they had remembered, was a man after their own
heart, who used to do errands for them on his trips to town. And they had
realised with heart-searching that they had not reached out a helping hand to
him during his trial. But, thank Heaven, it was all over and done with. Moses,
disentangling himself from a closely clinging Elsie, took her basket and moved
forward. Elsie, all her modesty cast to the winds, linked her arms to his and
walked on as though her man had just returned from the wars. Nambikkai Mary and
her brood, censorious to the last, uttered, “Wanton: shameless creature!” and
looked so sour that your teeth rattled. Father Gomez came along in his
double-bullock <i>bandy</i>, bound for Vazhamangalam which lay in his <i>pangu</i>.
And they told him the news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

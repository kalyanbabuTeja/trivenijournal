the rich and varied development of social and political theory in the West,
from Aristotle to Stalin, the western nations are fast heading towards
inescapable disaster. Struck in the morass of incomplete ideology, the West
today is rendering itself incapable of effectively resolving the present
impasse in political theory and political practice. That the ferment of the
western world has not really settled down since the Revolution of 1789 is quite
clear. It is a fact that the ideals of the French Revolution, even after a
century and a half, remain in the dreamland of human aspiration. From
Jacobinism to Stalinism, varieties of political theory and technique were urged
to secure liberty and equality: the twin demands of the French Revolution. But
neither the liberal thought of <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span> and Mill nor
the dialectics of Marx and <span class=SpellE>Engels</span> took the nations of
this planet any nearer their ideals than when the Statue of Liberty was vainly
worshipped by enraged Parisians. The failure of the western nations to cast
aside theories of nationalism, national sovereignty, balance of power and such
other related aspects of 19th century political organisation, notwithstanding
their colossal achievements in industry and technology, is <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
as the fundamental error in the western State System. The world is divided into
two camps: Liberal Democracy and Communism, each opposing the other, each
contending for more power, and more world domination. It is also a fact that,
however </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>slight, the balance of initiative and advantage,
at this moment in 1959, leans towards Communism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Communism
is the natural culmination of western political thought. Marx’s penetrating and
searching analysis of social and political development led him to the important
conclusion that the history of all existing societies is a history of class
struggle. This idea is found suggested in the writings of Aristotle, and more
than suggested in the political and economic tracts of the 18th and the early
19th centuries in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. In fact, the
struggle concept is one of the dominating principles of European Civilisation.
In earliest times, <span class=SpellE>Heraclitus</span>, <span class=SpellE>Lycurgus</span>
and Plato </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>were all upholders of the idea of social
struggle as the inexorable law of social development. What </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>needs
to be <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span> is that the concept of class
struggle was always accorded an important place in western political analysis,
though it w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as left to Karl Marx, the founder of Scientific
Communism, to point to class struggle as the key unlocking the cardinal truth
of human history. Marx demonstrated the fallacy of the transcendental unity and
supremacy of the State as proclaimed by Rousseau and by the German Idealists.
The State, instead of representing the lasting interest of all its citizens,
and instead of expressing the <i>General Will, </i>embodying the highest and
the only <i>real </i>interest of the entire nation, by conforming to which
alone is the nation’s <i>true </i>freedom realized, is, Marx pointed out,
animated only by class consciousness, class schism and class antagonism. The
unity claimed for the State is a <span class=SpellE>ficticious</span> unity, as
the State is not functioning for, and on behalf of, a single society with
similarity, if not unity, of interests. The State functions in a society
consisting of classes and groups with opposing interests. There is almost
nothing of substance that gives unity to the conflicting interests of the
clashing strata. The exclusive possession of the means of production by but a
few reduces the State to a mere instrument to maintain the property and the
privileges of those few. The State, far from being the apogee of common
interests, becomes a convenient system of perpetuating class interests,
proclaiming all the time what but seems, and is not, the total unity of
society. Marx, rejecting the idea of the unity of society or the State,
substituted for it the idea of the unity of the interests of each of the
classes in society or in the State. <i>Class Consciousness, </i>signifying the
innate interests of the class to which the proletariat belongs, is
characteristically analogous to the <i>General <span class=GramE>Will,</span> </i>save
that the latter is related to the interests of the nation and the former is
related to the interests of a class within the nation. Like the concept of the <i>General
Will, Class Consciousness, </i>though it may not necessarily be all the actual,
dominant, shifting and detailed strands of consciousness of the proletariat, is
that core of consciousness of the working class which reveals itself when, in
the struggle for power, it comprehends the common interests of that class. The
proletariat must be forced to see its true interests, and be guided to act
promptly in order to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> those interests. It is
to stir the class consciousness of the proletariat, to fan their discontent,
and to <span class=SpellE>organise</span> the working class, that Karl Marx
enunciated the doctrine of the leadership of the elite and the dictatorship of
the proletariat. The community has to pass through a period of probation, as it
were, under proletarian dictatorship which undertakes to sweep away the mental
attitudes, the ways of living and thinking, the customs, the traditions and the
moods fashioned and sanctified by the <i>Bourgeois State; </i>and this prepares
the people for a very significant transformation thereafter when the State
ceases to exist, and a classless and Stateless socialistic society is ushered
in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

teachings of Marx, dating back to the period of surely developing
contradictions within capitalistic societies, when there was poverty and
wealth, squalor and opulence, under-employment and, over-production, added to
the seething discontent of the masses, accumulated during long years, the spark
needed to blow up tradi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

order. Even as Rousseau was the force behind the French Revolution, Marx was
the force behind the revolutions in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
If Rousseau’s <i>General Will </i>was the philosophical basis of Italian and
German dictatorships, Marx’s <i>Class Consciousness </i>was the philosophic
basis of the totalitarianism of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The State is naked Power: desired, captured, put to use, whether by capitalists
and their political supporters for the benefit of capitalists or by the
proletariat and its political supporters for the benefit of the proletariat.
The objective is similar. The ruthlessness is similar. There is a group within
a magic orbit of power in the political society. There is a group outside it.
The two are at war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
recent years, the flames of Communism are spreading far and wide. The air is
foul with its din and smoke. Liberal Democracy failed to meet Communism
effectively on the ideological plane or to present a definite programme on the
plane of action to secure to its citizens equality of opportunity, equal
justice, and equal distribution of wealth. Liberal Democracy failed to evolve
an alternative theory of social and political organisation, eschewing the
traditional concept of the State which leads to disunity and war. If the truth
must be told against a background of accumulating armies and piled atomic
weapons, much of the social and political thinking of the West since the
Russian Revolution is indifferent, half-hearted, <span class=SpellE>paralysed</span>
by fear, pathetically militant or pathetically pacifist, never positive.
Liberal Democracy which is at once a competent philosophy and an adequate
technique of action has yet to evolve. The West cannot achieve the new
synthesis if it accepts class conflict as a fundamental feature of social
organisation till such unforeseeable time as the State withers, or if it
accepts the fate till then as a mere repository of coercive power vested in one
or other conflicting group. The West has not seriously questioned these basic
assumptions or their inexorability. Alfred <span class=SpellE>Cobban</span> had
this in mind, I believe, when he referred to the decline of political theory in
recent decades. The West’s political theory ceased to be either creative or
synthetic. Therefore, Communism won many adherents even among the intellectuals
in the West.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would have conquered the whole of S. E. Asia if it had not met in India a
powerful opposition in Gandhism. Gandhism is a name one could give to the body
of principles expounded by Mahatma Gandhi, and interpreted and sought to be <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> by his followers in India. Gandhism arrested the
spread of Communism in India and in S. E. Asia. Gandhism does not deny the
existence today of the basic fact of social conflict on which Marxism built its
theory. But it <span class=SpellE>viualises</span> that the conflict is not
inevitable, and that it should, and can, be resolved differently. It accepts
the ultimate social objectives and the honest basic impulses of Communism. It
vetoes violence and dictatorship. In essence, it connotes a fundamental method
rather than a whole dogmatic theory. It has helped to wean Indian intellectuals
as well as India’s illiterate masses from the lure of international communism
It has driven the Administration, with Jawaharlal Nehru at its head, to seek to
combine what may compendiously the styled socialistic or communistic <i>ends </i>with
what may compendiously be styled <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> <i>means. </i>It
has helped India, even in the face of Kerala, with a Communist Government in a
corner of India, to be comparatively free from the fear of Communism, whereas
the United States of America, protected from communistic indoctrination by two
oceans, are in the grip of the terror of Communism. America, with its stake in

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a striking similarity between Marx and Gandhiji in their diagnosis of the
sickness of modern society. The ideal state of society contemplated by them is
also almost similar. There the comparison ends. In the very methods they
employed to arrive at their conclusions we find a fundamental difference. The <i>Capital
</i>was the achievement of a keen academic mind spending long years in London
among books. It reveals deep <span class=SpellE>schalorship</span> and a
trenchant analysis of history. <i>Hind <span class=SpellE>Swaraj</span> </i>was
the achievement of a deeply religious mind, written during a voyage from London
to South Africa. It reveals a deep intuitive moral sense and the courage even
as a nation to live or die by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
many an occasion Gandhiji called himself a socialist. In 1939 he expressed his
faith in socialism in these words: “I desire to end Capitalism almost if not
quite as much as the most advanced socialists and even communists.” Regarding
his ideal of a free and equal society, he remarked: “My ideal is equal
distribution. But, so far as I can see, it is not to be <span class=SpellE>realised</span>.
I, therefore, work for equitable distribution.” <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
socialism owes its inspiration to Gandhiji’s intense passion for social
justice, and to his never-failing idealism. Gandhism has the imprint of a
highly developed soul receiving light and strength from a world beyond mortal
ken. That world insists on truth and non-violence. Karl Marx worked out
socialism by applying the dialectical method. Dialectical materialism involves,
and leads to, violence. It is a force divorced from the practice of truth: in
any event, not wedded to it. Above all is the complete rejection by Gandhism of
the class antagonism upheld by Marxism as permeating the whole social fabric.
Gandhism substitutes the principles of class harmony and class co-operation for
the Marxian postulates of class division and class war. It should not be
understood that Gandhism ignores the most obvious factual reality of class
distinctions in our society today. Rather, it is profoundly alive to the
existing divisions in society, and to the urgency of abolishing both privilege
and poverty. It is Gandhiji’s view that, if we <span class=SpellE>recognise</span>
the fundamental equality of the capitalist and the worker, we should not aim at
the destruction of the former. “It can easily be demonstrated,” he says, that
the destruction of the capitalist must mean destruction in the end of the
worker, and no human being is so bad as to be beyond redemption, no being so
perfect as to warrant his destroying him whom he wrongly considers to be wholly
evil.” <span class=SpellE>Consiousness</span> of class distorts the individual
personality. Class War regiments society. Proletarian rulers have to be ever
vigilant against the return of the <i>Bourgeois. </i>All the <span
class=SpellE>organisational</span> patterns based on violence are necessarily
authoritarian. Democracy, on the other hand, is compatible only with a
non-violent social order. If it is not by struggle, it may be asked, how else
can class inequality be removed? Gandhiji’s knowledge of law, and, more, his
study of the <span class=SpellE><i>Bhagawat</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Geeta</span>,
</i>enabled him to formulate the theory that all property is trust, and that
its should be so treated by all owners of property. This concept of property is
found sprinkled across the mythological and the <span class=SpellE><i>Arthashasthra</i></span><i>
</i>literature of ancient India. The <span class=SpellE><i>Bhagawata</i></span><i>
</i>exhorts mankind on that basis. “He who collects more than he needs is a
thief.” “All land belongs to <span class=SpellE><i>Gopal</i></span><i>.” </i>The
theory of <i>Dana </i>supports the view that all property is trust. To the
Marxist who views property as exploitation and accumulation of surplus <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> value, the trust theory of Gandhiji and <span
class=SpellE>Vinobaji</span> appears to be unscientific and opposed to human
nature. Herein is disclosed the primary difference between the <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> and Marxian ways. To Marx, human nature, unless it
is institutionally controlled and governmentally directed, is basically wicked.
Marxism </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

Land of <span class=SpellE>Shankara</span> and <span class=SpellE>Ramanuja</span>,
<i>Man is a spark of the Universal Spirit. </i>Man is innately good. If man is

If man is not innately altruistic, if man is incapable of self-sacrifice,
social organisation and social order are inconceivable. How this innate social
goodness of man was to be touched and worked upon was the practical political
problem set to himself by Gandhiji. He believed and relied upon the innate
nobility of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

in the modern monolithic State, the individual and the Government are
tragically estranged. Under the Liberal Democratic State System no less than
under the Communist State System the individual is rendered ineffective and
kept helpless. The purges and the secret police in dictatorships are the more
malignant manifestations of the same sad system which puts down the individual
and leaves him with no satisfactory rights against the State. The liberal
theory of the State, though it concedes the primacy of the individual, is, in
the context of the rapid development of industry and technology, unable to
prevent Authority from brushing aside the refinements of the individual
conscience from over-riding individual liberty as of no serious consequence.
Even the mere Administrative State means a diminution of individual freedom.
Bureaucracy can be worse than tyranny. So important a person as the Prime
Minister of India finds a compelling need to rebuke Indian Bureaucracy and its
stupid ways again and again. Should the individual candidly feel that the State
is pursuing a wrong end, following a wrong policy, attempting things in a wrong
manner, how then should he conduct himself? How then should he re-define his
relations with the State? The democratic theory attempts to answer these
questions by broad and vague generalizations which proclaim but do not
satisfactorily formulate or delineate the so-called superior rights of the
individual. The dissatisfaction arises in working the democratic technique
which stresses that democracy is an inflexible process and that aggrieved
individuals should attempt only constitutional methods to change the decisions
of the State by capturing the seats of authority rather than by defying and
disobeying Authority. This is to say, in brief, that the citizen can attempt a
re-statement of his relations with Authority only by the exercise of his vote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

parliamentary technique of election, debate and discussion is so far the only
known way of <span class=SpellE>organising</span> democracy. But no one who is
aware of the <span class=SpellE>organisational</span> weaknesses of democracy,
the ignorance of the electorate, the lapses of political parties and the
mediocrity of legislatures, expects mere democracy to deliver the goods. The
wide gulf between profession and practice, between the ideal and the real,
leaves mere democracy not just suspect but condemned. Democracy can be just as
tyrannical, and just as oppressively disregardful of the individual, as any of
its opposite number. Democracy is inevitable. But it needs more than mere
democracy to save even the mere political man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is that, between the State and the Individual, Gandhism assists us to avoid
the horns of a dilemma. The individual is of pivotal value. He is the source
and the <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of all authority. The State and the
Government derive their very existence and their power from him. A State or a
Government can hardly exist even for a while without the cooperation of its
people, its members, the individuals. Each individual has the right to
cooperate with the State as well as not to cooperate, to non-cooperate.
Individuals offer their cooperation when the State acts justly and fairly, and
advances their good. They withdraw their cooperation when it acts unjustly and
unfairly, and hinders their progress. They non-cooperate. When the State goes
wrong the State must be reformed by moral pressure, by non-violent non-cooperation.
The history of the struggle for<i> </i>Indian freedom, between 1918 and 1947,
was the history of the application of the principle of non-violent
non-cooperation, of negative response, to the claims of Authority. World
History records no similar instance of the withdrawal of cooperation with the
State History’s only alternative to acquiescence was armed revolt. It is well
stated by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Datta</span>, an eminent interpreter of
Gandhism, that the edge of political consciousness should be kept sharp, and
that the government of a people should be kept straight, by means of a
judicious operation by the people of the twin principles of cooperation and
non-cooperation. The exercise of the right of franchise is but once in a fixed
number of years. The exercise of the right to cooperate or non-cooperate is
from day to day. Judiciousness in the operation of this double-edged weapon
comes out of an evolving morality both in the individual and in society,
culminating in the true spiritual freedom of both.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

innate inadequacy of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Neo-liberalism of a pragmatic, un-spiritual kind attempted a synthesis of the
complex material needs and interests of the community and the equally complex
moral needs of the individual. Neo-liberalism, <span class=SpellE>savouring</span>
of Green, <span class=SpellE>Hobhouse</span>, Barker and even <span
class=SpellE>Laski</span>, failed to inspire men, because, as <span
class=SpellE>Shri</span> K. P. <span class=SpellE>Mukherji</span> observes, it
did not attempt the fusion of the social and the spiritual elements in man. The
religious impulse and content in liberalism have dried up. No political
philosophy which does not receive its <i>élan vital </i>from the richer and
truer springs of religion in man can aspire to be synthetic, complete and
perennial. We need an integrated political philosophy which encompasses the
individual as well as the society of Individuals, which does not ignore the
individual the moment it creates its own concept of an all-powerful State,
which <span class=SpellE>recognises</span> Man as more than Man, which gives
full validity to the ultimate reality of Spirit as against the immediate
reality of Matter. Politics, so viewed, becomes an aspect of religion–in its
sense of a progressively evolving morality. Our acceptance and our application
of defined political standards in life is possible, and is justifiable, only on
the sure base of a higher metaphysics which supports and keeps alive our moral
and our political beliefs as correlated beliefs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

theory is undoubtedly the first great attempt in recent history to <span

democratic inasmuch as it advocates conversion instead of coercion even in <i>Satyagraha,
</i><span class=SpellE>emphasising</span> man’s rationalism and man’s altruism,
and appealing to the best in him. It is communistic inasmuch as it passionately
demands the emergence of an egalitarian, classless society. The hedonistic
calculus and the economic determinism of communism are ruled out by faith in the
progressive role of the human spirit. Sheer determinism is ruled out<i> </i>by
faith in the purposefulness of human effort. In such a scheme of thought,
consciousness and being are not related to each other in the way Marx conceived
them to be related. A philosophical differentiation between liberalism and
communism is impossible within the scheme of occidental values, which covers
both liberalism and communism: the refinement of liberalism being a mere
rationalisation of the common concept of man’s hatred and greed. Man does not
only hater. He also loves his kind. Man is not only greedy. He also loves to
share with his kindred. Mutuality, cooperation, and love are as much man’s
character as greed and hatred. They are his deeper character, more surely than
exploitation and class consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Underlying
the political theory of democracy from the time of John Stuart Mill is the
thesis of the contradiction between the Individual and Society. Underlying the
communist theory from the time of Karl Marx is the thesis of the antagonism
between the Class and the State. Whether it is the Individual <i>vs. </i>the
State or the Class <i>vs. </i>the State, the State is different from both, the
State is ruthless power, and the State is morally vulnerable. In the one, it is
an unavoidable evil. In the other, it is an exploiter. Every act of the State
is followed by a mark of doubt and interrogation. The concept of duality as
regards the State and the Individual, or as regards the State and the Class, is
not conducive either to stability or to progress. It is the kind of approach
which encourages strife and the spirit of grab. On the other hand, in a society
where the individual either cooperates cheerfully or non-cooperates
non-violently the seeming opposition between the individual and society is not
there. Social living becomes a thrilling adventure in the effort to discover
the true individual in each of us, composed of layers of <span class=SpellE>consciouseness</span>
which are each in accord with the other, and with all of which the coming
social order is in complete accord. There can then be no opposition between
true individual interest and social restraint. In a society increasingly based
on truth, non-violence and love, the striking of the mean between individual
freedom and social restraint does not present any serious difficulty. In fact,
each individual can say, “I am Society, I am the State.” Each individual can
say, “I shall mould Society. I shall mould the State. I shall make them what I
am or what I desire, if need be, even by non-violent non-cooperation.” In the
language of Gandhism, “Individual freedom can have the fullest play only under
a regime of unadulterated <i>ahimsa.”</i> Murder makes the <span class=SpellE>Bren</span>

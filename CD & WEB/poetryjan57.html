style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poetry,
it is admitted by every body, is one of the fine arts. Tolstoy takes the
definition of art as the external manifestation, by means of lines, colours,
movements, sound or words, of emotions felt by man’ given by Veron and adds
that it must be effective as well. This is comprehensive enough to include
every one of the fine arts of which dance, music and poetry are of one
category, in that they may not have a permanent form. Poetry was originally
sung and heard but not written and read. Man, as that great philosopher
Aristotle says, is a social animal and the most essential requisite for a
social life is the communication of feelings and ideas to one another. That
could be done in three ways, when writing was not yet known, namely, by bodily
signs including facial expressions, by various cries with tonic modulations and
by the use of words. There is an increase in range though a decrease in depth,
from the former to the latter, in their capacity as modes of expression. That is
to say the facial expression, as a frown, or the bodily movement, as a shrug,
can be useful only when the parties are very near, and even then, they are
expressive of only a limited number of primary and simple emotions. On the
other band, the cries would be effective to even a distance and can reveal a
wider range of emotions. Words, of course, with their conventional meanings,
have the widest range. Thus each latter is more extensive in its operation than
the former. But at the same time it may be noted that what is gained in
extension is lost in intension. The facial expression is a better index, than
the cry, of an emotion, because possibly it is more universal. Of the three,
the word is the least universal as it is dependent upon the knowledge of the particular
language or the conventional system. Of these three means of expression of
emotion, the first two were already in use even in the animal life, and man is
the inventor of the last one. The advantage of the word is that it is, among
other things, the best, if not the only, means for the communication of
knowledge, which consists primarily of ideas, as distinct from feelings and
emotions. Art is, as we have seen, the effective transmission of emotions and
feelings, as opposed to the communication of ideas, which is the province of
science. In other words, it is emotional and not intellectual; it is concerned
with the heart </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and not so much with the head. Again it is not
mere intimation but infection, if one may use that word. That is where it
differs from the ordinary business. In Art, the emotion is not intended to be
intellectually perceived, but it is intended to be sympathetically lived. Now
then, when the transmission of a feeling is done through a word, as in poetry,
there is first the transformation of the ‘feeling’ into ‘idea’, which is
expressed through a sound symbol, which is decoded again at the other end. It
is a long process and the feeling would lose much of its freshness and
intensity by the time it reaches the other end. That is why, in many cases, it
is proving unable to recall the experience in the hearer. But in the case of
music, the emotion flows out, without much of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>an intellectual
intervention of the voluntary (human) agency, and acts directly upon the heart,
the seat of emotions, without the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>necessity of passing
through the medium of the hearer’s head, as the message is not sent in code.
That is to say, music speaks in the language of the beast, and poetry in the
language of the head. So it is that, as an art, music is more effective and
quick in action in kindling emotions than poetry; and this absolute truth is
clearly noticed by the ancient seers, who announced,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a discussion of poetry is taken up, I like to say one or two things about
music. It is given the status of a Veda as Gandharva and it is called
‘Sangitam’ by the Oriental scholars. ‘Sangitam’ etymologically means well-sung.
It is said to be a synonym of Tauryatrika which literally means the triune with
the Turiya. The lexicographer Amarasimha says “<i>Tauryatrikam nrutta giro
vadyam Natyamidam Trayam</i>”<i> </i>that is to say that Tauryatrika is the
triune of dance, song and orchestra, the three organs relating to a drama. But
this interpretation appears to be a development long after the advent of
Bharata, who established the dramatic art–Natya–which comprehended not only
Music <i>Sangitam, </i>and Dance <i>Nrutyam, </i>but also poetry. The original
meaning of the term Sangita appears to be the triune of vocal song with the
accompaniment of <i>Tambour </i>and drum representing the Raga, Tana (Sruti)
and Tala (Laya) aspects respectively. This can be gathered from Kalidasa’s <i>Meghasamdesam
</i>1.60 which runs thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fallen into the popular error that was current from the days of Amarashnha,
when he comments <i>‘Pasupateh nithyam Sannihitasya Sivasya–Nrutyata iti

developed from the physical expression as the other two were developed from
tonal and verbal expressions. It is called <i>Nritya </i>as distinct from <i>Natya

Yasobhushanam. (See the commentary of Kumaraswami also). But in course of time
dance itself was begun to be called, obviously erroneously, as Natya, as when a
performance in ‘Bharata Natyam’ is announced. So also here a mistake has crept
into the terminology or rather into the explanation of the term. It was only
after the development of the three modes of expression into the three different
arts of dancing <i>Nrutyam, </i>music <i>Sangitam, </i>and poetry <i>Sahityam, </i>that
it was found to be more effective to unite them into one comprehensive Art of
Dramaturgy, <i>Natyam. </i>Art is skill and the different means of transmission
of emotions which arise out of social necessity were skillfully handled by
capable persons, so as to yield the maximum effect, so as to recall the same
emotions in the recipient and not merely to give an intimation of them, turned
into art to adorn the life; and the latest of them is poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
what is poetry? It is an art in words or a literary art. ‘It takes its origin
from emotion recollected in tranquility’, says Wordsworth, but Mill appears to
differ from him when he says ‘What is poetry, but the thoughts and words in
which emotion spontaneously embodies itself’. But the difference is only
apparent, because Wordsworth has not completed his sentence but continues, ‘the
emotion is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the tranquility
gradually disappears, and an emotion, kindred to that which was before the
subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist
in the mind.’ Thus even according to Wordsworth, the poet, at the time of
writing, has to lose his tranquillity and has to work himself up to the
original emotion and has to be, in the words of Mill, ‘possessed by the
feeling.’ A poet is thus one who is inspired and poetry is nothing but the
spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings,’ as Wordsworth puts it, in words.
The general notion of the English critic is that poetry has always the form of
verse or the aid of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>meter and is something other than prose.
Thus it is that Shelley proclaims that ‘the language of poets has ever affected
a certain </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound,
without which it were not poetry.’ Leigh Hunt also says that ‘Verse is the
final proof to the poet that his mastery over the art is complete.’ Here, it
may be noted that the viewpoint of the Sanskrit critic is quite </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>different,
for he says that prose is the touchstone of poetry <i>(Gadyam Kavinam Nikasham
Vadant–Vamana). </i>However, in what Leigh </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hunt says, there is an
implied acceptance of prose as also poetry. But the popular use of the terms
prose and poetry, in juxtaposition to each other, points our the general trend
of equating poetry with verse. But, when Carlyle says, that ‘Whatsoever is not
sung is properly no poem’, he should not be taken to be echoing the popular
error, because what he actually means is something different, as is evident
from the rest of the sentence which runs ‘but a piece of prose cramped into
jingling lines.’ He means merely that poetry is spontaneous and he puts the
same in clearer terms when he says ‘Poetic creation, what is this too, but
seeing the thing sufficiently! The word, that will describe the thing, flows of
itself from such clear intense sight.’ Wordsworth, as has been noticed already,
speaks of ‘contemplation’, and Carlyle speaks of ‘seeing’. They are thinking of
two distinct sources of inspiration for the poet. The stimulus may be objective
or subjective, either to be ‘seen’, or to be ‘contemplated’, but one thing is
sure, namely that the poet has got to react and give himself up to the emotion,
has got to be ‘possessed’ by it and to live the experience and be filled with
it, before we can expect any overflow from him, which can really thrill us. The
words may come in measured feet or not, that does not matter. But one thing can
be asserted, that the more probable it is, that it takes some form of
rhythmical flow, that the words would play in measured feet, would dance, so to
say. For, as has been already stated, music has the advantage of directly
affecting the heart, and as such, the words set to tune would naturally,
‘without passing through the judgment, gain the heart, and all its end at once
gained’-pope. There lies the nucleus of truth around which grew the popular
fallacy. Thus, though the meter or the musical element has its own part in the
poetic art, the importance of the ‘word’ should not be subordinated, lest it
may cease to be poetry and become music. Poetry, is essentially an art in
words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sanskrit Alankarikas included both prose and verse in the term poetry when they
defined it either as ‘ <i>Sahrudaya h,udayahladakari sabdarthamayatvameva
kavyalakshanam’ </i>as <i>‘Rasatmakam vakyam kavyam’ </i>as <i>‘Ramaniyarthapratipadakah
sabdah kavyam’ </i>and when they finally categorised it into verse, prose and
mixed types. Even when it is said that the emotion must overflow, it only means
that it should be very intensive and not that the poet should absolutely lose
his control. If the emotion takes the upper hand–becomes uncontrolled–the
expression would necessarily be music, and not poetry, emotional sounds and not
meaningful words. Therefore in poetry there is always an element of will. But
the greater the control, the more it is likely, that the form it takes is
prose. Nevertheless true poetry must embody itself ‘in symbols which are the
nearest possible representations of the feeling’ as Mill has it, and the words,
which are mere symbols as their meanings are but conventional, are to be so
used as to lead on to the feeling proper over and beyond the convention. This
is done by ‘suggestion’ or hinting at the associated ideas something akin to
the process of a conditioned reflex. This is what is called <i>Vyangya </i>by
the Sanskrit Alankarikas and it came to reign supreme in the field of literary
criticism from the day it was established by Anandavardhana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to Anandavardhana <i>Dhwani </i>or <i>Vyangya </i>or suggestion is the <i>Sahrudaya
hrudayahladakari kavyatatvam </i>and it is of three types <i>Vastu, Alamkara </i>and
<i>Rasabhavadi, </i>that is to say, incident, ornament (figure of speech) and
sentiment (emotion and feeling). He asserts in many places, that of these
three, the last variety is the best, which point was taken up and developed in
his theory of literary art by Viswanadha. As poetry is the effective expression
of emotion in words, it is but meet to think that the suggestion of sentiment
is alone poetry. But still Anandavardhana could not boldly state so. His
commentator, Abhinavagupta, tries to find a reason for the statement of Ananda,
that suggestion in general is the soul of poetry, in the following words: <i>‘Tena
rasa eva vastuta alma. vastvalankara dhvaneetu sarvadha rasam prati
paryavasyete iti vachya dutkrustau tavityabhiprayena dhwanih kavyasyatmeti
samanyenoktam. </i>But as a matter of fact it does not appear to be the correct
explanation. It is true that for a drama, sentiment or emotion alone was held
to be the essence and so Bharata, who was mainly concerned with the dramatic
art, could say that the emotion is the soul of art (drama). But Ananda </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was
concerned with <i>Sargabandha </i>more and the authors there of were not always
dealing with emotion alone as he himself puts it <i>‘Sargabandhestu
rasatatparye yadharasam auchityam anythatu kamacharah; dvayorapi margayoh
sargabandha vidhayinam darsanat.’ </i>There we find the real reason for his
definition in a general and wider strain. He wanted to include the <i>Vastu
Kavya </i>as well as <i>Bhava Kavya </i>in his definition of poetry, though he
was neither logical nor rational in that. Anyway, it may be noted that this
idea, of suggestion being the central principle, is accepted by the Western
critics. Martin Gilkes says, in his book entitled ‘A Key to Modern English
Poetry’, that the old idea of representation has given place to the new theory
of communication in poetry and accordingly, the old method of direct
presentation has been replaced by the new technique of indirect suggestion. ‘We
all know how one thing suggests another. That is the technique of evocation’
says the same critic at one place, and at another he says, ‘Logically,
therefore, we may observe, the ideal poem would, consist of a single word,
supposing you could find one, which would fulfill the necessary condition of
suggesting both the subject of the poem and the whole range of associations
which the mind connects with it.’ Of course it should be that the subject is
expressed and the associations suggested; these are two distinct functions of
the word as is clearly noticed by the Sanskrit critic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
as to the content of poetry, the later Sanskrit critics were unanimous on this
point, namely, that emotion is the essence of poetry. The emotion is of two
types: primary and secondary; or permanent and transcendent. The permanent
emotion is given the technical name of <i>Sthayi Bhava </i>and the transient
emotions are called <i>Sanchari Bhavas. </i>The ideal of a poet is to represent
or communicate the <i>Sthayi Bhava </i>by depicting the appropriate associate
transient emotions. Mill also endorses this view when he says that the poetry
of poets ‘is little else than a pouring forth of the thoughts and images that
pass across the mind while some permanent state of feeling is occupying it’.
Thus it can be said that any poetic piece has got to have not only a unity of
plot or incident but also a unity of emotion or sentiment as Anandavardhana
puts it <i>‘Karyamekam yatha vyapi prabandhasya vidhiyate tatha rasasyapi vidhe
virodho naiva vidyate.’ </i>The emotion is only suggestible and not
expressible. Having been suggested, it conjures up in a sympathetic hearer, a
similar emotion which would give relish. In this, in the words of T. G.
Williams, ‘Each member of the audience will bring his own conscious or
sub-conscious memories to help.’ This is exactly what Kalidasa has suggested in
the lines <i>‘Tat chetasa smarati nunam abodhapurvam bhavasthirani jananan tara
sauhrudani.’ </i>The Rasa as thus enjoyed, is relish and as represented, is
relishability, and the production of that relish is the </span><span

feature of poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
then are the essentials of a true poet? It is again Mill, that divides poets
into two classes, namely the poets of nature and the poets of culture, and says
that the former are superior to the latter. This corresponds to the discussion
of the same topic by Jagannadhapandita. Even Dandi hints at this when he writes
<i>‘Na vidyate yadyapi purvavasanagunanubandhi prathibhanam adbhutam srutena
yatnena cha vagupasita dhruvam karotyeva kamapyanugraham.’ </i>Note the
significance of <i>cha </i>which makes study and practice together one course
and <i>Eva </i>and <i>Kamapi </i>which indicate that it, in any way, makes only
a second rate poet. Anandavardhana also expresses a similar opinion when
treating of <i>Sakti </i>or <i>Pratibha </i>and <i>Vyutpatti. </i>Bhatta Tonta
is said to have stated that <i>‘Darsanat varnana chchatha rudha loke kavi
srutih’ </i>and it means that a poet must have the insight, leading to the
heights of emotion and the expression, reaching to the depths of feeling. The
one is a gift and the other is an acquisition. So a perfect poet is one who has
in him both these qualities developed to the full. If he were to lack the
former, his work would be wanting in the spirit of poesy, and if he lacks the
latter, it would be devoid of the look of poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
finally, coming to the end of poetry. The general view of the Western critic is
that it is nothing but the production of joy or delight. Some have said that
poetry is to delight and to teach. It is, of course, Wordsworth who affirms
that the purpose of poetry is ‘to describe objects,’ and utter sentiments, of
such a nature, and in such connection with each other, that the understanding
of the reader must necessarily be in some degree enlightened, and his
affections strengthened and purified.’ This is quite similar to the estimate of
the Eastern critic who, in the words of Bhamaha, proclaims the purposes of
poetry as <i>‘Chaturvargabhidhanepi bhuyasarthopadesakrit.’ </i>The aim of
every activity according to oriental thought is to elevate humanity, i.e., to
instruct, and the art of poetry is no exception to the rule. The special
feature of it lies only in the method it adopts which is described by Mammata
in the words ‘<i>kantasammitataya Upadesayuje.</i>’<i> </i>It is not to delight
and to teach but to teach through delight. <i>‘Visvasreyah Kavyam’ </i>exclaims
the great poet and <i>Sreyah </i>is clearly distinguished from <i>Preyah </i>by
the <i>Kathopanishad </i>and it is that, that is the end of all poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

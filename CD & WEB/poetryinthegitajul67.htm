as a treatise on philosophy, ethics and religion the <i>Bhagavadgita </i>is no
less precious as a poem of endless and wonderful charm. If it is claimed that
it has been composed by the great sage-poet Vyasa, the claim never diminishes
but sufficiently enhances the glory and fame that he has attained by writing
the most celebrated epic–the <i>Mahabharata. </i>What popularity and praise the
<i>Bhagavadgita </i>has won is not merely due to the fact that it has led
Arjuna and many others, through moral and spiritual conflicts, to a sure haven,
where spirituality is restored to its eternal glory and morality is vindicated
beyond any doubt. Its praise and popularity also rest on certain other
qualities that it possesses–qualities which undoubtedly contribute to the worth
of a composition as a beautiful poem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Embedded
in the <i>Mahabharata </i>as a gem, the <i>Gita </i>sheds its lustre over the
whole of this colossal epic and lends a strange unity and harmony to the host
of facts that the epic contains. One can feel very well that a deeper meaning,
a calm sense of truth and perfection and a mellow beauty of human sympathy
permeate the warring events and jolting movements of many of the episodes of
this epic. All the different stories and anecdotes of this great book seem to
have been included to serve one great purpose and all the different characters
seem to have derived their distinct individualities from one tremendous motive
force. The <i>Gita </i>lends this deeper meaning, this sense of truth and perfection,
this purpose, this tremendous motive force. What would have been a loose
conglomeration of facts, gains the vigour of unity and integrity through its
spiritual sustenance. But for it, the <i>Mahabharata </i>would have lost much
of its unity, much of its cohesiveness. That the <i>Gita </i>helps to bring
about this fusion among an endless number of facts is not entirely due to its
wholesome philosophy and rich moral tone. It is also due to its poetic harmony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

joy and sorrow, hope and despair finds a place of honour in it, with its
turbulent doubts and fears derives lasting solace from it, with its endless and
intricate problems looks up to it for guidance. As a matter<i> </i>of fact this
noble message, this ‘Song Celestial’ is believed to have been communicated in
the face of one of the greatest human ordeals. The surging terror of the
battlefield on one hand and the formidable doubts of Arjuna on the other, with
a long history of sorrow and suffering of the Pandavas at the background, could
inspire such a message. Finding his own kith and kin, his own revered superiors
and teachers arrayed against him in a deadly fight Arjuna, the greatest of the
Mahabharata heroes, finds himself overwhelmed with powerful emotions. His heart
is assailed with sorrow and pity and an overpowering sense that he is going to
commit a terrible sin. He refuses to fight and lays down his bow and arrow. The
world literature has hardly any such grand picture to show except this one. The
major portion of the first chapter and a part of the second one of the <i>Gita </i>have
been devoted to delineating Arjuna’s sorrow, compassion and doubts. This lends
abundant human interest to the book, which would, otherwise, have been a dry
philosophical discourse. Here lies the great poetic charm of the book. The Gita
in this portion shows how Arjuna has become emotionally upset, and what a great
sentimental torture he suffers from. So tormented he has been that he goes so
far as to aver that he would himself be killed rather than win the battle
through killing and bloodshed. This background of human emotions and sentiment
lends a distinct character to this book. It seems that a deep sense of anguish
and bewilderment has been woven into its lofty philosophical message. It seems
that an expert architect has built up a wonderful edifice with marble and
granite, matching with rare skill the soft colour of the former with the hard
and grim features of the latter. This unstinting interest in human character
and human activities makes it possible for the <i>Gita </i>to act as a
cementing force in order to bring about a deeper understanding among the
divergent tendencies of the <i>Mahabharata. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
way the <i>Gita </i>begins and its conversational manner are quite of a piece
with the lovely features of true poetry. As soon as one starts reading the
first chapter of this book, one is thrown headlong into a critical situation.
The intense longing of Dhritarashtra to know what his sons and the Pandavas are
doing in the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>battlefield and the way Sanjaya fervently
describes the awe-inspiring condition of both the armies are really dramatic.
The conversational manner maintains this dramatic nature and keeps up an
atmosphere of suspense and curiosity. The eager and earnest queries of Arjuna
made from time to time lend a touch of reality to the whole discourse. Arjuna
questions and hears, hears and questions raising relevant points, expressing
sincere doubts, sometimes giving vent to very grave concern till at last his
doubts and fears are allayed. He then wants to see the real image of
Srikrishna, the creator, sustainer and destroyer of the Universe, and
Srikrishna complying with this earnest prayer shows him His real image with all
its terror in endless forms. Horrible yet sublime, this image, this vision of
the Lord of the Universe is intended to bring home to Arjuna that death is an
inevitable fact and an essential part of creation. Though the purpose is
philosophical, one can never ignore the poetic grandeur of the passage which
unfolds this vision, this supreme form of the Lord of the Universe. Sri
Aurobindo has rightly said in his <i>Essays on the Gita </i>that the vision of
the universal Purusha is one of the best known and powerfully poetic passages
in the <i>Gita. </i>The way this vision is unfolded and the way Arjuna shrinks
back into a state of fear and stoop as to be compelled to say that he wants to
see the charming image of Srikrishna and not this terrific one bear testimony
to the rare poetic genius of the writer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
has been said above is enough to prove, to the hilt of any doubt, that the <i>Gita
</i>is a beautiful poem. But that is not all. The way the thoughts are arranged
right from the stage where Srikrishna starts defining and explaining <i>Sankhya
Yoga </i>till the end of the book not only adds to their logical coherence but
also speaks highly of the skill of the writer as a poet. First comes the <i>Sankhya
Yoga </i>in order to elevate Arjuna’s mind to a higher plane of philosophy.
This is essentially necessary for one in order to be initiated into spiritual
enlightenment and into the higher mission of life in the light of that
enlightenment. After <i>Sankhya Yoga, </i>come the chapters on action,
knowledge, renunciation etc., one after another, to acquaint Arjuna with
different aspect of spiritual discipline, which one should undergo in order to
attain the goal of perfection. By the time these things have been explained
Arjuna’s mind is rendered free from all kinds of ignorance. His heart is now
probably attuned to the eternal blissfulness of divinity and he has risen to a
height which is ever </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bathed in the glow of spiritual
knowledge. Then comes the description of the infinite glory of God<i> </i>and
the unfolding of His supreme form. This is the right hour for that, because
there is now not a shred of doubt, not a shred of ignorance left in Arjuna’s
mind, which, instead of helping him to realise truth through the realisation of
the glory of God, would have frightened him into greater ignorance. Free from all
ignorance, all bondage of worldly passions Arjuna now witnesses the vision of
the world-spirit, the supreme image of God, and bows down to Him in boundless
awe and adoration. The infinite magnificence of that vision, the grand majesty
of that rare experience overawes him, bends him low, humbles him and makes him
fit to receive a lesson on devotion, because the essential quality of a devotee
is humility. So comes the chapter on devotion which brings a calm assurance, a
never failing faith, a severe realisation that God is all powerful, all knowing
and all good. When this realisation is there, all doubts are stilled, all
questions are silenced. Arjuna then listens to Srikrishna’s exposition of
metaphysical knowledge with calm earnestness and with a majestic faith. He
still questions, but that is only to sustain the conversation. He still
interrupts, but not perturbed with doubts. Thus the dramatic urgency of the
poem diminishes, though it still persists. How very natural it seems</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>how
very realistic! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
poetic excellence of the <i>Gita </i>is also enhanced by its language which
adds to its melody and cadence and helps its sublime thoughts vibrate in our
mind. The quiet solemn and confident tone of Srikrishna irradiates our heart
with the effulgence of spiritual assurance. The calm pictures of the life of a
Yogi, the comparative views of different stages of life and different types of
character, the description of the endless glory of God and, above all, the
vision of the Universal Soul create immense pictorial effect. These are all
indisputable qualities of excellent poetry. Dr. Radhakrishnan has, thus, said
that the <i>Gita</i> stands midway between a philosophical system and a poetic
inspiration. He has also said that the <i>Gita</i> is the most popular
religious poem of Sanskrit literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

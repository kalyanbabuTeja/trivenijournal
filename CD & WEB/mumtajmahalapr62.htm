was an unforgettable scene at <i>Agra. </i>People were engrossed in the ensuing
celebrations of prince Khurram’s assumption of the title of <i>Shah Jahan </i>(The
ruler of the world). The Mughal monarch, so very well known for his reign in
history, had usurped the throne of Delhi from his father. The dead body of his
father, Jahangir, had been interred in a tomb at Lahore and Nur Jahan his
consort, was in prison. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

these events were not quite unexpected at the Mughal court. Nur Jahan tried her
best to employ strategem for suppressing the supporters of Khurram but failed
miserably. Even her own brother, Asaf Khan, turned her mortal enemy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

none outside ever knew that certain significant happenings had transpired
within. The function was to come off in a few hours. The concourse at the
Diwan-i-khas was eagerly watching for the queen to appear on the balcony: for
Nur Jahan had brought the custom into vogue, to appear there on very select
occasions, despite the fact that the Begums, being purdah nashins, never before
used to appear in public. Hence the vast mass of people were looking forward to
a gaze at the Begum, Arjumand Bano. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the fort been in its prior condition, visitors could have guessed some of the
events in advance. But the great changes effected, as also the fresh buildings
in marble, lavishly added by Shah Jahan, made the place look entirely different
and wonderful. The pools of clear water from the river Jumna, as well as the
myriad fountains in the gardens, splashing rose-water all round, made all eyes
and hearts feel a strange thrill. It was a paradise enough. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the day. The Begum was drying her flowing tresses in the fumes of scented wood

her stood women bearing on silver trays costly costumes and ornaments of gems
and pearls set </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

the answer of Juleka it was evident she had not approved of Mumtaj’s
indifference to everything pertaining to herself. For she spoke with a certain
amount of ardour: “Are these fit words for a Moghal princess on the throne of
Delhi? Soon the world, which did not hesitate to aclaim your aunt as Nur Jahan
(Light of the world) will love to call you by the term of <i>Mumtaj Mahal, </i>finding
you the proud possessor of both light and laughter.” The Begum did not fail to
notice the hidden significance of Juleka’s observations. So she pursued, “Do
you really think it a greater honour to be called <i>Mumtaj, </i>when I occupy
the same status as my aunt’s, which had earned for her the celebrated title of
Nur Jahan?” and as if recollecting the message from her father, she wrapped her
head and shoulders in a thin shawl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Khan was not only the nearest relation of the Emperor, but his chief minister
as well. His influence at the royal court was immense. His own glittering
retinue equalled the monarch’s in splendour. His men followed him wherever he
went. The Mughal court showed him great respect and all the officials bowed
before him. It was not difficult to divine the cause of his power at court. The
king consulted him in everything of consequence to the realm. The manner in
which the menials about the zenana fussed on his arrival amply bore out his
unquestioned authority. Such a commotion and excitement never attended even the
Badshah’s approach. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

greying anywhere in his hair, on the head or the beard. He held his head with
an unapproachable bearing. Seeing signs of weariness and anxiety on his

Alas, Allah be blamed for shaping you like this when, with your rare endowments

with courage and decision. There is, however, hardly time for dreams and

hearing her last words. But only for a second was he thus excited; for at the
next he calmed himself and recollected how he had promised her satisfaction of
any request, and he resolved to keep it at any cost. Yet he began, “Am I
listening to you, my darling! You are mistaken in your belief that your aunt is
a kind woman. She will vomit only venom. You are so innocent and unassuming
that she can easily strip you clean with her words. Ponder awhile your own lack
of wisdom,” and he tried to lift her face to see what change was there as a
reaction to his warning. But seeing deep disappointment alone writ large on her
face, he decided to let her have her way. He drew himself up and cautioned her
thus: “Mumtaj, go if you want to see her. I do not prevent you, having given
you my word. Only one condition I shall impose. Do not tarry longer than
necessary with her.” He then left her, walking slowly towards his own
apartments. Mumtaj peeped into the mirror only to be confronted with her own
strange looks reflected there. She wondered why her eyes betrayed so much of
trepidation. Being the first woman in the whole of Hindustan, what need had she
to evince fear and caution of the kind? Had not her husband and her own father
proved themselves quite strong of mind on occasions demanding of extreme nerve
and decision? Doubts and questions rose, wave on wave, in her, but to no
purpose, as they never came within reach of the shore. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Beware, you may also meet with a similar fate. I have no more fear of anything.

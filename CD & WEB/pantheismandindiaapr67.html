style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Etymologically,
pantheism is the view that all is God, and that God is all, but, since thought
may move either, from God to all or from all to God, it can assume two forms.
If it begins with the religious belief or the philosophic faith in God as
infinite and eternal reality, then the finite and temporal world is swallowed
up in God, and pantheism becomes acosmism, i.e., the world is an illusion in comparison
with God as reality. If it begins with the scientific conception or the poetic
vision of the world as unity, then God is lost in the world, and pantheism
becomes pancosmism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here,
we are concerned with the theistic or religious conception of pantheism. The
definitions of pantheism generally agree in identifying God with the world: God
and the Universe are one and inseparable; all is God and God is all; nature and
God are identical. So far as the terms go, such statements are acceptable,
emphasizing, as they do, the oneness and the divineness of reality. Everything,
however, depends upon the meaning of the notion God employed in these
definitions, and on this point authorities differ. Recent naturalistic systems
like Haeckel’s, which call themselves pantheistic, conceive of God as the
universal substance which obeys the physical law of energy, and the ancient
naturalistic philosopher Strato is frequently characterized as a pantheist,
although his God is, in Cicero’s words, ‘without sense and form’. To call the
world God in such cases is, however, as Schopenhauer justly declares, merely to
increase the language with a superfluous synonyms for the word ‘God’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
be true to the spirit of pantheism, we mean by it that doctrine which conceives
of reality as one in essence and form, and thinks of this unity as somehow
rational and divine. Hence, according to this teaching, God is an entity not
separate from the world and remote from it, but in it and of it–immanent, not
transcendent; everything partakes of the nature of God. The particular objects
and individuals have no absolute existence of their own, but are either modes
of the universal substance or parts of the divine whole. Moreover, all things
arise from God by necessity; they </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>follow inevitably from
His infinite being.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has frequently been affirmed, by none more emphatically than by A. Barth, who
has done so much for the elucidation of Indian thought, that the tone and
tendency of Indian conviction and belief are as a whole pantheistic. With at
least equal truth the assertion might be made that India reasons upon theistic
presumptions, and that her favourite philosophy reaches idealistic conclusions.
Under other skies and in other lands, it might appear difficult to induce
harmonious working of principles and theories so diverse. In the Indian mind
they coalesce, or, if the figure be preferred, occupy different compartments
without impairing the unity of the whole. The Indian merchant or peasant is a
philosopher, who is generally ready to give a reason for the faith that is in
him, and always eager for a debate thereon. In most instances, his views of God
and the universe will be found to be pantheistic, dominated in the ultimate
issue by idealistic traditions and teachings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian
pantheism originated in different conceptions, and aimed at satisfying
different types and preconceptions of thought from the European. Historically
also it has run a different course. Perhaps, the identity of name has led to an
exaggerated conception of the strength of the influence which pantheistic ideas
have exercised upon the outlook and character of the Indian people. In reality
for all practical purposes, it has been slight. Except in the case of a few
mystics, pantheism has never been the most forceful motive of action or belief;
nor is it at all likely to strengthen its hold in the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the hymns of the Rigveda pantheistic strain of thought is discernible from the
very beginning. The rude and superficial polytheism of the popular faith failed
to content the more earnest thinkers among the poets; and the response which in
some instances at least was given to the search for a more satisfying creed was
in the direction of unifying all gods, all existences, into one. <i>Agni </i>especially
was the centre of this assimilating movement. The essence </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
fire appeared to pervade all things, and to give them warmth and being; when <i>Agni
</i>withdrew himself, the life also vanished. </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All the gods
accordingly are identified with <i>Agni, </i>and <i>Agni </i>himself is all the
gods.<sup>1</sup> Three general conceptions or theories of the constitution of
the universe are present to the minds of the writers–monotheism, polytheism and
pantheism–and of these the pantheistic view ultimately overshadows and controls
the others. Within the limits of the Rigveda the tendency to pantheism
culminates in the hymn to the unknown God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
culminating point of Indian speculation was reached in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
thought of the <i>Upanishads, </i>and in the system of the Vedanta founded on
them. That system assumed finally a pantheistic shape, and, thus, formulated,
secured the assent and conviction of the great majority of the Indian people.
Having failed to establish in intelligible form the mystical and metaphysical
doctrine of the <i>atman, </i>the thinkers of the <i>Upanishads </i>fell back
upon a modified pantheism. The universe was the created work of <i>Brahman, </i>who
(or which) then took possession of it as pervading principle or soul <i>(atman).
</i>The postulate of the sole reality of <i>Brahman </i>or the <i>atman </i>remained,
however, inviolable–one only without a second; and pantheistic speculation
therefore regarded the universe as immanent as it were in God, not conversely
God immanent in the universe. The doctrine thus formulated was in direct
succession with the thought of the <i>Brahmanas </i>and the Rigveda. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the <i>Mahabharata </i>and the epic literature generally the sub-stratum of
thought and belief which the writers presuppose, and on which they fall back,
is pantheistic, after the manner of the <i>Upanishads. </i>The divine actors
and heroes, however–Krishna in the <i>Mahabharata </i>and Rama in the <i>Ramayana</i>–are<i>
</i>the objects of an intense theistic reverence and devotion; and the
cross-currents of popular theism and philosophic pantheism run deep and strong.
In general, in the thought and exposition of the poems as a whole the former
appears to be in retreat before the vigour and persistence of pantheistic
ideas. The theism, however, whether or not it is really the older stratum in
this literature, is in no danger of dissolution. The conflict is most apparent
in the episode of the <i>Bhagavad Gita, </i>where the dignity and authority of
the divine Krishna have attracted to his person a fervour of monotheistic
worship unequalled elsewhere in the history of India. Yet even here the
interwoven strands of pantheism are so intrusive and continuous that the nature
of the primitive basis upon which the poem has been built up is still regarded
by scholars as doubtful. Unquestionably, however, in the epic period pantheism
as a reasoned explanation of the constitution of the universe is gaining ground
and commending itself to the thought </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and acceptance of the
people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hence
it is in what is known as Brahmanism and the philosophic Vedanta that the
stronghold of pantheistic thought in India is to be found. And it is a tribute
to the energy and conviction of its adherents that their doctrine has so
entirely taken possession of the Indian mind. Barth’s assertion is justified
that ‘India is radically pantheistic. But it would be equally correct to affirm
that India is radically mystical or radically theistic. In fact, the pantheism
in India is of an essentially mystical and visionary type, and lends itself to
dreamy aspirations, far removed from the hard and uncompromising theorizings of
the West. If carried to a logical conclusion, it finds itself in conflict both with
the practical necessities of life and with ancient theistic beliefs. It
compromises with both, and succeeds in living in harmony with habits and
deep-seated convictions which to minds differently constituted from the Indian
would appear to be fatal to its existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India’s
popular religious systems, on the other hand, are essentially theistic in
character, and constitute little to the significance or thought of pantheism.
This is true for the most part of the two greatest of these faiths, Vaishnavism
and Saivism, which in their varied forms share between them the allegiance of
the great majority of the people. In a broad sense it is true of both
Vaishnavite and Saivite that they are theist and pantheist in one, but that in
the urgency of daily life the latter creed is, with rare exceptions,
subservient to the former. Whatever his theory may be, the Indian regulates his
conduct by the desire to propitiate the gods and to receive help from them, not
by a pantheistic doctrine which confuses his personality and merges him in the
great unknown. In spite of this theistic tendency of an average Hindu mind, it
is however notable that an undercurrent of pantheism runs through the popular
theism, and there is no antagonism between the two. Like pantheism, theism too,
in the final analysis of things, upholds the philosophic faith in God as
infinite and eternal reality and ultimately subscribes to the idea of unity of
the world. Moreover, the theistic trends in Indian pantheism lead a majority of
the Indian people to make an attempt to bring it into some kind of harmony with
their moral behaviour or allow it to control their ethical habit or belief. The
ruling thought and inclination of the Indian people by nature intensely
religious is to seek intercourse with a personal God, to enlist His interest
and goodwill on their behalf, and to satisfy what they conceive to be His moral
demand. The abstract pantheism, devoid of any theistic bent, is for the most
part entirely without effect on daily conduct and life and is of no use for an
average man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

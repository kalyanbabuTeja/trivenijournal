<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Three
months ago, when the Fazl Ali Commission’s Report on the re-organisation of
States was presented to the nation, and the Prime Minister appealed for a
dispassionate consideration of the proposals, the atmosphere was not so
surcharged with acute discontent as it is today. Strong criticism was no doubt
directed against the proposed formation of the bi-lingual State of Bombay, with
Vidarbha left out. The leaders of Vidarbha Were keen on having a State of their
own; they would not join hands with the advocates of United Maharashtra. But
Vidarbha was slowly induced to support a fresh move for a yet larger State
consisting of all the Gujarati and Marathi speaking areas, with Bombay City as
its capital. But this was not acceptable to the leaders of Gujarat who were
afraid of ‘domination’ by Maharashtra. At a later stage, they agreed; but the
Maharashtra leaders dropped the proposal and resumed their original demand for
a purely Maharashtra State, including Vidarbha. They would not resile from the
position they have all along taken up, that Bombay is the natural capital of
Maharashtra, and cannot be cut off from it under any circumstances. The
decision<i> </i>of the Government of India to make Bombay City a Centrally
administered area, has roused the resentment of Maharashtra and an ugly
situation has developed, the consequences of which are unpredictable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is worth while recalling that the Government of India’s decision is in
consonance with<i> </i>the recommendations of earlier bodies like the Dhar
Commission<i> </i>and the J.V.P. Committee. The Prime Minister, in his
broadcast speech, gave full weight to the sentiment of Maharashtra by conceding
that Bombay was geographically a part of that area. But he felt impelled<i> </i>by
the special circumstances of the case, and, in particular, by the unique </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>economic
importance of the city, to justify its being carved out into a Centrally
administered area like Delhi. Where conflicting claims cannot be reconciled,
and powerful elements in the population of Bombay oppose its inclusion in a
uni-lingual State, the Central Government have taken the only step that is
possible for the adequate safeguarding of all the interests involved. The other
alternative of a separate State of Bombay, with the usual paraphernalia, was
apparently ruled out as too costly and clumsy. It is unfortunate that a city
which played a noble role in the freedom fight should have no elected Legislature
of its own; but this grievance may be remedied, to some extent, by enlarging
the powers of the Corporation of Bombay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
outbreak of violence in Bombay and Orissa, the difference of opinion over the
issue of Visalandhra, and the continued agitation about border areas like
Bellary and Belgaum, have led to a rapid re-orientation all over the country
with regard to the problem of linguistic States. The scheme of zonal advisory
councils is acceptable to the Working Committee of the Congress and to the Government
of India, but this is not meant to interfere with the present programme of
re-distribution of States. Uni-lingual States grouped into five zones for
purposes of co-ordination of activities, and consultation on matters of common
concern, is a perfectly sound proposition. But the Chief Ministers of Bihar and
Bengal sprang a surprise by their joint statement on the merger of the two
States to avoid the present border disputes between them. The idea has been
welcomed with enthusiasm, and similar bi-lingual States–in the South and the
West–are envisaged. As an escape from the present atmosphere of conflict, large
bi-lingual or tri-lingual States might appear to be a counsel of wisdom. But it
is necessary to remember that this will not solve the many problems which gave
rise to the demand for linguistic States in Bihar and Andhra, and later in
Orissa and Karnataka. The new found harmony between rival groups may not last
long. Further, while the border disputes between Bengali and Bihar, or Tamilnad
and Kerala, may be solved by the States’ being grouped together, the solution
will not apply to similar disputes between Bihar and Orissa, or between Orissa
and Andhra which are not so merged. This is not to deny the psychological value
of the move initiated by the Chief Ministers of Bengal and Bihar. Indeed, it is
like a silver lining to the cloud of distrust and despair enveloping us at the
moment. If voluntary agreement could be achieved through a union of hearts,
people speaking different, languages ought to be encouraged to effect mergers.
But it is vastly more important to emphasise the essential unity of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
and the virtues of a common Indian citizenship. There may be uni-lingual as
well as multi-lingual States, and very soon language will fall into its proper
place as a vehicle of expression and not the means of discord. The present
upheaval represents a passing phase in our national history</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
sad and shameful one. But a temporary situation like the present need not lead
to the complete scrapping of linguistic States, on which large sections of the
Indian people have set their hearts. Any re-organisation of States must keep in
view administrative and economic factors. The Fazl Ali Commission made their
recommendations after a careful consideration of all the relevant factors,
including that of language. Even now, it is not too late to implement those
recommendations, except where a change can be effected with the agreement of
the parties. Where such agreement is not forthcoming, a decision taken by the
Government of India in the wider interests of national unity must be accepted.
It is the prevailing uncertainty and the vacillation in high quarters that must
cease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If,
at a later stage, the idea of ‘mergers’ should gain momentum, the proper
grouping would be Maharashtra-Gujarat, Tamil-Kerala, and Visalandhra-Karnataka.
People in these States will gradually acquire a knowledge of both languages and
the Legislatures will be bi-lingual. While a member speaks in his own language,
he will be able to follow the speeches made in the other. All this seems to be
a far-off vision, but it is a vision worth pursuing. So, while the present
re-organisation is effected on the basis of the Fazl Ali Commission’s
recommendations, as modified by the decisions of the Government of India,
provision may be made in the Draft Bill for a re-grouping of States with the
consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the eve of Republic Day, All India Radio, Delhi, arranged for the first time a
‘National Symposium’ of poets representing the fourteen principal languages of
India. Sri Nehru, as Chairman of the Sahitya Akademi, inaugurated the function
and stressed the vital role which the modern Indian languages should play in
Republican India, and also their inter-dependence for their growth and
fulfillment. As poet after poet gave melodious expression to the urge for unity
in diversity, and called up visions of the India of the future, one experienced
an enrichment of the spirit. Here were the makers of the great modern
literatures of India, the inheritors of the traditions of Valmiki and Kalidasa.
In diverse tongues, but inspired by a common hope, they conveyed the message of
harmony on behalf of the millions of the land seeking in their respective
spheres to be worthy of our cultural heritage. The magic of the written word is
enhanced when the poet. communicates it in his own person. Over the air, his is
an invisible presence, and yet we love to imagine the well-known lineaments,
the graceful gestures, and the joy suffusing the countenance. And then followed
the renderings into Hindi which served to remind the eager listeners that in
thought-content, even as in the diction, the lilt of the verse and the quality
of creative imagination, there was a remarkable kinship among the poets. It is
noteworthy in this context that the Sahitya Akademi through its programme of
translations from one language to another, and anthologies of verse, song and
story, is laying the foundation of a cultural fellowship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

after laying the foundation stone of the Nagarjunasagar Project, Sri Nehru
visited the Nagarjunakonda Valley which contains the precious relics of
Buddhist Art dating from the age of the Ikshvakus of Vijayapuri. He was deeply
moved by what he saw. The excavations are in progress and have to be completed
within five or six years, so that when the valley is flooded by the waters of
the Krishna, the monuments may be preserved at a spot in the neighbourhood. Sri
Nehru specially instructed the officers in charge of the excavations to employ
a bigger staff and speed up the work. This was soon followed by the
constitution by the Government of India of a Board, with the Governor of Andhra
as Chairman, to supervise the work and to make the necessary arrangements for
the preservation of the monuments. Since the construction of the Dam is
inevitable, the only course is to safeguard the monuments and erect a Central
Museum to house them as well as other relics of the ancient art of Andhra.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

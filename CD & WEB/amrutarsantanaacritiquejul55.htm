is significant that, right from the fourteenth century onwards, Adibasis have
figured in Oriya literature either as material or as writers. Orissa is proud
of her famous Adibasi poet Bhima Bhoi, whose monotheistic Bhajans are on the
lips of millions throughout the State and outside. The first novel on Adibasi
life ‘Bhima Bhuyan’ was attempted by Sri Gopal Ballabh Das, </span><span

full-length novels with a purpose to bring home to the Oriya readers the
problems of these neglected citizens of the State. He is the author of nearly
more than half-a-dozen novels and a few volumes of short stories, but he has
achieved outstanding literary fame for his immensely popular novels depicting
the lives of these hill tribes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of his three novels ‘Dadi Budha’, ‘Paraja’ and ‘Amrutar Santana’ depicting the
lives of these hill tribes, in the first two he has principally drawn his
characters from the ‘Paraja’ community and from the Kond community in the
other. The background of all these three novels is the hills of Koraput
district, where the scheduled tribes predominate and have still retained to a
large extent their primitive ways, but not without signs of change in their
social and economic set-up. All the three novels, besides being the true
reflections of the Adibasi life, open new windows </span><span

Mahanty, while spending a few years in Koraput as a Sub-Deputy Collector,
picked up their language and made a deep study of their myths, social customs
and oral literature, and observed their day-to-day life at close quarters. Thus
he has been able to create the proper atmosphere in his novels, which makes a

novel has Miniyapayu, a village in the deep forests of Koraput District, cut
off from the outside world for the most part of the year, as its locale. Sarabu
is the ‘saonta’ (chieftain) of the village. The novel mostly deals with the
different aspects of the life of the people of this village. Sarabu breathes
his last on a most auspicious day, i.e., on the day of Chaita Parba, the most
important festival of Konds. He leaves behind him a son, a daughter, a
daughter-in-law, and his brother Lenjhu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

interest in his wife Puyu after she gave birth to a son, though he had married
her deeply believing in the Kond tradition of marriage based on love and
courtship. True to the culture of his community he is a lover of freedom,
brave, fatalist, conservative, and a believer in sorcery, witchcraft and magic.
His frustration in married life persuades him to question within himself the
hollowness of the quaint customs, weird rituals and nonsensical superstitions.
A deep urge to enjoy life and youth drives him to the door of Bhursa Munda, a
Dom, who is the village watchman, to pick up acquaintance and friendship with
Sonadei, the daughter-in-law of Bhursa. But deeprooted Kond beliefs and
traditions keep him back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

daughter of Sarabu and Diudu’s sister, was the betrothed of Harguna, saonta of
Bandikara. But a Kond girl is not bound to accept the decision of her elders on
the question of selection of her life-partner. Before Pubuli gets an
opportunity of renewing her acquaintance with Harguna, she meets Bisu of
Mitting. In course of a dance, which is a part and parcel of Kond life. Bisu
attracts her and proposes to marry her. Pubuli finds it difficult to turn down
the proposal. But Bisu finds it a hard job to pay the customary ‘jhola’
(bride-money) and feels it <i>infra dig </i>to serve as ‘goti’ (indentured
labourer) in case of failure to pay it. Therefore he proposes to elope. Pubuli
has no other alternative to offer and therefore keeps silent. Bisu leaves
Miniyapayu to seek a propitious moment to arrange for elopement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

saonta of Bandikara, another Kond village, is an orphan. He represents the
social force which wants a radical change, and stands for progress. He is
level-headed and a great admirer of the achievements of the new civilisation he
saw in Naranpatna, a trade centre of Koraput. He loves a settled life, new and
better techniques of production and cultivation. He dreams of a durable house
constructed in the style of ‘civilised plains’, of a godown to store
agricultural commodities, of the open pan method of preparing gur and of a
bullock-cart to carry on trade. Like his fellow-tribesmen he hates Sahukars
(money-lenders), the shrewd ‘telenga’ businessmen, but unlike others, his
dislike materialises in his efforts to emulate those he hates. Therefore he
does not accept ‘dadan’ or advance, does not agree to an advance fixation of
price at which he is to sell his crops after the harvesting season is over. He
exhorts the villagers of Miniyapayu to unitedly resist the exploitation of
Jagannath Sundhi, the money-lender: Thus in Harguna we find the new force,
which wants to take the best of ‘plains civilisation’ and gives up the worst of
Kond ways of life. In his endeavours to better his condition he has no time for
love-making or to run after young girls or to drown himself in liquor. Yet he
has a soft corner for Pubuli but he does not care to seek an opportunity to
finalise his marriage with her. When at last he expressess his love to Pubuli
he finds her, to his surprise, very cold. There the matter ends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the main stream of the story the most important of the minor characters is
Lenjhu, the uncle of the hero, who remains a widower all his life, because of
an age-old superstition of Kond tribe that if a man’s wife is devoured by a
tiger he can marry only a widow whose husband has been killed in the same
manner. He cannot marry any other Woman. Lenjhu is the symbol of frustration
due to superstition and circumstances beyond his control. The second factor
responsible for his feeling of frustration is the fact that on the death of his
elder brother his young nephew becomes the headman instead of him. Later on the
uncle and nephew fall out over the pretty wife of Bala Munda, son of Bhursa
Munda, Dom watchman of the village. The nephew in the right of his headmanship
drives the poor widower out of his village, on which Lenjhu accepts the
ryotship under progressive Harguna. But, to satisfy his aspiration for freedom
and leadership, Lenjhu later on leaves Bandikara also and starts a village of
his own up on the hills with his solitary cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we find ‘Amrutar Santana’ is the story of one Kond family. Diudu represents the
frustrated youth. His questionings of the hollowness in Kond philosophy and way
of life are half-hearted. Harguna is the symbol of the rising social forces.
Pubuli, Diudu’s sister, is the symbol of genuine Kond tradition. She indicates
that woman has a special position and privilege in Kond society; she has her
own say in matters of marriage; she asserts it and also believes she can demand
a divorce or separation by simply saying ‘I do not want’. Lenjhu is a prey of
superstitious beliefs. Pioty is the sophisticated inadjustible product of a
mixture of the hills and the plains. Bhursa, Bala Munda and Turunja are Doms,
who follow their traditional criminal way of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

critics are of opinion that this novel suffers from the Dickensian fault of
overlaid details of Kond customs, religious festivals, social structure, food,
technique of cultivation, philosophy and way of life. But it should be
remembered however that the average reader is not well-acquainted with the way
of life of the hill tribes. So the author thought it necessary to add these
details to give proper perspective to the characters. There is no doubt these
details supply most of the charm in the book and have made it interesting
reading with the exotic light and shade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

several places in the novel the author has given the exact words of the
tribesmen used in their different ceremonies like those of death, birth,
marriage, dances etc., in which hymns, prayers, curses, incantations and song
offerings are usually made. All these prove the study and close observation by
the author of the tribal lore. The characters and the background are both alive
as though the reader lived among them and which together have been presented to
the reader with the noble motive of the author to indicate that both the public
and the Government may take a little more interest in these innocent creatures
of nature, who are living in abject poverty as creatures of circumstances and
superstition and being exploited by money-lenders, liquor dealers and corrupt
government officials. While he wants<i> </i>that<i> </i>these primitive people
be protected from the corrupting contact of the plains, he also wants on the
other hand that these people should be raised from the low levels of primitive
existence and superstition by a reasonable system of education and social and
economic reorganisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

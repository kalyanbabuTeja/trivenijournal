<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The author devotes one very interesting chapter to
the dim beginnings and gradual growth of her interest in India which culminated
in the visit in 1949, in spite of the many difficulties which arose in her way
and delayed the consummation for a long time. Thrice she was invited by the
All-India Women’s Conference to attend their annual session as overseas
delegate, but her pronounced views in favour of Indian Independence rendered it
inevitable that the British Government should refuse their permission, for fear
of possible embarrassment in view of the already strained relations and bitter
misunderstandings between the British and Indian nations during the years of
the second World War.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was thus denied the opportunity of visiting India and meeting in person Tagore
as well as Gandhi. It was only after the termination of the War and the grant
of Independence to India, and after the death of Tagore and the assassination
of Gandhi, that she could realise her cherished objective. Finally she visited
India as one of the overseas invitees to a conference of pacifists and
war-resisters to study the work of Mahatma Gandhi. The conference owed its
inception to the suggestion in 1947 of some English Quakers, especially Horace
Alexander and Agatha Harrison, that a group of individuals representing many
countries, who were interested in his ideals and technique of peace-making,
should meet him and a group of select followers of his policies and programmes,
and discuss post-war problems and the creation of peace through spiritual
power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Mahatma welcomed the Idea and actively sponsored it, but the conference had to
be postponed from time to time on account of the tremendous problems that arose
in India itself, as a consequence of the Partition and the outbreaks of
inter-communal violence till the death of Gandhiji under tragic circumstances.
But the valiant followers and friends of the prophet and martyr of non-violence
proceeded un-daunted with their original plans and convened the conference in
1949 under the presidentship of the first President of the Free Indian
Republic, Dr. Rajendra Prasad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

book gives a detailed account of the conference held in two sessions, the first
at Santiniketan and the second at Sevagram, after an interval during which the
visiting delegates travelled in groups to the different parts of the country,
especially to acquaint themselves with the conditions and the efforts at social
reconstruction on Gandhian ideals carried on by his sincere followers in
different parts. Vera Brittain herself travelled into the remote corners of the
land even after the second session and returned home only after a visit to
Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is thus not merely a travel book, a traveller’s
story, that is presented to us in this volume but a genuine essay in
international understanding. The account of the conferences and her travels,
interwoven with admirable skill with her study and appraisal of the character
and achievement of three great Indian personalities,–Tagore the
poet-philosopher who not merely heralded the new era but in her opinion,
actually contributed substantially to its advent, Gandhi the prophet-saint, and
Nehru the heir to them both and the actual leader of the nation after the
attainment of Independence, upon whose shoulders has fallen the arduous task of
realising in practice the ideals and technique preached by the Father of the
Nation in the conduct of the affairs of a great nation during very critical
times in its history, in the face of the tremendous problems created by the
Partition of the country.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Notwithstanding
all her sympathy and genuine desire to understand, she is rather critical of
the attitude of the Indian people and their leaders with regard to the
outstanding differences with Pakistan. But she succeeds in keeping her poise
and provides an impartial objective appraisal of the performance of India which
enables her to retain hope for the success of the old nation in its new career,
in remaining true to her ideals in the solution of her new problems, and thus
setting an example to the rest of the world in the peaceful settlement of
international disputes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said Swami Vivekananda, “is not the spelling of that word but the practice of
it.” India is a land of religions in this sense of the term. Bharat was and
still is the birthplace of not merely thinkers but also of Siddhas who are the
seers of Truth. These Siddhas their researches in Spiritual Science realised
the Supreme Self, and bequeathed to posterity the fruits of their researches,
explaining in full both the nature of their experiences and the means adopted
by them for realising the same. All these are ensconced in what are known as
Sastras. ‘Mantrayoga’ is one of the means prescribed for self-realisation in
the Sastras, especially in Saiva and Sakta Tantras.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mantra Sastra has now become an almost forgotten science. Sakta Tantras are
misunderstood, and have become an object of abuse and contempt. In these
circumstances Sir John Woodroffe has laid Indians under deep obligation by
publishing his studies in Tantric works and explaining therein the rationale of
Sakta philosophy and Mantra Sadhana in the authentic and traditional way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

book under review is a collection of thirty-one essays dealing with the origin,
significance, efficacy, and rationale of Mantra and Mantra Sadhana. The first
ten essays deal with the theory of cosmic evolution according to the Sakta
Tantras, or in the words of the author “with the Principles of the general
Doctrine of Sabda”. The latter portion of the book explains at length some
important technical terms like Sakti, Nada, Bindu, Kamakata, etc., in a lucid
and scientific way. And to these are added at the end three more important
essays with the titles of (1) Mantra Sadhana (2) Gayatri Mantra, and (3)
Gayatri Mantra as an exercise of reasoning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The following observations of the author are worth
noting. “The Mantra of a Devata is that letter or combination of letters which
reveals the Devata to the Consciousness of the Sadhaka who has evoked it by
Sadhanasakti. The form of a particular Devata therefore appears out of the
particular Mantra of which that Devata is the Adhishtatri Devata. This Mantra
is intoned in the proper way according to letter and rhythm (Varna and Svara).
For these reasons a Mantra when translated ceases to be a Mantra. This shows
Mantra is not individual thinking but a particular sound body of
consciousness.” (P. 259)</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
superiority of Mantrasadhana to other Sadhanas is explained as follows by the
author: “In the case of Puja, Dhyana and other Sadhanas, it is only the
Sadhaka’s Sadhana Sakti which operates, whilst in the case of Mantra Sadhana,
Sadhana Sakti works in conjunction with Mantrasakti which is all powerful...”
In short Mantra Yoga is a Sadhana part of Advaitic Philosophy, and is worth
trying by every spiritual aspirant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

author while expounding this intricate subject spares no pains to make the
subject most intelligible to his reader, if he knows at least something of
modern science and Mantra Sastra. Wherever necessary he compares the systems of
Sri Sankara, Kapila and others, and explains clearly their subtle difference.
For every statement he makes, he has an authority to quote and he never goes
out of the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

creates in the reader a real interest in the subject. It dispels the doubts of
the vacillating mind, strengthens the belief of the initiated in his Sadhana,
and removes all misconceptions and misunderstanding standings that have crept
into the questioning minds of non-believers all these days.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is true Vemana was a philosopher, and that his
philosophy was concerned with the realisation of spiritual values in the daily
life of the individual. He was a merciless critic of empty ritual, narrow
sectarianism, gross worldliness and hypocrisy wherever he noticed it. It may,
therefore, be not incorrect to designate his philosophy a philosophy of culture
or humanism. But to suggest that it constitutes an attempt to evolve a
synthesised Hindu-Muslim culture like that of Kabir or Nanak is a willful
exaggeration and can be the result only of wishful thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Moreover, the verses of Vemana are dear to the
Telugus, sophisticated and unsophisticated alike, not only on account of the
philosophical truths that they convey, but also, and much more, for the shrewd,
penetrating social criticism with which they are replete, and most of all their
essential poetic quality as distinguished from the technicalities of grammar
and prosody, and the utter sincerity and genuine love underlying his biting
sarcasm evident in every verse.</p>

is of course unreasonable and ungrateful to the learned Dr. Topa–who confesses
in the Preface his ignorance of the Telugu language and his utter dependence on
the English translation by Mr. Brown–to expect in his treatise adequate
appreciation of all the various aspects of Vemana’s work. But at the same time,
it must be conceded that it is less than fair to Vemana and to Telugu
Literature to concentrate on his philosophy, to the exclusion of every other
aspect in an attempt to introduce his work to the wider English-reading public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Introduction by Prof. R. Subba Rao, which deals
briefly with the life and poetry of Vemana, tends to redeem the inherent
lopsidedness of the treatise. Nevertheless the Telugus will continue to feel
the need for a separate and adequate presentation of Vemana, the poet and
satirist. It is to be hoped that the Hyderabad Telugu Academy will sponsor such
another publication in the near future.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This short poem of 65 verses is a laudable attempt
on the part of the author, and, as the well-known Sanskrit scholar and poet Sri
Kasi Krishnacharya points out in his Preface, a convincing proof of the
vitality of our classical language. For, even in these days of its admitted
decay and neglect, it is employed by members of fair sex noted for their
natural delicacy and refinement of imagination and expression as the medium of
their original literary compositions. The talented lady is to be congratulated
for winning the compliments of such a fastidious scholar as Sri Krishnacharya
for the sweetness of her diction and the melody of her versification.</p>

perhaps the chief merit of the composition lies in the quality of imagination
exhibited in the handling of the theme. According to the Ramayana, as the
victorious hero was returning home with his consort on the Pushpaka, he
indicates to her the spot on which he had built a temple to Lord Mahadeva
before crossing to Lanka. From this a beautiful story is developed, of the
building of the temple by Sri Rama to propitiate the Lord, the invitation he
extends to Ravana as the fittest person to install the idol in the temple by
virtue of his well-known devotion to Siva, and the acceptance of the invitation
by Ravana. The intriguing situations are utilised with admirable skill, and the
opportunities for fine characterisation they provide are fully exploited by the
poet, who depicts the magnanimity of the noble rivals who are able to sink all
petty considerations of self-interest and prestige and mutual animosity, in
their common devotion to the Lord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

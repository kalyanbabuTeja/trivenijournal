<h1>It was end of April and was getting hot and dry in the lower hills. This
time shepherds move up to higher regions of the himalayas with their flocks of
sheep, buffalows, cows, mules and ponies. There where they find flat green
meadows they pitch their small tents or make huts with leaves and grass for
their stay through monsoon. Away from the world they live their simple life in
the midst of wild nature with easy acceptance of weather and climate as they
come and change. The sheep give wool and cows and buffalows give milk from
which they make ghee. These they take down to nearby village shops to sell and
from there they purchase their needs and provisions as they require. Sometimes
for extra needs they sell sheep too. </h1>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Buddhi
and his wife Lachmi with other shepherds of a village Gangol, three miles from
Gopeshwar, were moving up the way to Rudranath to a grassy meadow about six
miles up, where they had camped in the previous year. It was about evening when
they came up to the Spot. Surrounded by forested hills it was a beautiful place
of open grassy land with a thin flowing stream cutting across it. Here the
shepherds stopped, halted and unloaded their animals and set about pitching
tents and making huts. Buddhi and Lachmi </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>were behind the rest.
Buddhi had on his arms a few months old lamb of a sheep which was named Shyama
by Lachmi. Lachmi </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>had on her back her little a-few-months-old
child. They came and putting the lamb down, Buddhi collected their belongings
and started putting up their small tent. He helped his father and mother, who
had also come, to put up their tent close to theirs. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a couple of hours the shepherds were settled in their establishments. Then they
lighted fire and started, cooking their meals. </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The animals
were loose and grazed about freely. For sometime there was stir, movement,
noise and calls on the quiet hill-side; thereafter there was serene quietness
again. Inside and outside their tents and huts they had stretched themselves
and fallen asleep under the faint shine of a thin moon.</span><span

they lived away from the world and vet within it. The world goes with man

day a man from Gangol came up to purchase a sheep. His daughter was to be
married and he wanted to sacrifice a lamb at the altar of the village deity to
have the deity’s blessings on his daughter. He went, about talking to the
shepherds and came to Buddhi also. He liked Shyama’s lamb and offered to
purchase, but Buddhi hesitated. Lachmi came out with her child and heard. She
loved Shyama and her lamb, but the offer was tempting. With the money the pink
frock for her child could be purchased. The purchaser was in hurry to return.
His daughter’s wedding was on the next day. He took out fifteen rupees and put
that in Buddhi’s hand. Then he lifted the lamb which looked back to her mother,
“Ma Ma,” but her mother stood helpless and stared hard. “Ma Ma.” “Ma Ma” from
her and from the lamb went deep </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>into Buddhi’s ears. He
sat down on a stone and the money dropped from his hand on the ground. Lachmi
returned to the tent. The lamb’s “Ma Ma” and Shyama’s “Ma Ma” and Shyama’s hard
look at </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The next day Buddhi went down to Gopeshwar and
brought the pink frock. Lachmi stood up to take it from his hand. It fitted her
child beautifully. She kissed her again and again and held her up to Buddhi.
Buddhi gave her a kiss; but not with the same ardent emotion. He went to the
place where the sheep were grazing. He saw Shyama, gave her a tender pat on her
back and moved away. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That night Lachmi did not take off the frock from
her child when she put her to bed. In the frock she looked so beautiful, so
bright. Putting an arm round her, Lachmi fell asleep. The night was dark and
cold. All was quiet. All were asleep. Lachmi had a dream, a terrible dream. She
saw the purchaser of Shyama’s lamb coming with Shyama by his side. He came
along near her. Shyama said to him. “Lachmi sold my child to you. I shall sell
her child to you.” The man came up and lifted Lachmi’s child as he had lifted
Shyama’s little one. Lachmi shrieked “No, no Shyama, give back my child.
Shyama, Shyama.” She fell at Shyama’s feet, but the man carried away her child
and Shyama went with him. Lachmi cried out and stood up and ran out of the
tent. Buddhi woke, stretched his arm to feel but Lachmi was not in bed. He
shook up, lighted a pine stick torch and going out of the tent followed the cry
of Lachmi’s “Shyama. Shyama, give back my child.” He ran after her and called
“Lachmi. Lachmi”, but, Lachmi heard not. She ran down the hill till over a
stone she stumbled and fell and was unconscious. The shepherds heard the cry
and came and did all that they could do, but Lachmi remained in her dream. She
saw them not, heard them not; before her wide open eyes was only that man from
Gangol carrying away her child and Shyama going with him. Now and then she
shivered in fear and cried–“Shyama, Shyama, give back my child.” Buddhi held
her child to her, but she did not see, did not take her. She was in dream.
“Shyama, Shyama, give back my child” was all that she would say, and then stand
up and run and cry again “Shyama, Shyama.” They brought Shyama before her and
said “<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>Here is Shyama.” But she did not
look at her and cried as before. She ate, slept and moved about, but her dream
never broke. Her </span>child, her husband and none she looked at. None could
break her dream, none could call her mind to the environment, none could divert
her from crying out “Shyama, Shyama, give back my child,” and stretching out
her arms to take her child. </p>

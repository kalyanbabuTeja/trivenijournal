social organisation and the principles underlying it are as sorely
misunderstood by unreflecting Hindus as by foreigners: the former have now
little in common with the ideals which impelled their ancient forbears, and the
latter cannot see how a way of life other than their own could be rational or
worth living. The idea of social service as a technique of social relations is
of recent origin in the West. It is a device for rubbing out the sharp
angularities of class distinctions, or for facilitating political infiltration
among peoples a great way off. But large numbers of Hindus accept it as among
the revelations of a golden age, the light of which they see journeying from the
West to the East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ancient
Hindu society was divided into grades by graded disciplines. A four-fold
division of society, the aggregate of house-holders,–three groups, each with
certain disciplines cast in a ritual mould (symbolising the embedded idea), and
one group, with virtually the same discipline but free from the ritual setting,
reflected a four-fold gradation of severity in the discipline. The severest
discipline lay on the Brahmana house-holder. He was assigned no means of
livelihood except what was given to him voluntarily by those who went to him to
learn the way of the higher life; he was enjoined not to lay by ever food grain
for longer than the needs of three days and to keep on making offerings in the
domestic fire, thrice a day, of substances which exhausted virtually all that
he could have had by way of income. The discipline of a lesser degree of
severity lay on the Kshatriya, in the gradations of his groups, high or low; he
had to take upon himself the burden of protecting society from anti-social
elements, both internal and external, and of relieving social distress,
receiving a small fee therefor. The higher Kshatriya, baron or chieftain, had
now and again to deplete such wealth as was accumulating with him in periodical
offerings in fire, the chief offering being the Soma which was so scarce and
difficult to procure that it could not be obtained except at preposterously
high price. The highest Kshatriya, king or emperor, had to perform the great
Asvamedha sacrifice–a sacrifice in fire–once every four years, which drained
him of what he could have put by in the intervening years; or he had to
conclude the Rajasuya sacrifice (another sacrifice in<i> </i>fire) with
divesting himself of every vestige of property. Less severe was the impact of
the discipline on the Vaisya, who, with his wealth of land, of cattle and of
trade, had, for daily duty, the obligations of unstinted charity, and, for
periodical duties, the obligation of performing sacrifices in fire which kept
depleting him of accumulations of wealth. These three–the
‘twice-born’–disciplined thus in desirelessness, to the accompaniment of
symbolic rituals, were enabled to enter on and persist in the discipline
through the exertions of the ‘once-born’–Sudras, who laboured for the
production of ‘consumers’ goods’ and in the rendering of personal services,–a
course of life which meant that the ‘once-born’ had to sacrifice themselves so
that the ‘twice-born’ may immediately take over the fruits of their labours and
offer those fruits in sacrifice, virtually in fire and in charity to the
destitute. The vendor of Soma was subjected to great contumely for preferring
to make a fortune by the sale of the Soma to offering it in sacrifice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

most striking feature of the sacrifice of<i> </i>the ‘twice-born’ is that it
was in fire. The objects were offered in fire so that they were completely
consumed. The offering in fire is the most efficient mode of making the
offering an irrevocable one: what is offered in <i>puja </i>might come back in
part at least to the offerer. What is offered in fire does not survive: the
flames render the offering irretrievable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

culture has demanded, thus, of everyone in every station of life, master or
serf, that he shall keep himself free from attachments and from desire, leading
a life in which he shall have as little of property and possessions as is
possible in a world of temptations to wants and desires. Every one had to keep
on divesting himself of everything in the nature of property as soon as it
threatened to accumulate in his hands. The divestiture would not be final if
the things offered could come back to the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sacrificer on the
conclusion of the ritual as they would, at least in part, on the performance of
<i>puja. </i>Nor would it be to the sacrificer’s purpose if he offered the
things up to a brother man: he could not saddle that other with property, the
mainspring of desire, when he was divesting himself of ethical encumbrances for
ethical deliverance. Only an offering in fire which wholly consumes what is
thrown into it and leaves nothing behind for being salvaged is a true offering.
The sacrifice in fire was, thus, inevitable as a ritual to whoso was prepared,
day after day, to live a life of renunciation, readily destroying his
possessions so that they could not be temptations either to himself or to his
neighbours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cult of renunciation, formulated in the earliest days of Vedic culture when
possessions were not spectacularly great, became the basis of complex
sacrifices when material culture advanced and wealth increased. While only one
or two goats formed the offering in the early days, great numbers of cattle of
every description came to be offered in fire, in holocausts, with the increase
in material possessions. Apparently, the temptations of economic prosperity
loosened the grip of the cult of renunciation, and, gradually, disposed the
common man to feel exasperated at what appeared to him the wanton destruction
of the valuable products of a Nature which, in India, was not only kind but
also bountiful. Apparently, too, the paradox of taking life in the spirit of
Ahimsa, to which we shall refer presently, was not being understood. Reactions
such as these must have been responsible for emphasis being shifted to another
technique of renunciation. Sri Krishna, claiming to be the very Vedas, declared
that there is little need for the sacrificial ritual and the slaying of animals
if man lives a life in which he has no desire for the fruits of his acts. This
is renunciation–sacrifice–in the spirit of Ahimsa and there is no taking of
life and no destruction of property which suffered to exist, is not permitted
to rouse desire with its blandishments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Buddha is to be treated as a protagonist of Ahimsa it will be only in virtue
of his opposition to the taking of life in sacrifices, and notwithstanding that
he allowed his followers, and himself, the pleasures of the taste of flesh. If
the founder of Jainism is to be included among the advocates of Ahimsa, it will
be only in virtue of his caveat having extended to the extinguishment of life
for any purpose, and notwithstanding that he approved of the surrender of human
life by modes of suicide which involved protracted pain and suffering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is in the spirit of renunciation of desires that, in later times, the great
Harsha of Kanouj kept giving away, periodically, all that he had come by in the
intervening periods, making gifts of them all to the deserving, at great
convocations called Mokshas, or Maha-Moksha-Parishats. His was the spirit of
the performer of the Rajasuya of old, though Buddhism it is that gets the
credit for it in the pages of Yuan-Chwang and in the screeds of modern scholars
in their ignorance of tradition. Sharp is the contrast between the spirit in
which while Sri Krishna, deprecating desire, called on man to lead an active
life, and that other in which the Buddha, condemning desire, called for a
retreat from active life; but the difference means little to us to whom welfare
spells compelling desires and mounting wants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the principle of Vedic sacrifices is the renunciation of every desire and the
offering up of everything that could be desired,–large or small, paltry or
precious, perishing or permanent. The abandonment of even the impulse to live
was a logical sequence: love of one’s own life is the worst of desires. To the
logical necessity so reached, and to the emotional urge in the same direction
by which it must have been accompanied, has to be attributed the vogue of
Sanyasa,–the formal adoption of a life of renunciation. For a stabilisation in
its onerous code, there was not only an abandonment of wife, children and
property, and all the desires and attachments from which they spring and to
which they give rise, but even a surrender of the will to live, symbolised,
even on entering into Sanyasa, by an anticipatory enactment of the ritual
following on physical death. The Sanyasi continues to live, not because of a
desire to live, but because the clock has not yet ticked off all the seconds of
his life time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
logic of the theory could not be escaped by even the gods who, according to Rg-
Vedic thought, are creatures of desires. The gods too have to submit themselves
to the rule of renunciation. They too have to sacrifice, they generate
sacrifice, they sit contemplating the place of sacrifice. They augment the
sacrifice. They have, indeed, to sacrifice with sacrifice. The gods make one or
other of themselves the offering and immolate themselves in fire (following the
principle of the code of Sanyasa adopted by man for himself). If Purusha,
because of the absoluteness of his power, is not to turn into a baleful being,
but is to function beneficially, he has to extinguish in himself the very
desire to continue and to function: he has to get himself dismembered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Animals
could not, therefore, be exempt from the operation of the logic of the theory
of the burnt offering. Animals may not be spared from destruction, if it is
needed for renunciation of property and for nullification of desire,–so long as
they could be desired and owned. The offering of animals in the sacrificial
fire is, therefore, an inevitable corollary to the Vedic sacrificer’s ethical
code of offering up irretrievably his possessions of every kind. He took it
that the sacrificing of the animals–the inflicting of pain on them in the
process of sacrificing–is of considerably less gravity than the retention of
property. That sometimes the offerings were of large numbers of animals was
due, not to the sacrificer being heartless, but to his cattle-wealth being
large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
taking of animal life was much against the inclinations of the Rg-Vedic
sacrificer. The strangling of the animal–there was no slitting of the
throat–and the quartering of it were not for the taste of the flesh, only a
tiny part of the victim being tasted as symbolical of communion with the deity
to whom the offering was made. Neither the patron of the sacrifice nor the
priest, coming near the victim when it had been cut and carved, crammed himself
with the flesh nor smacked lips with relish of the juiciness of the morsels.
The Rg-Vedic animal sacrifice, far from being a product of blood-lust, was a
ritual regrettably necessitated by the imperative ethical urge to the denuding
oneself irrevocably of all possessions, irrespective of their being animate or
inanimate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and priest were oppressed by the heinousness of taking life. Believing that the
tree suffers pain from the axe that cuts it down, they were sensitive to the
taking of the ‘life’ of plants. In the ritual of the felling of a tree, for
fashioning a sacrificial post from, a blade of grass, placed just where the axe
was to fall, was bidden to protect the tree from the pain of the cutting; the
axe was commanded not to cause harm to the tree. This could be no hypocritical play-acting
over the dismembering of the tree, for the tree and its brethren are no
accusers whose reproaches </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

little uneasy was the sacrificer in mind over the apparent perversity of
circumstances which compelled him, for the high purpose of attaining ethical
eminence, to descend to the taking of life: that he looks for salves for the
wounds of a conscience badly bruised by the rub of duty against duty speaks to
the genuineness of his tenderness of spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the idea that man’s duty to make his sacrifice, all-inclusive does extend to
the offering himself up in sacrifice was the notion that even beasts feel that
they are under an obligation to give themselves up in an all-inclusive
sacrifice and that, lacking the means of compassing that self-immolation, they
are not loth to accept the opportunity given to them to be offered up in fire

has, thus, to be accepted as an important factor in the Indian culture of even
so early an age as that of the <i>Rg-Veda</i>. The history of the doctrine, and
of the attempt of the Rg-Vedic people and the inheritors of their culture to
live by that doctrine, may not be traced here for lack of space. It has a
history in which place will be found for Atharvan, the Yadus, Kapila, Ghora
Angirasa and Sri Krishna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

though each desire breeds further desires, each of which, in turn, breeds yet
more desires. Few also are the desires of one man that could be satisfied
without cutting into the range of another man’s desires. Such being the case,
when even the legitimacy of the desires cannot be put into issue, the gravity
of the disasters to society following on a sufferance of illegitimate desires
need hardly be expatiated on. To neutralise the conflict of the desires of
individuals has been the aim of religions. Buddhism, for instance, called for a
withdrawal from the world. Christianity prescribed brotherhood and love. Islam
emphasised charity. Society has made no progress: it stands rooted in its
passions, evils and crimes. Does the real panacea lie in a reversion to the
ideals and to the technique favoured in the <i>Rg-Veda </i>and adapted by Sri
Krishna?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

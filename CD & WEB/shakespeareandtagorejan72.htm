was essentially a poet–a lyricist who was intoxicated with the music and melody
of words. The truth and meaning behind life and existence could be comprehended
according to him in the melody and rhythm of day to day activity; even action
could be better understood through the form of melody. Thus, in his dramas he
has concentrated more on the musical appeal than on mere action. It is not that
he ignores the plot or the story, but according to him it is the feeling behind
drama that is of utmost importance. He clarifies his attitude to drama in his
explanation of his first musical drama which was actually written in the form
of an experiment–the <span class=SpellE><i>Valmiki</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Pratibha</span> </i>(the genius of <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>)
which later on became the model of all his musical dramas. The significance of
the play is lost if it is not heard, sung and seen acted. In another early play
<span class=SpellE><i>Mayar</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Khela</span> </i>(The
Play of Maya) he stresses upon the musical appeal and the power it has to
convey the real significance which is beyond the reach of mere words. He
describes this play as “a garland of songs with just a thread of dramatic plot
running through. The play of feeling and not action was its special feature.” <sup>1</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
preoccupation with melody and rhythm is very noticeable in all his symbolical,
philosophical and allegorical plays. In his social dramas, however, as his concentration
is more on the story and plot and not just the feeling, music does not play
such an important role. Such dramas where Tagore takes on the garb of a social
critic are of course few in number and none of them have been translated. <span
class=SpellE>Niharranjan</span> Roy in his <i>An Artist in Life </i>has put
three of these social comedies in a group as fruits of his maturity, and these
are <span class=SpellE><i>Goday</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Galad</span> </i>(wrong
at the start), <span class=SpellE><i>Vaikunther</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Khata</span> </i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(</span><span
class=SpellE>Vaikuntha’s</span> Manuscripts) and <span class=SpellE><i>Chirakumar</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> </i>(The Bachelors’ Club), which is a satire on
men who imagine that they can ignore Women and go through life as confirmed
bachelors. Besides being a humorous comedy ridiculing the eccentricities of
certain types of individuals, it is also a satire on the customs aha traditions
of aristocratic life. It was the age of the cultural Renaissance and since the
movement involved a synthesis of the values of the East and West there were
many Indian attitudes and customs which would have to be modified. At the same
time he takes the opportunity to attack the general attitude of society towards
women; marriage and the caste system. Apart from this Tagore’s chief idea seems
to have been a criticism of the unnatural attitude of suppressing normal human
desires and the cultivation of artificial barriers which are bound to break down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

both the dramas is more <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or<i> </i></span>less

thus nothing is lost in the unusual ending. On the other hand a conventional

not be correct to call <i>Love’s <span class=SpellE>Labour’s</span> Lost </i>a

<span class=SpellE><i>Chirakumar</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> </i>(The
Bachelors’ Club) is a hilarious comedy; at the same time it is a satire on the
conventions and customs of aristocratic life. The plot is built around a group
of men who like the “<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Night</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>” are members of ‘the
bachelors’ club’, and have resolved to go through life without the company of
women and as confirmed bachelors. The action of the play consists of various situations
which force the members to give up their resolution and get married. Unlike
Shakespeare’s play where there is no story, plot and satisfactory ending, here
there is a story, plot and a complete end. There is no doubt that Tagore was <span
class=SpellE>criticising</span> the unnatural stand taken by the members of ‘the
bachelors’ club’, but his main motive was to criticize the customs and
conventions connected with marriage in orthodox Hindu families, where it was
made unduly complicated by taking into consideration the caste, creed and
family. Tagore could not tolerate many of these meaningless orthodox customs.
Besides he also believed in independence and freedom for women. One must not
forget that Tagore was actively associated with the social emancipation of
women. This attitude is very analytically studied in the book <i>Heroines of
Tagore </i>by <span class=SpellE>Biman</span> <span class=SpellE>Behari</span> <span
class=SpellE>Majumdar</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it<i> </i></span>is not entirely
impossible to notice some points of similarity. In general both plays are a
gentle satire against people who are hypocritical and think they can disregard
the dictates of nature. At the same time while <span class=SpellE>criticising</span>
the unnatural resolution of the king of Navarre Shakespeare was not unmindful
of the artificial manners and language of the courts. Tagore also while
ridiculing the attitude of the ‘bachelors’ club’, was out to criticize the
artificial manners and customs of aristocratic society in <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>.

Shakespeare’s <i>Love’s <span class=SpellE>Labour’s</span> Lost </i>there <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is<i> </i></span>no plot, but there is a
very complicated plot and story in Tagore’s drama. The story is about the four
daughters of an orthodox Hindu widow. The eldest is well-settled in life as she
is married to a very humorous and enterprising young man called <span
class=SpellE>Akshoy</span> Kumar, who had been actively associated with the bachelors’
club before his marriage. The second daughter <span class=SpellE>Sailabala</span>
is a child widow and is the most vivacious and lively of all the sisters. She
is educated and cultured and has a very fine wit and sense of <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>. The two younger sisters, <span class=SpellE>Nripabala</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Nirabala</span> are still unmarried and they have very
individualistic views regarding marriage and orthodox attitudes. The mother’s
sole worry is the marriage of these two young girls. With the help of a distant
cousin she fixes up two young men from a very high caste. One is thin, tall and
ugly, dressed <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in<i> </i></span>a <span
class=SpellE>dhothi</span> that is too short; the other is stout, fat and
hairy. The two pretty, young girls are positively terrified at the sight of
these two uncouth candidates. With the help of their brother-in-law <span
class=SpellE>Akshoy</span> Kumar they plan to get rid of them. He convinces the
old lady who is so orthodox that she would not even hear the name of chicken or
meat in her house that these two eat only such food and drink whisky. The old
lady drops the negotiations and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in<i> </i></span>sheer
disgust decides to go on a pilgrimage to <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Benares</span></st1:place>. The coast is now clear for <span
class=SpellE>Sailabala</span> to put her plan into execution. She has decided
to get two young members of the bachelors’ <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>club<i> </i></span>as bridegrooms for her sisters. The first step in
her plan was to throw these young men into the company of her sisters. This
could be done if she could change the venue of the bachelors’ club to her
house. <span class=SpellE>Sailabala</span> dresses herself as a young man and <span
class=SpellE>enrols</span> herself as a member of the bachelors’ club. It does
not take her long to persuade the president’s niece and the three other young members
of the club to change the location to her house. The members, who were already
tired of their vow of celibacy in no <span class=GramE>time</span> fall in love
with the two charming sisters. The Bachelors’ club is very unceremoniously
broken up and three young men are conveniently paired off with the three young
girls–the two sisters and the resident’s niece. <span class=SpellE>Sailabala</span>
comes out of her incognito and is very happy that her plans have proved a
success. In spite of all his emancipated views Tagore, however, does not
interfere with the life of <span class=SpellE>Sailabala</span>, the widowed
sister. She is the only one who is left alone, but she patiently accepts her
fate of a Hindu widow. Tagore has shown a considerable advance in his attitude to
a young Hindu widow by depicting <span class=SpellE>Sailabala</span> as an
educated and bold young woman. As Mr. <span class=SpellE>Mazumdar</span> in the
<i>Heroines of Tagore </i>has written “<span class=SpellE>Saila’s</span>
boldness of resolution elicits admiration but Tagore has failed to assign to
her any significant part in executing the plan. Consecutive social conventions
prevalent at the dawn of the present century seem to have deterred him from
depicting the young widow as too free or too witty in her talks with the young
men. The result has been that her disguise as a young man is almost futile.”<sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are, therefore, many points of resemblance between the two plays. Both are
topical plays and have definite references to incidents connected with their
respective centuries. The <span class=SpellE>humour</span> of <i>Love’s <span
class=SpellE>Labour’s</span> Lost </i>is based on the manners and customs of
the aristocratic society of the sixteenth century, and such is the case with
Tagore’s <span class=SpellE><i>Chirakumar</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span></i>;
there are so many allusions to nineteenth century aristocratic society in <st1:place
w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> that half the <span class=SpellE>humour</span> is
lost on a modern audience. Just as there is a lot of formal poetry in <i>Love’s
<span class=SpellE>Labour’s</span> Lost, </i>so also in Tagore’s play there are
a number of songs and poems which form an important part of the play. Both the
plays deal with the social life of the times; but, what is most remarkable is the
similarity in ideas between the ‘<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Night</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>’ and the ‘Bachelors’
Club’. The dissimilarities of the two plays are representative of the character
and personality the two great writers. Shakespeare gives his play a very meagre
plot and an unconventional ending which was his idea of a ‘celebratory
resolution.’ Shakespeare’s main intention was to prove that an unnatural
resolution could be easily broken. Thus, he did not feel the necessity of
ending the play in a conventional manner as the story element was not
important. Shakespeare had achieved his end when the four gallants broke their
vow. For Tagore on the other hand, the story was <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>most </span>important as his main intention was to show some of the
orthodox customs of his society and the evil effect they might have upon life.
The resolution of the ‘Bachelors’ Club’ was only an episode in the story and not
the main plot of his drama as in the case of <i>Love’s <span class=SpellE>Labour’s</span>
Lost</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>. Shakespeare’s play was an
early composition and there are many signs of immaturity. Tagore’s play was the
result of his mature views and highly critical attitude towards society. The
play is a satire on the hypocritical attitude of some people and an attack on </span>some
orthodox social customs of <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

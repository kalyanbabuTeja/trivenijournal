<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Brahma Sutra is a work
of interpretation of the Upanishad. Though it does not mention by name, yet all
the commentators of importance have agreed that the work cited Bhagavadgita as
an authority in support of its interpretation. So, the work is definite
subsequent to the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita, which itself was based on
the Upanishads. Competent critics see in Panini’s Sutra IV. ii. 129 read with
the Vartika thereon a positive indication that Aranyaka literature, the source
of the Upanishads in general was not in existence by then, i.e., C. 380 B. C.
The Bhagavad gita in its extent form seems to be definitely later than the
Samkhyan thought and the Patanjala Yoga Sutra the latter of which it seems to
have in mind at least at two places (VI. 200 b &amp; 35 cd) and as such must be
dated not earlier than about the beginning of the Christian era. Now the
Brahrna Sutra itself refutes in the main Samkhya which appears to have by then
acquired the status of a Smriti (II. i. 1) but was not known either to Panini
or even to Patanjali (C. 150 B. C.). It refutes the Buddhist schools including
Vijnanavada which is evidently development upon the Sautrantika which itself is
a correction of Vaibhashika. Vaibhashika is the school based on the authority!
Vibhasha the commentary composed on the authority of Vibhasha the Buddhist
canon at the council of Kanishka under the guidance of Vasumitra (C. 100 A.
D.). And, therefore, naturally none of the four schools is mentioned in
Vasumitra’s book on the eighteen sects for the simple reason that they did not
as yet come into existence by then. That, being so, the Brahma Sutra cannot be
dated prior to, at the least, III century A. D. and it can be quite later in
fact. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sankara, the earliest
available commentator on the work, refers to the author as Sutrakara in T. i. 2
Avatarika and on I. iii. 9 and as Acharya on IV. iii. 14 and in IV. iv. 22
Avatarika. Of course, at the last place the name Badarayana also appears along
with Acharya but I feel it to be an interpolation for reasons to be stated
below. Sankara nowhere refers to him as Vyasa or Vedavyasa while he calls the
author of the Bhagavadgita Vedavyasa (Introduction to Bg.), the author of
Anugita as Vyasa (on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I. 4. 10) and the author of <i>Nachiketapakhyana
</i>also Vyasa (on B. S. III. i. 14)–all from the Mahabharata, and cites Vyasa
as an authority in support of the views of Brahm Sutra thereby definitely
indicating that Vyasa not the author of Brahma Sutra. On this aspect Dr.
Radhakrishnan says, (I. P. II. Ch. VII, ii. f. n. at P. 433 of 1948 Repnnt)
“Wherever Sankara quotes Vyasa, he does so without implying that Vyasa is the
author of the Sutra (II. i. 12; III. 3. 47). There are many references to the Bg.
and the Santiparva of the M. B. in the B. S., if we accept the testimony of the
commentators, which cannot be easily understood if the author of the Sutra and
the writer of the M. B. were one.” The earliest writer to call the author of
the Brahma Sutra, Vedavyasa was Vachaspati Misra (see Intr. St. 5 of his
Bhamati); but he calls the Yoga-Sutra-Bhashyakara also Vedavyasa (see Intr. to
his Tatva Vaisaradi) which indicates his unhistoric perspective, if he meant
Parasarya or Satyavateya. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now as to the question
whether Badarayana was the author of Brahma Sutra the following facts may be
carefully noticed. The work itself quotes Badarayana at several places along
with other authorities and at one place in a very significant manner. III. iv.
I ff. constitutes one topic where the Su. I gives the view of Badarayana that
the Purushartha results from Jnana alone as the Scriptures say so and the Su. 2
gives the counter view of Jaimini that the statements to that effect found in
the Scriptures are only Arthavada and that Karma is not to be given up. Sus. 3
to 7 give the reasons for the counter view and Su. 8 is the verdict of the
Sutrakara in favour of the view of Badarayana. It runs <i>Adhikopadesat tu
Badarayanasya sevam tad datsanat</i>. It is a clear judgment and as such it
will be unreasonable to think that one of the opponents is the judge himself.
Sankara also indicates this distinction of the Sutrakara from Badarayana by the
wording he employs in explaining the concerned Sutras. He presents Su. 1 and 2
as Badarayana <i>Acharayo Manyate </i>and <i>Jaiminir Acharyo Manyate </i>and
says on Su. 8 <i>Evam prapte pratividhatte </i>(i.e., Sutrakara) <i>iti yau
matam Bhagavato Badarayanasya tat tatha eva tishtati na seshatva prabhritibhir</i>
<i>hetvabhasaih</i> <i>chalayitum sakyate</i>. See also Sankara’s wording in
explaining III. ii. 38, 40 and 41: <i>Tatra tavad pratipadyate </i>(i.e.,
Sutrakara, 38). <i>Jaiminis tu Acharyo Manyate</i>, 40, and <i>Badarayanas</i> <i>tu</i>:
<i>Acharyah</i> <i>Manyate</i>, 41. If this indication of Sankara is correct,
Badarayana (Acharyah) found in his Intr. To the last Su. IV. iv. 22, must be a
later interpolation by some copyist who must have been under the impression
probably that Badarayana was the author of the work on the basis of
popular-tradition current in his day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart from this internal
evidence of the work itself and the corroboration of the earliest available
commentator thereon, there is another significant piece of evidence in favour
of the view that Badarayana was not the author of the Brahma Sutra. The work in
I. iii. 34. ff. a section usually called <i>Apasudradhikarana</i>, strenuously
opposes the right of Sudras to get initiation into Brahmavidya on the basis of
a somewhat strained interpretation of the scriptural texts. In that section
nowhere the name of Badarayana was mentioned. Now turning to the Mimamsa Sutra
we find Badarayana was presented there in VI. i. 8. as advocating the position
that the competence for performing sacrifices lies in all human beings as a
genus while Atreya rejects it in the case of the Sudras, VI. i. 26 and this
militates against Badarayana being the author of Brahma Sutra whose definite
view goes counter to the specific stand of Badarayana, especially when this
view of the Brahma Sutra was not presented as of Badarayana. This seems to be
decisive in establishing that Badarayana was not the author of Brahma Sutra <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If the popular notion
has been that Vyasa was the author, which was the basis evidently of
Vachaspati’s assertion, we need not equate him with Parasarya or Satyavateya as
another Vyasa is definitely known to us who was the author of a Bhashya on
Patanjala Yoga Sutra and who could have easily been the author of Brahma Sutra
also. As a matter of fact Vachaspati calls him as well as the Sutrakara.
Vedavyasa thereby indicating their identity though this Vyasa could not be Parasarya
or Satyavateya and to that extent his view if he viewed so or the
misunderstanding of his readers if that be the case is unhistorical and
erroneous. This aspect of the identity of these two authors has, of course, got
to be further investigated into through a careful and comparative study of the
two works as a research problem and its truth or falsity established. As the
Bhashyakara Vyasa quoted Varshaganya, who is said to be the guru of
Vindhyavasin (Isvara krishna) and assigned to the 5th century A. D. by
Paramartha he must also be dated in the 5th century A. D. and if his identity
with the Sutrakara is to be accepted, Brahma Sutra must also be assigned to
that date which will agree well with the position of Sankhya and Buddhist
Vijnanavada by then and which is not in conflict with any positive evidence
except orthodox tradition which always tries to boost up the importance of a
work or an author by vain claims of exaggerated antiquity put forward without
any proof and with dogmatic assertion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

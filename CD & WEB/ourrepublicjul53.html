style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
attainment of Indian Independence was a gradual process, which was finalised by
the formal establishment of a Republic on the 26th January 1950. The
anniversary of that event<i> </i>is perhaps the most important red-letter day
in the nation’s secular calendar. In celebrating it,<sup>1</sup> we naturally
ask ourselves this epochal event was brought about, what is its significance,
how far are the ideals and hopes behind it being realised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In presenting to the Constituent Assembly “the first
budget of a free and independent India” in 1947, the then Finance Minister
remarked that “we have secured freedom from foreign yoke, mainly through the
operation of world events and partly through a unique act of enlightened self-abrogation
on behalf of the erstwhile rulers of the country.” This observation was
resented, particularly by the members of the Congress party, who felt that it
was through their sacrifices and sufferings and the martyrdom of some of their
comrades that Independence had been won. It is understood that a special
committee has been appointed to write an authentic history of the Indian
freedom movement. Whatever may be the conclusions of that committee, it is
clear that the attainment of India’s independence must be a case of divided
honours. It cannot be denied that the Indian Congress bore the brunt of the
struggle. Swaraj was conceived by Mahatma Gandhi not as a free gift of the
British Nation but as a ratification (almost automatic) by the British Parliament
of the Wishes of the Indian people as expressed through their freely chosen
representatives. This demand, first made in 1922, for what virtually amounted
to a Constituent Assembly, became thereafter a plank of the official Congress
programme and reached fulfillment in a quarter of a century.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
exact role played by the Congress in the Civil Disobedience movement of 1942 is
still a matter of controversy. The movement was, as we know, put down quickly
and for the time being effectively, but it proved to be the last turning point
in India’s road to complete freedom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recall today with gratitude and admiration the vision, the courage and the
sacrifice of several generations of patriots who contributed to this result,
and more particularly the efforts of Mahatma Gandhi whose dynamic leadership
helped to compress into a couple of decades a struggle which might have
otherwise filed a very long and painful chapter of Indian history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the same time, we cannot honestly withhold our need of praise for British
statesmanship. It is true that Britain’s response to Indian political demands
was always somewhat tardy and grudging. There were always Britishers,
particularly among those who held high administrative positions in India, who
discounted India’s competence for self-government and deprecated every move,
however modest, towards constitutional advance as premature and dangerous. But
for nearly a century the makers of British policy at the highest level rarely
questioned India’s right to govern herself ultimately or Britain’s moral
obligation to guide her towards that goal. Three famous passages from the
speeches of British statesmen are often quoted in this connection and it may
not be superfluous to repeat them on this occasion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

induced to reconsider its attitude, the Constituent Assembly met on the
appointed date and started its work of framing a Constitution for the whole of
India. But the continued and determined absence of the Muslim League
representatives from the Assembly, and the occurrence of communal disturbances
in different parts of the country, made it evident that no progress was
possible unless the Muslim League demands for separate State were conceded.

form, in our National Emblem and the National Flag. The former is a replica of
the magnificent lion capital at Sarnath near Banaras, which consists of a stone
column crowned by a group of four lions sitting back to back on a circular
abacus. The abacus is girdled by four animal figures in relief (a bull, a
horse, an elephant and a lion) broken up by 24 spoked wheels. The abacus rests
on a lotus in full bloom with sixteen petals opened out. The four lions are
emblems of power. The animal figures are facing the four quarters of the

wheel is the wheel of law–Dharma Chakra. The motto in Devanagari script means,

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have taken the above account almost verbatim from
a publication issued by the Ministry of External Affairs in connection with the
celebration of the Republic Day in January 1950. Some of the high principles
and ideals (adding up to a formidable total) enabled in the symbolism of our
National Flag and Emblem find explicit mention in the text of the Indian
Constitution and clearly underlie its provisions. The Preamble of the
Constitution, Part III dealing with Fundamental Rights, and Part IV dealing
with Directive Principles of State Policy form a triology comprising a
declaration of faith; a charter of freedom, and a code of politico-social
ethics. It has been said that “legal monuments generally contain in an
inextricable confusion at least two contradictory types of rules; rules which
are a simple restatement of an existing custom, and rules which are enacted for
the very purpose of reversing existing customs and which, in terms of social
reality should be read as we read the negative of a snapshot; white for black
and black for white.” It is true that the constitutional provisions in question
cannot altogether escape this criticism. But it is necessary to remember that
the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution are justiciable. In
framing laws relating to such matters as preventive detention of persons
without trial, control of the Public Press and acquisition of property for
public purposes, the greatest care is taken by legislative bodies to see that
constitutional restrictions and safeguards are not overstepped. And the
Judiciary of the country has shown its readiness to remedy any invasion of
these rights by the Legislatures or the Executive. The effect of judicial,
decisions may, of course, be neutralised by the amendment of the
Constitution,–a process which has so far proved all too easy because of the
large and obedient majority that the Government can command in the Houses of
the Central Legislature. But this state of things cannot endure for ever, and,
so far as one can see, the time is not far distant when the availability of
Judicial review may become an even more effective deterrent, than it now is, to
hasty or arbitrary action prejudicing the people’s Fundamental Rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is evident, however, that judicial protection cannot be omnipotent. There is a
well-known maxim that “the Constitution runs against Governments only”. If the Central
Government or any State Government or any Legislature infringes constitutional
rights, there is a remedy. But if the injury is inflicted by social groups
which are powerful but juridically unidentifiable, the matter becomes one of
social conscience. Slavery was abolished many years ago in the U.S.A., but
social life still bears the taint of racial discrimination pronouncedly in some
of the States, less apparently in others. The Indian Constitution declares that
“untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The
enforcement of any disability arising out of ‘untouchability’ shall be an
offence punishable in accordance with law.” The members of the scheduled
classes complain that in spite of this imperative provision, their people,
especially in the rural parts, are still labouring under various disabilities.
Most of their l</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>eaders, however, are honest enough to admit that
the treatment of the scheduled classes has greatly improved of late. If the
Inten</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>tions of the Constitution are not yet fully translated into
a social reality, time and increasing self-confidence on the part of the
scheduled classes themselves may be trusted to bring about a clear
approximation between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Directive Principles of State Policy enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution
are not enforceable rules of law. But the Principles are said to be
nevertheless fundamental, and it is laid down that it shall be the duty of the
States to apply these principles in making laws. Some of the directions embody princi</span><span

directing attention to the goal of a welfare State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

though as yet on a limited scale, to provide free and compulsory education for

thus, something is being done to put into effect the relatively easy and, for
the most part, negative items of the programme, its arduous and constructive
portions have not been tackled to any significant extent. Constructive work includes
the provision of adequate means of livelihood to all citizens and raising their
standard of living, which require financial </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sources, expert

surprising that it should have taken all </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>these years to prepare
a plan for commencing it. I share with many people the feeling of relief that
some plan has emerged at last, and that there is likely to be an end to
haphazard activity and vague idealism. If the Plan signifies no more than a
return to realism, it should be welcomed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

real value of the Plan lies in the fact that it seeks to direct attention to
selected projects and objectives which could be undertaken without running the
risk of serious disappointment. It rightly accords priority to the production

which is not less important, it constitutes a much needed warning to the
Central and State Governments not to bite off more than they can chew, not to dissipate
limited resources on schemes which, however desirable or attractive, are beyond
our present means or can have only a marginal utility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recruited. But, by and large, the core of a suitable public service exists
already in most of the States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

elements that make for good government are there. But there are also some
signals of danger. The public services are not fully shielded from improper
political influences. In the absence of an established convention, the
relations between the political Executive and the permanent services are a
matter of personal equation. The temptation to interfere with the proper work
of the permanent official, which is strong in the professional politician, is
not always tempered by lack of official authority. On the other hand, the
circumstances also encourage officials that way to play at politics. A scheming
public servant is just as odious as a political knight-errant. They are equally
a menace to good administration and healthy public life. The cobbler should stick
to his last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a perfect understanding of the functioning of representative institutions. The
expansion of the legislative bodies, and the increase of their powers under
successive schemes of political reforms, have helped to mould political

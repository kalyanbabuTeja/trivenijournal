versatile genius, an optimist, a humanist, a profound thinker, a moving
speaker, an able organizer, a politician, a civil servant, a journalist, a
great scholar, a patient teacher, a capital storyteller, and a literary
architect–all in a unique medley in one is Dr. Mulk Raj Anand. And, as a
belletrist, he is a host in himself. Early in life, his intimate contact with
the suffering underprivileged and the myriad levels of Indian masses with their
differences of caste, creed, and colour seem to have implanted in his mind
profound impressions about ‘the still sad music of humanity.’ The premature
death of his nine-year-old, beautiful girl cousin, Kausalya, appears to have
vibrated his inner strings, as Keat’s brother’s demise did the poet’s, to brood
over the mystery of life and death. Prompted by Irene, the charming daughter of
a Welsh Professor of science with whom he fell in love at first sight, Anand
became a writer. His research in philosophy has immensely contributed to his
humanism; and as he admits in his <i>Apology for Heroism, </i>his research was,
indeed, ‘search for truth’. He felt that philosophy, should answer the problems
posed by human needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has fused, in the crucible of his imagination, the philosophies and the ideals
of life of the Orient and the Occident and given his golden message to the
world through his works. His ideal is happiness–happiness of mankind in
peaceful and harmonious co-existence. He preaches–as Sorokin adovcates in his <i>Reconstruction
of Humanity</i>–that<i> </i>man should acquire spiritual awareness and altruism
for the welfare of humanity, and should cease his onslaught of humanity. To
expound this philosophy, Anand has aptly opted for fiction as his mouthpiece.
In his novels, it is mainly man’s cruelty to man that he describes and vehemently
condemns with </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a Dickensian piquancy’ and candour and
effectively evokes our sympathy and compassion. Thus, the problem he tries to
face as a writer, as he admits in his <i>Apology for Heroism, </i>is not
strictly ‘a private, but a private-public problem’, with Buddhist compassion.
With this philanthropic outlook, he defines the general in terms of the
particular with a universal appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>is Anand’s first noteworthy achievement. The theme of man’s
inhumanity to man is the mainstream of thought in the novel, depicted in the
form of caste-hatred or untouchability. It is a chronicle of a day’s incidents
in the life of Bakha, an eighteen-year-old outcaste boy. He experiences the
indictment of caste-hatred on him a number of times during a single day: he is
abused and slapped for polluting a merchant; he is put to shame when he runs to
save his sister, Sohini, while Kalinath, the priest, tries to rape her; he
receives a shower of abuses for polluting an injured child in his attempt to
help the child; lastly, his father, Lakha, the Head of the sweepers, drives him
out of the house for having wasted his time in playing hockey. He walks out
frustrated and helpless. Gandhi with his dislike for untouchability, Colonel
Hutchinson, the Salvationist, with his shield of casteless society and
salvation for all, and Iqbal Nath with his new machine (the flush) raise
towering hopes in him. He returns home and to his idle bed. Here Anand shows
the impact of man’s evil on man to a limited extent. His art of representing the
general in the particular begins here. Bakha, here, is any untouchable; his
tale is any untouchable’s. All through the novel, Anand points out the
inevitable play of fate, or <i>karma, </i>which is a regular feature of his
novels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anand’s
next novel <i>Coolie </i>is the best and the most ambitious of his
works–inasmuch as <i>Of Human Bondage </i>is Maugham’s–transcending the limits
of time and space. It describes man’s evil to man with all its poignancy in
terms of the fate meted out to the hero. In all aspects it is perfect, unique,
and of chiselled excellence–art and plot, events and episodes, characterisation
and narration, symbolism and didacticism. Here our interest hovers around the
heights and hollows in the life of the protagonist, Munoo, a poor orphan
hill-boy, verdant and innocent. Fate in diverse forms overpowers him
everywhere, wherever he goes. The first chapter is a brief account of his life
at his native village, Bilaspur. His aunt under-feeds and ill-treats him with
her frequent maledictions. She wants him to earn, and his uncle Daya Ram–who is
indeed devoid of <i>daya</i>–takes him to the town to serve in the house of the
Bank sub-accountant Nathoo Ram. In the second chapter, we see Munoo as a
boy-servant at Sham Nagar in the house of Nathoo Ram, where he slogs and slogs
without rest, from dawn to dusk, sweating in his dirty dublet. To him, his
mistress is no less a terror than his aunt, Gujri. Amidst the constant
upbraiding of his mistress, Daya Ram’s blows, the teasing of the other
boy-servants of the houses hard by, and Nathoo Ram’s nonchalance, the only
consolation to him is Prem (Nathoo Ram’s brother) who alone is kind to him. One
day, the boy is kicked by his master with his boot for a peccadillo while
playing with his master’s daughter. A wild bird cannot be caged easily: Munoo
escapes. Decried by the kindhearted Prabha under the bunk in the train, he is
taken to Daulatpur. The third chapter is a vivid picture of his life in the Cat
Killers’ Lane at Daulatpur. He works in Prabha’s pickle factory, where life is
happy for him but for the occasional authority and abuses of Ganpat, Prabha’s
partner. Malevolent and demonish, Ganpat adulates Prabha finally. Arrested for
debts and beaten by the police, Prabha leaves Daulatpur in adversity with the
result that Munoo is left unshielded and helpless. In vain he becomes a coolie.
Paralysed by the competition and the cunningness among the coolies, he strives
for security; and with the help of an elephant-driver of a circus company he
stows away to Bombay. In the fourth chapter, Anand gives a clear picture of
Munoo’s life in Bombay, until Munoo gets proof of the elephant-driver’s
averment: ‘The bigger a city is, the more cruel it is to the sons of Adam.’ In
Bombay he becomes a worker in the Sir George White Cotton Mills; he is one of
the many workers exploited by Jimmie Thomas, the foreman. Within and without
the factory, life becomes miserable. He lives with Hari, a worker and a
fellow-sufferer, in the slums. Wage-cut and hunger, exploitation and the
retrenchment of another worker Ratan, lead to labour turmoil and communal
riots. In panic, the boy steals out of the pandemonium to Malabar Hills, where
he is dashed down to unconsciousness by Mrs. Mainwaring’s Chevrolet. She takes
the boy to Simla. The last chapter is a picturesque description of Munoo’s life
under the kindly cruel treatment of his mistress. With his double duty as her
page and rickshaw-puller, over-work and undernourishment gradually fret away
his health until at length he is abed with consumption. He excuses one and all–even
his mistress–and attains spiritual sanctity. Death relieves him, relieves from
the prison of life. Here Anand’s representation of the myriad in the chosen is
at its acme. It is a cosmic painting of the lives of thousands of orphans,
coolies, boy-servants, factory-workers, and rickshaw-pullers, their health
running down ‘through the hour-glass of Time’. The novel is a treatise on
social evil at its sundry levels and phases. Every one of Anand’s other novels
is but a kaleidoscopic turn of one phase or other: an event or a chapter, a
character or a situation, in isolation, or in juxtaposition, appears shown
under a magnifying lens. In other words, it is the microcosm to the macrocosm
of Anand’s world of fiction. <i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

Macpherson Tea Estate, in Assam. Hari and Lakshmi (of <i>Coolie</i>) appear as
Gangu and Sajani here; Jimmie Thomas, the foreman of the Cotton Mills at
Bombay, is Reggie Hunt, the assistant manager. The evil atmosphere of the Sir
George White Cotton Mills–an arena of conflict and exploitation, treason and
injustice, derision and devilry–is shown in larger dimensions and with greater
intensity in the Tea Estate in this novel. The European bosses pester and
exploit the labourers. Gangu and his family suffer much: his wife becomes a
prey to malaria; and he himself faces death at the point of Reggie’s gun in his
attempt to save his daughter, Leila, from the clutches of the lust-blind
Reggie. As in <i>Coolie, </i>to quote Goronway Rees, here also, ‘with great
skill and without insistence, Dr. Anand shows the Indian coolies, exploited,
starving, cheated, dirty, diseased, as the true heirs of one of the world’s
greatest civilizations’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next,
Anand turns to his ‘familiar earth of Punjab village, Nandapur, and tries to
build up an ambitious epical structure’–a trilogy: <i>The Village, Across the
Black Waters, </i>and <i>The Sword and the</i> <i>Sickle, </i>These three
novels give a picture of the life of a Sikh peasant, Lalu Singh, covering his
boyhood, youth, and early manhood. Munoo in Bilaspur is Lalu of <i>The Village.
</i>He is constituted counter to the tradition and sentiment of the village.
With the enthusiasm of Munoo who goes to the town own with his uncle, Lalu goes
to see a fair at the neighbouring town. And without a second thought, he gets
his hair shorn away just as Munoo empties his pressing bowels beside the
kitchen-wall of Nathoo Ram’s house. The insult caused at home-the abuses and
the beatings–and the attempt for a shameful donkey-ride spur him to revolt
against the age-old custom and superstition. He leaves the house and joins the
army just as Munoo leaves Bilaspur for the riddance of his aunt’s maledictions.
The second of the trilogy, <i>Across the Black Waters, </i>is a picture of
Lalu’s experiences during the First World War. He is one of those ready for any
havoc, ready to fall or fell. The conflict, the fire and fury of action, the
frenzy of bullets (the love-messengers between nation and nation as Ruskin
ironically puts it)–all place him in a world of embarrassment and dismay no
less than the communal disturbances do Munoo at Bombay. After the car-accident,
when Munoo opens his eyes from unconsciousness, he finds himself moving in Mrs.
Mainwaring’s car; when Lalu regains his consciousness, after his fall in the
battle, he finds himself moving–only being dragged by a lion-mustached German.
And Lalu’s life as a captive is no better than Munoo’s in the service of the
Anglo-Indian lady. After the war, Lalu gets release from the Germans. The third
novel, <i>The Sword and the Sickle </i>is a catalogue of Lalu’s activities in
India until his incarceration in an Indian gaol. He awaits the fatal day behind
the grating, pondering over the fruitless revolution in which he has partaken,
as Munoo lies moribund reviewing the past in his mind. But, Lalu does not seem
to have attained the spiritual elevation of Munoo at last; his life’s journey
remains incomplete; and had Anand extended this novel, or written another
making it a grand tetralogy of Lalu, it would have been a splendid achievement
with man’s spiritual elevation as its central theme. In this trilogy, Evil
shows his vagaries in the guises of religious superstition, war, and revolt.
Lalu’s role symbolizes the lives of all detested, disgraced, dejected and
duped, youth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is the atmosphere of the pickle factory at Daulatpur and the Cotton Mills at
Bombay that prevails in Anand’s <i>The Big Heart. </i>The novel shows the evil
of tug between the capitalists, Lalla Murli Dhar and Seth Gokal Chand who open
a factory, and the dispossessed thathiars, the hereditary coppersmiths. Ananta,
the man with a big heart, wedges himself into this industrial dispute and
endeavours to bridge harmoniously the abyss of rivalry. But, he meets his
tragic death thrown against a broken machine by Ralia, the Samson of the place
while the latter is breaking the machine of the factory in sheer bedlam of fury
and revolt. “I want to live,” murmurs Munoo at Bombay in the Cotton Mills, “I
want to know to work this machine, I shall grow and be a man.” And it appears
as though Munoo grew up in Anand’s mind and reappeared in <i>The Big Heart </i>as
Ananta with his limitless love for the machine and sympathy for the
dispossessed thathiars. The tint of ruthlessness adumbrated in Ratan (in <i>Coolie</i>)<i>
</i>reaches its climax in Ralia as seen in the final catastrophe. Ananta, with
the tragic death meted out to him, is a symbolic and microcosmic representation
of all Mahatmas and Kennedys; and the role of Ralia is a cosmic painting of all
the starving stomachs of modern times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is fortunate that at least the first of the seven parts of Anand’s personal
odyssey <i>(Seven Ages of Man) </i>is published under the appellation <i>Seven
Summers </i>which appears to have its foundation in embryo in the first chapter
of <i>Coolie. </i>There is a brief account of Munoo recollecting his early
childhood in the first chapter. Here, Anand describes in first person his own
childhood experiences with great psychological insight. In general, it is ‘the
story of Indian childhood’ amid all the incongruities and inherent evils of
Indian social set-up described in true colours. No wonder if one finds
something of one’s childhood in the book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

part of Ratan and Piari Jan and the episode of Guy and Mrs. Mainwaring–man in
the hands of woman–provide for the central theme of <i>The Private Life of an
Indian Prince. </i>Here the hero is a wealthy and powerful Indian Prince,
Victor, who lords over many, but is a sad lord over himself. The sex-thirsty
Prince becomes a puppet in the folds of a harlot, Ganga Dasi, like Guy in Mrs.
Mainwaring’s. She plays havoc with his feelings and the Prince, therefore,
suffers so much like Guy or Munoo. He loses his power and wealth with the
accession of Estates to the Indian Union. His cup of worries becomes full when
he has been suspected in the murder of Bhool Chand, his rival Ganga Dasi’s
love. Most opportunely he becomes moon-struck. And his Rani Indira, the
embodiment of true love, chooses to attend on him with all the delight of a
devout wife. Victor comes a lunatic, just as Munoo falls sick, and dies, because
a woman. Ganga Dasi and Mrs. Mainwaring are two prints of the same stamp. They
become bitches to all that prowl around them. But, while Mrs. Mainwaring’s
sex-thirst is due to sheer fancy, Ganga Dasi, as a prostitute, accmulates
money. If Mohan, another rickshaw-puller, at Simla is kind and consoling to
Munoo, Dr. Sankar becomes the ‘Sancho Panza to the Prince’s Don Quixote.’ While
Rani Indira is a token of all women of true love, Prince Victor is a realistic
portrait of all the rich people with lust for power, wealth, and sex.</span><span

conflict between adherence to superstition and </span><span style='font-size:

a wife who is banished because she had innocently lived in another man’s
house.’ Panchi and Gauri, the young married couple, claim our sympathies as
they strive to find happiness and peace in love. Whereas Panchi fails to defy
the meaningless ancient system, Gauri, with a stronger will, faces the
banishment and rejects the narrow world of sentiment and superstition that
enthralled her husband. She leaves the village like Munoo. The frustration of
Munoo caused by the evil of social inhumanity finds expression in Panchi though
in a different atmosphere and emphasis. Panchi stands for those diffident to
defy the age-old senseless tradition; Gauri is a symbol of the courageous
modern woman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>The Road, </i>Anand revives the problem of untouchability of his <i>Untouchable
</i>sublimated to its dramatic essentials in the mould of the
Prabha-Ganpat-like episode in <i>Coolie. </i>For improving the economic
condition of the village by carrying its milk to the nearby town for sale, the
outcastes hew stones to lay a road to the town. But the upper classes refuse
even to touch the stones touched by the untouchables. Hence the latter
undertake the work themselves. Infuriated by their unity and success, the upper
classes set fire to their houses and force them to leave the village. We reach
the climax when the outcaste Bhikhu encounters vis-a-vis the landlord’s son,
once his playmate. Although his lip is cut and is bleeding he controls his fury
and withdraws like Munoo when kicked by his master at Sham Nagar. He walks on
the road, he has helped to construct, in the direction of Gurgaon to Delhi,
where nobody would care to know his caste and pester him. Here Anand has

evil of communal fanaticism leading to riots adumbrated in <i>Coolie </i>(chapter
IV) appears to have been adopted and expanded in Anand’s recent novel, <i>Death
of a Hero. </i>Here Anand shows the cruelty of the Pakistani hordes as the sole
cause for the tragic as well as heroic death of a dauntless Kashmiri nationalist
hero<i>, </i>who dies for the cause of secular India. His tragic death is an
indirect plea for international peace and harmony. This novel is Anand’s
condemnation of communal fanaticism inasmuch as, <i>The Home and the World </i>is
Tagore’s condemnation of political fanaticism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all these novels thus Anand exposes the bitter suffering or cruelty of humanity
at different levels; superlatively loathes and condemns evil of all its shapes
and shades; and greatly succeeds in tuning our hearts to compassion and beauty.
The indomitable spirit, the spiritual upsurge of man is the real hero and the
plea for universal love is the real theme of his novels. Through the roles of
Bhikhu and Gauri, he preaches that man should defy and transgress whatever
stands detrimental to new <i>values </i>and human glory. In his <i>Apology for</i>
<i>Heroism, </i>he advocates that one should break through ‘the facade of
protective egoism around oneself,’ believe in ‘the creative life, which means
the discovery, at the deepest levels, of Truth’, and adopt ‘worship of
humanity.’ This, in fact, is the keynote of his art. No wonder if E. M. Forster
observes: He (Anand) had the right mixture of<i> </i>insight and detachment and
the fact that he has come to fiction through philosophy has given him depth.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

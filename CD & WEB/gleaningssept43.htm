early life I began reading the so-called history of India. From day to day was
inflicted upon me the torture of cramming the name dates of the dismal
chronicle of India’s repeated defeats and humiliation’s in her political
competition with foreigners from Alexander to Clive. In that historical desert
of indignities, we tried desperately to satisfy intense hunger for national
glorification, out of the slender harvest of the oasis of the Rajput Chivalry.
It is known to all with what a feverish excitement we tried in those days to
press into our service Tod’s <i>Annals of Rajasthan </i>to enrich our Bengali
poetry, drama and romance. That clearly showed how direly we had been starving
in the process of discovering the true greatness of our country, which was not
a mere geographical expression but a vast continent of human aspirations and
character. The external nature of our country, no doubt, builds our body, but
our character grows with the inspiration we derive from the world of human
aspirations; and if we know that world to be petty and low, then we earn no
strength to dispel our depression of spirit, merely by reading the history of
the heroic nations that are foreigners. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may interest educationists in other parts of India, to know effort is being
made in Bengal to introduce “Picture Hours in the Schools” with the help of
colour post-cards of famous masterpieces of paintings–a very effective, yet a
cheap apparatus of study suitable for conditions prevailing in India. I have
just finished a series of an intensive course of lectures on the History of Art
for the benefit of a group of Art-teachers at the Calcutta University, almost
exclusively illustrated with a series post-cards representing significant
Masterpieces of Art of all the Schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Calcutta University’s humble efforts to train a small band of Art-teachers
to take up duties in schools to develop interest in Art appreciative and
creative, appear to pale into insignificance in comparison with the greater
achievement of the Travancore University in send formidable battalion of 320
graduates, with L.T., degrees, to take up strategic positions in Schools to
vanquish the prevailing ignorance of Art and to make our students art-minded.
But the great problem is to provide these teachers with the necessary arms,
implements, and apparatuses, for Art is a subject which cannot be talked about,
but has to be demonstrated, at each step, by visual examples. Before every
School has its Gallery of Pictures it is impossible even for trained teachers
to accomplish much. Yet the beginnings have to be laid in the Schools, for long
before the school boy matriculates and comes to his University, his hunger for
beauty is starved out by our too much bookish education.–(O. C. GANGULY in the
Modern Review–August, l943.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is remarkable to observe that singing lessons are given to nearly every private
and public organisation. In every such organisation a chorus band of selected
singers is formed. In case any organisation is too poor to afford a big
gathering hall, its members stand together in an open space, with the written
songs posted on a wall, or in case a wall is not available, on a wooden board.
Singing is no longer a classroom monopoly. On every street corner, in great or
small cities of Free China, on every day from morning till evening, in every
public meeting, rural or urban, singing voices are heard. A European, who
escaped from Hongkong, recently came to India, and told me that during his two
months’ travel through the provinces of Kwangung, Kwangsi, Kweiyang and Yunnan,
in every town he visited he heard the rich volume of mass singing which he had
never heard before. “It is,” he said, “the voice of New China.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Success is due largely to the personal inspiration of Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek. It perhaps sounds strange to you that such a minor thing as singing
has to be taken care of by a national leader. But it is a fact. As a soldier he
knows how great is the value of military songs to an army, and how much greater
it would be to the people as a whole. As a classical scholar he knows that
vocal science is a branch of old Chinese culture which had been frequently
emphasized by Confucius, as one of the two basic means of successful political
administration, and worth while reviving, In the Central Training Corps at
Chungking, of which the Generalissimo himself is the President, and at which he
lectures at least twice a week to the members who are high military or civil
officers of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>various parts and
departments of the country, a class of Teachers of Music and Singing had been
set up. Two hundred trained teachers are pouring out from it every half-year,

perverse development of philosophy, in the direction of arid logomachy and
mystifying jargon, is far from absent in even the modern scientific west. One
small instance will suffice. Some two years ago, I happened to pick up a volume
of the well-known Home University Library, entitled <i>Recent Philosophy</i>,
by John Laird (pub. 1936). I glanced through the Introduction. It was brightly
written. I proceeded to read the rest. I found the brightness marred more and
more frequently, as the pages went past, by sudden emergencies of strange,
dark, even fearful, words. I began to note these down on the fly-leaves. At the
end, the number of those ending in ‘ism’ amounted to one hundred and
twenty-one, each different from the others. And I had probably missed jotting
down some others. What does the reader think of ‘heuristicism’, ‘aporeticism,’
‘synechism,’ ‘tychism,’ ‘eidetic phenomenologism,’ ‘absolutistic normative
ethicalism,’ ‘noodicism,’ logistical positivism,’ ‘subjective transubjectivism’
and ‘glottologicalism,’ and ‘gignomenologism!’ Besides the ‘isms,’ there were
some equally amazing ‘ologies’ and ‘ogonies,’ f. i., ‘axiology,’
‘psychomegathology,’ and ‘heterogony.’ The Samskrit <i>vada </i>is an exact
equivalent of ‘ism’ and ‘ology’; can be tacked on to any word; and has been, to
many scores; yielding as many formidable words, which have neither earthly nor
heavenly use. On no page of Laird’s book was there any mention of any
connection between any of these astonishing words and views, supposed to be
‘philosophy,’ and human welfare and social structure; except one, in which
there was a passing reference to Marx’s ‘dialectical materialism’ and the now
famous ‘isms,’ Nazism, Fascism, and Communism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

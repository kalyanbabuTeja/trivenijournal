I agreed to speak to you on some aspects of Hindi literature, I really did so
under false pretences. The fact is that I have not studied Hindi at all, as, in
the days of my boyhood and youth, the official and even cultural language of my
home State of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Uttar Pradesh</st1:place></st1:State>
was Urdu. Urdu really means ‘camp’; and it was the language of the Muslim
armies camping in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to begin with. Urdu is, in a way, a daughter of Hindi. The grammar which is the
soul of a language, is the same both in Hindi and Urdu, but Urdu was enriched
by Arabic and Persian words, and the Persian script was adopted for writing it.
That was our heritage from Muslim days. For Hindi, the Nagari script was used.
Truly speaking, Hindi written in Persian script, with a few necessary
additions, is Urdu; and similarly Urdu, written in Nagari script, with similar
additions, can be regarded as Hindi. However, Hindi in the earlier days, was
looked down upon as <i>bhakha</i>–corrupted pronunciation of <i>bhasha</i>–that<i>
</i>is, the language spoken by mere common folk, a sort of <i>patois, </i>dialect
or vernacular. Owing to the fact that Urdu was the language of culture in the
North, Samskrit, which means a cultured language, was not pronounced as correctly
and beautifully there as in the South. Maharashtrians perhaps pronounce
Samskrit best, and most distinctly and accurately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
my early days, the person who came under the spell of Muslim educationists, was
better mannered and had a better pronunciation. Just as the good English
teacher who says ‘pronounce your last syllable distinctly,’ so did the Maulvis
also insist on their pupils pronouncing all words of the languages–Persian or
Persianised Urdu that they taught–fully and correctly. Those who were brought
up under Muslim teachers, seemed to hold in scant respect, those who spoke
Hindi, because their pronunciation of Urdu was faulty according to their own
standards, and also because their manners were regarded as bad. It was a pity
that Samskrit Pandits generally, unlike Muslim Maulvis, did not seem to have
laid much stress either on good pronunciation or good manners. The difference
can be generally marked in the pupils of the two. Anyway, no one cared to learn
Hindi as such. It was known because people spoke it and utilised it for the
ordinary purposes of daily life. Hindi, as a language of culture and
literature, was not in prominence at all. Pandits at home spoke local dialects
of Hindi, unlike the Maulvis who spoke chaste Urdu to their wives and children.
The Kashmiri Brahmanas and the Kayasthas among the North Indian Hindu
communities, were particularly steeped in Muslim culture. Hindi was under an
eclipse at the time; but towards the latter part of the last century,
particularly under the influence of Bharatendu Harish Chandra, Hindi started
becoming a living and vigorous language, quite capable of conveying thoughts on
an subjects of human interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far as my own education was concerned, great care was taken to teach me
Samskrit and English; but Hindi as such, was never taught to me. I stated
writing Hindi really when I was put in charge of the Hindi daily “AJ” of my
home-town of <st1:place w:st="on">Banaras</st1:place>. I was quite thirty years
of age then. This aggressively nationalist paper was started by my friend, the
great patriot Shri Shivaprasad Gupta, to break the unfortunate tradition that
all Hindi papers represented Hindu communalism and similarly all Urdu papers,
Muslim communalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the circumstances above mentioned, a desire was felt towards the latter part of
the 19th century that the great heritage of Hindi should be preserved, and its
literature enriched and ennobled. Thus was founded the Nagari Pracharini Sabha
at Banaras an association with the object of spreading the Nagari script, as
its name implies–because, Urdu, they regarded, as Hindi written in persian
script, with an unnecessary and undesirable admixture of foreign, Persian and
Arabic, words. Soon this association, as the later one founded at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>, called the
Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, stood out for Hindi wholly and absolutely. At the
beginning of the century, there was a Lieutenant-Governor of Uttar Pradesh–then
known as <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">North West</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Province</st1:PlaceType>, and later the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">United</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Provinces</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Agra</st1:place></st1:City> and Oudh–Sir Antony McDonald who
favoured Nagari, and issued a circular that in courts, if any papers were filed
written in Nagari, they were to be accepted. If the court language was Urdu
written in the Persian script. “It </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was only in that that
people could file documents in courts. Many Courts continued to object to Nagari
even afterwards, despite the circular and the<i> </i>sponsors of Nagari
continued to have difficult time to the last. It should be mentioned here that
only the script used was Nagari, the language continued to be the same as
before, namely, highly Persianised. I might incidentally mention that one of
the major tragedies of history, the partition of the country into <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
Bharat, was due not a little to the most unfortunate Hindi–Urdu controversy in
my home-State of Uttar Pradesh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this long introduction is only meant to show that I have never studied Hindi
due to circumstances that prevailed in the North in the latter part of the
19th, and the early part of this century; and that is why I feel I am not wrong
when I say that you have all come to hear me on Hindi under false pretences for
I am no authority on either the language or its literature. Sheer self-respect
compelled me to accept your invitation to speak, lest you should feel amazed
that there should be an apparently educated man whose mother tongue is Hindi
and who still does not know anything about it. The two languages that they took
pains to teach me, as I have said before, are English and Samskrit, and my
ignorance of Hindi therefore is really pardonable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
need hardly add that like many other major languages of the land, Hindi is also
regarded as having been derived from Samskrit. You may, however, be interested
and even perhaps amused to know that the very learned Mahamahopadtiyaya Pandit
Sudhakar Dvivedi of <st1:place w:st="on">Banaras</st1:place>, said that
Samskrit was the offspring of Hindi and not the other way round. His argument
was simple: ‘Samskrit’ means a cultured language. There must be something rough
before the same is cultured. Cultured Hindi is Samsrit. Thus he tried to prove
his thesis. Well, whatever Pandit Sudhakar Dvivedi might have thought,
generally speaking, we all believe that Hindi is the offspring of Samskrit. You
do not hear (much) of Hindi before the<i> </i>10th century of the Christian
era. People must have spoken some forum of the language in the street and the
field in the earlier days as well. They certainly did not speak Samskrit. Hindi
as a living, written language was unknown in the earlier years; and so we might<i>
</i>take the 10th to the 14th century as the first or early period of Hindi
when we hear something of the language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This period may be called the period
of the poetry of chivalry, of deeds of valour and of prowess. It appears that
the writing of poetry came earlier than the writing of prose in the world. As
there was no printing and everything had to be </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>committed to
memory, it was found that poetry is ever so much </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>easier to
remember than prose. Therefore all who could write </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>used
poetry as the medium for the expression of their thoughts. Thus we begin by
chronicling the deeds of the brave. Two<i> </i>very great illustrations of this
type of poetry are found in a poet of the name of Chand Bardayi who wrote his
famous ‘Prithviraj Raso’ and Jaga-nayak who sang of the exploits of Alha and
Udal (Uday Singh). Chand Bardayi has written about the exploits of Prithvi Raj.
Prithvi Raj and Jaychand were important historical figures at the time of
Mohammad Ghori in the 11th century and closely related to each other. We hear
of an attack by Ghori on Prithvi Raj, king of Kanauj. Jaychand turned against
him. It was Jaychand who migrated from Kanauj after those wars, and founded the
well-known <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">kingdom</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Jodhpur</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. We also have
Alha-Udal stories and songs in praise of Udaya Singh, the well-known and brave
king or chieftain of Bundel Khand round about <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Jhansi</st1:place></st1:City>, Banda and Hamirpur districts of
to-day. In this bardic age of<i> </i>nearly four centuries, these poets sang
the praise of war lords, of their fights, of their valour, of their greatness,
and so on. Not that they did not speak of other subjects, but chivalry was </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>their
main thesis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

17th where we find a sudden emergence of devotional poetry. W</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hile
the first four centuries gave us war-poetry in which the valour of the
chieftains was idolised, we come now to rich and beautiful poetry–great songs
sung in praise of God in various </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>forms. The <i>bhakti </i>(devotional)
school then came into prominence, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and we have a large
number of earnest devotees as poets, expressing their feelings of love of, and
absolute surrender to, God in the most ecstatic language. It is this age which
is greatly stressed in the history of the evolution of Hindi. The poems were
all written in <i>vraja bhasha </i>where the original words had to<i> </i>be
elongated or shortened in order to suit the exigencies of metre–for instance, <i>‘sneha’
</i>(love) becomes <i>‘neha’; ‘yatna’, </i>(effort) becomes <i>‘jatana’;
‘paksha’ </i>(feather) becomes ‘pakha’; <i>‘smarana’ </i>(remembrance) becomes <i>‘sumarin’;
</i>and even the Persian, word <i>‘ishka’ </i>(love) is turned to <i>‘isik’.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
historical setting of this period was just the same as the historical setting
of the previous period. In the earlier period, a large number of Hindu
chieftains over whom the Muslims were trying to establish sovereignty, were
resisting them with all their might, because of which bardic poetry was born.
So in the political setting of the next three centuries, we find Muslim rule </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>having
been more or less established. The heart of the people did not like this, for
they felt that they should not have this foreign rule. They wanted to throw it
away, but they found that chieftain after chieftain surrendered–maybe, because
of weakness of implements of warfare; maybe, because of treachery for which I
fear our country is rather noted from the time of Vibhishan downwards–and so
those who felt that this was not the correct thing and still felt helpless,
withdrew from the battle, so to say, and said: Let us now praise God, let us
Surrender ourselves to Him for surely He will come some day to rescue His
people from their serfdom and sorrow, for has not the Lord pledged Himself in
the words of the Bhagavad Gita:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all good people of the time thought that the game was up: that they must pray
to God to get rid of <i>mlechchas</i> who would otherwise destroy their
temples, their wealth and their cattle, and ruin all the structure of
civilisation and culture that had been built up by them. So they practised
complete non-co-operation with the powers-that-be. They just refused to
recognise them or even acknowledge their existence in the land. It is indeed a
curious thing that though Tulasi Das’ Ramayana is a big volume, and he has
written many other books besides, he does not even mention at any place, the
existence of a foreign power in the country. </span><span style='font-size:

may now come to the third stage of Hindi poetry which takes us from about the
middle of the 17th to the middle of the 19th centuries. This is the age of
erotic poetry. Some persons interpret it as only an extension of devotional
poetry put in a language that could be regarded as giving prominence to the
physical side of love. Various types of lovers and beloveds are described, and
the quality of love is scrutinised when extended in licit or illicit manner.
The view also finds expression that illicit love has greater force and passion
in it than the legitimate variety. There is endless description of <i>nayika-bheda,
</i>the difference between various types of heroines, with its stress on <i>swakiya
</i>(love for one’s own wife) and <i>parakiya </i>(love for other folks’
wives). This age of writing may be interpreted as the expression of a mentality
that has surrendered to the scheme of things as they were at the time. People
might have realised that their personal asceticism, self-denial and their
devotion to God and their prayers to Him to help, have yielded no results. The
rule of the Muslims was getting stronger and stronger, and actually law and
order had been established and there was peace and plenty in the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is no doubt that by the time Shahjahan came to the throne and the conquests of
Akbar has been consolidated, the country had settled down. We read in a little
book ELIZABETHAN VENTURE by Cecil Tragen, the story of the first
Englishmen–Ralph Fitch and John Newbery–who came to our country towards the
close of the 16th century. They travelled far and wide in the land; had been
captured and kept as prisoners by the Portuguese in Goa; had escaped from their
confinement; had gone on to <st1:City w:st="on">Agra</st1:City> and Hooghly
(that is near modern <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>).
It is clear </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

hospital at Cooch-Behar. No wonder </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that in these
circumstances, the poets and writers thought that they should accept facts as
they were and give themselves to sensualism and the joys that flesh could give,
after a long period of asceticism and self-denial. We can regard this period as
one of reaction from the extreme puritanism of the earlier age and a
recognition of the inevitability of things as they were, namely, the subjection
of the country by a foreigner for all time. Such swinging from one extreme to
another is not unknown in the social history of other peoples as well. Sex
being the instrument for the highest physical pleasure in man, the poetry of
these centuries is inclined to express sensual sentiments. The great poet of
the age is Bihari with his seven hundred couplets on love. After Tulasi Das, he
is perhaps the most popular and best known Hindi poet. Let me quote just one

have thus passed through three stages of Hindi literature: from the 10th to the
14th centuries, there is the early age of heroic poetry; then there is the
middle age from the mid-14th to the mid-17th century of devotional poetry,
followed by a third stage from mid-17th to mid-19th century which may be called
the later medieval or early modem age when we have our erotic poetry. In the
middle of the 19th century we come to the modem age of Hindi writing, which
covers roughly an hundred years up to date. Thus we come after 800 years of
poetry of all sorts, to an age of prose writing as well. When paper was scarce
and there was no method of duplication, people composed in poetry that was
comparatively easy to remember. When paper came into existence and the art of
writing was developed, the making of extra copies became easy, and people
started writing both in prose and poetry. The Christian missionary was almost a
pioneer in this respect, for he translated the Bible into the various spoken
languages of the land to enable him to take his message to the remotest
corners. Newspapers also came into existence, and all manner of subjects came
now to be freely discussed. Prose literature grew rapidly, and books on
science, philosophy and history became quite common. The influence of European
life thought, ideals and technique on it are great and undeniable.</span><span

outstanding figure of this age is Bharatendu Harish Chandra who is rightly
regarded as the father of modern Hindi. He lived a very short life of only
about 35 years; but in that period he wrote copiously and on varied subjects.
He belonged to an aristocratic family of <st1:place w:st="on">Banaras</st1:place>,
and must have been an extra-ordinary individual who could do so much in so
short a time. He showed by his own writings, how the Hindi language could be
utilised for the expression of thought in every department of human endeavour.
The spoken language became a most powerful vehicle in the supple hands of
learned writers, beginning with Bharatendu Harish Chandra. A grateful people
gave him the title of Bharatendu, the moon of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, in recognition of his great
talents and services. While formerly all poetry was in <i>vraja bhasha, </i>today
poetry, like prose, is almost entirely in <i>khadi boli, </i>the spoken
language. Those who love the poetry of <i>vraja bhasha </i>may not find modern <i>khadi
boli </i>poetry equally vigorous or beautiful; but that may be a matter of
opinion. <i>Khari Bali </i>is translated by some as the ordinary spoken
language, while others think it means perfected or chaste language. The evils
of the Hindu social system also attracted great writers; and Harish Chandra
himself has written on many current topics criticising the various wrongs done
in society: the differentiation of rich and poor, the hypocrisy of Hindu life,
covering wrongs under the guise of religion, etc. He was well-versed in
Samskrit also, for he translated difficult Samskrit dramas into Hindi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We should also mention Devaki Nandan Khatri who
wrote stories of magic. Many people grew so fond of them, that they actually
learnt Hindi–both script and language–in order to be able to read his then
famous books, “Chandrakanta” and others. He wrote in his own peculiar style,
but people read him with pleasure. He was thus able to teach the language to
many people who would never have learnt it otherwise. We must also not forget
the contemporary figure of Raja Shiva Prasad who lived a remarkable life of
varied activities, and about whom more should be known than actually is. He
suffered from the fact that he was a supporter of the British Government out
and out, and was invested with many high titles by them for his loyal services.
His good qualities have therefore been rather obscured because of prejudice
against him for buttressing foreign domination. It may perhaps amuse friends to
know that the title of Bharatendu (Moon of Bharat) was given to the
patriot-poet Harish Chandra as an answer to the Companionship of the most
exalted order of the ‘Star of India’ (translated in Hindi-Urdu as Sitare-Hind
or Star of Hind) given by the British Government to Raja Shiva Prasad. Though
astronomers tell us that stars are huge suns larger than ours, to the layman,
the moon is more powerful than stars, for as the Samskrit verse goes: <i>‘Ekah
chandrah tamo hanti na cha tara gana api’ </i>(one moon kills all darkness, but
not so a multitude of stars).’ <i>Bharatendu </i>to the public was thus bigger
and greater by far that <i>Sitare Hind.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

humble in society. He has drawn our hearts to sympathy for the sufferings of
the poor and the lowly. Charles Dickens was lucky inasmuch as he wrote among a
people who set themselves to the task of eradicating the evils that the author
had exposed. Unfortunately Prem Chand has not met with equal success here. Both
his novels and his short stories are, however, most popular in the
Hindi-speaking world to-day. We must also remember the great living poet
Maithili Saran Gupta who generally draws his themes from the great figures of
ancient legend, and interprets the characters of the Ramayana, Mahabharata and
the Puranas in his own unique and exquisite manner. There is also the famous poet
Jaya Shankar Prasad with his high philosophical concepts, who is studied by

the journalists, I am bound to mention Pandit Mahavir Prasad Dvivedi, the
learned and popular editor of the famous Hindi monthly “Saraswati” who died
some years back to the sorrow of all his friends and admirers. He was the
person who searched out talent and encouraged young persons to write in Hindi.
In fact it was he who found me out also; and I can never be sufficiently
grateful to him for the first letters he wrote to me inviting me to write for
his journal. It may interest some of my friends to know that I had written a
very long letter to my mother from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>
where I had spent the Christmas of 1913. In this letter I had described various
sights and sounds of that great city. This letter got into the hands of a
friend who copied it in a manuscript magazine that was being issued at that
time, in my home-town of <st1:place w:st="on">Banaras</st1:place>. Some one
seeing this, reproduced it in a weekly of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Gorakhpur</st1:place></st1:City>.
Pandit Mahavir Prasad Dvivedi, seeing this, wrote to me saying that he was
‘overjoyed’ on reading the article, and would very much like me to write for
his magazine as well. In our country unfortunately we do not encourage others,
and Pandit Mahavir Prasad Dvivedi is a great exception to the rule. It may be
safely said that he created writers and served Hindi in a remarkably successful
manner. In fact he is so widely respected that some scholars are inclined to
speak of the Dvivedi age in Hindi, as the immediately preceding one is
described as the Bharatendu age. Modern Hindi literature is not without its
controversialists; and the various types of poetry-<i>chayavada </i>(the shadow
cult) and others–are all subjected to the utmost scrutiny by the learned: and
very often in the course of discussions, poets are inclined to use hot words
against each other representing different schools of poetry, and sometimes
almost threaten to come to blows. I am not qualified enough to speak on the
merits of these controversies, and so must leave them at that. I should also be
pardoned for not mentioning more writers, poets, essayists, journalists,
speakers, novelists, and others of the modern age of Hindi for their number is
very large indeed. I have only mentioned a few whose names came to my mind on
the spur of the moment, and with whom and whose works, I myself happen to have
some slight acquaintance. I have not ventured to quote from them for that would
take me too far afield, and it is obviously difficult to pick and choose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has had its great protagonists in the land outside the Hindi-speaking areas as
well. Both Swami Dayanada Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, and Mahatma
Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, had for their mother-tongue, the great
Gujerati language, but both were advocates of Hindi as India’s common language
so to say; and they did, what few could have done, to spread a knowledge of the
language and raise its status. Modern Hindi journalism is eternally indebted to
a large number of <st1:place w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place> editors who have
used Hindi to great and good purpose in the daily press. The present
Constitution of the. country has accepted Hindi as the all-India official
language and the language for inter-state communication. It is hardly necessary
to repeat that this has not been done because Hindi was richer and more </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>powerful
than any other language of the land–it is decidedly not so. This has been done
solely because it does happen that Hindi </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is known, spoken and
understood by a greater number of people and over a larger area than any other.
I do most earnestly hope that all the unfortunate controversies that have
arisen in our country in the wake of Swaraj over the subject of language, will
soon disappear, and that we would all settle down in peace and amity ever
enriching our own regional languages for all intra-state purposes, and also
learning Hindi for the sake of national unity and well-being. We should, at the
same time, preserve the very useful and the very vigorous English language as
well for purposes of international converse and understanding.</span><span

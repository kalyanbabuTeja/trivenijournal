damaged its prestige and reduced its popularity and prominence considerably.

of the country, and heroic attempts were made, along with the attempts to wrest

the use and growth of the national languages and literatures of the people of

for inter-regional co-operation and co-ordination of the common <span

languages, the one spoken by the largest number of people, some variant or

selected for that role of <span class=SpellE>honour</span>. A great effort was

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it</span> was included in the list of
national languages enumerated in the 8th Schedule, and it was specifically laid
down that Hindi, the future Official Language of the Union Government, should
be developed to qualify for its role of <span class=SpellE>honour</span> by
drawing largely upon the other national languages, and especially Sanskrit, the
parent language of most of them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But as the time fixed in the Constitution for the
change-over approached, and steps began to be taken for effecting the
transition, defects and difficulties in the proposed arrangement came to be
revealed. The fitness of Hindi, in its present condition, in no way more
developed than most of the other regional languages, to replace English as the
official language of the Union, as the link language for inter-State relations,
and as the medium of instruction in higher education all over the country, was
questioned; the need for <span class=SpellE>recognising</span> and ensuring in
the present, and for a considerable time to come, an important place for
English in the educational system and in the national life of the country, for
spreading among the people modern knowledge, especially in Science and
Technology, and achieving an adequate measure of success in the plans of
economic and social development 4lndertaken, came to be <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
with increasing urgency; and the danger, in case a hasty attempt were made to
replace English by Hindi, of a steep fall in the standards of educational
attainment and administrative efficiency, felt to be already at a deplorably
low level, came to be feared. Moreover, the adoption of the democratic forms
and processes of government and the execution of gigantic plans of economic
development and industrialisation through the application of modern science and
technology, before the national soul had been fully recovered from its torpor
during centuries of foreign domination, before the national culture had been
revived after the consequent decay, and before the process of national
integration had been completed, encouraged narrow, material, sectional and
regional interests in the people, their representatives in the legislatures,
and even the leaders in public life, and forces of moral deterioration and
national disintegration began to manifest themselves. Differences arose, and
intolerance grew to alarming proportions, over the official language issue as
over several others; motives were suspected and attributed, extreme views were
advocated, and unconstitutional methods resorted to, and vested interests
developed, for a rapid and high-handed change-over on one side, and for
permanent retention of the status quo on the other, and the country is now faced
with a formidable internal crisis over this issue, at a time when it is
threatened with the danger of aggression on the frontiers by powerful enemies.
Bitter feelings have been roused between the advocates of English and Hindi for
the role of the official language of the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>
and the medium of higher education, and the chances of a compromise or
reconciliation of differences seem to be remote. The imposition of Hindi as the
official language of the Union, against the wishes of a large section of the
people, is repugnant to the democratic spirit of the times, and will not be
tolerated by the people of the non-Hindi regions; and the retention of English
in its present unnatural position of dominance, for ever, as a permanent
feature of the national life, is equally repugnant to the national sentiment.
Assurances are not likely to inspire confidence, and every step which has to be
taken for effecting a transition, is likely to be exploited by one party and
opposed and resented by the other party. </p>

generation and the period of the employment career of one generation. The

one of the most ancient languages in the world, perfect, precise and
scientific. It is the store-house of the culture and civilisation of Greater
India, a vehicle of Eurasian culture and a link between many of the Eurasian
languages for over five thousand years. It has already to its credit a vast and
rich literature covering various branches of knowledge, in arts, sciences,
philosophy and religion. Many invaluable treasures of knowledge and cu1ture,
preserved in the language, have yet to see the light of day and be brought into
contact and intercourse with modern knowledge, so that they might contribute
effectively to the common stock of knowledge of the human race. A revival of
the prestige of the language in the country, and consequently in the

a few misapprehensions are likely to prevail in certain sections of the people:
one, that it is a difficult language and is likely to remain beyond the reach
of the common people; and the other, that its ascendancy has been, and will be,
used by the learned and priestly classes to exploit the masses, and lastly the
revival of its vogue may lead to reaction and obscurantism. The objections are
really weighty and have to be faced and answered. It is unquestionable that in
a democratic and secular State, the official language of administration should
be within easy reach of at least a reasonable proportion of the common people
and that it should not be such as to lead to the emergence of a priestly or
privileged class and exploitation of the masses. But the use of the arguments
by way of objections to Sanskrit can be easily answered. It should not be
beyond the ingenuity of the intellectuals of the nation to attempt considerable
simplification of the language and the methods of learning and teaching it, to
the extent necessary for using it for communication in the ordinary
transactions of life and affairs of public interest and administration, so that
it may be accessible to an adequate proportion of the population. Experiments
with the language, in this direction, have been made from </span><span

may be disputed whether the language and the literature in it have ever been
the exclusive possession or monopoly of the priestly classes in the past, and
have been responsible for any exploitation and superstition; but even conceding
for the sake of argument, that it had been the case in the past, there can be
no reason to fear any such development in the future, as we have adopted a
democratic form of government, a secular conception of the State, and a
socialistic pattern of life as our goal. On the other hand, even to fight
reaction, obscurantism and superstition among the people, and their
exploitation by the learned and intellectual classes of the old, or a new,
type, education has to spread among the masses. A revival of the prestige and
importance of Sanskrit, a spread of the knowledge of the national language of
our ancient culture, in which our religious scriptures are all preserved, will
help a rational understanding and fruitful application of religious teachings

modifications to suit the changing circumstances of modern times, and to <span

preferential facilities or special aptitude for learning the language. Among
the students of the language in our educational institutions at present, of the
general type or the oriental type, we find a fair representation of all castes
and communities and a fair proportion of each exhibiting aptitude for it and
proficiency in it, and there is no evidence of any danger of a monopoly of any
kind emerging as a result of its use as the official language of the Union. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the crisis with which the country is now faced over the official language issue
may prove a blessing in disguise, if it should lead to a restoration of the

culture, and an honest attempt to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> them in
practice and derive strength and inspiration from them in building up our

Hindi by Sanskrit in the accepted three language formula; the use of the
regional language, in due course, as the medium of instruction at the secondary
stage all over the country, and compulsory study of Sanskrit at that stage;
ultimately the use of Sanskrit as the medium of instruction at the University
level with due provision for the compulsory study of English or any other well
developed modern language, to keep our intellectuals in touch with modern
knowledge, especially in science and technology. We have to provide for the
continuance of English as the official language at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
till it is replaced by Sanskrit, and fix a date for the change-over, and plan
in detail, for the steps to be taken during the transition period, for ensuring
a smooth change-over without any inconvenience to anyone section or linguistic
group in the country, and any danger of deterioration in standards of academic
attainments in our educational institutions or standards of efficiency in our
administrative services. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

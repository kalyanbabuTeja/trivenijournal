is a general misconception that in the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> way
of life art does not play an important role. In fact, so prevalent is this
fallacy that in his “Verdict on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,”
Beverly Nichols boldly says: “Gandhi is probably typical of the <i>modern
Hindu’s </i>(emphasis mine) complete insensibility to art; it simply does not
enter his scheme of things.” This remark needs no refutation. It has only to be
noted if the modern Christian is really cultured he will, with equal
completeness, be insensible to the verdict of Beverly Nichols. But what is more
relevant is that the cultured Christian will have greater respect for the
sympathetic but critical verdict of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who in his Autobiography
says: “Gandhi had little sense of beauty of artistry in man-made objects,
though he admired natural beauty. The <span class=SpellE>Taj</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mahal</span> was for him an embodiment of forced <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> and little more….And yet in his own way he had made
of his life an artistic whole. Every gesture had meaning and grace, without a
false touch.” But even Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s comment needs qualification in
the light of the following anecdote. During one of his visits to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>, Gandhiji was
shown some beautiful landscape studies by Sri K. <span class=SpellE>Venkatappa</span>,
the well-known artist. One of these showed the first outburst of the monsoon
and the “mist-clad and rain drenched” hill at <span class=SpellE>Ooty</span>.
When looking at this picture he said that he felt “the chill and cold blast of
the rains” as if he were actually caught in the monsoon on the <span
class=SpellE>Nilgiri</span> Hills. Those about Gandhiji noticed that he even
shivered. This incident clearly shows that he is not impervious to man-made
beauty, to art in the strict of the word. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

their sister to be trained first at <span class=SpellE>Ahmedabad</span> by the
artist R. M. <span class=SpellE>Raval</span> and later at <span class=SpellE>Santiniketan</span>

there is no single treatise where Gandhiji has expressed his views on art.
Unlike Beverly Nichols, with his propensity for passing verdicts on matters
beyond his comprehension, Gandhiji was, as he himself said in an interview with
Sri G. <span class=SpellE>Ramachandran</span>; too conscious of his limitations
to hold forth on art. But he has expressed his fundamental convictions on art
which can be gleaned from his writings and statements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

true art must help the soul to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> its inner

my soul’s <span class=SpellE>realisations</span>. I can claim, therefore, that
there is truly sufficient art in my life, though you might not see works of art
about me. My room may have blank walls; and I may even dispense with the roof,
so that I may gaze out upon the starry heavens overhead that stretch in an
unending expanse of beauty. What conscious art of man can give me the panoramic
scenes that open out before me, when I look up to the sky above with all its

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“That”, replied Gandhiji with a smile, “I could
never dream of doing, for the simple reason that it would be <span class=GramE>an
impertinence</span> on my part to hold forth on art. I am not an art student,
though these are my fundamental convictions, I do not speak or write about it,
because I am conscious of my own limitations. That consciousness is my only
strength. Whatever I might <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt'>have been
able to do in my life <span class=GramE>has</span> proceeded more than anything
else out of the realisati0n of my own limitations, my </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt'>functions are different from the artists and I
should not go out of my way to assume this position. True art takes note </span>not
merely of form but also of what is behind. There is an art that kills, and art
that gives life. True art must be evidence of happiness, contentment and purity
of its authors.” (<i>Young India, </i>August 11, 1921) </p>

however, does not mean that I refuse to accept the value of productions of art,
generally accepted as such, but only that I personally feel how inadequate
these are compared with the eternal symbols of beauty in nature. The

onward towards self-realisation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I not the forests and seas, the rivers and the mountains, the fields and the
valleys with which to slake my thirst for beauty? Could one conceive of any
painting comparable in inspiration to that of the star-studded sky, the
majestic seas, <span class=GramE>the</span> noble mountains? Is there a
painter’s <span class=SpellE>colour</span> comparable to the vermilion of an
emergent dawn or the gold of a parting day? No, my friend,” he smiles, “I need
no inspiration other than <span class=GramE>nature’s</span>. She has never
failed me yet; she mystifies me, bewilders me, <span class=GramE>sends</span>
me into ecstasies. What need have I for the childish, <span class=SpellE>colour</span>

art as created and demonstrated by man had very little place in Gandhiji’s conception
of life and beauty. His approach to perfection and beauty was by a different
road, and this we can accept for him without trying to change or to give him an
attribute for which he had no use. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“During
the years that my husband and I lived in close contact with him, we had many
discussions on the need for some expression of art in Man’s life. The following
one I recorded in my little book, <i>Mr. Gandhi: <span class=GramE>The</span>
Man, </i>and it is a good example of two different approaches in the search for
the good and the beautiful. It was a few days after my return from <st1:City
w:st="on">Natal</st1:City> to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Johannesburg</st1:place></st1:City>,
to make a home for Mr. Gandhi, my husband and myself. A little house had been
secured for this purpose before I arrived. This was very ugly and built of the
cheapest kinds of materials without any finish. It was furnished with the
barest necessities. I, being young, hopeful, and energetic, set to work to
bring some kind of redeeming features into being, and asked for material to
make curtains, and a rug or two for a bare board-floor. “But why?” asked Mr.
Gandhi, in a surprised tone. Why? Is not the country you can see from your
window more beautiful than that picture? Why, then, do you warn to shut it out
by curtains? Muslin or lace curtain that I am thinking of will not shut out the
view, but will hide the ugly, cheap wood that frames the window. I cannot look
out of the window all day, and furthermore it gets dark at about 6. Then there
are only distempered walls to meet one’s eye. It is all without any harmony,
and I want to hide some of the ugliness of the buildings, since I cannot change
it. This can be done with my <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and very little
money.’ <span class=GramE>‘But’, again urged Mr. Gandhi, ‘why do you want to
cumber yourself with things that will need time to be spent on them?</span> You
say you love beauty. You have it all around you. God has given you that. Why,
then, do you want things made by man?’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do not easily distinguish between God and man’, I replied. ‘If man creates
things of beauty, it is God speaking through him. Man is God’s interpreter. A
beautiful picture can raise the mind to a higher perception of God as the Giver
of all beauty.’ Mr. Gandhi was quite unmoved; he could not appreciate such a
need or point of view. We had many such discussions. Poetry, music-apart from
hymns which pleased him because of the sentiments the words expressed–beautiful
works of art found no living place in his life; and in after years I <span
class=SpellE>realised</span> that for him such things were not only not
necessary, and, therefore, not really understood as having any spiritual value,
but would act as a veil to cover what to him was Truth.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Aesthetic Ascetic whereas <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy</span> is an Ascetic

artificiality. Gandhi may not be able to appreciate the technical charms of a

it and given it to me as a token of his love. It is very precious to me. I
think the complete explanation of the principles of artistic creation is to be
found in these few words. “There is an interesting story of how once Gandhiji
tried his hand at art. A pen sketch depicting a temple, Shiva, Cupid and a
farmer was drawn by Gandhiji in an autograph book of Sri <span class=SpellE>Amarnath</span>
of <span class=SpellE>Santiniketan</span> when Gandhi visited <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
during the year when <span class=SpellE>Desabandhu</span> <span class=SpellE>Chittaranjan</span>
<span class=SpellE>Das</span> died. Sri <span class=SpellE>Amarnath</span>
relating the story in the Uttar Pradesh Congress Office said that he went with
artist Sri <span class=SpellE>Nandalal</span> Bose to Mahatma Gandhi and
presented his autograph to him. Gandhiji wrote a couplet of <span class=SpellE>Tulsidas</span>
on kindness and mercy and signed it. Finding Sri <span class=SpellE>Nandalal</span>
Bose busy in sketching he also started scribbling something and said smilingly
to him, “You are not the only artist. I too know something of art.” One
American journalist offered <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 20,000 for the sketch
but Sri <span class=SpellE>Amarnath</span> refused to part with it, but worked
to present it to the National Museum of Free India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

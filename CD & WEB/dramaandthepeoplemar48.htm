<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Drama
has been hailed by literary critics all over the world as the highest form of
literature. Comparing it with the epic, Aristotle found enough reasons to
assert its superiority even over that form of poetry in which Homer and Virgil,
Dante and Milton excelled. The very fact that Bharata’s <i>Natya Sastra, </i>the
earliest extant compilation of the principles of Indian dramaturgy, was called
the fifth Veda, goes to show the position it held in the domain of Indian
Literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the reasons that established the supremacy of drama, the most important is its
inherent capacity to maintain the closest relation to life. For, drama, to be
true to its character, must be stage-worthy. It has certainly a poetic or
literary aspect, but the stage and its appurtenances are designed to accentuate
it, neither to flatten its appeal nor to put a limitation on its scope. And
even if the stage should ever set up any boundary, it should do so only to lend
the drama a structural beauty or decorum which is the hallmark of all great
art. It is for this reason, most of the greatest realists in literature are
playwrights. A poet may roam in a fancy-utopia singing merely of life as it
should be rather than of life as it is; a novelist may talk of the ‘shape of
things to come’ or indulge in pleasant fantasies, but a dramatist, even if he
wishes to let the reins of his fancy loose, must always be cautious lest he, in
disregard, should trample over the life that his audience represent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a sense, though rather paradoxically, literature in general is both for the few
and for the masses. For the few, because with its technical subtleties and
profundity of ideas, it leaves those who cannot understand for themselves–or
are uninterested in the subject–unconcerned. For the masses, because it deals
with the general trend of life in a particular century or under certain
particular circumstances with, to be more precise, a harmonised sum-total of
various outlooks on life. But it is not the relation between the drama and the
people on this basis that I am writing about. With regard to drama such
relation is quite different, and is really worthy of being taken into
consideration from various angles of vision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Drama
is, indeed, the most democratic of all arts. To attain to its full stature it
must count on the services rendered by an author, actors, painters, musicians,
and audience at the same time. Obviously, therefore, it absorbs, on the one
hand, the services of different professionals, and on the other, of the people,
all and sundry who form one of its most indispensable parts, the audience.
Leaving aside the contributions of other allied arts to the making of drama, we
shall now concentrate on the mutual relation between drama and the audience,
because this is the main theme of this article. Needless to say, we are
excluding, for convenience, all writings poetic or otherwise in dramatic form,
which are exclusively meant for mere reading. We refuse to call any dialogic writing
a drama, though, in this connection, consistent attention should be paid to the
fact that drama is not subservient to the stage. What is really important and
true is that the business of interpretation of the spirit of the play is
carried out by both.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
late, it has been contended, and rightly too, that literature should not
divorce itself from the social background of life, in order to maintain its
power of eternal and universal appeal. Society has not only moulded the outlook
of the artist; it has also changed, in different ages, the entire character of
art itself and maintained its protean variety. Every other branch of literature
may moon into the twilight of escapism, but drama cannot, without some emphatic
loss, uproot itself from the soil. Even if sometimes it interprets life
allegorically or symbolically, the reality is suggested by bold implications.
As a matter of fact, it comes into being by the collective demand of the
people. A poet or a novelist writes mainly because he feels the urge from
within, but when a dramatist commits himself to writing, the demand comes from
all corners,–from actors, musicians, painters, managers,–in short, from the
people. In the very beginning poetry was, of course, the popular art, because
it was not characterised by exclusiveness, because it was read out to the
people. Gradually poetry moved towards lyrical esotericism, and though for a
long time it stuck to its narrative character, mere reading out was not
considered sufficient to satisfy the whole gamut of aesthetic appetite. Even in
the epic age significant references have been made to dramatic representations.
So with poetry moving towards its attainment of a somewhat exclusive character,
drama replaced it more successfully, for it combines in itself the salient
elements of all branches of literature, poetry, novel, story and so on. It
brought poetry from the unlively atmosphere of classrooms and bookshelves and
‘academics’ to the vast open vistas of life. Drama is, thus, literature read
out,–read out by voice, gesture, colour and tune. We know how profoundly the
lyrical lilt of Aeschylus, the supreme artistry of Sophocles, the intellectual
virility of Euripides and the subtle and pungent humour of Aristophanes
appealed to the Periclean Greeks. It does not require a vast range of
imagination to visualise an England where Shakespearean masterpieces were
enjoyed in hearty cooperation by playwright and actors and audience, and the
spirit of the dramas “showered from spectator to player and from player to spectator
in a carnival of delight”. Nor is it a myth that Kalidasa with his poetic
grandeur, Bhavabhuti with his artistry and idealism, and Sudraka with his deep
insight into life and reality, held their audiences, comprised of people from
every layer of society, in ecstatic rapture. But imagine, how stale and limited
had been their appeal if these masterpieces were written in a form other than
dramatic, or written in a dramatic form with an intention other than that of
catering to the people. It is only recently that a ‘Brand’, a ‘Faust’ or a
‘Blue Bird’ has been earmarked for the intelligentsia, neither because the
people have been comparatively less sensitive to this art than they were
formerly, nor because they are debased in their power of understanding and enjoyment,
but mainly because the artists themselves have changed their attitude,–which
perhaps they are bound to do in the social circumstances under which they live.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whenever
there was a marked unbalance of economic power, creative and intellectual pursuits
were usurped by a certain section of the people. There was even a faith in the
divine right of artistic heredity, and, for certain periods, artists were
actually lords or barons, men from the highest strata of Society. Though, as
chance exceptions, artists sometimes emerged from among the masses, their chief
aim was to flatter the sentiments of the upper classes,–the aim which actually
paid both in cash and kind. And the worshippers of learning with ample leisure
to chalk out the ramifications of artistic sensibilities, with vast property
which yielded all earthly comforts and power, and love for patronisation and
also with the convention of honour achieved through rendering of inspiration,
looked upon these artists as their proteges or foster-children. Then there were
set literary principles which encouraged the ideal of spiritual oneness and the
artists themselves found sufficient justification for their, perhaps
unconscious, vindication of upper class ideals, in the name of those
principles. The more revolutionary among them tossed for a while between
different ideals and at last sang of escapism, utopia and millennium. It was
the absence of the democratic basis of Greek society in the 5th Century B.C.
and the absence of humanism during the early English Renaissance that actually
checked the growth of the drama, which generally wilts when divorced from its
relation with the people. Most fortunately, the literary outlook, of late, has
undergone a vital change. The Gorkis and Silanappas and Sholokhovs had not to
barter or betray the life they lived for literary fame. On the other hand the
relation between art and the people has been well-defined and closely knit. The
next literary age will be mainly an age of drama. It will be an age when poets
and dramatists will sing of the aspirations of the common man, and in a
language which will vastly expand its scope by adapting its common forms; for,
the medium of expression must also change,–and the only desirable and
inevitable change is towards orientation or ‘literalisation’ of the common
speech. If Wordsworth failed to work up to his poetic theory, it was not
because his theory was wrong; it was mainly because he wanted to use the common
words without the necessary modifications. And when the question of common
speech arises, it is drama, of all the branches of literature, that is most
concerned, because drama is the art of direct narration–its language is the
language of the people. Shakespeare may have written mostly in blank-verse, but
the turns of his expression, its grammatical forms and constructions are
Elizabethan; and the imagery his dramas invoked captured the imagination of the
Elizabethan public. Maybe all his artistic subtleties were not appreciated by
the masses,–but may not we ask how many of the educated have actually
appreciated them? The fact is, when the economic equilibrium of a society is
intact, love for art is sure to grow, and by constant, though sometimes a
little artificial, attachment to art, the people can ultimately acquire
artistic sensibilities. The belief that the power of appreciation, like the
power of creation, is an inborn quality is conditioned by the system of
society. When a society becomes outmoded, it affords very little scope for the
cultivation of this appreciative power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

language of literature also, in spite of its elevation and flavour, does not
set any obstacle in the way of enjoyment by the people. As a matter of fact, as
suggested above, the language of literature, especially when it is used by a
dramatist, widens its scope by adopting the people’s language. The very fact
that Shakespeare knew and used twenty-one thousand words as against the eight
thousand known and used by Milton, the most scholarly of English Poets, bears
eloquent testimony to my contention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
a dramatist, as we have already said, can start with certain advantages. He is
privileged to have a direct and immediate contact with the people and, in his
hands, language is capable of unlimited expansion. The vast variety of life can
come under his comprehension because, both by expression and ideas, his only
aim is to ‘hold the mirror up to nature’. His grand style is not a rigid
sustenance of a particular standard; it is marked by the flexibility of life,
by its different tones and colours and shades. Take for instance the soliloquy
of Hamlet that begins with “To be or not to be, that is the question”. Mark the
movement of ideas and their range. From the most philosophic and fundamental
question of “to be or not to be” they move towards and centre round “the slings
and arrows of outrageous Fortune,” and then at last round “the whips and scorns
of time, the oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, the pangs of
dispiz’d love, the Law’s delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that
patient merit of the unworthy takes.” Similarly mark also the comparative
variety of Sanskrit drama, both in ideas and language, produced by the use of
different dialects and the representation of different ‘rasas’ or sentiments,
as against the somewhat unvaried note of the other branches of Sanskrit
literature. And it is certainly unreasonable to deny that such colourful
variety of drama is possible simply because its only and immediate concern is
the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
to change our point of view: Drama is not only a mirror of life as it is, but
also of life as it should be; it is not merely a pleasant pastime–it is an
institution, an academy where great and new ideas are born. It aims not merely
at pleasure, but both pleasure and profit. Preachers and reformers in different
countries, at different ages, have used it and are still using it as a great
and effective instrument for the dissemination of their ideas. When people, due
to social prejudices, have refused to subscribe to new ideals, it has forced
them to change with the time-spirit. Chekhov has convinced his audience of the
principles of ‘The New Theatre’. Ibsen set the world thinking anew on all the
fundamental issues of life in the context of new circumstances. Bernard Shaw
compelled his audience not to leave behind their brains at home while
witnessing his dramas. The Russians, in the most critical hour of their
national life, have inspired their soldiers by enacting the lives of their
heroes in every war-front. Conversely, oppressors and tyrants and enemies of
progress have found it necessary to stop theatrical institutions in order to
keep the people in ignorance and subjection. In ages long gone by, many playwrights
and actors were excommunicated and denied even Christian burial. Even recently,
in spite of a fundamental change in world outlook, Ibsen had to live the life
of an exile. So we can even summarily conclude: “Suppress theatrical
institutions, and you can suppress Revolution.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the fulfillment of the perennial possibilities of this most important branch of
literature. Sophocles required a Periclean Greece, Shakespeare, an Elizabethan
England, Kalidasa a golden age of the Gupta Dynasty. But it does not follow
that social conditions are not changed and moulded men; and who else among
artists can better mould them than playwrights?</span><span style='font-size:

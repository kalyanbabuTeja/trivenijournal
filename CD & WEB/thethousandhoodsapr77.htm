style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is a thousand-paged
novel by the Poet Laureate Dr. Viswanatha Satyanarayana, the dazzling celestial
that blazed exasperating trails on the literary horizon of Andhra dominating it
for several decades. A prolific writer he was, He wielded his pen in every
literary form of Telugu prose and poetry with grace. This novel, an epic in prose,
is his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>magnum opus </i>which touched
unprecedented poetic heights. It is done in the best of Indian tradition or
Lakshana, offering the reader an authentic account of, and an authoritative appreciation
of Bharatiya Vidya, the rich repository of Vedic philosophy, Sastras,
scriptures, literature, art, music, thought and culture, through the medium of
novel. The artist sets up a galaxy of true-to-life characters on his literary
canvas and brings out the subtlest shades of hues blended in a variety of
harmonies contrasting vividly the spiritual and the temporal, the sublime and
the ridiculous, and the puritanic and the cosmopolite types. His characters
enact the human drama, fully subserving the gracefull imitations of the
national character in speech, thought and action, breathing rich the varied
fragrance of Indian culture. His erudite pen sways freely along unbeaten
literary tracks delinating the curves of his novel-theme in unexcelled styles.
As a rare document of social history in literary form, the novel genuinely
traces out the complex life-web of men and women that once walked this great
land and faded out into oblivion facing the trials and tribulations of a
changing social life with a smile backed up by the innate power of a tradition bound
frame of mind. The beauty about the Indian way is that despite the intermittent
exposure to the impact of several alien cultures of dubious value, it still
sustains the vital soul of its life and thought nurtured by the nectarus
quintessence of its hoary past. That is why the novel, though written four
decades ago at a time when the Indian society stayed static severely suffocated
by a crimping rule, is still effulgent sprawling out to beat the linguistic
barriers through its translations into Hindi, Gujarati and other languages with
a universal appeal that is unfettered by imposed values of time and language.
The present wide acclaim to the novel by the multilingual world of Indian
letters four decades after it was originally designed in Telugu is a historic
test it successfully stands in values threatened so much by change in every
direction. The springs of a perennial life-stream, it strikes in its pages, of
an integrated national culture of eternal excellence but prophetically do echo
the renaissant melodies for a spiritual resurgence of this hitherto supine
nation. The novelist fathoms the depths of thought scooping up invaluable gems
hidden in the deep-rooted past and portrays them with a finished polish that is
rare for its exemplary quality. The intensive, as well as extensive, human
study of the varied textures of social conflicts germane to the soil, revealed
and resolved in its own right, offers the discerning reader sumptuous material
to meander thoughtfully in a provoking world of apparently imponderable values
swinging between Dharma and Moksha on the one side and Artha and Kama on the
other, if only to sharpen one’s faculties of understanding and judgment. Indian
sentiment freely flowing in life and culture, if ever captured and capsuled
truly, that is probably done in this single novel written in an uncompromising
style of superb finish by a renowned litterateur who faced life, literally and
literarily, with the uncompromising fervour of a prophetic poet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

characteristic charitable disposition toward public good was anybody’s guess.
Within six months of his coronation Ranga Rao had already spent eight lakhs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fifty thousands each at coronation time surreptitiously; anyway, the wastage

Radhakrishnayya and Sarvarayudu retired to their villages. Rameswaram was the
lonely soul left in the fort. He was minding other duties and there was none
responsible in the fort to supervise, and the materials had all mysteriously

the situation Rameswaram was now keen on avenging them. Ratnagiri, a
prostitute, was no problem at all, he thought, and Dharma Rao therefore became
his first target. He summoned him into the fort one day, and pat came the reply
disobeying his summons! A streak of indignation sparked off at his navel; it
gave a stroke in his heart; from there, it struck his face and finally settled
down at the trijunction as black blood-clot! Rameswaram would have straight
given him an affront; but, he knew well enough the antecedents of Dharma Ra and
the goodwill he had in the village. He showed timely restrain thinking that
discretion was the better part of valour. Nevertheless, he soon gave expression
to his wrath in a long letter he dispatched to Ranga Rao at Madras with a
bundle of falsehoods concoct against Dharma Rao; this partly pacified his fury.

was not the man to be disheartened at that: he then turned his wrath upon
Ratnagiri for he was bent upon humiliating her somehow. He deputed a khasa
(servants in fort are known as khasas) for the nefarious purpose. The fort
servants and the nautch community in the village were one. Kabir was Ratnagiri’s
brother. At forty, he looked sturdy and was a rank rowdy of the place. He could
easily negotiate a cart of two-putti load by putting his shoulder to the wheel.
In sword and stick-fights he was second to none: he learnt this art from
Krishnama Nayadu. He was once engaged a coach to Ranga Rao when he was a boy! as
Ranga Rao showed aversion Kabir often used to spank him for his indifference.
Quite disgusted with Kabir, Ranga Rao once complained against his ill-treatment
to his father. Nayadu had strong views in such matters; mastery over such
skills of valour for a zamindar’s son was a must, he held. He therefore did not
take note of the complaint. Owing to chagrin Ranga Rao thereafter developed
antipathy for Kabir. Khasa and the menial servants were all close to Kabir;
this mutual trust was something endemic with them. Rameswaram’s machinations
against Kabir’s sister drew out a righteous response from the khasa as could be
expected. He went to Ratnagiri the same evening and hinted it to her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rao was the wife of Krishnama Nayadu and was sixty years old. Ratnagiri
approached her that evening to give her a vivid account of the vindictive
attitude of Rameswaram toward her. The Queen-mother had an inkling of it even
on the coronation day. She had the corroboration of the khasa and sent away
Ratnagiri. She sent for Rameswaram and reprimanded him for his unworthy
conduct. Rameswaram’s head was down with shame. In deep mortification he
deplored the betrayal of the khasa. With subdued animosity he however moved
about with an artificial show of cordiality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

eleventh and the twelfth days of each lunar fortnight fasting partly and
visiting Venugopalaswamy’s temple those two days. The last six months after
Nayadu’s death she did not visit the temple at all. It was the tenth day of the
first fortnight of the fifth lunar month, Sravana, the day she took Rameswaram

appeared to her in the youthful form of Krishnama Nayadu with vertical white
marks on forehead. His face had the pleasant look, and on the lips those
enchanting smiles offering the devotee-world the complacent bliss of divine
protection. He wore his turban with a yadava slant; tucked in it was a tuft of
Royal insignia. There were ornaments worn on the neck–a rosary of Tulasi beads
and others in gold. His shoulders, hands, the ten fingers, the legs, the
waist-line, and in fact, the whole figure was ornate in gold studded with
precious gems. The yellow silk-dhoti worn was elegantly dropping down to the
ankles. Even with the toughest of yogic practices one would seldom have a
glimpse of Swamy’s full divine form. Meditation, however persistently pursued,
would not bring the mind to focus upon even a solitary limb, and if it did at
all, it would flash for a split-second! It was indeed the supreme fortune of
Rukminamma Rao speaking volumes about her past good and the degree of control
she exercised over her five senses! Never before was a boon of the divine
vision granted in such a beautiful form to any!–none, not even to the most
devout Leelashuka! To appear in the form of Krishnama Nayadu was itself a
divine recognition, the sublimation of her devotion and the culmination of her
chastity in the Almighty! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an inexplicable compunction, an infinite bliss and an overpowering grief, all
at once, as she woke up from sleep. The eastern sky cleared as the routine
instrumental music of the morn was being lilted. The shenai melodies of that
serene dawn floating over the cool breeze aloft pleasantly reached the Queen’s
ears offering her a fulfilling bliss. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

along the tranquil wind-waves like the tiny yacht sailing along the river-waves
under favourable winds. Raga and rhythm danced at the hands of Ranganayakulu in

knew him well. That threw Dharma Rao in a dilemma: a call from Queen he was
obliged to honour in the face of the oblique attitude of the fort towards him.
He came to a quick decision, however, to face the situation boldly. On his way
he met Kabir accidentally. Kabir never spoke to Rao and he usually shunned his
notice. But this time, he could not resist asking him: “Where’re you going
Babuji?” Rao was surprised: “Into the fort,” he replied. “Fort!” Kabir
exclaimed doubly apprehensive. “Then, I’ll go with you” he said and followed

whirled round his eyes! “Why? my boy! what’s the matter?” the Queen enquired

of the temple as she entered. A man was somehow left inside the temple

this grace with Nayadu’s death; and indeed, she lost all her former charm. She
noticed a man and a woman seated on the lake steps behind the temple. She
identified Dharma Rao but was surprised to see him in the company of a woman at

Rao relaxed after food on a cot in the verandah. His grandfather, Somanna, was
very much annoyed once about his son’s marriage. Rameswara Sastry then
interfered and went in search of a bride for him and managed to get him one
from the Palnad region against odds. He was issueless for a long time after
that marriage: this was another worry, rather to the old Somanna than to the
son himself. Gangadharam’s wife Nagamma was a veritable virago!–tall, rugged in
build, dark in colour and absolutely uncivilised she was, but of a careful
type. She had a daughter ten years after she joined her husband. Somanna’s
regret was that it was not a male child. Three years later, she gave birth to
another girl: it was a shock to the already disgusted grandfather. He cursed
himself. The elder one grew up to be five. Somanna then proposed her for Dharma
Rao. He literally teased Sastry. “I’ve become old–perhaps, I’m not destined to
have a grandson! I wish to see these girl’s married off and die peacefully,” he
constantly dinned into his ears. “You seem to be after a better alliance for
your son; any rich alliance you may seek will not be like ours, be assured!” he
insinuated at times. “It’s strange you’re so merciless to this old man. All
right! I’ve all these days been reckoning you and Gangayi as my two eyes,” he
tried to appeal to Sastry sometimes. Savitramma too played no mean part in the
matter. The result was Sastry yielded to their pressures and his eleven-rear-old
Dharma Rao was married to the five-year-old Arundhati. The wedding was celebrated
at Rangapuram on a grand scale. Krishnama Nayadu graced the function and
presented the couple a thousand rupees. Sastry spent in all five to six
thousands for the marriage; he gave a sovereign to each Brahmin who completed
Vedic studies and a rupee each to others. Looking an imbecile like a
three-year-old Arundhati could not face the ordeal of the ritual. She wept
weighed down by the heavy wedding clothes which were retained for the essential
part of the ceremony only and removed later. Most of the ceremonial formality
had to be gone through without her. When she felt sleepy once during the offer
of sacrifice to fire and dozed off cozily in Dharma Rao’s lap, the little
Dharma Rao himself was yawning, and it was a delightful spectacle! Somanna felt
blessed and fulfilled. In another two or three years, Sastry found himself in
straightened circumstances. Nagamma began to taunt them for not offering the
new bride conventional gifts in the month Sravana and for other lapses of the
kind. Savitramma felt miserable. Gangadharam too assumed a hostile attitude
towards them fanning the fire already kindled by Nagamma. That no good sari was
presented to Arundhati at puberty was a major allegation. The relations between
the two families were on the whole strained, with the sisters-in-law taking a
pique each against the other. Dharma Rao never received a pie from his uncle,
not to speak of anything in kind either, even in his bad times. How to go on
with the expensive function was what puzzled Dharma Rao now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rao stared thoughtfully at his house as he lay musing in the bed. It was indeed
a spacious one housing just two souls, himself and his mother. If his wife were
to join them now it would not however be that vacuous. The last he saw her was
nearly four years ago when they all came to Subbannapeta at his father’s death.
She was then a ten-year-old moving about the house smartly and shyly. In his
bereavement he had not the peace of mind then to eye her sportive movements
with satisfaction. Moreover, he was too young to be youthfully aspiring at that.
She must by now be really beautiful and in good form with age. A paragon of
beauty even then, she had a thin and reddish face! Dharma Rao’s spirits sprang
high suddenly in a self-designed fantasy that Arundhati was present with him as
the life and soul of his enterprise – Arundhati, the embodiment of chastity, with
her enchanting smiles, strutting around gracefully and spicing his home-life
with fortunes of glee, and in his tight embrace! He required money for this
consummation! – and, how to raise it? He had but just one way out left: he had
however been resisting it the four or five times he had the idea before–to
mortgage the house and raise the needed money. He grieved it was tantamount to
taint the memory of Krishnama Nayadu for the good turn he did him. On the other
hand, he held the home-coming of his wife might augur well! The hundred rupees
he would now raise on mortgage could somehow be discharged. He vacillated in
the turbulence of his mind and at last decided to raise the money somehow. He
slept fitfully till almost the cocks crowed in the world of Arundhati! He then
slept well. He woke up late in the morning and he changed his mind again as he
was totally averse to the mortgage idea. Would it do him any good betraying such
a noble couple?–he questioned himself. The Queen who showed him so much concern
and the King’s spirit always shadowing him! – he deliberated deeply. Two or
three days later, he met a village pandit to fix up the date for the nuptial
function. It was to come off ten days later. He informed his mother and said: “Mother!
Can’t we wait for another month, till Magha?” She smiled indifferently and
conveyed the message to Rangapuram the same evening and told her son about it
only the next day. “I wanted you to put it off!” Rao stressed. “You didn’t say
so!” his mother replied emphatically. Had he pressed for a change at that stage
his uncle would let off much steam. Dharma Rao therefore kept quiet. That
evening he went to see Naganna Setti. Setti’s son Venkataratnam was managing
their family business. Theirs was a monopoly in Subbannapeta, a place neither
totally rural nor urban. Father and son were both there in the shop but both
deliberately ignored Rao’s arrival. During the last four years of Krishnama
Nayadu’s life, Setti was very obsequious to Dharma Rao. He however began to
treat him lightly the moment Rao lost the zamindari patronage. Disregarding the
callous neglect aired by Setti, Dharma Rao said: “Setti! I’ve some business with
you,” with solicitude. “What business?” enquired Setti after a calculated
pause. “I want a loan of hundred rupees,” Rao said. “What! We already lost
heavily on your transaction! Barely we got back half the money lent. Moreover,
what’s your background that I should burn my fingers again?” said Setti,
disgustfully. “I’ve the house worth five thousands,” replied Dharma Rao. Setti
became avaricious. Actually, the house was worth ten thousands; nevertheless, Nayadu
struck it off for five. The last occasion and the house seemed to woo him
again. “Do you wish to pledge the house for a hundred? Anyhow, I don’t have the
money now,” said Setti with a reservation that was rather understandable for
its intentions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a matter of fact, Rao did not offer to pledge the house in his talk and he was
naturally perturbed, but he remained silent prudently. “See me tomorrow,
please!” said Setti after a while; “Morning?” enquired Rao eagerly, noticing
his affected courtesy with concern. Setti said “yes”, and then Rao went away.
When he came to see him again the next morning Venkataratnam said: “My father’s
gone out. I think we can’t accommodate you now.” Rao however waited there to
take the ‘no’ from Setti himself, but vexed with waiting there any longer he
left later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

went to see Savitramma that evening. Savitramma was not well disposed towards
her in those initial by-gone days. She often referred to her in quite ignoble
terms. Sastry always stood by Rangajamma in the bitter strife between them. The
succour Rangajamma gave them and the stand given through thick and thin totally
changed Savitramma in her attitude toward Rangajamma. Later, the two moved on
quite intimate terms and Savitramma used to refer to her respectfully as the
elder-in-law of the house and so on and so forth. Savitramma told Rangajamma
about her son’s consummation and informed that he went out to raise money for
the function, presumably from Setti. Rangajamma did not say anything at the
time. She left the place very late in the evening and went straight to Setti’s
house. “Madam! What brought you here at this hour?” enquired Setti anxiously.
Everyone had respect for Rangajamma, for she was a solvent with ten acres. “Has
Dharma Rao approached you for a loan? she enquired. “Yes,” replied Setti. “How
much?” she asked. “A hundred,” he said. “I’ll pay you back after I get paddy in
the season; lend him the amount now. If you want, take, pro-note from me,” she
said. “Sure, madam!” promised Setti and then she left. The next day Rao went to
see Setti again. Both father and son received him cordially this time. He was nonplussed
at such a sudden change overnight. He guessed it to be the mortgage that
allured them. “Attend to Raoji’s business first, my boy!” said Setti to his
son. The stamped covenant was kept ready at hand and they took his signature on
it. Deducting one anna for stamp Venkataratnam placed the balance of ninety-nine
rupees and fifteen annas in his hands. “Take a letter from me if you like,
instead of the mortgage.” Rao offered. “No, sir!” said Setti in complimentary
tones, “You’re Sastriji’s son and we know you stand by your word.” A whole
mystery seemed shrouded in every syllable Setti uttered, Rao wondered. He
returned home. Later, he brought ghee, dhal, cereal, etc., worth about ten
rupees. Over the next ten days his mother put him on a preparatory dietary
schedule which brought a fresh bloom to his face with puffed up cheeks. A day
prior to the function, Rao went out into the village. Older generation of the
Kamma, the Kapu and the Reddy communities had all good regard for Rao, because
he was Sastry’s child. “So, the grandchild is ready for the nuptial, right now!”
accosted a grand-old Reddy of ninety, a land-owner of about fifteen acres.
Dharma Rao blushed at the old man’s humour. Those of that era were unique in
their hits and pranks, at times bordering on roughness. He continued: “These
youngsters are a good-for-nothing lot. They can’t eat nor digest what little
they eat. Me? oh! I used to consume jaggery cakes by maunds!...polished
rice...two or three seers barely sufficient for me!...from morning till evening
I used to till the land and could easily jump over Gunderu!...” Kabir was just
then passing by. “Look! Here’s a robust man at forty and I’m ninety! Let’s test
our strength,” and in challenging tones he extended his arm toward Kabir. Kabir
had bitter experience of this “old man” and of his strength four or five times
before; he therefore he did not wish to make it the sixth. He curved away from
the old man letting off an unconquerable smile. “Thatha!” said Rao, “Your diet
is your strength–corn, ragi, etc. Our fragility is reared on rice. We’re indeed
no match for you. Don’t know if we can make the ninety like you!” he
complimented him heavily and politely went away. He went to Setti from there.
He purchased new clothes, took small change in coins, nuts, cloves, etc. Savitramma
was the sort who never cared for the morrow; whatever he brought home she
exhausted in the ten days. Rao despatched invitations to all relatives. He
purchased three measures of ghee and other needs for about sixty rupees leaving
a balance of twenty-nine rupees in his hands. He bought a golden sovereign for
fourteen and that left a balance of fifteen and change for two rupees.
Rangapuram was close by and so they decided to leave the next day only. Rao’s
sisters, in-laws, and their children were all expected by night. It is rather a
peculiar feature: despite the bitterest animosities brewing, relatives invariably
rally round promptly on occasions like this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the time of sunset. Even with such a sun so close to big setting-time the
characteristic hues still lingered on. Flocks of birds tined up in arrays were
to be seen flying across the horizon. The top of the Aswattha tree in the front
yard beautifully silhouetted the same hues against the tinted background of the
Western horizon at sunset. Devadasi came to see Dharma Rao. He saw her from a
distance and came out of the house with an upper cloth and they moved out
toward temples. “Look! how handsome my son is!” Manga observed proudly to Rami
of the weavers’ community as she met Rao <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>en
route. </i>Rao noticed she was watching him keenly but she never spoke to him.
They went to Siva’s temple where the sister stayed in the portico as Rao
entered the sanctorum. Swamy peeped into Devadasi’s face over Rao’s shoulders.
He regarded Krishna to be more fortunate than himself! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Rao
had a split-personality that was half-spiritual and half-temporal. On seeing Parvati
Devi beside Swamy be fancied upon the idea that family as an entanglement was
one God Himself could not escape! As the priest took out the Rudra’s Feet to
offer them blessings the metal plate underneath was displaced and it gave a
loud sound. Rao quickly turned round to look at Swamy expecting to see Him
laughing over his fanciful thought. Then they visited Venugopalaswamy’s temple.
It seemed to Rao that Swamy fixed His constant gaze all the while at Devadasi
and never noticed him at all! It was slightly dark as they set out homeward.
Rao escorted Girika home and turned back. “Brother!” Girika called him back. He
turned back. “Tomorrow is the day of consummation! Once my sister-in-law joins
you, I’m afraid, you’ll abandon us all!” “You!...mischievous girl!” ejaculated
Rao with the affected modesty of a nuptial groom. “Please do me a favour,” she
said, “give this as my present to my sister-in-law” and she passed on to him
the one ring which crowned her hands all these days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

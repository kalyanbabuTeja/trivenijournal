<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
visited <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in March to May this year. My previous visit was a dozen years ago. The tempo
of life has much quickened. I started in <st1:City w:st="on">Delhi</st1:City>
at 3-30 A. M. and reached <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State>
at 8-30 P. M. on the same date. The Jet Liner I travelled by moved so quietly
that I hardly felt the motion. It flew at a height of 25,000 feet over Asia and
Europe and 35,000 feet over the <st1:place w:st="on">Atlantic</st1:place>. It
moved at the rate of 350 to 600 miles per hour. In <st1:State w:st="on">New
 York</st1:State> as in other big towns of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region> the motor traffic in the
streets is so crowded that it is difficult to park a car where you stop. People
who cross streets do so with fear in their eyes, looking along the street.
There are electric signs on the streets telling when to cross and when not,
when your car may go long and when stop. It requires, however, alert
co-operation on the part of all to have this system working without accidents.
One needs to act on the signals with some discretion lest some car-drivers do
not obey the signals. Still, one gets accustomed to the heightened tempo of
life in cities; and when once you do so, life moves smoothly. <span
class=GramE>Less than 50 miles an hour on the road is slow motion for a car.</span>
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Economic
development has been rapidly progressing. Rural areas are left by people to
live in towns. People who work in towns often live 20 or 30 miles off, coming
to work and returning each day, for almost every worker has a car. Cars as a
rule are big and fast. Some town-dwellers keep a small plot of land round their
house in the country, for recreation or growing vegetables for their own use.
Agriculture is <span class=SpellE>practised</span> by hardly a tenth of the
population. The rest live by industry, trade or professions. There is high
production, wide distribution, and mass consumption. All the changes which
Professor <span class=SpellE>Rostov</span> predicted of economic development at
the summit have been reached in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.
  S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>! <span class=GramE>Professor <span
class=SpellE>Rostov’s</span> question–“What next?”</span>–is a question that is
relevant to the American situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
went to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with the purpose of studying both agriculture and culture. The density of
population in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is 60 per square mile. The holding of a farmer is on the average 100 acres.
There are farms which are smaller as well as farms which are much larger. It is
the large farms, held perhaps by a tenth of the farming <span class=GramE>families,
that</span> produce the surplus for internal distribution and for export.
Cotton, tobacco, wheat and <span class=SpellE>soya</span> beans are crops which
markedly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>provide for exports. In wheat, about 6 to 8% of
the crop is available for export to under-developed countries after the needs
of internal consumption and assured markets are met. While, on the one hand,
the Federal and State Governments stimulate increase of productivity of land,
there is need also to control total production: lest prices should slump. Till
1920, agriculture in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
used only horse and mule power. It was by 1920 that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region> became a creditor country.
Between 1920 and 1940, the use of oil and electric power as well as provision
of tractors and other agricultural machinery developed. There was a slump in
1930 with increased production. But the 2nd World War gave markets by 1940, and
later the Korean War added to external demand by 1950. Attention has now to be
given to price support as well as control of production through subsidies for
maintaining a floor price and arrangements to restrict cultivated area and
keeping excess land fallow. These arrangements do not work altogether smoothly.
If the area for wheat or corn is restricted, and price support is given for the
crop on the restricted area, farmers with the aid of agricultural science
produce more on that area itself, and the arrangements for balancing production
and demand tend to get upset. In the near future, when under-developed
countries become self- sufficient in food, namely, countries such as <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> which
hopes to grow all the food it needs in the next five years, American
agriculture will run the danger of excessive production and consequent decline
in prices. This is a danger of which American authorities are conscious. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
economic development in <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:country-region>
is largely based on scientific research apart from the large natural resources
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the energy of the people who are bent on getting from agriculture as well
as industry all the profit they can obtain. A materialistic attitude to life
has reached large proportions. To some 90% of the people, the objectives of
life are very largely materialistic. In T. V. shows, each day, the amenities of
food, clothing and house furniture are advertised with almost religious
emotion. This gives an outsider the impression that life in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
almost wholly materialistic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
change is, however, taking place below the surface of life. I found people
everywhere in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to be kindly, helpful and pleasant. Such cordiality and consideration for <span
class=SpellE>neighbours</span> is itself a sign of spiritual quality. While at
the bottom of social life as well as at the top there is a tough materialism,
the large body of the social structure is healthy and human. Among an important
minority of the intellectuals, a reaction against materialism and an urge
towards spiritual values has set in. This is like the leaven that <span
class=SpellE>leaveneth</span> bread, and may in time change the cultural
character in U.S.A. Almost all the scientists and administrators in agriculture
were found by me to be interested in spirit and spiritual values. Biologists as
well as agriculturists come nearer </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to understanding spirit
than pure physicists. I met several Professors of Science and Philosophy in
Universities. With very few exceptions, they were attracted to the ideas I
expressed for the reconciliation of science and philosophy, of matter and
spirit. I found that this change had taken place in the last 5 years. The cause
of the change was the atom bomb and the Russian Sputnik. The fear of the atom
bomb has become widespread. In one leading paper I read that 70 million
Americans could be killed in 4 minutes. Such anticipations naturally produce
disturbance of mind and spirit. I spoke at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">New Mexico</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
to the Philosophy Club. Some 30 or 40 young men and Women students of the age
of 20 or 22 were present. I expected that these young people would not be
interested in my thesis of integrating spirit with science. I found to my
surprise that they were very interested. After an hour’s talk and answering
questions, these young people told me that my talk was very stimulating and
that they thought it was a privilege to have heard me. They took me for drinks
and for an hour’s further talk. I said at the International Institute of
Education that I was surprised at this interest of these young people in my
thesis. The young woman who was the assistant in charge there asked why I was
surprised. She said, “It is we young people that are interested; it is we that
have to pay the piper; it is we that have to bear deformed children.” The
development of the atom bomb puzzles Americans. They feel that all the energy
and expenditure which are used for science seem to be leading science to human
danger instead of human progress. They hunger for an alternative target to
materialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
a year or two ago, Americans felt that they had freedom of spirit, free
enterprise and developed science and technology, but they found that the
Russians, with no belief in spirit, could develop science of the same scope and
quality as they. They are puzzled where the missing gap is</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Americans,
while avoiding spirit in science, do believe in spirit religion. Religion has
position in American Universities which it is not in Indian Universities.
Churches do attract congregations on days. But the difference between spirit as
believed in America and in India is that the former is transcendent while the
latter immanent. Dr. A. N. Whitehead said in his “Adventures of Ideas’’ that
the fundamental schism in humanity is between Aryan to whom Law is immanent and
the Semitic to whom Law is transcendent. In the West, there is a clash between
their Aryan blood to which spirit is immanent and their Semitic religion,
Christianity, to which spirit is transcendent. In Roman Catholicism, spirit is
immanent in man but not in all the Universe as in Vedanta. Scientific
institutions in the West have an unseen inscription at their front, <span
class=SpellE>viz</span>, “Spirit is prohibited from entering Science”. But in
India, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the statement of Pandit Nehru that “spirit is
the inner base of every thing that exists” marks the understanding of reality.
Spirit, on this view, is the nucleus of the atom of matter, of the mind of man,
of every living organism and indeed every thing with the quality of unity. If
science is to develop in India, its motto would be the statement of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pandit
Nehru. And integrated research into physics, psychology, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>biology,
astronomy, philosophy, ethics and mathematics would be the objective of an
Indian science of spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is such an effort and such an objective that I presented in my thesis before
American intellectuals, and the eagerness with which they were attracted to it
has much surprised me. Professor <span class=SpellE>Hlavaty</span>, in charge
of the Department of Mathematics in Indiana University, summed up the reaction
in the following words: “Science has recently begun to feel its limitations but
is unable to overcome them. India with her spiritual experience has the
obligation of helping science to overcome its limitations.” I said India accepted
the obligation. I am considering how this obligation can be implemented. Before
I met Professor <span class=SpellE>Hlavaty</span>, I said that science in U. S.
A. was like a frog in the well which ignored the world beyond the wall of the
well. But now I feel that science in U. S. A. is like a chicken in the shell
which is trying to peck out its way. It will do so even by itself, but with
delay and casualties. With help from the outside, as from an incubator, the
chicken will came out more surely and efficiently. Professor <span
class=SpellE>Morgenau</span> of Yale University said he accepted this analogy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
return for American aid to India, with 17 million tons of wheat agreed to be
given recently, with all the scientific know-how and methods of organisation
which U. S. A. is helping us with, we in India surely have an obligation to
give Indian aid to America along the line on which their need has been
expressed. In the long history of India, starting even some 4000 years ago,
India started with spiritual development as the Vedas and Vedanta, and built up
a rich material civilization till, say, 1000 A. D. Then the two cultural
streams of Islam and western Christianity came into clash with Indian culture.
It has taken till a few years ago for India to recover her feet and her freedom
of life. It is now to be hoped that the genes of life which India developed
during her progress both in spirit and in matter will not only help her to
develop once again but also help her to make a contribution to the world. When
I told Professor <span class=SpellE>Sinnot</span> of Yale University what Professor
<span class=SpellE>Hlavaty</span> of Indiana University told me, he agreed with
the latter, but added that people thought that India had nothing to contribute.
Indeed, most Indians are not aware that they have an inheritance of spiritual
experience and values on which they can build further with the aid of the
science they received from the West, while helping the West to expand and
rectify the science which the West has developed </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>but about which
the West is feeling unhappy and puzzled. The time has come for India and the West
to help each other. Neither is complete in itself. Together they may meet the
crisis in humanity which has come on earth. Science is flowing into India.
Philosophy neglected, and treated almost with contempt, in India may rise with
a new vitality and <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> with the help of the very
western science which it may help to renovate. The frontier of science is
matter: with an ignored spirit beyond. The frontier of Indian philosophy is
spirit: with matter beyond as <span class=SpellE>maya</span>. Man is now
growing a new dimension from which he can look beyond both the frontiers of
matter and spirit. Indeed in such a man the world may witness a new mutation of
man who may survive destruction threatened by science without spirit, and
stagnation caused by spirit without science. </span><span style='font-size:

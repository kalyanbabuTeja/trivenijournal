life-long quest for Truth by non-violent means. Fearlessness, indeed, plays so
large a part in Gandhi’s scheme that some hold it to be his “greatest
contribution to Indian life.”<sup>2</sup> Gandhi wanted his countrymen to be
fearless so that they might break the shackles of centuries-old political
thraldom, economic exploitation and social tyranny and injustice. His
insistence on fearlessness sowed the seeds of what is perhaps the most
formidable revolution of our age–the Revolution of Rising Expectations, which
is shaping today the attitudes and aspirations of billions of people of the
developing countries of the world. Three Revolutions in one, it seeks to
emancipate countless millions hold down in slavery or near-slavery from alien
political and economic tutelage and domination, to attain a full measure of
human dignity irrespective of race, religion and colour and to pave the path of
broadly shared economic opportunities.<sup>3</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an overwhelming majority of his Indian and foreign admirers Gandhi is, however,
known as the apostle of non-violence par excellence, the greatest the world has
seen since the days of Jesus Nazareth. As an exponent of Truth and non-violence
Gandhi has no peer, far less a superior in modern history. The quest for the
twin ideal was to be carried on with the help of the constructive programme
chalked out by him. The programme includes “Swadesi” or the use of indigenous
goods, physical labour which may be compared with the bread-labour of Tolstoy,
spinning and weaving work for communal unity, the removal of untouchability and
the revival of cottage industries, among others and the resuscitation thereby
of the seven hundred thousand villages of (undivided) <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Gandhi’s
admirers also know him as the inventor of Satyagraha and also as the man who
perfected it. Satyagraha generally means the application of the principles of
truth and non-violence on a mass scale for the realisation of specific
objectives–social, political and economic. It may also be individual, however.
Satyagraha became a matchless weapon in the hand of Gandhi. Satyagraha and
constructive programme cannot be isolated from each other. One is the struggle,
the other the preparation for it. The latter gives the necessary training to
the non-violent army of Satyagrahis-to-be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the abyss. Two major blood-lettings–World Wars I and II–in one generation
notwithstanding, nations and governments seem to be thirsting for more blood.
They seem to be itching for more blood-baths. Super-Powers with their
stockpiles of lethal nuclear weapons seem to be eager for a showdown. It is all
touch and go. The world has known no peace since curtains were rung down on
World War II more than a quarter of a century ago in early 1945. Hardly a year
has passed since then without a war or wars. They have all been local and minor
wars no doubt. But none can guarantee that a minor, local war will not develop
into a major international conflagration. The war, in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region> has already engulfed <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Laos</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region> has
long been deeply involved. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the U.S.S.R. may be so before long. A war in which the three
Super-Powers-the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R. and China–fight on opposite sides is sure
to be fought with nuclear weapons and a nuclear war will mean the annihilation<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>of our species and the possible
disintegration of our planet itself. War has plagued humanity from the
beginning of history. Inter-clan, inter-tribal, inter-class and inter-state
suspicions, jealousies and rivalries have again and again led to conflicts, but
they have all failed to solve the outstanding problems among the rivals and to
create lasting friendship among them. These earlier wars were nothing but
child’s plays in comparison with modern wars, which cause far more sufferings
and far greater loss of life, limb and property and create more numerous and
complicated problems than their earlier versions. Thus all the problems created
by World War II, which ended more than a quarter of a century ago, still cry
for solution. The problems created by wars, particularly modern wars, far
out-number those solved by them. Some alternative to war has, therefore, to be
thought of and it is against this background that a serious thought may be
given to non-violence as conceived by Gandhi, and to Satyagraha, the weapon of
the non-violent struggle devised by him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

revenge. Violence thus leads one into blind alley or a whirlpool as it were and
there is no getting out of either. Centuries-old blood feuds in the tribal
areas of the Pak-Afghan borders and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sicily</st1:place></st1:State>,
for example, have not established inter-family and inter-tribal peace in these
areas. Violence, in fact, starts a chain reaction, which harms its authors as
well as its victims. That explains why Martin Luther King (Jr.) said that
annihilation is the only alternative to non-violence. If we follow King
Hammurabi’s savage and heartless injunction of ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth’, we shall all be eyeless and toothless in the end. Not a very
heartening prospect perhaps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Satyagraha, applied in the right way and right spirit, will go a long way
in curing many of the maladies, including <span class=GramE>wars, that</span>
afflict humanity today. But non-violence, to be fruitful, must be the
non-violence of the brave, free from anger, hatred and malice. The brave alone
can be truly non-violent. Non-violence is not a cover for cowardice for them.
Gandhi realized this truth and it is why he prescribed violence “where there is
only a choice between cowardice and non-violence.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

freed by violence than enchained like a slave to her foreign oppressors.”<sup>5</sup>
It is thus evident that Gandhi was not a pacifist. He did never want
non-violence to degenerate into impotent cowardice. A successful application of
non-violence pre-supposes at least some sparks of humanity in the adversary,
one who has a conscience to appeal to. But there is no guarantee that a soldier
of non-violence will have such an adversary or adversaries in all cases. What
is he to do when those whose hearts he seeks to change by soul-force are
completely dehumanized? Non-­violence has no doubt achieved a fair measure of
success against the British Government in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the U. S. A. Government.
But it must be remembered that shortcomings notwithstanding, the British and
the Americans are on the whole civilized peoples. But what would be the fate of
non-violent non-co-operation against a totali­tarian or military dictatorship,
which does not tolerate disobedience or opposition in any shape or form.
“Hundred flowers” are not allowed to “blossom” under them. A non-violent
struggle could not, therefore, be any more successful in Nazi Germany and
Fascist Italy than it can be in the U.S.S.R., People’s <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>, <span class=GramE>Fidel</span> Castro’s <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> and against the military junta at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Islamabad</st1:place></st1:City>. Should the men
of non-violence in these countries submit meekly to their tormentors whose
hearts, if they have any, they (the men of non-violence) cannot melt? Gandhi
says “No”. He contends that God has given a marvellous weapon to everyone of us
and an undoubtedly formida­ble weapon it is. When all peaceful means to stop
unjust deeds fail, we can at least say ‘no’ to them. If necessary, a man of
non-violence should be prepared to lay down his life for the vindication of his
faith. In extreme cases where there is no choice <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>between<i> </i></span>violence and cowardice, Gandhi asserts that the
one is preferable to the other. The apparent contradiction between the
Mahatma’s profession and practice can be explained when this is borne in mind.
The war of liberation raging in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:country-region>,
which began as non-violent non-co-operation against Yahyashahi has assumed its
present form when the Yahya regime sought to crush it by unleashing a reign of
terror in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:country-region> that
was <st1:place w:st="on">East Pakistan</st1:place> till the other day. The
non-violent non-co-operators there have retaliated by unfurling the banner of

freedom fighters of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:place></st1:country-region>
would have had his blessings. “Gandhi’s <span class=GramE>campaigns in <st1:country-region

been told to Nehru and others of the Congress High Command subsequently. Some
of the Congress stalwarts, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
among them, however, refused to swallow the dangerous pill. Patel and others
tried to win over Gandhi. They argued that if the formula was rejected and a
fresh civil disobedience movement launched to win freedom for undivided <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the
Muslim league might start Hindu-Muslim riots all over the country. Gandhi
rejoined–“<i>Issa dar <span class=GramE>gaye</span>? Kitne log mare <span

understood and like all weapons, properly used at the right moment. The mind
and heart of the Satyagrahi must be free from all traces of ill-will for his
adversary. There should be love and compassion for all–friends and foes–alike.

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>American Negroes had to put up with injustice,
inequality and indignities in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montgomery</st1:place></st1:City>
buses. Schools and universities in the south would not admit Negro students.
But much of these is a memory of the past today. Civil Rights measures placed
on the statute book by the Federal legislature has done away with much of the
anti-Negro discrimination. Middle class Negroes have started moving up the
social ladder. These changes, however, do not represent even the beginning of a
social revolution. But they certainly reflect “a certain shifting of attitudes,
a certain success in putting issues on the map which were once off it.”<sup> 18</sup>
The non-violent Negro Civil Rights Movement has further given rise to Black
Power with different methods and objectives, which were beyond the ken of Dr.
King. But his non-violent Civil Rights Movement was the pre-condition of Black
Power, which has brought about a Negro awakening and which could not have
probably come in any other way. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The world suffers from a
war psychosis today. War is sought justified on various grounds. One of the
arguments in favour of war is that war provides employment to thousands of
unemployed whose numbers can be counted in thousands and millions in every
country. Another argument, a very heartless argument no doubt, in support of
war is that one of the three safety-valves of nature, famine and epidemic being
the other <span class=GramE>two,</span> it helps to keep down population. Not a
few actually believe that to sacrifice the lives of some for the safety and
well-being of many is just undesirable. These arguments, however, do not stand
scrutiny. Besides, their exponents lose sight of the patent historical truth
that violence has long been tried to solve the problems of humanity. But the
problems are where they were. If anything, violence has added to their solution
more difficult than ever. Under the circumstances what is the harm if
non-violence is given a trial? <span class=GramE>If it succeeds, so far so

mongers and “death merchants” (manufacturers of arms and ammunition) too
occasionally loose their purse-strings for the propagation of Gandhian
doctrines. The Pentagon itself encourages and finances Gandhian studies in the
American Universities. The Government of India too is in the same boat and
tries to juxtapose the machine-gun and the spinning wheel. It spends money on
the Gandhi centenary celebrations as well as on the defence preparations of the
country. Such inconsistency is, to say the least stultifying. The man in the

violence and of the mastery of machine over man were visualized by Gandhi more
than half a century ago. He raised his voice against both. He prescribed
Satyagraha and constructive programme to counteract the evils of violence as
well as machines. But his was a voice in the wilderness and we see the results
today. We see before our very eyes how machine has dehumanized man, how it has
made men brutes without brains in many cases. Gandhi was no obscurantist,
however. He was not against machines as such. What he wanted was that the
machine must be harnessed to the service of man. Man must be in the centre of
the picture and everything must revolve round man and his welfare. He sincerely
believed that machines can be truly useful to man and helpful to his evolution.

pilot after the ship has been brought to the port, i.e., after the country has
been liberated. Outlandish leaders–they are great in their own ways no
doubt–and their heartless ideologies which go against the very grains of our
own culture and tradition, have pushed Gandhi out of our minds. We have all but
forgotten him. Like Christ and the Buddha, Gandhi is about to be forgotten in
the land of his birth, the land which he has liberated from political bondage
and for which he lived, worked, suffered and died. His own people have disowned
him. “The manner of his death, On January 30, 1948,” writes a <span

no man than this that he lays down his life for his people, and he did so in

and fashionable today than the teachings of Gandhi and the reasons are not far

their hopes and fears and their joys and sorrows. They supply ready-made
solutions of the problems of the masses and promise quick results. They stir up
envy, anger and hatred of the masses against those whom they label as
class-enemies. They prescribe the liquidation of the class-enemies as the
panacea of all the sufferings of the masses and get quick response in
consequence. They sing hymns of hatred against their opponents and breathe fire
and brimstone against them. Gandhian workers by and large have moved away from
the people on the other hand and are in most cases out of such with them.
Besides, appeal to the nobler instincts of man, to his moderation and sense of
justice, cannot elicit as quick a response as that to his baser, primeval
instincts, viz., fear, ire, jealousy and the like. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

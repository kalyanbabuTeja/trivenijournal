mother-in-law accompanied the pair. After they had said their prayers and
received prasad, they came down the temple steps. Under a large banyan tree, a
sadhu was seated in apparent meditation. Near him sat a disciple, also in
saffron robes. Wishing to receive the blessings of the holy man, the little

had a formidable rival. Her husband seldom spoke to her, and only laughed at
his mother’s trivial remarks. She worked in the kitchen, helping her
mother-in-law, and her husband’s aunt, in the cooking and washing and cleaning.

in the Ashram was not unpleasant. She toiled in the communal kitchen, while her
husband conducted literacy classes and taught the villagers how to live
hygienically. He worked with a fanatic zeal, but was no happier, and grew
thinner. He spent much time in meditation and prayers, and ate frugally once a
day. The fresh country air and the regular life suited Ranjini, but she felt
uneasy. Her husband hardly spoke to her, except to criticise her. He made her
join classes and supervised her studies. The most she would receive in return
was a commendation on her work, but never a word which indicated any deeper
feeling. He was highly critical of the Ashram’s inmates, and often decried them
for their frivolous behaviour in their leisure hours. He allowed himself no
recreation and studied far into the night, always rising before dawn. Often she
found him muttering to himself. Sometimes she found him gesticulating. She did
not know what to think. She became wan with anxiety, afraid to disclose his

occupation, now muttering, now laughing. He looked wildly about him and gnashed
his teeth in rage. Again he would become quiet and </span><span

laugh and chuckle. When he seemed most preoccupied, Ranjini cautiously edged
her way to the door. The oil tablelamp threw only a limited circle of light and
left the rest of the room in darkness. Once outside the door she ran in search
of someone </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

scented rural night hung about her like a cloak, almost smothering her with its

went with her through the Ashram garden. All was still and dark. Only the
squeek of their sandals and the tap of their sticks broke the awe-inspiring
silence. No one spoke and she cried to herself. The hurricane lanterns which
they carried threw strange shadows, and here and there a rustle indicated that
a creature had been disturbed. The door of Ranjini’s hut stood wide open and
the light still burned. On the floor lay a shirt torn to shreds, but Vishnu was
nowhere. They searched and called all the rest of that night, but only the
sound of the rushing river nearby broke the stillness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

her mother-in-law, asking her to return home. The people at the Ashram also
felt that it would be best for her to go. She made the lonely journey by
herself. Vishnu’s uncle met her at the station and took her home. Vishnu’s

remark, as if to herself: “I wonder that she can eat so heartily. Anyone else
in her position would have gone on fasts and done penance for their past sins.
Yet look at her, eating as if nothing has happened,” she would end, casting a

body would burn with fever. But she dared not complain. One day Vishnu’s uncle

platform. The station was actually little more than a tin shed, with a few
green painted benches on its two platforms. It was deserted, except for a cow

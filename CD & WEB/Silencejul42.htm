<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Silence is more potent than speech. Few realise it. We are so much accustomed to speaking in season and out of it that we never realise that oftentimes we better our cause by silence. That silence has a value and a message has long been recognised by sages and saints. There are very many occasions when thought can be communicated by silence, perhaps more effectively than by speech. This does not mean that speech is unnecessary or irrelevant. Ordinarily speech is the method of communicating thought. But in speaking too much and too often–often not preceded by careful thought–we forget the value of silence. Great men have discovered great things only in moments of silence and peace. It is not possible to think while speaking. If we think more and speak less, we will be saying less and what we say may have greater value.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is all the more necessary to realise the value of silence today when we have nothing but noise all thc day and all over the world. The Radio is working all the twenty-four hours of the day; the echo of conflicts is heard at all hours; politicians and propagandists are speaking eternally; the noise of traffic is perpetual. Indeed, it looks as though we cannot get a minute’s silence or peace in all our waking moments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Silence is not only necessary for the hermit, who has retired from the world. It is equally, if not more, necessary for the man of the world. It gives him a pause–a necessary pause–in which he can turn the light inward, review the position of affairs and gain a better knowledge of them. This gives him a chance to regain his equilibrium. During the period of silence, he is able to cultivate a sense of detachment, which enables him to view things and events in their proper perspective. It is not without reason or significance that so great and busy a person as Mahatma Gandhi imposes on himself a day of silence so often as once a week. If it is necessary for him, how much more so is it for us? Even a few minutes every day will be of immense benefit. Those who have exercised it will realise its tonic effect.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Silence in a congregation has a great spiritual effect, when a hundred or two hundred people or more can sit in silence for a few minutes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is inspiring and ennobling–and if they can meditate on a single object, for instance, the peace and well-being of humanity, it must have a great spiritual value. In silent meditation, men of all castes and creeds, without difference or distinction can join unaffected by their religion or faiths. No one’s religious faith is touched. No words are spoken for prayer is common to all religions and to all men.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Silence experienced in the mass has a different effect from silence experienced in solitude. I had a recent experience of it when I was at Sri Aurobindo’s Asram. The Asramites and the visitors meet in the evening about 7-30 every day and sit in silence in the beautiful garden of the courtyard of the Asram for about ten minutes. The silence is impressive and spiritual in its effect. You can literally hear a pin drop and, except for the distant roar of the sea, not a soul stirs. The silence seems to convey a deep spiritual message, which pervades your whole being. There is a feeling of high spiritual elevation after the ten minutes’ meditation. Solitude and silence have been responsible for the production of some of the best literature and discoveries of the world. <I>The Artic Home of the Vedas</I> was written in the solitude of a jail cell.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would make a world of difference if we can have silence in our temples as they have in the temples of Travancore. Silence in a place of worship has profound spiritual effect. Any one who desires to experience this has only to visit any temple in the State of Travancore, particularly that of Kanyakumari at Cape Comorin.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greater the noise and confusion, the greater the need for silent meditation. In the world of today, the first step to bring peace and good will among men will be for every one of us to sit in silent meditation as often as we can and pray intensely for the end of conflicts and the establishment of a better life. It is silence alone that can open our eyes to a better understanding of our fellowmen and of things of which we have not yet gained a full knowledge.</P>

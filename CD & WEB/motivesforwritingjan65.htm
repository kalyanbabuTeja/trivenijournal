spoken word has a spell of its own; its purpose is immediate; and its appeal
instantaneous. When it comes from the mouths of earthly dignitaries, it
acquires a power and might of great consequence. But the written word is seldom
heeded by the contemporaries; it is addressed to posterity; rings across
generations; survives and gathers a momentum. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Needs
over-sway and words are of little value in the days of infancy; but with the weight
of years and the growth of the mind, words take the field; the increasing
sophistication makes us draw more and more on our artistic sense and the point
of view is driven home with a cogency and palatability almost un-challengeable.
After the satisfaction of the animal needs, man settles down and gives more of
his thought towards <span class=SpellE>chiselling</span> and refining the form
and the manner of his expression. A care, a concern and an attention which are
rarely associated with speech, lurk behind writing; but the question that
stares us in the face is, why should the great authors give their nights and
days to writing: and why should they toil so <span class=GramE>much</span>
whether there is recognition or not? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

urge for writing seems mysterious when we consider the instance of Lady Mary
Montague <span class=SpellE>Wortley</span> who after writing a history of her
times, insisted on the whole lot being consigned to flames; there is the other
equally staggering instance of a Casanova writing his memoirs, spending
thirteen hours a day in the library and expressing a similar desire that they
may be burnt; and certainly <span class=SpellE>Peppys</span> never meant that
his diary should be pried into by any other than his own eye. The only motive
here seems to be a type of Narcissism, a quest after self-perfection: it may be
useful to remember how there have been a few who have given the clay of their
lives an angel finish by such a determined pursuit; Marcus <span class=SpellE>Aurealius</span>,
Benjamin Franklin and more recently Mahatma Gandhi may be quoted as shining
illustrations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be the motive of exhibitionism; writing may serve as a sort of
window-dressing for mental ware; if a sportsman shows off his skill, why not a
writer his prowess in turns of expression or the wealth of his scholarship; the
writing may be a galley with an over-load; the peg may be too fragile to hold
on the frame-work of learning and Milton cannot but suggest himself to us in
this connection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be another motive for writing; the mind may be wavy and turbulent; it may
be a nest of thoughts which may be scattered away like birds at the slightest
disturbance; a net has to be spread to capture them and one may write in the
spirit of accepting a challenge to express the thoughts <span class=SpellE>clamouring</span>
for expression in the exact words. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writing may come in handy for taking away one’s blues; a mood of depression

self-absorption, bodying forth the hankerings of the soul; but for
Shakespeare’s being jilted by the Dark Lady, there would have been perhaps no
sonnets and but for the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

may after all be the diviner’s twig; if a water diviner is to be consulted to
avoid wasteful <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and dig at the place located by
him for a sure supply of water, so too the writer may take the quill to draw
out the riches, the ore lying concealed and dormant in the sub-conscious; what
a mine of wealth is there undiscovered, one does not know, unless one starts on
the journey; the writer himself may be over-mastered and the course the
direction and the culmination may all go contrary to his original intentions;
the outline may be there, but the execution may be different; Shylock and <span
class=SpellE>Falstaff</span> are so towering in the personality given them that
they refuse to obey the wand of Shakespeare’s dismissal; so too Rebecca of <span

starved may satisfy their hunger in dream banquets; the actual may be too <span

escape from this imperfect world into a fairy land of one’s own creation may be
another motive for writing and thus we have day-dreaming, the rosy pictures of
Utopias given to us not only by Sir Thomas Moor but by Plato and more recently
by </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Books may have the purpose of educating the public
censuring the morals of the times or correcting the evil practices as Addison
did with his Spectator or Charles Dickens with his novels; they may be written
on purpose for giving a message; in fact books may be referred to as messages
contained in a bottle; but just now the sea is stiff with too many bottles and
the world requires a reduction by ninety percent of its population, leaving
behind only the best part, before the individual regains his significance and not
be the drop that he is today in the world ocean. </p>

to writing; something not said before, not thought of either or something out

be marked out for a <span class=SpellE>particularism</span>; it may not be out
of place to remember the shock-tactics of Bernard Shaw in debunking
Shakespeare; the same strategy of discrediting the accepted values just <span
class=GramE>for<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>inviting</span>
attention on their individuality, may be the motif for writing. It is however
profitable to note that every individual is unique and different from others;
praise be to God for his infinite diversity in creation; straining too much
after uniqueness or originality may land one in queer-street; the writer’s job
is to be good and if he has a personality, it is bound to come out in his
works. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Money-making
may be another motive for writing; there is the famous dictum of Johnson that
none but bloc-heads, wrote anything except for money; but Johnson is not
remembered by his <span class=SpellE>Rasselas</span> or his Dictionary but by
his Talk and be did not make any money by his talk. There is no doubt a
possibility of serving both God and Mammon when we remember the case of
Shakespeare writing with an eye on the box-office returns and Scott studying
the sales proceeds. Some may make writing a regular calling; in fact, since
Dryden’s time writing has come to be established as a regular profession; but
professionalism may spell danger for the writer and his writing; for one thing
the author makes a precarious living; his writing has to be cut to size; it may
not have survival value being too topical; and for the other it may offend the
group that may come into power, landing the author in danger as in the case of
Milton for his pamphlet on Regicide. When writing is embraced as a profession,
it becomes soulless and mechanical; it is done as job-work and bas no
immortality about it; it is because Aeschylus mentioned in his epitaph
unimportant things such as where he was born and where he was born and where he
died and how he fought the Persians and nothing about his dramas, that we
delight in his dramas; it is because Chaucer could not finish his <i>Canterbury
Tales </i>due to the stress of his official duties as Civil Servant, that we
read with a sigh of disappointment that he has not finished; Milton in his
prime is little remembered when compared with the Milton who lost his eyes in
return for a real vision and higher that gave the epic. There is however the
possibility of one writing too much and living too little; witness the case of
Scott or <span class=SpellE>Trollope</span> drudging away the entire length of
their lives; blacking pages and losing the <span class=SpellE>savour</span> of
life; life is too precious to be thus thrown away on a single stake and that is
why Marx in one of his relaxed moods and with a sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
said that we should strive for a day when the fragmentary man should be
replaced by a completely developed man and when society could be so <span
class=SpellE>organised</span> that a man could hunt, fish and write without
being a professional. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Writing
may be motivated by a desire to be <span class=SpellE>lionised</span> by the
public, to be heard as an oracle and treated as such; the desire for publicity,
renown, is perhaps greater than for money; but the public, to be worth
anything, must at least be a century old like the oak; the contemporary
pronouncements have no validity; reviewers are geese; friends and acquaintances
are either too kind or jealous; time is the only court that can make an
authoritative pronouncement and universality of appeal is the stamp, the seal of
a good book. What is after all a public; Hitler had a public; the <span
class=SpellE>humourous</span> <span class=SpellE>programmes</span> of the
wireless have a public; Shakespeare regarded his public as being fantastic in
their judgment, idiotic in their passions; even so he conceded that among the
public there were lovable and admirable individuals; the same good-<span
class=SpellE>humoured</span> amusement with which Shakespeare looked at the
public and treated them, should be the attitude to be developed by the writer.
Keeping company with such dead authors is healthy and leads to a productivity
of the proper kind; the fear that keeping too much company with the dead may
lead to their becoming antiquated or outmoded is entirely groundless; every age
leaves its stamp on its generation; the Victorian because of intellectual companionship
has not the slightest chance of being transformed into an Elizabethan and we
may conclude by giving an instance in this connection of <span class=SpellE>Demosthenes</span>
copying out <span class=SpellE>Thucidides</span> thrice for becoming an orator
without ever being mistaken for <span class=SpellE>Thucidides</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

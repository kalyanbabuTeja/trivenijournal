position of the Indian woman in society has been a source of inspiration for
writers through ages. ‘Traditionally she is worshipped as a Goddess, but
socially she is degraded to the role of a slave. Besides, there is such an aura
of sanctity and tradition that it is highly untenable to imagine her out of it.
In a man-made society when women rebel against any injustice they are stamped
bad and are promptly chastised by the men who dominate their lives. Great
writers like Tagore, <span class=SpellE>Sarat</span> and <span class=SpellE>Premchand</span>
have made a very searching study of the social, position of the Indian woman,
but even they<i> </i>never dared to cross the boundaries of tradition, Whether
it is <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> <span class=SpellE>Bimala</span> or <span
class=SpellE>Charulata</span>, <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> Rosie or
Kamala <span class=SpellE>Marakandaya’s</span> Mira, or any other Indian
heroine, it is observed that they remain strictly Indian and tradition-bound.
We find a good deal of similarity in all these <span class=GramE>cases,</span>
hence it is not difficult to predict their reaction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and famous novels <i>Combat of Shadows, <span class=GramE>The</span> Princess,
A <st1:City w:st="on">Bend</st1:City> in the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganges</st1:place>,

class=SpellE>Malgonkar’s</span> popularity is not mainly in his style and
content of his novels, though<i> </i>they are different from others; nor in his
heroes who are as gallant and amorous as any other Indian hero, but in his
heroines much rather in his women characters endowed with a rare mixture of
charm, beauty, brains and strong individuality. They come from different social
levels, status and even nations–but primarily they are human beings–individuals
of highly inflammable nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of nation and tradition, and morality is specified essentially by culture. It
is difficult to think of any human activity which was not considered wrong at
one time or the other. <span class=SpellE>Malgonkar</span> exploits this
varying nature of morality in his novels. Whether it is poor, uneducated fallen
women who represent half of India’s women population like <span class=SpellE>Gauri</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Mumtaz</span>; or rich, sophisticated people like <span

an inexplicable inferiority complex despite their social status like Ruby and
Minnie; or rich educated cultured English women like Margot and Jean – are all
alike in the sense that they are rebellious. They all face different problems
under different circumstances. Their attitude to morality also varies with
their character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Miranda, the Anglo-Indian Headmistress of the school run by the tea plantations
in which Henry is working. The theme of <i>Combat of Shadows </i>is reminiscent

welcome. Ruby’s sole aim is to marry a <span class=SpellE>Britisher</span> and

dream come true. Henry’s sole need is physical pleasure and Ruby has much to
offer in that respect with “a rare mixture of the submissiveness and surrender
of oriental womanhood with the freedom and gaiety of the west...”<sup>3</sup>
and this is what brings them together. As G. S. <span class=SpellE>Amur</span>
rightly says, “The story of Winton’s relationship with Ruby is one of
betrayal–betrayal of passion through fear”.<sup>4</sup> Henry even overcome his
partiality for his own race and establishes a very good companionship and

heroines, whatever be their shortcomings, are creatures of flesh and blood.
Besides they have the common characteristic of being highly individualistic and
are self-possessed characters who are also true to themselves. It is not for
nothing that they all rebelled against traditions and conventions. In the
search for their true identity, they are not stopped by any obstacles. It is
this quality that gives them the element of reality. They may or may not be
unusual but they definitely have an air of realism. Their reactions to
situations can be deemed natural and realistic–especially when viewed in the

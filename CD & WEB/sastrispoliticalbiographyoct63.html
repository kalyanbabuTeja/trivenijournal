<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Very few, if any at all, will feel disillusioned
about Sri P. Kodanda Rao’s gifts and competence otherwise to write the
biography of his master, the late Rt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri. His close
association with him for more than quarter of a century and the intimate
knowledge he has had of the many inner workings of his leader’s mind,
especially in the none-too-comfortable political atmosphere of the times
between 1920 and 1946, entitle him to our listening with respect to his words.
For he writes as though he speaks with little effort. The result is not
superficiality of either matter or manner but solid material to enliven us
about his great master whom, according to an undisclosed urge in him the world
has not judged aright. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Diffident as he is of his literary powers, the
reader at no place feels the lack of either adequate language or accurate
presentation of a fine portrait. It is all one long, well-constructed,
unfolding of a political career. Maybe, here and there, Kodanda Rao tries to
restrain himself from an attempt at making Sastri look better than what he
appeared to him; still he can be acquitted of any trace of throwing mud at the
political antagonists of Sastri in his narration of some of the strange
misundersrandings which Sastri was subjected to by interested persons. Judged
by the best standards of a biography, Kodanda Rao’s work falls no whit behind
any of the well-known standard biographies in English. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kodanda
Rao has not for one moment concerned himself whether to give something of a
modern biography or something after the Victorian fashion. All that he has done
or has striven to do is to give a faithful account of a life that was rich in
both the qualities of greatness and of achievement in no mean measure. There
are many delightful spots for the connoisseur of anecdotes to dwell upon in
this life. At the outset we are introduced to the three important figures in
the Indian political scene, at any </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rate as accepted by
all, to have played very significant parts despite the proportions of their
stature differing in perspective to a later generation. Gokhale, Gandhi and
Sastri met not only together at times but also separately within the very brief
period after Gandhi’s return to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Gokhale’s death. Sastri’s self-confessions regarding his dress and
appearance, to the perturbation of his own master, draw our undiluted sense of
the humour of the situation. Let us turn to Kodanda Rao’s account: “Gokhale’s
delicate hint about dress and appearance was however lost on Sastri. Lord
Sydenham, when he was Governor of Bombay, suspected that the Society was a
cover for seditionists and played with the idea of suppressing it. To stave off
the catastrophe and to let the Governor know the members and their work by
personal contact, Gokhale invited him and his wife to tea at the Society. That
morning Gokhale discussed with Sastri the arrangements for the tea and invited
him to sit with him at the table of the chief guests. Sastri noticed that
Gokhale had something more on his mind but hesitated to say it. Gokhale essayed
to speak but hung back with evident embarrassment. Finally, he clinched the
brewing crisis by suggesting that Sastri might take a shave before meeting
their Excellencies. Having released the words, Gokhale retreated to his room,
somewhat abashed at the liberty he had taken with Sastri. Sastri was terribly
upset and blamed himself for not anticipating Gokhale’s suggestion, and for
having caused him such great embarrassment. In distress and in tears, he
returned to his room, only to find a brand new safety razor on his table–a gift
from Gokhale!” This is a very amusing episode told with such sense of
proportion that even the trifling incident looks quite a sizable insight into
the Gokhale-Sastri relationship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kodanda
Rao’s chief merit lies in his making us believe in an unvarnished tale. During
the year 1931, when events were shaping towards the Second Round Table
Conference in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>,
before the actual meeting of the conference, Sastri expounded the policy of the
Indian Liberals in a broadcast. Kodanda Rao’s comment is disarming in the
context. “Sastri confessed that the Liberals did not foresee the magnitude of
the people’s response to the Mahatma’s propaganda; they had not made the political
education of the masses their duty, and the discovery came to them as a shock.
The Government officials were even less in touch public opinion and did not
realise the gravity of the situation.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not easy to summarise the many details in this volume so far as the
political events connected with Sastri are concerned. The reader will have a
very gripping time when he actually turns the pages, consuming bit by bit of
every anecdote with which Sastri’s name was intimately connected. The Imperial
Conference in London to which Sastri was the delegate of the India Government
in 1921, the Geneva League of Nations, of which also he was a member
representing the India Government, the South African struggle which was a
legacy from his master ending in the Capetown Settlement, the Kenya
disappointment which almost brought upon Sastri a heart-break, the Washington
Conference for Disarmament in 1923, for which he was sent by the India
Government, his tour of countries at the invitation of the Premiers of the Dominions
of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the many contacts he had with the mighty
in power in the Western countries, the many scenes of his triumph, as a speaker
without a second in ability of presentation of India’s case, as well as
Britain’s great role in the entire world for a higher sense of political
values–all these and more are scattered about the pages of an out and out
entrancingly written biography. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
politics is the main preoccupation of the present writer, he has not eschewed
some of the relevant interesting details possessing intrinsic human interest.
For instance, one can hardly leave an incident as the one where Mrs. Sastri,
unable to accompany Sastri to South Africa as the Agent General’s wife, had to
resign herself to the satisfaction of leaving her husband’s care to an
unswerving lieutenant of Sastri. Let us to Kodanda Rao<i> </i>himself: “Mrs.
Sastri naturally presumed that she would accompany her husband and started
making preparations. But Sastri felt she would not<i> </i>be able to adjust herself
to the life he had to live in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region> and be happy: she would be more a
handicap than help to him. But he had not the heart to tell her and disappoint
her. He postponed the evil day, as it were. Finally Mr. V. Venkatasubbaiya, who
was the head of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
of the Servants of India Society and was on intimate terms with the Sastris,
was persuaded to introduce the subject and get the matter settled to avoid
last-minute disappointment. He came to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City>,
called the couple together and put leading questions to Sastri. Mrs. Sastri was
surprised and Sastri embarrassed. When she was told of the life she would have
to live in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as the wife of the Agent General, Mrs. Sastri herself decided that she should
not go. With a heavy heart, the brave yet sad lady turned to me and her moist
eyes pleaded eloquently with me to look after her beloved husband in his exile.
It was a touching scene. Her’s was a great sacrifice.” Anybody else would have
seized upon the sentimentality of the situation and made an overdrawn picture
of the whole thing. But it requires superior instinct and artistry to indicate
merely the occasion’s inevitable emotional appeal and pass on, as Kodanda Rao
has done. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
chapter on ‘Sastri and Nehru’ will be read with interest by all persons who
have a desire to know why to the last Sri Jawaharlal Nehru maintained an
attitude of criticism of Sastri, as also proved in the pages of his justly
famed <i>Autobiography</i>. The attempted intervention of Gandhiji to see to a
better understanding by Nehru of Sastri by the suggestion of a gift of his book
to Sastri by himself was aborted even at the outset by Sastri. Let us learn it
from Sastri himself. His letter to Mahadev Desai, the personal secretary to
Gandhiji, explained his disinclination: “I endorse and applaud your sentiment.
There is nothing in the world equal to an understanding of those from whom you
differ. It is beautifully put. Your good offices and those of the Mahatma are
always available in this sphere. May I say I am grateful for the effort which,
as you say in your letter, has already made? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“But
for the purpose it is not necessary that Mr. Nehru should be induced to give me
a copy of his book. If he were to give a copy to each person that stands in his
circle of acquaintance at the distance at which I stand, he should give away
thousands. What he would not do in the natural course, he need not be made to
do. He would’nt hesitate to act on Mahatma’s suggestion. But in the Corner of
his mind the thought might occur: ‘Why am I asked to do this?’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
episode brings out more than one fine lesson to us. In the first place a
sensitive mind, as Sastri’s, would rather risk allowing a misunderstanding to
continue than permit an out of the way attempt to reconcile two persons to
something like an understanding. Again, the part played by the Mahatma shows </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>how
much more human he had been to have felt that a prejudice lurking in the heart
of one good friend should not be neglected to the extent of causing pain for
long in that of the other, after a common friend like himself had come to know
of it. More than all, the way Sastri had written the letter to Mahadev Desai
with poise and delicacy proves a worthy example to follow for many, who fall
easy victims to irritation or imbalance, the moment something not of their own
choice or liking has taken </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
of Sastri’s admirers too are not aware, we can assure the public, of the
personal contacts he had developed with many foreign friends or the extent of
that intimacy or understanding which found itself in some of the letters now
disclosed to us. For instance, few alone of his many close friends were aware, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>while
he was living, of the very affectionate relationship that existed between him
and the artistes-couple, Moshe and Eva, in </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
“You gave me” he writes, “you and Eva, the most affectionate, charming, noble
home I have had or am likely to have. Remember where I write from. I am very
happy here. Still Eva and you gave me a vast deal which I miss and miss
sorely.” The letter was sent from his Mylapore home, but what a home he always
would cherish more is revealed in that letter. He loved an intellectual company
but at the same time he was free from inhibitions on grounds of convention and
tradition, if they tried to constrict his free flow of conversation or
companionship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
mind as his could not be sustained long on anything but the highest in
literature. If he was an unswerving follower of English literature, it never
stood in the way of his appreciating our own, whether in Sanskrit or Tamil. He
was even a bit partial to Sanskrit, when it came to a question of his final
evaluation of permanent literature. His musings on the Ramayana which were
delivered in the form of lectures towards his last years and afterwards
published in book-form, give the proof direct to his unshakeable belief in,
“the Ramayana...to be the most without a rival in the world’s literature.
Whether we judge by the grandeur of the theme, by the variety of characters
portrayed, by the tone of its idealism or by the appeal that it makes to the
devout heart, it ranks amongst the noblest monuments of the poetic genius.”
However much one may think that the appreciation of the Ramayana by itself is
not a conclusive test of one’s capacity to love great literature, still it is
an unfailing test of anyone’s deepening spirit to have felt, as Sastri had,
about the epic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be readers among friends who may not relish the chapter dealing with
‘Sidelights’ of his character and inclinations of which some details are
provided by Sri Kodanda Rao, as occasional departures from convention in the
matter of food and other habits. To some readers these may lack justification
to find a place in a book of this kind treating of his political life alone, or
even for that matter in any account of his life, which was one of unsullied
reputation and lofty principles. But they have certainly a place here for the
very reason a biography is not a panegyric but an assessment of a great hero by
another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the whole, the book satisfies the desideratum that ‘the aim of biography’ in
the words of Sir Sidney Lee, ‘is the truthful transmission of personality.’ Sri
Kodanda Rao has, in the light of his own accurate diaries as well as many other
documentary materials, traced the history of the political events in which
Sastri had himself made history no doubt by his labours and statesmanship. Sri
Kodanda Rao may have occasionally let fall a slip in a statement of a fact or
failed to tell quite as exactly as some of Sastri’s other friends whose
particular knowledge on a point of actual happening may be a bit more correct
than his. But it will not, it is hoped, take away the intrinsic merit and value
of a clear, correct and conspicuous judgment on a life of such noble and
exemplary conduct, approached with a sense of veneratio</span><span

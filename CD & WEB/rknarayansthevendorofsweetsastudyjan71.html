style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the contemporary Indian writers in English, Mr. R. K. Narayan stands supreme,
“a star that dwelt apart.” As Professor Srinivasa Iyengar says, “He is a rare
thing in India, a man of letters pure and simple.” Following the traditions of
the regional novel, Mr. Narayan’s novels deal with <i>Malgudi </i>(any growing
town in South India) and its people–their joys and sorrows, aspirations, and
achievements, feelings and failures and above all their human foibles. Mr.
Narayan’s <i>Malgudi </i>is like Hardy’s <i>Casterbridge </i>or Hopkin’s <i>Yoknapatwapha.
</i>His novels deal with Indian middle class life unlike Kamala Markandeya’s or
Bhabani’s which deal with the problems of the teeming millions. Mr. R. K.
Narayan is the most successful and widely read contemporary writer both at home
and abroad. The reason for this is to be found in his ability to translate
Indian situations with touches of reality, humour, wit and irony. “He is the
most brilliant realist writing at the moment.” His art of narration, his
ethical problems, his mastery of the medium, his subtle humour and irony and
above all his unique style–a style that is pure, simple and unsophisticated–make
his novels unique. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>His latest novel “The Vendor of Sweets” is an
additional feather in his cap. The novel deals with the tragi-comic clash of
two generations. The clash deepens with every page and chapter. The old
generation comes into conflict with the new generation that sets at nought the
cherished notions of marriage and morals. They seem to count for nothing in the
new world. “The prosperity and welfare of a country depend upon its adherence
to the ancient systems of education and marriage.” The novelist presents this
clash with a touch of realism, humour, irony and sadness. Humour is ubiquitous,
a humour that is strange among the modern English novelists but closer to
Cheucer and Chekhov, a humour rich, profound, irresistible, puckish, sane and
devoid of spite or cynicism. Like Chaucer, Mr. Narayan reads humour in everyday
life. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
entire story revolves around the central figure lagan, the protagonist, a
prosperous and flourishing sweet-vendor in Malgudi. He is a widower and Mali,
his only son, is the apple of his eye. Mr. Narayan presents the character of
Jagan in a characteristic way. Jagan is high-minded, austere, pious and
attentive to the scriptures. He almost leads an ascetic life without attaining
Sanyasihood. He is a true follower of Gandhiji. His diet habits are strict and
he always boasts of his book, his <i>magnum opus </i>on “Nature Cure and
Natural Diet” which refuses to come out of the Truth Printing Press. In spite
of these merits, his character includes a small flaw for the sake of safety.
The spiritual and practical aspects of his life are amazing. With
“Bhagavadgita” in his hands, he had an eye on the collections in the shop. What
we apply to images, can safely be applied to human beings. If an image is
perfect, it cannot be held on its pedestal. So a small flaw is created in every
image for the sake of safety and security. Mr. Narayan presents all his
character with appealing human flaws. It is in the true tradition of all great
writers like Kalidas and Shakespeare. “Gods give us defects to make us human.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to our Sastras, everyone has three earthly attachments–Dareshana (wife),
Putreshana (son) and Dhaneshana (wealth). Jagan, the widower, lives and earns
for the sake of his only son Mali. Mali is petted and pampered and he is like a
spoiled horse fresh from the stable. Jagan’s deep affection goes unrequitted as
Mali hoodwinks the presence of his father and in this respect Jagan resembles
Margayya (“The Financial Expert”). Jagan has a cousin (how he became a cousin God
knows,) who visits his shop daily to taste sweets gratis and to listen to
pompous speeches of Jagan. His listening capacity is as great as his nibbling
capacity. He is a man about town claiming cousinhood with many. He plays the
part of a bridge between the conventional father and the unconventional son. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
day Mali firmly announces his fantastic decision to bid good-bye to education.
He expresses his keen desire to go to America to become a writer as he is bored
with the Indian educational system. “You can always hit education when there is
no other target.” Jagan comes to know that his son has reached America and it
seems to him worth all the money and pangs of separation. With a touch of pride
and vanity, he informs everyone (almost blocking the way) about his son in
America. He suffers from talking disease. He receives a series of Blue Air Mail
letters with an elated feeling and slowly they take the place of
“Bhagavadgita”. When he comes to know that his son has taken to eating beef,
Jagan receives a shock. In one of his letters Mail advises his father and the
nation to eat beef, as it would solve the food problem and the problem of “the
useless cows in our country”. Jagan feels outraged because the Sastras defined
the five deadly sins and killing of a cow headed the list. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
character of Mali is drawn from real life. Narayan visited the U. S. A. in the
October of 1956 on an invitation by the Rockfeller Foundation. The fruits of
this visit are “The Guide “ and “My Dateless Diary”. He refers to an Indian
friend by a pseudonym in his book “My Dateless Diary”. He is Mr. Govind from an
orthodox family in Bombay, an austere associate of Gandhiji and a stern
practitioner of Gandhian principles. He went to the States for higher studies.
He fell in love with an American (or European) girl. He married her much to the
chagrin of his father who ostracized him from the ancient family. In order to
avoid domestic complexities, he started eating beef. In one of his letters to
his old teacher in Bombay, he advises him to adopt beef-eating as a national
duty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
morning Jagan receives a cable “Arriving home another person with me.” Jagan
has terrible misgivings regarding the latter part and his mind is in a turmoil.
He receives his son and “another person” with tears in his eyes and trembling
in his bones. Mali introduces “another person” as Grace, his half-American and
half-Korean wife. Jagan is completely perturbed by the sight of the alien girl,
his supposed daughter-in-law. He faces a new world in which his cherished
notions of marriage and morals are dwindling at cosmic or supersonic speed. He
is brought from illusion to reality, his airy castles crash to pieces and he
remains a ruined piece of nature. His house becomes hell and he walks with
downcast eyes avoiding people in the street lest they should ask about his
daughter-in-law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

starts a project of selling story-writing machine which is like a radio with
American collaboration. He wants to drag his father into the field. Mali says
that it is essential for every Indian home. Jagan keeps himself aloof from all
these activities. He finds an invisible barrier between himself and his son.
Though living under the same roof, they are in two different worlds. “East is
East, West is West, the twain shall never meet. “The more he tries to
understand his son, the more he is mystified. Mali whose mind is fresh with
American memories, finds everything backward and awkward in his country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Slowly
“Bhagavadgita” comes to its original place with a sort of revenge. Evidently,
it indicates the agitated mind of Jagan. Throughout the novel Mr. Narayan uses
the two symbols–“Bhagavadgita” and the Charkha which are prescribed by Gandhiji
for any deep agitation of the mind. One day, Jagan comes into contact with a
hairdyer-cum-sculptor. He takes him to a secluded place where his master carved
figures. He shows the image of a Goddess and needs the help of Jagan in order
to instal the image. He also requests Jagan to purchase the garden where he can
spend the last days in meditation and tranquillity. It is a reposeful memory
for lagan and the man has revealed a thrilling vision. Jagan does not come to
any conclusion as he is not yet ripe for retreat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

comes to know that Mali did not really marry Grace. He wants to send her back
as his project has completely failed. Jagan is completely at sea and he is
unable to enter his own house as it is tainted and polluted by the presence of
an unmarried couple. Even though his grandfather’s brother practised lechery,
it was of a different kind. “I can’t understand how two young persons can live
together like this without being married.” He finds himself torn between his
love for his son and his love for the cherished and embalmed notions of
marriage and morals, his hatred for disorder and loose living and his love for
order, simple living and high thinking. Finally, he gets rid of the
entanglement. He wants to retire from the new world which has no reverence for
the old traditions. He comes out of his house with a little bundle of clothes and
Charkha. He is sixty and in a “new Janma.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the way he comes to know that his son is imprisoned as a small bottle of liquor
is found in his car. After the initial shocks, Jagan has attained extraordinary
clarity. He is least perturbed by the news. He tells his cousin that truth
ultimately will win and a dose of prison life is not a bad thing. He hands over
the keys of his shop to his cousin which will ultimately reach his son. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Jagan’s
final escape from the galling chains of paternal love comes as an unexpected
twist” and it is a supreme sacrifice in the case of Jagan. But it is in the
true Indian tradition requiring renunciation at some stage. A person becomes a
Sanyasi when he gets rid of the earthly attachments. Jagan’s entire love
(including his love for wealth) is concentrated on Mali. When once he comes out
of it, he becomes a Sanyasi. “It is tinged with the appealing human flaw. He
does not forget to take his cheque book.” This is characteristic of Mr.
Narayan’s sensibility. Perhaps he wants to indicate that one may get rid of
anything but not money. He wants to point out that human beings after all are
human beings and not gods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Narayan’s greatness lies not in making Jagan renounce the world but in bringing
this change in various degrees and making it plausible. “Jagan has to renounce
three areas–Malgudi and its surroundings where he spent his life; his sweet
shop, a world of confectioneries where he is doing a set of repetitions for
sixty years; and above all his only son Mali.” After the initial shocks he
attains spiritual enlightenment and realises that he has come to a point at
which all struggle and all the comedy of friction are irrelevant. The
conclusion of Mr. Narayan’s novel “The English Teacher” is realised by Jagan at
the end. “Wife, children, parents, brother, friends–we come together only to go
apart again. It is one continuous movement. They move away from us as we move
away from them. The law of life cannot be avoided. The law comes into operation
the moment we detach ourselves from our mother’s womb. All struggle and misery
in life are due to our attempt to arrest this law or get away from it or in
allowing ourselves to be hurt by it. The fact must be recognised. A profound
unmitigated loneliness is the only truth of life. All else is false.” This
profound philosophy (perhaps Mr. Narayan’s own outlook on life) is realised by
Jagan fully. He makes a retreat to assist an image maker in making images for
others to worship. He feels that his life is complete and there is an inward
urge to retreat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps,
Mr. Narayan wants to point out the necessity of preserving the rich traditions
and moral values. Jagan’s love for “Bhagavadgita” and the ancient traditions is
so great that he does not hesitate to sacrifice his paternal love. When Dharma
is at stake, one should not hesitate to sacrifice everything and </span><span

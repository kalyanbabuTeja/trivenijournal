style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
event in recent history has made statesmen and leaders in the international
world bestow such deep thought on the serious predicament in which humanity
finds itself today as a result of the growth of meaningless fanaticism as the
assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of peace and non-violence.
Universal tributes have been paid to his work as a teacher of mankind for
nearly fifty years. He conveyed the message that what matters in man is his
essential humanity and not the colour of his skin, the race to which he
belongs, the creed which he professes or his economic status in society. It is
because this simple but eternal truth is forgotten that bitterness and hatred
prevail between nation and nation, religion and religion, race and race, class
and class, leading to the prostitution of man’s ever-growing knowledge, not to
constructive effort but to the devising of more and terrible instruments of
destruction and devastation and the plunging of the world into all the horrors
of modern warfare. The greatness of Mahatma Gandhi consisted in this, that he
not only preached the gospel of non-violence but practised it every moment of
his life and in all that he spoke or did. Who could have dreamt that an
embodiment of universal kindness and child-like simplicity like him would have
an enemy bent upon taking his life? But the thing has happened, revealing once
again that the beast in man is ever active, that culture and civilisation have
only produced a superficial effect on him, and that the disparity between what
man can become if he truly disciplines himself and what he is actually under
the influence of his untamed passions is still as wide as ever. Let us hope
that the martyrdom of this Prince of Peace will do something to awaken the
higher self in man and enable the world to march at least a short distance on
the road of universal brotherhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
realisation however of such a hope requires a change of heart and outlook on
the part of those who are at the helm of affairs in the leading countries of
the world, especially countries like the United States, the U.S.S.R. and
Britain. Events are not pointing to such a change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Britain
has now aligned herself definitely against Soviet Russia. This has been made
clear by Premier Attlee’s broadcast on January 3rd, Mr. Herbert Morrison’s
speech a week later, and the House of Commons’ debate on the statement of
foreign policy made by Mr. Bevin in the last week of the month. In his
broadcast Premier Attlee charged Russia with pursuing a policy which threatened
the other nations of Europe with a new form of imperialism–ideological,
economic and strategic. He frankly stated that in Russia and the satellite
countries of Eastern Europe the voice of criticism is silenced, that only one
view is allowed, and that it is ironical that the absolutists, who suppress
opposition much more vigorously than the kings and the emperors of the past,
masquerade under the name of upholders of democracy. Mr. Morrison not only
repeated these views but also repeated them in much stronger language. He said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“There
is nothing we should like better than co-operation with the Soviet Union for
protecting peace and promoting the social well-being of mankind. But we cannot
be expected at all times to lie down to untruthful and malicious attacks upon
our country and our Government by the reckless propaganda machines of the
Russian Communists and of the Communist Parties of the world which conduct
themselves as the servile automatic outposts of the Soviet Foreign Office. We
cannot be expected to be happy when country after country in Eastern and
South-Eastern Europe find themselves subject to undemocratic and
unrepresentative Communist governments, coupled with the suppression of other
political parties and freedom of the press, wholesale witch-hunting and even
the very judicial execution of non-Communist political leaders…..And it adds to
our sorrow and indignation that this process should so untruthfully and
noiselessly be proclaimed as promoting Democracy and anti-Fascism.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Bevin accused Russia of playing power politics and imperialist expansionism,
not merely in Eastern but also in Western Europe, and stated that “if the
policy is pursued of trying to dominate Europe by whatever means, indirect or
direct, we are driven to the conclusion that it will inevitably lead again to
another world war”. For him the question was what precautions should be taken
to avert such a war and to obtain victory if, in spite of all efforts, a war
were to become inevitable. It is in this context that his constructive
proposals assume special significance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
proposals fall roughly into two categories. The more important of them is the
formation of a West European Union as a counterpoise to the Soviet-dominated
Eastern Europe. This is to consist of all the democratic countries of Western
Europe–England, France, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Scandinavian
States–who have common political and cultural traditions of their own,
distinguishing them from the countries of the East. It may be an economic and
commercial union to start with, but should develop into a political one in due
course. Italy should also be invited to join it. The second proposal of Mr.
Bevin was that the West European States which happen to possess colonies should
take special steps to exploit them, so that they might supply to their
metropolitan countries a larger quantity of raw materials, food and other
products of which they have in plenty. This, according to him, is the only way
by which the West European Union would be in a position equal in economic
strength to the United States and U.S.S.R. which have tremendous internal
resources of their own. In addition to these he made it clear that Britain
would make special efforts to build up a system of co-operation in economic and
other fields in the Middle East which would carry with it responsibilities for
mutual defence on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>both sides. The
revised treaty with Iraq, the proposal to revise the treaty with Transjordan
and to commence negotiations afresh with Egypt on the revision of the
Anglo-Egyptian treaty, are parts of the new policy to be adopted in the Middle
East. By these means the British hope to arrest the further growth of Soviet
Imperialism in Europe as well as in Western Asia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the whole Mr. Bevin’s call for greater consolidation of Western Europe has been
welcomed in all political circles in West European countries and the United
States, although the Communist Parties have bitterly attacked it on the ground
that it would make impossible any rapprochement between U.S.S.R. and the
Western democracies. It is quite possible that the cleavage between the East
and the West might become widened if a West European Union is formed. But the
question which one should ask oneself in this connection is whether Britain and
the Western democracies have any other alternative in the face of the
ideologies and the practical policies of Soviet Russia. One should not forget
in this connection that the Soviets believe–it is a part of their Marxian
creed–that they should do their utmost to bring about a world communistic
revolution, that until it is brought about there is no prospect of Communism
becoming permanently established in U.S.S.R., that Communism in one country can
never be a success and that the Socialism for which the British Labour Party
and similar Socialist Parties in the West European States stand is no Socialism
at all. It is also a part of their creed that monopoly capitalism which is at
the root of British and American prosperity is inevitably bound to collapse,
that the boom which America is now enjoying will be followed by depression and
that all this will pave the way for Communism and the dictatorship of the
proletariat in the Western world also, and that in consequence there is no need
to enter into any kind of friendly alliance or co-operation with capitalistic
States, and that all attention should be concentrated on opposing them
everywhere, creating difficulties at home as well as abroad, so that their
disruption and disintegration may be brought about at a much quicker pace.
There is of course another explanation of this policy of persistent opposition
and obstruction pursued by the Soviet representatives in almost all
international conferences. It is that they are anxious to get the support of
their own peoples for the domestic policies they are pursuing–policies which
have resulted in a scarcity of consumer’s goods even of an essential character
and the concentration of disproportionate effort on the production of capital
goods and goods needed for purposes of war–and that such support would be
forthcoming only when they are made to believe that the West is determined on
making war on Russia and destroy the new classless civilisation which the
Communists are trying to build there. Whatever it be, the enunciation of a new
clear-cut foreign policy by the British has set a final seal to Britain’s
preference for open separation from Russia and her alliance with the United
States. One remarkable feature of the debate in the House of Commons was that
the large majority of the Labour back-benchers, who in the past were vociferous
in attacking Mr. Bevin for his anti-Soviet attitude, not only refrained from
opposing him during the debate but also welcomed the new policy outlined by
him. And among those that welcomed it was Mr. Richard Crossman, one of the most
persistent of Mr. Bevin’s former critics. The view is now gaining ground that
the Soviet would not care to adopt a policy of conciliation so long as it feels
that its opponents–Britain, France, etc.,–are weak, that these States cannot
become strong unless they come closer together, and that the proposed unity
among the Western nations is the safest road to peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile
the United States is proceeding with her measures to prevent the worsening of
the economic situation in Western Europe and driving the peoples there into the
fold of Communism and Soviet influence. The State Department gave full details
of the various kinds of commodities–grain, coal, steel, machinery, petroleum,
etc.,–that it proposes to supply to each of the sixteen countries which are to
receive aid under the Marshall Plan during the next four years. This gives to
the whole Plan a more concrete form than it possessed so far. In addition to
this, both Mr. Marshall and President Truman conveyed to Congress the opinion
strongly held by them that if the Aid Plan did not get through Congress, or if
it failed for any other reason, the country’s security would be threatened and
that the people of the United States would in effect have to live in an armed
camp and that the programme should therefore be put through at all costs, even
though there was the avowed determination of the Soviet Union and the Communist
Party to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sabotage it at every turn. The intimate connection
between European </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>recovery and the maintenance of peace in the
world was forcibly brought out by Mr. Marshall when he observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“So
long as hunger, poverty, desperation and the resulting chaos threaten great
concentrations of people in Western Europe–some 270 millions–there will be
steadily developing social unease and political confusion on every side. Left
to their own resources, there will be no escape from economic distress so
intense, social discontents so violent and political confusion so widespread
that the historic base of Western civilisation will take on a new form in the
image of the tyranny that we fought to destroy in Germany. The vacuum which was
created in Western Europe will be filled by forces of which wars are made.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
is the connection between the Marshall Plan and Mr. Bevin’s Plan for a West
European Union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Efforts
are also being made in the United States to avert the trade depression which is
regarded by the Soviet ideologists as inevitable. In the message which
President Truman sent to Congress, he called for the enactment of an
anti-inflationary programme which would include price and wage controls and
rationing powers. He stressed the need for maintaining maximum employment,
achieve maximum production and adjust the price-income structure so as to stop
the inflationary spiral. It was with the same objective that he proposed a
large increase in corporation profits taxes. It may be noted in this connection
that the budget proposals made by the President for 1948-49 provide for a very
large expenditure on Defence Services. Out of the total budget of 139,700
million dollars, as much as 11,000 million dollars, or 28 per cent, is to be
set apart for Defence which includes construction of aircraft, naval ships and
other improved types of vessels, and work on Atomic energy. This is how the
United States wants to combat Communism and Soviet domination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
necessary item in the economic recovery of Europe is the settlement of the
German problem. Now that all hope of United Germany has been abandoned, the
British and the Americans have agreed on proceeding with their programme of
work in their respective zones. One significant development in this connection
is specially to be noted. Of course it is a logical development of the fusion
of the British and American zones that had already taken place and the
willingness of the United States to take over from the British most of the
costs of occupation. It consists in the reorganisation of the German Economic
Council at Frankfurt, which is virtually the capital of Western Germany at
present. This is purely a German body. In future it is to consist of two
Houses–a Lower one having 104 members appointed by the State Parliaments in the
British and American zones, and the Upper one having two members from each of
the States, nominated by their governments. Besides this there is to be an
Executive Council or Cabinet with a chairman and six departmental heads
controlling economics, food and agriculture, transport, finance,
communications, and civil service. For the settlement of disputes between this
Central Economic Council and the States, there is to be a High Court of nine
members established by the Allied military authorities. Two points require
attention in this respect. One is that this Council may be a step towards the
creation of a common political institution, however loosely organised it may
be, for the whole of Western Germany and for the association of Germans
themselves in the administration of their country, though subject to Allied control.
The other is that no economic reconstruction of Europe can be thought of unless
the vast mineral and industrial resources of the Ruhr region are once again
developed, The chances of such development seem to be brighter, as there is to
be shortly a conference of the American, the British and also the French
governments to settle the question of Western Germany. In the reconstitution of
the Economic Council the French were not consulted and they were naturally
dissatisfied. Now things have a chance of taking a brighter turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One would not expect Soviet Russia or her satellites
in Eastern Europe to remain indifferent to these developments in Britain, the
United States and Western Europe. The help which they have been rendering to
the Communist guerillas in Greece is now on the increase. Although their
stronghold in the West–Konitza–was captured by governmental forces, it is now
felt that a long campaign would be necessary before they are completely
suppressed and that such a campaign would not be possible unless with the
active help of the American army and navy. The American fleet has therefore
entered the Mediterranean for this purpose. There is however the danger that
the guerilla government might be recognised as the legitimate government in
Greece by the neighbouring Communist States. In such a case, supplying arms to
them would be perfectly legal under international law, and the Soviet might
bring about such a situation. Another development is the completion as it were
of the process of creating a sort of Balkan Union through pacts and treaties
which have been shaping for several months. A document revealing a ‘Soviet
Plot’ for fomenting strike action in the Ruhr to break the Marshall Plan has
been published, although there is some doubt regarding its authenticity. But,
as a matter of fact, serious strikes broke out in the British occupied zone,
perhaps due to insufficient food rations although they did not continue for
long. It is quite possible that tactics like these might be resorted to on a
much more extensive scale in future. There is also a move to create a separate
German Government for the Soviet zone of Eastern Germany with Berlin as the
capital, and a German Government at Berlin is sure to carry more prestige than
the one at Frankfurt. It is however more in the propaganda front that the
Soviet is active as usual.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
situation in the Middle East is becoming more disturbed. In almost every
country in that area there are pro-British and anti-British sections. The
latter have been active in Iraq for some days. The present tension is due to
the dissatisfaction felt by the younger and the more radical group of people in
the country with the new treaty recently concluded with Britain. Under the old
treaty of 1930 the British were permitted to station their forces in Iraq, to
have two vital air-bases in it and it also enjoined on the Iraq Government
that, in all defensive measures, it should act in concert with the British
Government. It was to remove these clauses, and have a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>treaty
which would recognise the independent and equal sovereignty of Iraq, that
revision was demanded. In view of the growing tension in Palestine the people
of Iraq wanted to be free to adopt any military measures they thought
desirable, without British interference. But the revised treaty did not come up
to these expectations. The modifications were not of a substantial character.
British troops would continue to be there. They will still have air-bases. A
Joint Defence Board is set up. It is unnatural to expect that with her oil and
strategic interests in the Middle East and with the growing pressure of Soviet
Russia in that area, Britain would agree to give up the military facilities she
now possesses. There was a change of Cabinet in Baghdad but the situation has
not been eased. There has also been a deterioration in the situation in
Palestine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>GENUINE regret was expressed by leading Indians, in
or out of politics, at the departure of Lord Louis Mountbatten after laying
down the high office of Governor-General of free India. During his term of
office, India passed through cataclysmic changes unequalled since the first
fight for Independence in 1857. This scion of a medieval German feudal house,
kinsman of the King of England, and an Admiral by profession, played, a
distinguished role in effecting the transfer of power from British to Indian
hands. Faced with problems of great magnitude and complexity, he brought to
bear on them a detached outlook and a will to get things done without undue
loss of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To blame him for the partition of India, as several
have done, is hardly fair to one whose tremendous sincerity is as patent as his
power of initiative. That partition was inevitable became clear to the Congress
chiefs soon after Lord Wavell admitted Muslim-Leaguers into the interim
Government by the back door as it were, and confronted the country with a
virtual choice between civil war and partition. There was Pakistan in action in
the Central Cabinet at New Delhi; all governmental activity was paralysed by
the cleavage between the League and non-League elements; all problems of
national reconstruction had to be shelved till this perpetual deadlock was
resolved. The only question before the Congress section of the Cabinet and the
Congress High Command was as to the extent of territory and population that
could be salvaged at the last moment. And they were content to salvage the
whole of Assam, West Bengal with the city of Calcutta, and Eastern Punjab.
Mountbatten did not create the situation; his predecessor had done it with the
backing of the reactionary elements in British politics. Mountbatten’s quick
eye seized the fundamentals of the situation, and he evolved a formula not
wholly acceptable to either party, but which both were prepared to accept as an
alternative to domestic commotion. To charge Mountbatten with having hustled
the parties and forced the pace of events is to miss the meaning of the various
factors in a quickly changing scene. It is very brave of people to proclaim
that even civil war was preferable to partition, and that bloodshed and
distress were not, in fact, avoided by the partition. The truth is that while
civil war was certainty, it was not so clear–nay, it could not be imagined–that
in the wake of partition streams of blood would flow and vast masses of
humanity uprooted from hearth and home. Even Gandhiji, whose opposition to any
scheme of partition was pronounced, gave way towards the end, and advised
acceptance of the Mountbatten settlement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>All this might look like a post-mortem examination,
but a dispassionate survey of events in retrospect is the only way of arriving
at a correct judgment, when a British statesman of the front rank, who sought
to befriend India, is accused of having forced a partition of India and brought
on us the many disasters that followed the partition. That Mountbatten led
Nehru into making a reference to the U.N.O. on the Kashmir issue, or that he
deliberately prolonged the negotiations with Hyderabad, might form the subject
of cheap gibes, but those indulging in them forget that Nehru and Patel who
hold all power in their hands are not likely to have been wheedled into courses
of action contrary to their judgment. Such allegations are not complimentary to
the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, nor do they indicate a
correct appraisal of the constitutional position of a governor-general of India
after the 15th of August 1947. In any event, no final judgment is possible
until more light is thrown on what happened behind the scenes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His Excellency Sri C. Rajagopalachariar, Lord
Mountbatten’s successor in the Governor-Generalship of the Indian Union, has to
face the problems of Hyderabad and Kashmir and solve them in collaboration with
the Cabinet. During the hectic days when Mir Laik Ali kept flying between
Hyderabad and Delhi, there were persistent rumors that Lord Mountbatten was
anxious to round off his career in India by arriving at a settlement with the
Nizam. But the Nizam, it was said, was playing for time; he hoped that C. R.
would use his influence to secure better terms for His Exalted Highness! Both
Razvi and the Nizam have complimented the new governor-general on his love of
peace and justice, hoping obviously to improve the prospects of an
‘independent’ Hyderabad, free to pursue its mad career of autocracy and
oppression of the vast majority of the citizens. But the Nizam who ignored the
friendly admonition of Mountbatten, even at the eleventh hour, is not likely to
find favour in the eyes of his successor. The blunt truth is that further
negotiations between Hyderabad and India are ruled out. Very soon, the Nizam
will find that he has no friends left in Delhi or London. Mr. Jinnah is
certainly a factor to be considered, but he will help the Nizam not with men
and arms but with thundering statements, which can cow down nobody. Meanwhile,
the economic blockade of Hyderabad is being intensified, and we may be sure
that the Government of India will not hesitate to take further drastic steps,
including military action, to maintain peace and orderly administration in the
Deccan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Equally pressing is the situation created by the
visit of the U.N.O. Commission on Kashmir. India refused to accept the terms of
the revolution of the Security Council, particularly those relating to the
curtailment of Sheik Abdullah’s powers and the conditions under which a
plebiscite should be held. The U.N.O. has not called upon Pakistan to withdraw
its support to the raiders, though the Council tacitly admitted that such help
was being rendered. Thus the primary objective of the Government of India in
making the reference was not secured, while irrelevant issues gained
prominence. India is under no obligation to co-operate with the Commission when
the latter seeks to implement a resolution which India has not accepted. The
preliminary meeting at New Delhi will reveal the shape of events. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In Kashmir, as in Hyderabad, India can decide to
take action in accordance with her considered view of the situation. She need
not be deflected from her resolve to treat Kashmir as a State that acceded to
the Indian Union. A plebiscite has always been kept in view; but no plebiscite
can be held till the last of the raiders has been driven out and Pakistan’s
complicity in the unofficial invasion of Kashmir is proclaimed and atoned for.
C. R.’s statesmanship will be judged by the way he handles the Kashmir and
Hyderabad issues. That will be his first great achievement at New Delhi. A
skilful negotiator, he is also known to take swift decisions. In the course of
the fateful talks between Gandhiji and Mr. Jinnah at Bombay, it was he who
finally prevailed upon Gandhiji to break off the negotiations. He, like all
Gandhians, prefers the path of peace. But he is not enamoured of peace at any
price. C.R., Nehru, and Patel form the Indian Triumvirate in India’s hour of
destiny. They may be trusted to guide India aright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A three-man Commission, assisted by representatives
of different linguistic units, will go into the question of forming linguistic
Provinces in Southern and Western India. According to the terms of reference,
the Commission will also indicate, roughly, the boundaries of the new
Provinces, leaving it to yet another Commission to demarcate them with greater
precision. Evidence has to be presented to the Commission about the feasibility
of the re-distribution of Provinces and the financial and other implications of
such redistribution. But what is occupying the minds of some people is not the
preparation of their own brief, but the method of forestalling other people’s
claims to areas like the city of Madras. A minor crisis was precipitated the
other day by the Education Minister’s naive declaration that the ‘regional’
language of the city was Tamil. His Andhra colleagues on the Cabinet raised a
protest and one of them announced that the Education Minister had merely
expressed his personal view and that the Cabinet was not bound by it. The Tamil
Congress leaders have duly reiterated their undying faith that Madras City is
the exclusive property of the Tamils, while Andhra Congressmen like Dr.
Pattabhi Sitaramayya plead for its retention as a common, multi-lingual area
with an independent administration. All these views can very properly be
pressed before the Commission or Commissions dealing with the question. There
is no need to create bad blood by premature wrangling. The Commission can only
carve out Provinces; it is not setting up independent sovereign States. And
wherever the lot of a citizen of the Indian Union may be cast, certain
fundamental rights regarding language and culture will be assured to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Tamilnad, Vijayawada or Masulipatam in Andhra, Poona in Maharashtra, and
Ahmedabad in Gujerat. The distinctive culture and traditions of a people must
grow at such centers, while the cities of Greater Bombay and Greater Madras
will reflect the composite culture of the various groups which built up these
cities during the last few centuries. Such groups can claim the city as their
subsidiary homeland, away from the primary homelands which will emerge under
the new Constitution of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Government of India have planned to train
teachers of art and artistic handicrafts at Santiniketan. The first batch,
consisting of advanced students from all over India, is about to take the
course under the general supervision of a master-artist like Sri Nandalal Bose.
When Rabindranath Tagore started his institution, education in the fine arts
was an integral part of his scheme; it was to be the richest expression of his
dream of a renascent India. Several of the artists in the different Provinces
and States of India are ‘old boys’ of the Kalabhavan in Santiniketan. They look
back with joy to the days spent in those sylvan surroundings. The first
National Government of India have done well in choosing that hallowed spot for
inaugurating what promises to be a new era in Indian art. Provincial and State
Governments which have deputed students for training will, it is hoped, start
art-centers of their own in suitable places. Thus, from Santiniketan will ray
out the message of art to the remotest corners of the land.</p>

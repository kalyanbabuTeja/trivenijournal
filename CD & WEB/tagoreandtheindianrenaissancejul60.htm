cannot be anyone’s “aim” to “perpetuate” the memory of Rabindranath Tagore!
For, we are but little men to presume to perpetuate so great a man’s memory.
His writings, the memory of his life, <span class=SpellE>Visvabharati</span>,
the great institution that he created–these perpetuate Tagore’s memory as
nothing else can. But there is one thing that we can do; there is one thing we
ought to do. We can read Rabindranath’s works–such of them, at least, as are
easily accessible in English or in our own regional languages–and we shall then
feel thankful that, although ours has been in many ways a <span class=SpellE>chequered</span>
history, although the cup of our discontent has filled to the brim, and perhaps
spilled over even, the Time Spirit has nevertheless thrown up a few great men
during the last 150 years, men of outstanding ability and striking personality,
who have given new life to us, shown new directions of national evolution, and
brought new hopes and visions to sustain us in our trials, and inspire us in
our undertakings. It is our racial habit to call such men <span class=SpellE><i>Rishis</i></span><i>,
</i>and among the <span class=SpellE><i>Rishis</i></span><i> </i>of the recent
past none stands higher than Rabindranath Tagore. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the years pass, we are apt to view Tagore as a figure of dim vast proportions,
lost in the mists of legend. It is necessary to remember that he was no legend,
but a real human being; that, for instance, he once visited the Andhra
University campus to deliver two lectures under the Alladi Krishnaswami <span
class=SpellE>Ayyar</span> foundation; that the poet, playwright, novelist,
patriot, prophet, did not exhaust the man. He was more than the sum of his
achievements, and still the only Rabindranath, light-giver, life-giver, to
those who were close to him and dear to him. We shall do him no justice if we
treated him as an institution and as a legend, ignoring the fact that this
evangelist of the Religion of Man was himself an arch-individualist, a
trembling human being in all that he thought, felt, said and did. Let us raise
the cry, <i>“Ecce Homo! </i>Behold the Man!” before we salute the <span

Leonardo <span class=SpellE>da</span> Vinci of the Indian Renaissance’: so
Professor D.S. Sarma has called Rabindranath. The description is apt: Tagore’s
was as many-sided an achievement as Leonardo’s had been, and quite as rich, in
fact richer. When after an icy season of blight and sterility, when at the end
of the winter of our frustration and discomfiture, new life bursts upon us, at
last, many are the sights we see, varied are the thrills we experience–there
are the new sticky leaves, the ants return, the birds return, the ice-capped
Himalayas send <span class=SpellE>freshes</span> to the rivers in the plains,
hope returns, gaiety returns, life returns. In a nation’s history, new life
means awakening in all the <span class=GramE>divers</span> fields of life: in
politics, economics and industry, in ethics, philosophy and religion, in art,
education and social life. The whole aspect of life seems to change. It is the
same country, the same people–yet everything is different. See the paddy fields
before and after the monsoon: at one moment the stubble, at another the rich
sheet of green. So it is with a nation’s cycles of blight and renewal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rounded <span class=SpellE>fulness</span> and splendour of ancient Indian
culture may be inferred by us even at this distance of time. The elements that
make for a full and free life were there in ample measure. Vitality, first of
all: a great zest for life, a zest that knew no inhibitions, no timid
exclusions. Second, an intellectual <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>, keen and
constructive: analytical, no doubt, but not allergic to the processes of
integration. And, third, a high spiritual awareness, mediating between the two,
and making the most of them. Life, mind, spirit, a trinity of powers that made
possible the great ancient Indian civilisation–the art and the literature, the
forms of social and political organisation, the systems of philosophy and the
codes of law and ethics. In course of time, de set in, and this civilisation
stagnated. The power and the glory receded, the decline began, <span
class=GramE>the</span> fall seemed to be imminent. Invader after invader came:
Islam came, and remained; the Cross came, and remained; the foreign soldier and
the rapacious trader came, they remained, <span class=SpellE>quarrelled</span>
among themselves, and gave a vicious violent twist to the nation’s life. Ruin
and confusion reigned in the country. Vitality weakened; there was, as it were,
a flight from life; intellect weakened and worked for the wrong ends; and
spiritual awareness ceased or slumbered. In 1757, the Battle of <span
class=SpellE>Plassey</span> was fought, and during the next fifty years we saw
the veritable nadir our fortunes. It was mid-winter. <span class=GramE>Famine,
disorder, corruption, moral apathy, were</span> the outward manifestations of
the hell that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had become, and, in the Miltonic phrase, “refuge none was found.” Such, at any
rate, was the general picture. But, all the same, there <span class=GramE>were
not wanting</span> pockets of sanity, vitality, even spirituality, that managed
somehow to survive this invasion of hell. For example, was during this dark <span
class=SpellE>dark</span> period of our history that, in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place>, Saint <span class=SpellE>Tyagaraja</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Muthuswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Diksbitar</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Syama</span> Sastri took <span class=SpellE>Katnatak</span> music
to great heights, and turned their <span class=SpellE><i>bhakti</i></span><i> </i>into
imperishable song. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Western impact–by which we mean, not merely the
political action but also the coming of Western culture and the religion of
Christianity–made both for confusion and the possibility of new creation. The
advancing shield of the West indicated the holiness of Christ on one side, and
the power of the Machine on the other. The missionary and the soldier were thus
the two arms of the conquest of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by the West, though the actual beneficiary was only the trader. Was it
surprising that many Indians thought in the first flush that, if <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> was to
survive in the competitive modern world, it was necessary not only to adopt
Western knowledge and technology but also to accept the religion of the West? <i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet,
the Western impact, when the first shock was over, proved beneficial in many
ways. It put an end to the old apathy. It quickened the impulse to creation. It
introduced the critical spirit. It brought to our notice new forms of
literature, new forms of social and political organisation, and challenged us
to attempt readjustment and live, or to remain stubborn and perish. The battle
of the Indian renaissance was won (it was a long struggle, though) when we
decided to readjust and live. A vigorous cross-<span class=SpellE>fertilisation</span>,
a purposive <span class=SpellE>transvaluation</span> of values, was called for:
and it was forthcoming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
history of modern India may be said to begin with Raja <span class=SpellE>Rammohun</span>
Roy, for he was, in very truth, our great pathfinder, an idealist coupled with
a shrewd man of affairs, a visionary and a builder who really deserved the
title of ‘Father of Modern India’. <span class=SpellE>Rammohun</span> was a
self-made man, with a purpose in his life and an unfaltering sense of
direction. While still young, he left the East India Company’s service, and
chose to be a servant of the nation. He then carried his mission to England,
made the appropriate contacts, and moved the powers that be to do the right
thing by India. Whether in India or in England, he was restlessly active, and
there was not a department of life–religion, social reform, education,
journalism, public administration, legislation–which did not receive the
beneficial impact of his personality. He was no unbeliever but a devout Hindu,
yet his Hinduism went back to the pristine purity of the Vedas, leaping over
the unhealthy encrustations of the intervening centuries. He was a sturdy
nationalist, but he also wisely saw that it was not in obscurantism, but in the
assimilation of Western knowledge and techniques, that our progress would lie.
He even pleaded for “settlement in India by Europeans” and recommended that
“educated men of character and capital should now be permitted and encouraged
to settle in India.” The qualifications are masterly: not <i>any </i>Englishmen,
but <i>educated </i>Englishmen of <i>character </i>and <i>capital! </i>The
plight of the Indian widows, the darkness of superstition, the miasma of
ignorance, the general backwardness of the country, all stirred him to action:
and writing and speaking–whether in Bengali or in English–was to him a form of
action. By 1823 he had fully matured, sharpened his dialectical instruments,
tested his friends, and re-thought his ends and means. Some disillusion he had
no doubt experienced during his ‘experiments with truth’ (in the Gandhian
phrase), but it had also given a new dimension to his experience, and a
mellowness to his intelligence. Being a staunch advocate of English education,
he asked Lord Amherst to consider the India of his day as being similar to the
Europe before the time of Lord Bacon, and begged that the funds set apart for
education might be usefully spent “by employing a few gentlemen of talent and
learning educated in Europe and providing a college furnished with the
necessary books, instruments and other apparatus”. Again, the qualifications
are masterly: there is the emphasis on the right teaching personnel, on books,
on instruments “and other apparatus”. If, twelve years later, in 1835, Lord
William <span class=SpellE>Bentinck</span> resolved to employ the funds available
for education on English education alone, the credit goes both to <span
class=SpellE>Rammohun</span> Roy’s vision and persistence and <span
class=SpellE>Macaulay’s</span> emphasis and determination. For the rest, <span
class=SpellE>Rammohun</span> was an intensely religious man, and he felt that
quintessential Hinduism was of a piece with quintessential Christianity or
Islam. He looked under the bewildering edifices of dogma, ritual, and
philosophical dialectics, and sought the foundations of the great faiths, which
seemed to him identical, and on these he wished to raise his Brahma <span
class=SpellE>Samaj</span>, rather as Akbar had done in his day in his own way.
As <span class=SpellE>Mahadev</span> <span class=SpellE>Govind</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ranade</span> has pointed out, <span class=SpellE>Rammohun</span>
“aspired only to establish harmony between men’s accepted faith and their
practical observances by a strict <span class=SpellE>monolatrous</span> worship
of the One Supreme Soul, a worship of the heart and not of the hands, a
sacrifice of self and not of the possessions of the self”. Humanity was no mass
that he viewed in the abstract, but a collection of individuals, each of whom
mattered as a unique piece of trembling humanity. Hence the war he waged
against the monstrous custom of <i>sati, </i>and hence too his anxious regard
for the rights of women and the rights of the depressed of all kinds. By
precept, and by example, he advanced the causes he held dear all along the
front, and in him the renaissance in India found its first prophet, the first
of our latter-day </span><span class=SpellE><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Prince <span class=SpellE>Dwaraknath</span> Tagore and his son Maharshi <span
class=SpellE>Debendranath</span> Tagore. <span class=SpellE>Dwaraknath</span>,
the poet’s grandfather, was an intrepid and royal figure. Max Muller tells us
that <span class=SpellE>Dwaraknath</span>, when he visited Paris in 1844, gave
a grand party and “placed a shawl on the shoulders of each lady as she left the
room”; and, while in England, he erected, a tomb over the ashes of <span
class=SpellE>Rammohun</span> Roy at Bristol where he had died in 1833. <span
class=SpellE>Debendranath</span> was an <span class=SpellE>austerer</span>
figure, and he found that the enthusiasm for English and Western culture had
gone to the heads of many young men, the “<span class=SpellE>Derozio</span>
men” as they were called in Bengal, who were at once violently pro-British and
no less violently anti-Indian. They thought, in <span class=SpellE>Surendranath</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bannerjee’s</span> words, that “everything English was
good–even the drinking of brandy was a virtue; everything not English was to be
viewed with suspicion”. <span class=SpellE>Debendranath</span> wished to stem
the tide, and went from house to house, from morning till evening, entreating
Hindu parents not to send their children to missionary schools but only to
native schools. Presently, when in 1857 he met <span class=SpellE>Keshub</span>
<span class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Sen</span>, the Brahma <span
class=SpellE>Samaj</span> became a power once again. But <span class=SpellE>Keshub</span>
found himself more and more attracted to Christ and Christ’s Gospel, though he
always tried to give it a Hindu <span class=SpellE>colouring</span>, and this
in time brought about a split in the <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Keshub</span> <span class=SpellE>organising</span> his own Church
in 1866 and going his own way. <span class=SpellE>Keshub</span> too paid a
visit to England, and made a great impression upon people by the eloquence of
his preaching. Max Muller found him “perfectly tranquil even when most in
earnest”, and others have classed him, as an orator, with Gladstone and <span
class=SpellE>Gambetta</span>. Meantime, <span class=SpellE>Debendranath</span>
kept the Brahma <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span> going on conservative lines,
with Anand Mohan <span class=SpellE>Bose</span> and <span class=SpellE>Akshaya</span>
Kumar <span class=SpellE>Datta</span> as his principal lieutenants. In later
times, Rabindranath himself tried to close the ranks between the two wings of
the <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span>, but without much success. Judged by mere
numbers, neither the original Brahma <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span> nor either
of its sub-sects had what may be called an impressive following, but the
quality of the leadership they gave to Bengal and to India was most
distinguished in many walks of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
Bengal only, but other regions in India also were participating in this
ferment, this careering towards new horizons. In the Punjab, <span
class=SpellE>Dayananda</span> <span class=SpellE>Sarasvati</span> founded the <span
class=SpellE>Arya</span> <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span>. While the leaders of
the Brahma <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span> had tried in their different ways to
effect a marriage of India and the West, to build a bridge between Hindu
spirituality and Western thought, <span class=SpellE>Dayanand</span> wanted
only a return to Vedic simplicity, clarity and burning purity, and pleaded for
a determined elimination of the accumulated accretions of the ages. <span

guided as much by the prophets and saints of Maharashtra in their religious
life as by the speeches of Gladstone, Cobden, Bright, Clarkson and Wilberforce
in their political and social thought. In Madras, while the new education was
taking rapid strides, and a generation of eminent lawyers, jurists, and
administrators was coming up, the shifting of the Theosophical Society to <span
class=SpellE>Adyar</span> in 1878 had something of a national significance. If
the Brahma <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span> was an Indian attempt to link the
indigenous and Western springs of spirituality, the Theosophical Society was a
western attempt to drink deep in the springs of Eastern mystical thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

none of these movements–neither the Brahma <span class=SpellE>Samaj</span> nor
the Theosophical Society, neither the <span class=SpellE>Arya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Samaj</span> nor the <span class=SpellE>Prarthan</span> <span

initiated by intellectual gladiators like <span class=SpellE>Iswar</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Vidyasagar</span>–was a really
effective answer to the ‘challenge’ from the West. It was now that Ramakrishna <span
class=SpellE>Paramahamsa</span> occurred in Bengal, and people saw in this
“self-illumined ecstatic and mystic, without a single trace or touch of the
alien thought or education upon him,” a true embodiment of human unity through
god-realisation. When Ramakrishna pass away in 1886, his chief disciple, Swami
Vivekananda, established the Ramakrishna Mission, and in other ways also played
an intrepid St. Paul to the <span class=SpellE>Paramahamsa</span>. The obscured
soul of India had come out at last in a blaze of glory, and there was no danger
now that Indians would surrender wholly to the values of the West. We had still
to learn many things from the West–science, technology, organisation, the
critical temper, democracy–but all had to be built on the soul’s purity and
strength. Ramakrishna sent rain to our roots, and created conditions for growth
in terms of our own <span class=SpellE><i>svabhava</i></span><i> </i>and <span
class=SpellE><i>svadharma</i></span><i>. </i>The impulse from the West was not
to be withstood. As Gokhale remarked, “We could not remain outside this
influence even if we would. We would not so remain if we could.” While
purposively responding to the influence, it was also necessary that we should
not become rootless creatures. Sri Ramakrishna saved us from that fate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such,
in broad outline, was the course of the Indian renaissance in the 19th century:
Rabindranath was born on 6 May 1861, in Bengal, in the Tagore family. In other
words, he was by his very birth caught in the mid-current of the renaissance.
The youngest of the seven sons of Maharshi <span class=SpellE>Debendranath</span>,
affluence and aristocratic culture surrounded him, and as a boy he grew up
keenly alive and awake to the world of man and nature around him. He had no
regular schooling, nor did he go through the usual academic grind. He had,
however, profound regard for some of the Jesuit Fathers of St. Xavier’s,
Calcutta. Rabindranath’s forerunners in literature–Madhusudan Dutt, <span
class=SpellE>Iswar</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Bankim</span>–had given Bengali poetry, prose and fiction a great
start among the modern Indian languages. It was an atmosphere of expectancy,
and Rabindranath eagerly breathed this air of infinite possibility. At 15 or
earlier he had begun lisping in numbers, and by 1875 his first efforts in prose
and verse had begun to appear in print. He was drawn to the Bengali <span
class=SpellE>Vaishnava</span> singers, and indeed to Indian devotional poetry
in general. A visit to England followed. The English romantics–Keats, Shelley
and <span class=SpellE>Woidsworth</span>–and the great Victorians–Tennyson and
Browning–exercised a potent influence on him. He was absorbed in Shakespeare.
He read Sir Thomas Browne. Tagore was not a systematic or voracious reader,
but, like Shakespeare, although he read at random, he turned to capital use
what had come his way. He wrote lyrics with astonishing facility, and his
fecundity was amazing. He had written 7000 lines of verse before he was
eighteen, and the pace was maintained for the greater part of his life, and,
when he died on 7 August 1941, he left behind him about 300,000 lines of verse,
probably a world record! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was in 1883 that Tagore wrote his first play, later translated into English as <span
class=SpellE><i>Sanyasi</i></span><i>. </i>Henceforth, poems and plays,
stories, novels, and essays flowed unceasingly from his pen. For a time, during
the ‘Partition of Bengal’ agitation, Tagore was involved in politics, but then
he was too much of an individualist–too much of a humanist too–to be a
demagogue and to court the glare of political opinion and action. While the
nationalists were angry because he was not nationalist enough, Government was
secretly suspicious of his moves and aims. He was ill at ease, he often retired
to the peace of <span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span> and lost himself in
either the frenzy of literary creation or the tasks of creative education. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rabindranath was fifty, a commemoration meeting was held in Calcutta in January
1912, and it was clear that the Bengali race as a whole had risen to do homage
to their great poet. It was verily an overwhelming experience to him, and the
function almost left him prostrate for a time. As an escape from this
exhaustion, Tagore started translating into English some of his own Bengali
lyrics. Presently, while on his way to England, he returned to the translations
again and again, and when he landed in London he had quite a little collection
on hand. This bunch of prose renderings soon came to the knowledge of <span

phenomenal success of <i>Gitanjali </i>ensured the publication of other volumes

poems and plays appeared only in 1936. In the meantime, he had founded the <span

in 1920. To collect funds for it, he toured incessantly, and became a sort of
unofficial ambassador, visiting the countries of the East and West, and raising
India’s prestige everywhere. While not entangling himself in politics, he
maintained friendly relations with Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru. As the years
passed, he became more and more a legendary figure; in his flowing beard and
immaculate white robes, he looked rather like a <i>Rishi </i>of <span
class=SpellE>Upanishadic</span> times. He had a certain spiritual affinity with
Sri Aurobindo, and he lavished much love on Subhas <span class=SpellE>Bose</span>.
While standing aloof and detached, Tagore nevertheless kept close to the

politics, again, Tagore held a middle course. During the opening years of the
present century, the air was rent by conflicting cries. The old Congress,
wedded to <span class=SpellE>Moderatism</span>, recoiled from the new
Extremism, the extreme nationalism, the cult of the bomb, the movement of
boycott, the burning of foreign cloth. Tagore’s patriotism was the patriotism
of a humanist and a poet, not that of a fanatic nationalist. Humanist values
were more to him than power values, the ‘spirit of man’ more than the power and
the glory of the nation. He was suspicious of violent political action, and of
the passions unleashed by it, and there is a prophetic quality in his poem, <i>The
Child, </i>inspired by Gandhi’s march to <span class=SpellE>Dandi</span> to
launch Salt Satyagraha. Tagore felt, again and again, that, if we did not hold
human values as paramount, we would be surely degrading and ultimately

economics, too, Tagore differed both from the ‘<span class=SpellE>Charkha</span>
School’ and the impatient modernistic school: differed, that is to say, from
Gandhiji as well as Jawaharlal. Tagore pleaded, not for a bare life, nor for a
hectic luxurious life, but for a beautiful and full life. He did not share
Gandhi’s belief that the <span class=SpellE>Charkha</span> would prove an easy
solvent to our economic ills, and he also instinctively shrank from machinery
and gigantism. He saw man being more and more pitted against the machine,
humanity against ruthless power; and in his great play, <span class=SpellE><i>Mukta</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Dhara</span>, </i>he articulated, in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Satyavrata</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mukerjee’s</span> words, an “eloquent protest against the
onslaught of machinery on the ancient ramparts of man’s individual freedom.”

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> life-long interest in
education flowed mainly from his keen dissatisfaction with the lifeless <span
class=SpellE>commercialised</span> education of our time, and he strove to make
<span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span> and <span class=SpellE>Sriniketan</span>
the focal points of a new experiment in living, an integral experience in
creative education. <span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span> as a home for
retirement and meditation, as an Ashram for cultural and spiritual realisation,
owed its origin to <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> father, the Maharshi. But
the poet turned <span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span> the near-by <span
class=SpellE>Sriniketan</span> into educational <span class=SpellE>centres</span>
of unique potency. The cultures of the East were to be brought together, and a
living relationship was to be attempted between the West and the East. In other
words, the East was first to find its own soul, and then help the world to
transmute the seeming West-East dichotomy into transcendent unity, and so
establish a broad base for human <span class=SpellE>understading</span> and
action. Further, the cultural life was to be related to the life of the
community, and education was to include vocational training as well. Above all,
harmony was to be the keynote of all the activities in <span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Sriniketan</span>. When the school became a university
in 1920, an international team of dedicated scholars and artists began the
valiant attempt to enact the drama of human unity and humane understanding.

care at <span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span> was the integral view of
education that made art, literature, philosophy, religion, intellectual
discipline, vocational guidance and intimacy with Nature independent, each
receiving from, yet enriching, the others, and all contributing to the full and
harmonious efflorescence of the human personality. Art and literature were not
‘extras’ but had a vital role to play in human life. And life without
religion–in its quintessential <span class=SpellE>nectarean</span> sense–was
life without meaning, and was <span class=SpellE>savourless</span> like a dish
without salt. And so art and literature, at their most profound moments, became
God-conscious, became ‘religious’ in fact. When the human mind tried to grapple
with these relations, the filiations between life and art and literature and
religion, there resulted the systems of aesthetics, poetics, ethics and
philosophy. But man cannot live–cannot live long or live happily–without
religion, without something of a God consciousness. </p>

the urge is from the human to the divine, to seize life without fear, and to
temper it and transform it, to cross the gulf that seems to separate man from
God. Tagore used a familiar but wonderfully appropriate simile to describe this
spiritual adventure of discovery and <span class=SpellE>realisalion</span>. It
comes at the end of the lecture on ‘Man’ that he gave in the Andhra University:

student, after much effort and time, first learns the alphabet, then the
spelling, then the grammar; he wastes paper and ink scribbling incomplete and
meaningless sentences, he uses and discards much acquisition of materials; at
last when as poet he is able to write his first utterance, that very moment, in
that composition, all his inexpressible accumulations of words first find their
glimmer of a significance. In the great evolution of the Universe we have found
its first significance in a cell of life, then in an animal, then in man. From
the outer universe gradually we come to the inner realm and one by one the
gates of freedom are unbarred. When the screen is lifted on the appearance of
Man on earth, we realise the great and mysterious truth of relatedness, of the
supreme unity of all that is….We can only pray, let sorrow come if it has to
come, let there be death, let there be loss, but let man declare across all
space and time ‘I am He’.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tagore holds a central
place in the Indian renaissance. He joined it in its mid-career, re-defined its
aims, and consolidated its foundations. At a time when the East and West, the
Old and New, the claims of revelation-grounded religion and science-grounded
reason the pull of romantic or Dionysian adventure and exuberance and the
attraction of classical or Apollonian grace and poise,–when these seemed to
wrangle, taking extreme positions. Tagore came as a <span class=SpellE>harmoniser</span>,
and strove to build a durable bridge of understanding between man and nature,
man and machine, and man and god. Tagore not only spanned the ages of Indian
history with his harmonies, he also tried to annul the yawning divide of
culture, the antinomy between what Sir Charles Snow has called the two
cultures, the humanistic wisdom and the scientific knowledge. The
reconciliation, the fusion and the transcendence are to be attempted and <span
class=SpellE>realised</span>, not in a committee room or a psychological
laboratory, but rather in the heart and soul of man. Tagore had his trials, no
doubt: his moments of uncertainty and exasperation. He was no monster of
perfection, and he could not always write at the top of his form. But take him
all in all, he was a Titan force in life and letters, and his example gave us
Indians, gave all Asians in fact, self-respect and self-confidence, and showed
the way to self-mastery and self-realisation. Although no ascetic preaching a
flight from life, he cared not to think only of comfort, and he had no truck
with the weights and measures of the market-place. He returned his knighthood
when he felt that it but irked and burned him, he did not hesitate to differ
openly from Gandhiji when be launched his non-co-operation movement, or from
the Japanese poet, <span class=SpellE>Yone</span> Noguchi, when Japan entered
upon a career of <span class=SpellE>blazen</span> aggression. While he was thus
not afraid of contention, while he did not refrain from any necessary
expression of dissidence, his preference nevertheless was for a life of culture
and contemplation, for the creative tasks of peace and harmony. He tirelessly
pursued the ideal of Beauty, and Beauty was to him also Love, Truth, Goodness
and Power. In a poem like his <span class=SpellE><i>Urvashi</i></span>–surely,
one of the supremely beautiful poems in world literature–we are vouchsafed the
very vision of the Nymph, we see <span class=SpellE>Urvashi</span> bursting
into view, just as Aphrodite rose from the foam, swaying and mastering and
melting the beholders. In poem or play, or story or novel, in reminiscence or
exegesis, or exhortation or prophecy, Tagore is essentially an integrated force,
of a piece always, whether as a poet or as a prophet, and the total impact of
his many-sided personality is exciting as well as enduring. He is our Leonardo <span
class=SpellE>da</span> Vinci, without a doubt. He is more. He is <span

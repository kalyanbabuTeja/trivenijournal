style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Non-violence has been
defined as desistance from the “desire to harm, injure or kill.” It was one of
the most important ethical teachings of Lord Buddha as well as Lord <span
class=SpellE>Mahavira</span>. It was the principal teaching of Mahatma Gandhi.
Although not the principal one, it has always been one of the cardinal
principles of Hinduism. It is a part of the <span class=GramE>sermon</span> on
the Mount and Mohammed is also said to have taught it to his followers,
although in a restricted sense. In short, all great religions and teachers of
the world have exhorted man to <span class=SpellE>practise</span> non-violence.
It is a different matter how far man has followed it in actual life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some of the modern psychologists hold that
violence, pugnacity or urge to destroy and kill is a natural instinct common to
both animals and men, and not without some useful purpose to serve, as no other
instinct is. <span class=GramE>Everyone</span> of us has a natural tendency to
be an aggressive little tyrant some time or other in our life. Who has not seen
mothers, fathers, teachers and even lovers consciously or unconsciously playing
the part of a tyrant to their daughters, sons, pupils and the loved ones at
times? Even the greatest men well-known for their learning and culture, have
sometimes been seen to have become actuated with violence towards those who happened
to, or were imagined to stand between them and the object of their strongest
desires. Even the Buddha, the Christ and Gandhi have not escaped the wrath of
those who became jealous of their greatness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The impulse of violence, psychologists contend
further, is not only natural but also necessary. Most of the animals, birds,
insects and primitive races would have been extinct, had they followed the creed
of non-violence. Among men it is usually those races and communities who are
capable of exercising their instinct of violence and who dominate and rule over
others, whereas those who are incapable of doing so for whatever reason–height
of civilization or culture, or physical or mental weakness–have lived as
subject races or communities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now in order to
appreciate the creed of non-violence as taught by great saints and sages of the
world, it is necessary that we should understand the nature of man rightly, and
clearly distinguish it from the nature of animals. In the first place, the life
of animals is entirely governed by their instincts, which are not under their
control, but under that of Nature directly. But in the case of man it is quite
different. Nature has granted control of instincts to man and also, in his
case, left them undefined and unlimited with ­regard to their range and force.
Man can modify, correlate and control his instincts. He can inhibit some and
reinforce others; he ­can repress or sublimate them. He can change their
objects and modes of gratification. In short, he has a complete potential
mastery over them, which is not granted by Nature to animals. May it, therefore,
be not desirable to control the tendency of violence and evolve a better and
more prosperous humanity? Man has already made many improvements over nature;
he can still make many more, for nature has bestowed upon him the great gift of
thought and constructive imagination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There are several
grounds on which non-violence can be justified and proved better and more
fruitful than violence. First, we take the personal ground or practical
consideration. From the point of view of one’s own personal health and
happiness, it is not difficult to decide that one should follow the path of
love and sympathy rather than that of hatred and violence. For no man,
community or race can be sure of being equally strong and powerful for all
times to live successfully by violence. It is a truism that he who lives by
sword perishes by sword. A cruel man, community or race is bound to be treated
cruelly when he or it becomes weak in course of time and others come into
power. That is why in ancient Aryan times, certain rules of decent <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span> towards the weaker and the vanquished were
prescribed. It is also true that cruel persons live a miserable life and die a
miserable death. A tyrant lives a life of perpetual danger. Aggressive
individuals and communities live in perpetual fear of other individuals and
communities. The gains and victories of violence, although quickly achieved, are
short­ lived and are maintained at heavy cost. From the purely selfish point of
view even, therefore, the path of violence is not secure and desirable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Man is not, however, a
purely selfish and lonely creature. He is also a being of society, a citizen of
State or community. The ultimate and real society of man is humanity as a
whole. The limits of religion, race or <span class=SpellE>colour</span> are
artificial limits, which always tend to disappear when man lives a truly human
life. All these limits are baneful. Human society flourishes better on love,
sympathy and co-operation than on acts of violence which upset its balance.
Acts of violence are diseases of humanity. Cruel and selfish individuals or
communities who trample over the natural rights of others are like poisonous
germs in the body. A happy and healthy social life demands that all its members
should live with others amicably, and should help and protect each other. In
the interest of law and social order, all those who preach, propagate and
organize violence, in thought, word or deed, should be regarded as criminals,
irrespective of the position they hold, and be prosecuted and put in jail. In
this age, when science has brought humanity in closer contact than ever before,
and when scientific discoveries and inventions have greatly increased the
powers of man to do both good and evil, there is a great and imperative need to
organize humanity on rational, just and equitable principles and to develop a
keen social and humanitarian consciousness in every human child, so that the
inhuman and grossly violent activities of the stronger and the more equipped
communities and races, threatening the very destruction of humanity itself, may
not recur again. We must abolish imperialism, racialism, colonialism, in short,
all ‘isms’ that are the forms of violence, the desire to exploit the weak races
and communities. There will be war in the world as long there is any empire on
the earth, as long as any community, race or country exploits the resources of
others, as long as every human child is not to think and feel, and act
according to the view that all humanity is like a family and human beings are
brothers and sisters. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Personal integrity and
social solidarity are not the only objects of human life. There is, in each
heart, a moral demand, a command of the conscience, an insistent urge to do the
without any consideration of the consequences. <span class=SpellE>Bhartrihari</span>,
a great Sanskrit poet, has given a beautiful expression to this moral urge. “A
brave and religious man,” he says, “will never deviate from the right path, no
matter the worldly-wise people praise or deprecate him, no matter whether
thereby he loses or gains wealth, no matter whether it involves immediate
destruction or a long life.” Now violence is something which can never be a
universal moral principle. In a world order and world government based on moral
principles of truth, justice, honesty, equality and fellowship, there will be
little need of taking recourse to violence. Moral life alone, whether
individual or social, is happy. The present miserable state of humanity
indicates that it is not living according to moral principles which can be
accepted by all human beings. Violence cannot be universalized and universally
approved. Hence, it can, never be a moral principle. Even those who believe in
violence and act on their belief will not accept it as a right attitude if others
stronger and <span class=GramE>more cruel</span> than themselves were to have
it towards them. Non-violence, on the other hand, is morally approved,
universally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There is still a deeper layer of our being than
moral consciousness. And that is the region of faith, of intuition, or of a
sense of something beyond and above our finite existence. Those who are
fortunate to have access to this mysterious innermost chamber of their being,
the cave of their heart, the very centre of their existence, and those who by
their aspiration and effort have been able to extend their normal consciousness
to the level of their being, are religious in the real and true sense of the
term. Once we have a dip into that mysterious <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">ocean</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Divinity</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
on the surface of which we all live without our knowledge of the fact, we are
changed men. We begin to see life in its fuller significance, in its wider
relations, and with its much greater possibilities. Then we begin to understand
that service, surrender and sacrifice really lead to immortality, perfection
and eternal happiness; and that violence, exploitation and selfishness lead to
repeated death, ignorance and misery. Then we begin to understand that every
selfish act, every cruel deed and every effort to exploit others is a step in
the direction opposite to spiritual perfection which is the real goal of life.
One who <span class=GramE>injures,</span> harms or kills another for his own
benefit or for the benefit of his own party, community, or country really harms,
injures or kills himself, his party, his community or country from the
spiritual point of view. Hence, all religious teachers, who had a right vision
of life and all scriptures based on that vision have denounced violence and
advised the cultivation of non-violence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A very vital question,
which is in fact the very crux of the problem, arises here. Can non-violence be
an effective method of <span class=SpellE>defence</span> against the violent
force of an aggressor? How, in other words, a man or a community sworn to
non-violence, is to defend himself or itself against a violent aggressor
without taking recourse to violence? This question is very difficult to answer
and no ethical thinker has answered it more satisfactorily than Mahatma Gandhi.
He formulated a technique of non-violent self-<span class=SpellE>defence</span>
against a violent aggressor which was not known to earlier thinkers. They
either advised the victim to take to violence in self-<span class=SpellE>defence</span>
or to invoke the help of God in case the victim was too weak to offer violent <span
class=SpellE>defence</span>. Thanks to the practical experiments and philosophy
of Mahatma Gandhi, we now have a very effective method of non-violent <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> against violent aggression. It consists in
resistance and non-co-operation both of which should be strictly non-violent.
Every individual, community or race should try to protect his or its natural
and minimum rights and should never surrender them to a violent aggressor.
These rights should be defended bravely and at the risk of life. Death should
be preferred to yielding, but no recourse should be taken to violence against
the aggressor. On the other hand, the victim should give expression to the
noblest side of himself in relation to the aggressor, so that the noble but
dormant nature of the aggressor may be aroused into action. There is nothing
more contagious than nobleness and nothing more effective against an enemy than
a sincere love for him. The most ferocious person is likely to become the
kindest in case his other side is slightly aroused. The victim of an aggressor
should avoid feeding his anger by returning violence with violence. On the
other hand, he should try to arouse his finer and nobler instincts, by himself
behaving in an extremely noble and rational way. Thus, there are greater
chances of the aggressor’s feeling smaller in the presence of the victim than
in a violent struggle on both sides. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

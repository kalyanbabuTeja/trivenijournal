physi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

elusive as ever before. There has been protracted delay and hesitation in
taking the necessary steps for achieving our most cherished but none the less
most neglected objective of emotional integration. The policy of our Government
is tending to endanger even the nation's physical integration, and to undo the
great work of our Sardar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
present situation has arisen because of certain special provisions which made
leeway into our Constitution, by which it was sought to confer special status
and preferred treatment to selected regions and communities within the country.
These special provisions were dictated by political inexperience and
short-sightedness. They do not reflect the overall interests of the nation. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
our Government did nothing, in the last eighteen years since </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Independence,
to remove this constitutional cob-web of special clauses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Take
the case of Kashmir. The. State became an integral part of the Indian Union,
under a covenant of accession, executed by its ruler, in accordance with the
Indian Independence Act of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1947. But, strange as it looks, our
Constitution contains special provisions which confer a special status on this
region. In a federation, such as ours, no State or region is entitled to a more
equal status. Our Constitution cannot possibly discriminate between the people
living in Kashmir and the rest of India. Such constitutional aberrations are
ethically inequitous and politically unsound. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
a special status is given to one region, it is certain to lead to similar
demands from other regions in the country. One such constitutional deviation is
enough to set in motion a process of national disintegration which cannot be
halted. To allow and to make room for such a special status by constitutional
provision, the Indian Union is not a confederation of loosely knit sovereign
states which may tear off their connections from the main body politic any day,
choosing their own convenience and acting independently at their will and
pleasure. Ours is a federal set-up, and its essentials ought to be preserved.
It is therefore imperative that our Union Government does away, as
expeditiously as possible, with all sorts of <i>special status provisions </i>of
our Constitution, as a first step towards national integration. The minimum
that could be done to help serve the cause of national integration is to bestow
equal constitutional status on all Indians. Any claims to special status and
privileges by regional or communal groups offends against the fraternity of
Indians, while concessions to this effect discriminate in favour of some
against the others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
logic of the case of Kashmir naturally led the Nagas to go a step further and
to demand an independent status for Nagaland. Reports have it that our Government
may be willing to concede some kind of special status to Nagaland. Once again,
this is to become an utterly dangerous game. How far the Constitution of India
is going to be amended to satisfy the separatist demands of regional or
religious groups in the country is a matter agitating the minds of all
patriotic Indians. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is the politics of religion that has prompted the Nagaland demand for
independent status. Already our Government has gone, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>too
far in allowing itself to play into the hands of the Nagaland Baptist Church
Mission. The main stay of this Church is but politics </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
religion. Our secular Government believes that religion is purely: a personal
matter. But religious missions are unsecular in approach and outlook.
Secularism is devoid of any appeal to them. They foster and propagate religious
group loyalties. Heads of religion appropriate those loyalties to themselves
and work up feelings of religious seclusion to strengthen their hold over their
following. Such following is used to grind political ends. So with the spread
or Christianity, the cry of a separate nationhood status mounted up in
Nagaland. Our Constitution and the approach of the Union Government may be
secular, but that of the Baptist Church Mission and its loyal followers is
certainly not. Besides, what was the <i>locus standi </i>of a foreigner like
Mr. Scott, for the Union Government to have allowed him to set foot on the soil
of Nagaland and to meddle in a purely internal affair of ours? What, then, were
the credentials of Mr. Scott? How could it be expected of him that he would
make for impartial mediation, after it became known that he gave asylum to
Phizo, the underground rebel? Little wonder, Mr. Scott now intends to
internationalise the Nagaland issue. The present stalemate in our relations
with the Nagas is the direct consequence of the pusillanimous policies of the
Union Government. The terms ‘cease-fire’ and ‘peace’ are appropriate in
describing a state of truce entered into between two sovereign states. They
sound absurdly meaningless within the context of a universally known
relationship between a Union and anyone of its constituents. The Nagas ought to
be told that secession and treason are unlawful and will be dealt with as such.
Any compliance with the demand for a <i>special status formula </i>will
ultimately lead to the withering away of our federal Union. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unfortunately,
our Constitution is serving as a hornet’s nest of several kinds of special
concessions. Girijans and Harijans were given preferred treatment. It was
originally stipulated that this position was to last for a period of ten years.
However, this time limit was later raised. It became clear once again, that
once an exception is made and a privileged position is conceded to a region or
a community, the tendency is to preserve isolation and aloofness to justify the
continuance of the privileges. Vested interests gain momentum and strength with
the passage of time. Those interests view with suspicion, and resist any
attempt to remove the preferred treatment. Human nature, being what it is, will
be unwilling to forego advantages to which one gets used by long preferment.
The States’ list of Backward-classes too has been steadily swelling year after
year. It looks as though, more and more castes of people are becoming ‘backward’,
with the passage of time after Independence. It is one thing to give help to
the really economically backward and deserving cases. It is quite another to
recognise and reward <i>caste backwardness, </i>which encourages <i>caste and
sectarian </i>outlook. The Constitution should not be made an instrument for
distributing special favours and patronage to select communities by the party
in power. The Government should conduct itself as a trustee of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nation’s
future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
act of assigning to Hindi, without any appreciable merit in it, a special
status in our Constitution, is threatening to undermine the cause of the
nation’s emotional integration. Hindi is not spoken even by one-fifth of the
total population. Its usage is not wide-spread throughout the country, but
confined to only a few north Indian States. The majority of Indians are not
prepared to accept it as the official language of the Indian Union, for a good
variety of reasons. The imposition of such a language against mounting
opposition is bound to cause untold damage to national integration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In making the choice of a language for official
purposes on an all-India basis, the peculiar Indian conditions must be taken
into account. In a multi-lingual society such as ours, where no one language
can claim to have an all-India stature, the best course is to evolve a new
language out of the fourteen national languages, using modernised simplified
Sanskrit as the basis or cementing force. English may be allowed to continue
during the transition period. It may remain thereafter, as an associate
language and an international link language. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
present stalemate and confusion attendant on the choice of the official
language should be removed right now. Hindi cannot be made the official
language of the Indian Union without imposition from above. Democracy and force
are contradictory terms. Moreover, the use of Hindi as official language
confers special advantages to people in the Hindi-speaking States. And this
constitutes an invidious discrimination against the vast majority of the
non-Hindi-speaking people, which our Constitution should avoid. The emergence
of a new official or national language which should take place under proper
planning, would alone balance all conflicting interests and confer equal advantages
and disadvantages on all and there can be no room for complaint, as there would
be no need to provide for any constitutional elevated status to any one of the
regional languages, now exclusively held by </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

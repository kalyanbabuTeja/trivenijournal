often we come across an editor who not merely accepts a contribution to his

furthering the human bonds of fellowship among those whom opportunity brought
together in serving the cause of higher journalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

some of us became his close associates from the early days of the <i>Triveni </i>publication,
it was not due to any seeking of our own but to Ramakotiswara Rau’s infectious
absorption in the child of his creation, drawing us beyond even our own
inclinations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
December of the year 1927, witnessed the birth of <i>Triveni </i>and the scene
of activity shifted for Ramakotiswara Rau from <span class=SpellE>Machilipatnam</span>
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. For,
he was formerly a professor in the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span>
Kalasala founded and <span class=SpellE>organised</span> by the patriot-savant,
<span class=SpellE>Kopalle</span> <span class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span> Rao. The
only dream of his life then was to bring out an English monthly or quarterly
journal, which would reflect the ideals of renascent <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the throes of its rebirth as
an independent nation. Every aspect of our national life, according to him, should
be permeated by pure idealism, and his concept of an artistic production gave
no room for cheap imitation or immature reconstruction of any of our heritages
in art and literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
when with ardent hope and genuine passion for writing, he set foot on the
none-too-smooth path of English journalism, he was confronted by insurmountable
difficulties of both ready finance and steady circulation. He could not find
his way to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> his expectations of a journal
which should mark the level of an enriched Indian culture by the fusion of
modern thought with the inheritance from our imperishable literatures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>No
sooner had he brought out two or three issues with an exclusively high-class
finish in its printing and binding, than there was a stir in intellectual
circles to look eagerly for the succeeding numbers. It was with such an
expectation that I also joined the group of prospective writers to the journal.
Before <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>long, </span>the editor gave me
a fillip by accepting an article of mine with the words, on a post card, on
January 29, 1929, “I received your excellent article on F. W. Bain” and ending
the little note with the sincere wish: “I shall be meeting you one of these
days at your place.” My acquaintanceship with Ramakotiswara Rau thus began with
his sympathy in my writing which was strengthened in no time by his quicker
perception to find in me a sharer of his woes of running a journal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
taking up a room for his office in the Y. M. I. A. building in Armenian Street
of George Town, was the commencement of a closer bond with him not <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>only </span>for <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

class=SpellE>Manjeri</span> S. Isvaran, K. S. Venkataramani, Dr. K. R.
Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Aiyengar</span> and his brother <span

other friends who were only too earnest to <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

high-class magazine, solely mirroring the aspirations of a generation which was
adhering to traditional values combining them with the awakening consciousness
of a fresh dawn of purposeful activity in our cultural horizon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
editor made the friends, who gathered during luncheon hour at the Y. M. I. A.
in his place, to feel at home. If occasions arose for small clashes of opinion
or argument among the spirited group, he was too willing to restore peace and
amity through his timely ministrations. As an editor he was never known to
perform his work of editing and proof-reading in any shoddy manner. Every
little detail requiring his attention was attended to with prompt concern to
keep up the reputation of the journal. If by oversight an error crept in,
either in the printing or in the explanatory note appended to art-plates, he
was too ready to rectify it or <span class=SpellE>apologise</span> for any
unavoidable occurrence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was an enviable array of statesmen and scholars who were enlisted by <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>him </span>in the panel of his contributors.
Publicists such as the Rt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Rajaji, Sir P. S. <span
class=SpellE>Sivaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyer</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Mocherla</span> <span class=SpellE>Ramachandra</span> Rao, T. A. <span
class=SpellE>Ramalingam</span> <span class=SpellE>Chettiar</span>, C. R. Reddy,
D. V. <span class=SpellE>Gundappa</span>, men of letters like T. P. <span

class=SpellE>Venkatesa</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>, Dr. <span

class=SpellE>Ganguli</span>, S. V. Ramamurti, K. V. <span class=SpellE>Ramachandran</span>,
not to speak of a host of younger spirits, found a welcome place in the pages
of the <i>Triveni </i>which was issued every two months, thereby assuring
subscribers of six numbers for a year. The editor’s ambition was never to show
off merely his capacity to muster strong the beaming intellectuals of the times
in the service of his journal, but to discover younger talents also and make
them the standard writers of the morrow in their own respective lines. If he
was much inclined to encourage younger writers like <span class=SpellE>Manjeri</span>
S. Isvaran and M. <span class=SpellE>Chalapathi</span> Rau, there was the
recompensing satisfaction to the public that they were not spoilt by indulgence
but only inspired to blossom out with enduring substance and creative output of
a high order in the literary field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
characteristic of Ramakotiswara Rau, which may not be found in many others’ of
his tribe, was his intuition in selecting both the subject for an article and
the writer for it. Nothing but pertinacity in this trait could have withstood
all the attempts at evasion to write an article of substantial value on the
Simon Report by Sir P. S. <span class=SpellE>Sivaswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aiyer</span>, in the year 1930, before the meeting of first Round
Table Conference at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>.
<span class=SpellE>Sivaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyer</span> was first
unyielding to the importunities of the editor, but would only accede later, on
condition that a thousand reprints, neatly bound, should be given to him free
of cost, for distribution among both members of the British Parliament and the
front-rank politicians in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<span class=SpellE>Ramakoti</span>, without a second thought, agreed to the
condition to foot the extra bill for the paper. Not only was the journal
delayed in its appearance in schedule time but the printer’s bill rose beyond
the capacity of the editor to pay. It was only Ramakotiswara Rau who could show
that rare dedication to his task, irrespective of the strain caused on his resources
and the time involved in waiting for such a valuable article. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Again,
as an editor, he was independent to the extent of holding to his own decision
in matters pertaining to the language used or the taste involved. People today
would be astonished to know that he deleted a word “witty” introduced by no
less a person than the Rt. Hon. Sastri in a note referring to <i>Triveni </i>and
its useful services to journalism. Ramakotiswara Rau felt that it sounded
somewhat cheap to a journal so serious in its outlook and steadfast in its role
as a purveyor of substantial food for intellectuals to be termed “witty”. No
amount of argument to the contrary could make him change his decision and so,
to the lasting chagrin of <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>, the note found a
place with the deletion in the pages of the journal. May be it was obstinacy of
a kind not associated generally with liberal spirits or may be it was an
inexplicable sense of his own responsibility in the publication that made him
hard to be persuaded to change his opinion even when the person to be reckoned
with was a man of outstanding mastery of the English language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Childlike
he was, but also proud, very proud sometimes, which could not reconcile him and
his sensitive soul to effrontery or insults from people high-placed. A
well-known public worker in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
was complimented by the Rt. Hon. <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> in a
foreword to a volume of articles on libraries compiled by him. A particular
sentiment of <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> couched in adequate language
described well that worker. Ramakotiswara Rau, while <span class=SpellE>eulogising</span>
another public-spirited individual in his “Triple Stream” quoted that sentence
of <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span>, of course within inverted commas, but <span
class=GramE>not disclosing</span> the source. The recipient of the compliment
from <span class=SpellE>Sastriar</span> objected to such quoting of the
sentence without also disclosing the occasion and source of it. Rather he was
furious and demanded an explanation from the editor for the breach of etiquette
involved in such writing. Not only Ramakotiswara Rau was unshaken in his view
of the propriety of his own action, but afterwards would not even show the
normal recognition due to the publicist, however highly spoken of by others he
was. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Rajaji
has aptly described him as “a pure and simple soul”. True, he was childlike but
also childlike sometimes in his gullibility to outside influences. Among
friends he was a rare combination of warmth and restraint, unusual in persons
of such preoccupations as editor of a journal. He knew no reserve; he required
no persuasion to befriend the depressed and the lowly; he could be emotional
and comforting to lacerated hearts in singularly unfortunate straits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

tastes. Seeing once a beautiful line-drawing of <span class=SpellE>Nandalal</span>
Bose done on China silk, of a <span class=SpellE>Veena</span> player with the
instrument lying on her lap, he deemed the price, which was beyond his means,
as nothing in consideration of its value as a piece of art, and purchased it.
He again, with equal celerity, parted with it to a dear friend whose
appreciation of the picture easily induced him to make a present of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Khaddar shawls and silks appeared attractive to his eye, no matter whether he
had spare money left in his purse to purchase things for domestic needs for the

office always bespoke of his tasteful ideas in furnishing them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

residence, then in <span class=SpellE>Royapettah</span>, he made it a
pilgrimage to <span class=SpellE>Mylapore</span> in order to give his mother
her last funeral rites. Though not very orthodox in spirit, he was punctilious
in the observance of religious rites, especially to be performed annually for

too remained <span class=SpellE>uncontacted</span> by him with a resignation

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Life
is real; life is earnest. There is no getting away from it. It is not given to
us to realise, in all its implications, the meaning and value of life. And yet
a little study and introspection and the companionship of the wise, may enable
us to glimpse something of God’s plan which is believed to be
Evolution–evolution of life as well as form. From the mineral up to man, and
from man up to God, the progress is continuous. To the extent that we put ourselves
in tune with the Infinite, and perform the duties of the station in life to
which we are called, we made ourselves efficient instruments in the hands of a
Power that sweetly and mightily ordereth all things, and always makes for
righteousness. This fundamental faith is at the back of all systems of thought
which have shaped men’s minds through the ages, and subdued their wills to
Something that is far, yet near, transcendent as well as immanent, seated, so
to say, in the heart of all beings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
from time to time; certain attitudes are developed, by individuals as well as
groups–attitudes which run counter to the generally accepted notions of right
an wrong. They indicate, in exaggerated forms, the point of view of cultivated
minds that have pondered over the evils and the seeming inconsistencies of
life. To them this simple faith in a beneficent and all-wise Power is an
over-simplification, a way of escape from the realities that confront us on
every side. Of different ways of looking at life, Stoicism is by far, the most
powerful, and, to the unwary student of life’s problems, the most cogent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
common, and very mistaken, conception of Stoicism is that it is a denial of the
joy of existence, that the Stoic always courts suffering and revels in it. But
in their origin, both Stoicism and Epicureanism were theories as to how one
might be happy though subjugated or enslaved. As Will Durant puts it; Stoicism
is the apathetic acceptance of defeat, and Epicureanism the effort to forget
defeat in the arms of pleasure. The Stoic Zeno argued that philosophic
indifference was the only reasonable attitude to a life in which the struggle
for existence is so unfairly doomed to inevitable defeat. If victory is quite
impossible, it should be scorned. “The secret of peace is not to make our
achievements equal to our desires, but to lower our desires to the level of our
achievements.” According to the Roman Stoic Seneca, “If what you have seems
insufficient to you, then, though you possess the world, you will yet be miserable.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is remarkable that Stoicism drew its votaries from all ranks, from the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius down to the slave Epictetus. Life according to nature is the
ideal of the Stoic. Marcus Aurelius is full of studies of nature in the devout
spirit of “passing from nature to nature’s God”. The fountain of all virtue is
the life of subordination of self to more general interests–to family, country,
mankind, the whole universe. The four cardinal virtues are wisdom, i.e., the
knowledge of good and evil; justice; fortitude; and temperance. Temperance,
mark you, not asceticism. Of these fortitude is easily the most important. One
need not go out of one’s way to invite suffering and pain. But<i> </i>when
suffering does come, one must have the strength to bear it, strength of mind as
well as of spirit. In a celebrated passage Epictetus says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
after all, Stoicism is a philosophy of negation. Man should learn not merely
hook to face sorrow, but also how to seek happiness in the many things of
beauty that lie all around him. Epicurus, who was in actual life as severe and
simple as Zeno the Stoic, supplied the needed corrective to the Stoic attitude.
He held that apathy is impossible, and that pleasure–though not necessarily
sensual pleasure–is the only conceivable, and quite legitimate, end of life and
action. We must not avoid pleasures but select them. Epicurus is no epicurean
in the vulgar acceptation of the term. He exalts the joys of intellect rather
than those of sense; he warns against pleasures that excite and disturb the
soul which they should rather quiet and appease. In the end he proposes to seek
not pleasure in its usual sense, but <i>ataraxia–</i> tranquillity, equanimity,
repose of mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bacon is no believer in the Stoic suppression of desires. “Let not a man trust
his victory over his nature too far,” says Bacon, “for nature will lay burled a
great time, and yet revive upon the occasion or temptation. Like as it was with
Aesop’s damsel, turned from a cat to a woman, who sat very demurely at the board’s
end, till a mouse ran before her.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

through human history, the Stoic view has, within limits, been admired. The
limitation of wants, the practice of contentment, the striving after
equanimity, the hardening of one’s self against the blows of fortune, are all
fundamental maxims of later ages; and a qualified form of the subordination of
self to the general welfare is an essential part of most modern theories
virtue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is, however, against the exaggeration and the over-emphasis of the Stoic
attitude that saner philosophers have fought. For example, the Stoic is never
tired of speaking of the fleeting nature of all pleasures, of the impermanence
of all Beauty, of the need to so order our lives as to make all life a
preparation for Death. But the wise man will take his pleasure as it comes to
him, knowing that it does not last for ever, while he bears pain with fortitude
knowing that “even this will pass away”. There is enough of suffering and
sorrow in life. There is no sense in seeking to add to this volume of suffering
by telling oneself every moment that the smile of an innocent child may be
followed by a fit of sobbing, that the flower in full bloom is bound to fade
before the end of the day, that the charm of the beloved is of small account
because, some day sooner or later, that fair form must be consigned to the
flames. This constant and futile contemplation of decay and death is a sign of
morbidity. And when this morbidity develops into a malady, the tasting of
delicious food is imagined to be a sin; so too the listening to good music and
the rapt admiration of sunrise and sunset. “You are becoming a slave to the
five senses,” our friends would tell us. I have a vivid re-collection of a <i>bhajan
</i>party where the voices were out of tune and the instruments made discordant
noises. When I pleaded that music must fall pleasantly on the ear so as to
induce the proper devotional mood, I was told that the object of the <i>bhajan </i>was
to sing the praises of the Lord, and the moment you began to love sweet sounds
your attention was diverted from the Lord! This is like saying that you cannot
taste a cup of nectar, unless a drop of poison was mixed with it. Otherwise,
you would be in danger of becoming addicted to nectar; the drop of poison will
supply the requisite alloy to the gold of the nectar! And, that way, your faith
will be strengthened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Stoicism
represents a mood. It answers to something deep down in our natures. Time after
time our hopes are dashed to the ground, our dreams cruelly broken. Those whom
we love are snatched away from us by death, and the friends who meant so much
to us become indifferent. The joy of life seems to be slipping away from us. It
is then that the Stoic view appeals to us and we seek shelter in a philosophy
of negation. In lands where the twin doctrines of Karma and Re-incarnation are
either not known, or not held to be valid hypotheses, the discontent is
particularly acute. But to those of us who have learnt to value the main tenets
of Buddhism or Hinduism, death is not the end of life, nor birth its beginning.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Through
long ages of evolution we err and reap the consequences of those errors. There
is a divinity that shapes our ends, but, within fairly well-defined limits, we
can exercise our will and shape the future by our present thoughts and deeds,
even as the present is being shaped by those of the past. With this background
man strives after perfection through the performance of duty, the service of his
fellowmen, and the spreading of kindliness all around. But these virtues
constitute their own reward, and the virtuous man is not necessarily the
prosperous man or the happy man judged by outward conditions. But the attitude
of viewing praise and blame, victory and defeat, happiness and misery, with the
same calmness and equi-vision, helps us to the right perspective towards life
and its problems. This is the Gita view. And it is a view which is gaining
acceptance in an ever-increasing measure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Self-reliance is a noble quality. To turn inward and
commune with our deepest self is the mark of the exalted soul. But there are
moments, rare but exceedingly precious, when this faith in ourselves seems to
break down, and something within us cries out for succour to something
apparently beyond us. These are the moments when religious experience touches
its loftiest points, and the mystics and the prophets gain a vision of the
Infinite. It was such a vision that was vouchsafed to Arjuna, when in his
distress he turned to the Charioteer seated beside him. It is best therefore to
realise that there is Someone waiting to help.</p>

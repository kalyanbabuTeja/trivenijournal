civilization, as we have learnt from its history, long <span class=SpellE>chequered</span>
and punctuated by several crises, has taken several steps in its onward march.
Each time it does so, it is due to the stimulus of some pregnant values or
under the force and drive of some great personality, a <span class=SpellE><i>Mahapurusha</i></span><i>
</i>or a Mahatma, who is an embodiment of a comprehensive harmonious view and
way of life. Mankind has taken several steps forward in its civilization. The
advance in civilization has not been indefinite or automatic. There is no
dialectical inevitability about it, for there have been dark ages many
set-backs and retreats into humanity and the ethics of the jungle. Taking the
studies of civilization in a sweep, we find that millions of men are miles away
from the primitive and at least a good number of them cherish human values like
truth, love compassion, God, etc., and seek to realize them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

values of civilization and the eternal varieties of religion do not stay out,
for they evolve with the growth of knowledge and wisdom, with the result some
of the values are <span class=GramE>superseded</span> by others which mankind
holds and welcome as worthy of acceptance. The personality of Mahatma Gandhi
and his teachings mark the opening of a new era (<span class=SpellE>Nava</span>
Yuga) in the annals of human civilisation, and he has reared up before mankind
the conception of a new social order, <span class=SpellE><i>Sarvodaya</i></span><i>,
</i>in the image of social justice and individual freedom. He looks at life in
the face and has disciplined all his impulses into a harmony. He is the symbol
of a man who represents an honest effort to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the entire potentialities in men. He is never tired of telling us that he is an
average man with all his foibles and lack of learning. He has fought
temptations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

excessive, straightened all that is crooked and brings light on all aspects of

looked upon speculation and the purpose of human thinking as action. He never
believed in vain speculation or unconsidered action. He lived life intensely
with <span class=GramE>an</span> unique awareness of its multiple significance.
His was an attitude of an <span class=SpellE>experimentor</span>. He called his
autobiography “The Story of my Experiments with Truth” and he actually
experimented with every aspect of human life. He experimented with food, dress,
health and cure, politics, ethics, reforms, economics and education. His
experimental findings enabled him break new ground. He cherished the spiritual
values of human life as dearest to him and as the foundation of human
civilization. Above all values he asserted the supremacy of <i>Truth </i>and <i>Non-violence.
</i>The one is the goal and the other is the means to it. Non-violence he said
is “Love in action.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

values are a part of the moral evolution of man and civilization. He discovered
the technique and the attitude to life and called it non-violence or <i>Satyagraha.
</i>When we refer to non-violence as a technique, it should not be conceived
after a gadget or a material weapon for, in a sense, it is a spiritual force.
He discovered it and found its efficacy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region> where he fought racial
domination on behalf of the coolies. The psychology and the ethics of this
force deserve close study reverent admiration. It is the essence of Gandhi. It
is the Second great <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> value, the first being
Truth. Man according to Gandhiji is a bundle of miscellaneous impulses. The
impulses lead to conflict among men and nations. They need to be <span
class=SpellE>harmoised</span> unless we achieve that <span class=GramE>harmony,</span>
we cannot live in peace and friendly relation with fellow-beings. Conflict
arises through a lack of harmony and when desires compete with one another we
have the spectacle of the complex horrors of modern industrialism. </span><span

Gandhiji upheld is the dignity and divinity of man. To preserve this, a
necessary atmosphere and discipline have to be created. To uphold man’s dignity

and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:

is the law of our species as violence is the law of the brute. The spirit is
dormant in the brute. He knows no law but that of physical might. The dignity
of man requires obedience to a higher law, to the strength of spirit. The <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Non-violence
is soul force. It is not negative. It is a Positive attitude to life. It is a
splendid way of life. It is more than the mere determination not to use
violence. It is no more negative than the term <span class=SpellE><i>Nirguna</i></span>
Brahman of <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span> or the <i>Nirvana</i> of Buddha.
It is not the passive resistance of Christianity asking us to show the right cheek
when one slaps the left. It is not passive in allowing the aggressor to work as
he likes. It does not imply running away from the spot of the conflict. Like <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Casablanca</st1:place></st1:City>, one must
stand at the burning deck, offering resistance with soul force. It is not meek
submission to authority. Gandhiji used to say to the <span class=SpellE>Satyagrahi</span>,
“Take me before you take my country.” It is not the desire to save one’s skin.
Non-violence is not for the weak, for it is the virtue of the strong. It is not
non-resistance. It is an active resistance of evil and not <span class=GramE>a
surrender</span> to evil. It is opposing evil with soul force, not inflicting
violence on the aggressor, but at the same time not leaving him to triumph till
there is energy and life left in the <span class=SpellE>Satyagrahi</span>. On
occasions, Gandhiji has said that he had no doubt about what should be
preferred if we are to choose between ‘cowardice’ and ‘violence.’ It is better
to be violent than be a coward. Non-violence, in the words of William James, is
the ‘moral equivalent of War’. Gandhiji feels non-violence is innate in the
nature of man and it is natural to man. It is submerged by our passions. We
have only to call it into action by appropriate action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>uniforms and ask them to shoot our enemies.
Violence is thus artificially built in the hearts of men and hatred is
instilled in their lives. After <span class=SpellE>miseducating</span> our
youth, we complain that violence is natural to men and is the history of man
and non-violence is a beautiful little dream. Gandhiji writes, “It is the moral
nature of man by which he rises to good and noble thoughts.” The different
sciences show us the world as it is. Ethics tells us that it </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ought
to be. It enables man to know how he should act. “Man has two windows to his

discovery of <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>satyagraha</i></span></span><i>

its application to policy and all the branches of life and their success in
getting us freedom. The inescapable implication is the refutation of the
current view that the physically weak is doomed to destruction and cannot offer
battle to the strong, he must <i>surrender </i>or <i>die. </i>Gandhiji
countered this view by</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>

live as men and women. <span class=GramE>Possessing our minds and souls, not as
censored and driven by regiments with no virtue but obedience.</span> The
exercise of freedom keeps alive the emblem of human dignity. The exercise of
the soul force is non-violence in action. It is the determination not to fare
better than the best. It is the antidote for<i> </i>all forms of exploitation
of fellow men. It is the full realisation of the great truth that there cannot
be happiness for any of us until it is won for all.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

non-violence of Gandhiji is based on the faith in the unity of existence and
fellowship of man. From it follows that happiness and sorrow are indivisible.
It is this outlook on life that made Gandhiji declare his faith in memorable
epigrams, e.g., “I have no pleasure from living in this world if it is not
united...The world is one in fact, and it must become one in truth in the minds
and all hearts of men...All my actions have their rise in my inalienable love
of mankind…All men are brothers. The welfare of all should be our aim.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

based on faith in the ultimate, innate absolute goodness of man. We have all
forgotten the existence and ignored the power of our soul force is ours. We
have not heeded to its call and have silenced its voice and muffed its cry. Our
sensate culture is greatly responsible for it. We live sense-bound existence,

Gandhiji, Truth was God, and in this formulation he was farthest from the

and spiritual in man. He laments the great ingenuity and passion spent by theologians
in defining God instead of doing His will. It is described in the Upanishads as

mind and full of peace.” The pursuit of truth is the high destiny of man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

employ violence in some form or other. The operation of violence has a
self-defeating result. Violence gives rise to greater violence. Greater
violence is met by still greater violence; with the result we have treaties
like that of <span class=SpellE>Versailes</span>. What we need to do is to put
down the impulse for violence itself. When this is done the very conditions of
the situation and the relationship of opposition changes between the aggressor
and the victim. With the change of psychological conditions, the instinct of
defiance and the question of individual prestige disappear. This enables us to
educate the aggressor and bring home to him his crime. The result is a friendly
solution to the problem becomes possible. Non-violence is at once thrice

to intensify it. There is no metal that does not melt at a particular
temperature. There is human heart that does not change by the impact of
non-violence. That is the great faith which Gandhiji wanted mankind to imbibe.
When Gandhiji was asked as to how long he will preach non-violence, his answer
was, ‘‘as long as there is one non-convert to it.” He wanted to effect a very
big change in human nature. Human history does not furnish any instance prior
to Gandhi of using non-violence for struggles. It has to be tried. But the
verdict of history is plain that violence has not helped civilization to grow
or advance in the desirable direction. Non-violence becomes significant in the
contest of world history and the nuclear developments. Man’s greatest enemy
today is not disease or famine or demographic explosion but the alarming
development of nuclear weapons. It is an urgent imperative of our age on the
agenda of man’s charter of duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Non-violence is an absolute value for Gandhi. In the
history of the ethical thought of the world, for the first time Gandhi
proclaimed that violence in any form and in any context of life and against any
is fundamentally an evil, opposed to the dignity of man and antagonistic to the
spirit of true religion. The need for non-violence and the necessity to outlaw
war is not what spiritualism has recommended. Russell reminds that it is simple
common sense and to ignore it is suicidal insanity. He writes, “We are all in
peril, in deadly peril, ourselves, our children–not our great grand children,
unless we are successful for, if we fail we shall have none. In comparison with
this peril, all other questions are <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt'>insignificant.
What will it matter who was right and who was wrong when no human being has
survived? Survival depends on </span>us.” It was Burke who observed
pertinently, “We can never walk surely but by being sensible of our blindness.”
Violence is insanity. </p>

Every crisis is a challenge and opportunity for man. There are two
potentialities in men, one for violence, cruelty and bloodshed, and the other
for mutual aid and peace. We should by the use of our intelligence hold back
the destructive impulse and restore the play for the peace instincts. “Safety
is the sturdy child of terror and survival, the twin brother of annihilation.”
While hope is possible, despair is a coward’s part. Gandhiji was unconquerably
persuaded of man’s good nature triumphing over evil. It is this basic faith in
the fundamental goodness of men that has confirmed Gandhiji’s faith in
non-violence which is unqualified and absolute. Violence even in self-<span

comparison with Hindu thought will situate Gandhiji’s non-violence in the
history of ethical thought. The Hindu ethical thinkers like Manu have looked
upon <i>ahimsa</i> as a virtue necessary for all (<span class=SpellE><i>sadharana</i></span><i>
dharma</i>). But they did not insist on its unexceptionable (or absolute
nature) application to all the defined and undefined eventualities in life.
They held animals could be killed in sacrifice, because such killing is
enjoined by the scriptures. The sacrificial act is said to purify the agent and
the animal, hence it was declared not as unethical. Kings were allowed to kill
forest animals for sport. In self-<span class=SpellE>defence</span> we are
asked to use violence, even kill those that aim at our life, property, our
women, poison us and burn our houses. These criminals are called <span

advisability of use of violence in warfare. The <span class=SpellE>Bhagavad</span>
Gita stands for the principle of collective security and Krishna commands <span
class=SpellE>Arjuna</span>, not to sob or <span class=SpellE>sentimentalise</span>
but shoot his bad enemies as a supreme duty but with no hatred in the heart.
Jesus too did not rule out violence completely. He did use on occasions violence
against the shopkeepers in the temple at Jerusalem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ethics. He said, “If blood is to be shed, let it be our blood. Cultivate that
quiet courage of dying without inflicting violence on the opponent. Man lives
in his readiness to die, if it need be at the hands of his brother.” Gandhiji
told his secret by not to fuss about anything. “If you are arrested, go to the
prison quietly, if assaulted bear it cheerfully, if shot dead die peacefully.”
Gandhiji’s faith in non-violence is the result of his conviction of the unity
of existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gandhiji is a constructive and practical idealist.
He knew that faith in non-violence does not grow like grass. So he conceived
the necessity for an elaborate discipline, in all the aspects of human life.
Without a successful discipline, we cannot make the ideal operative and strong
for the establishment of the higher side of our nature to be in the ascendancy
and secure inward harmony. Discipline and attention to concrete details is
remarkable in the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> view and way of life. He
showed it by his practice. He did not repress the natural desires that make for
a healthy life. To him, the ill health of his body is fatal to the spirit. He
looked upon the human body as the temple of God. He ate such food as gave him
the utmost vitality in consonance with the findings of the scientific laws of
dietetics. He never gave up his exercise or spinning. He kept his sense of <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> and capacity to laugh even at the most trying
circumstances and difficult times. Few can laugh so heartily as he did and
infect others with it. His asceticism was balanced and clicks well with the
Gita teaching. He shut out nothing from his mental and physical life which did
not weaken his will or his undying strength. </p>

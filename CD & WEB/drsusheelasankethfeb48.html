the Doctor in her visitors’ room. I and my daughter were immersed in our talk.
My little grandaughter toddled into the house. I had to enter it in search of
the child. It had gone beyond the Doctor’s drawing-room, into her bedroom. The
child made directly for the inner apartment. She climbed the cot and reached
for the photo placed on a teapoy near-by. I went just in time to snatch it from
her and replace it on the table. I could not help recognising the identity of
the man in the photo. Guess whose it was? Nishkalananda’s!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

University, you would have known about his life. Having studied at Calcutta to
qualify himself for the degree of M.A. in Mathematics, and being engaged in
research work along with his professor there, he was about to proceed to
Cambridge for the Tripos. His fame had travelled to scholars over there and
they had hoped that he might prove to be yet another Ramanujam. But just then
he was obliged to pay a visit to his native village. Something happened there
which prevented his leaving for Cambridge. He left Calcutta behind and went to
the Himalayas to spend twelve years there. When he returned he had become

seen him playing in the streets as a boy. We also knew that he had planned to
go to Cambridge along with his professor, after a brilliant career at the
Calcutta University. There was a relation of T’s who happened to be a
Superintending Engineer in Bombay. He went to Thirumalachar’s village, to offer
his daughter in marriage to Srinivasa. Thirumalachar also felt that his son
ought to marry before going abroad. Hence the telegram summoning the son home.
His son obeyed it and alighted from the train at Hassan. Thirumalachar had sent
his motor to fetch his son home. But the car broke down on the way and the
driver was obliged to halt and try to repair it. The servant proceeded towards
Hassan by bus and met Mr. Srinivasachar. He explained to him the accident that
had delayed the car and made arrangements for him to stay for the night in the
choultry. Only one room was available. The servant saw to the comfort of his
master’s son as best he could, and returned to the spot where the car had been
stranded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then a cart drawn by two bullocks brought to the choultary a family of

leave their things in the cart and camp in the courtyard of the choultry. They
were obliged to sleep in the open. The servant remained in the cart. The family
consisted of an elderly couple, a small boy, and a girl in her teens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>“Sririivasa felt a natural curiosity to see who the strangers were. He was
wonder-struck by the beauty of that girl. Her hair was long and curly. She was
evidently the foster-child of nature, well developed but unsophisticated and
pure. Her smiling face reflected the lustre of generations of good and cultured
people whose virtues she had inherited. But in the calm depths, of her bright
eyes one could discern traces of some abiding sorrow. This peculiar blending of
beauty and distress stirred the heart of Srinivasa and created therein waves of
ineffable feeling. His eyes noted all her movements as though she had cast a
spell on him.</h2>

to beauty was quite unique. It made him toss restlessly in bed when he went in

moon. Nature had evidently conspired with love that night. The family were
sleeping in a row. She was at the end which was open to the sky. The roof over the
verandah cast its shadow over the three of them, but she was flooded by the
moonlight. The moon had cast warm gules on her face and breast which were
uncovered. She was in deep slumber. The dimple on her cheek was visible in the
bright moonlight. The soft breeze was twirling her ringlet curls. The edge of

however succeed. He got up from his bed and stood at the door gazing at the

upon him. While he stood like one entranced, the peppermints dissolved in his
mouth. He went in and put several more in his pocket and, thus armed, returned

cricketer, he threw a peppermint at her. He was considered to be an accurate
bowler. It made her turn on her side and pull the shawl over her bosom. Her
left cheek appeared in the moonlight like a hemisphere carved in marble. The
imp in him had already been provoked. He had also been an accomplished player with
marbles. He now thought that her cheek was a suitable target for his
peppermint. This second assault made her hand move, as if to drive away
something, and to cover herself completely with the shawl. But he was not
satisfied with this. He was impelled to send over one more peppermint rolling
through her ringlet curls. Now her sleep was completely disturbed. The young
woman sat up. She tried a few physical jerks, covered herself properly, and

chewing the cud and enjoying perfect rest. The cause of the disturbance was
nowhere to be seen. She left the verandah and moved towards the yard. Srinivasa

fact that the ivory idol of Srinivasa, which he had kept on his suit-case, was
missing. It had been a present from his grandfather on the occasion of his <i>Upanayanam.
</i>He had always taken it with him on all his journeys. Now he found that the
idol as well as his photo underneath it had disappeared. She must have taken
both of them. He did not know who she was, and what was the name of her
village. He had not even taken the trouble to know her name. Nor did he know whither
they had gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shall send for you one day. Please come on that day.’ I had intended to leave

in a priestly family. How can I escape the culture of generations? My father
was a Vedic scholar. He was also good at playing on the <i>Veena. </i>Worship,
prayer, and music all run in my blood.’ I said that I should very much like to
know her father’s name and other particulars. She replied, ‘Perhaps you have
had no occasion to see him. You are probably a perfect stranger even to his
name. He was not much in the habit of leaving his village and going abroad. He
preferred to devote all his time to the cultivation of his garden. I am the
only daughter of my father. When I was quite a child my mother fell seriously
ill. When she was on her deathbed, she insisted on my being married before she
died. I don’t remember much about my marriage and the death of my mother. It is
said that I lost my husband also. The events happened in quick succession and I
was too young to realise the cruel blows of fate. I saw others crying and I too
wept, hardly aware of the cause of all this sorrow. My father abandoned the
village and lived in a hut which he caused to be built in the garden. He cooked
the food for both of us. As for me, I was thoroughly absorbed in my toys. My
father never tired of playing on the <i>Veena </i>too.<i> </i>When we were in
the village, I had been taught to play on the <i>Veena </i>too. My father
taught me a number of Sanskrit <i>slokas </i>also. My education came to a halt
after we moved to the hut in the garden. I wished for nothing better. I liked
the idea of being left alone. My only companions were the cow and calf kept in
the house by my father. My father sent for my maternal uncle one day. He was
asked to bring all his family also. The whole of the next day my father refused
to touch food, and locking himself in his room, went on playing on the <i>Veena.
</i>Next morning he came out and went through the morning ablutions. Then he
took his seat on the little platform in the verandah. Whenever he wanted to
meditate he used to sit there. I thought it was only his usual day of
meditation. But my uncle summoned all the relatives to our hut. They assembled
one by one. It was the time of sunset. My father had spent the whole day in
meditation. Now he opened his eyes and beckoned me to go to him. He took my
face in both his hands, had his last look at me, and sent me away with his
blessings. Then he sent for the <i>Veena. </i>He tuned it properly and began
reciting Vedic <i>mantras. </i>My relatives also accompanied him in the proper
melodious manner. Thus they spent about an hour. My father felt tired and
leaned back. My uncle shouted for the water of the Ganges kept in a small,
sealed vessel. I was asked to pour a little of it into his mouth. As he was
drinking the holy water, his soul departed from this world and found its
at-one-ment with God.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

uncle became my guardian according to the wishes of my father. He settled down
in our village, to look after me and the garden. My uncle and aunt were very
good souls. They treated me as though they were my own parents. They never
spoke one harsh word to me, nor ever set any task to me. I did whatever part of
the household work I liked. They had a child. It was greatly attached to me. I
liked to have it always with me to play. Whenever my fancy turned that way, I
took up the <i>Veena </i>and played on it, and became absorbed in its melody.
In this way some five years rolled by. One day my uncle received a letter from
a lawyer giving notice of a certain law-suit in which he was made the
defendant. Thenceforward he was obliged to go to and from Hassan with the
necessary records. Some relation of my father who had fled to foreign lands,
now returned to claim my father’s property as his by right. The suit dragged on
for four years. There was an appeal to the High Court also. It was finally
decided that our opponent’s claim was legally justified. I might claim
maintenance from my husband’s people. My uncle had no property of his own. He
had resigned his job as a schoolmaster to look after my father’s property. He
was helpless now. He claimed maintenance on my behalf from my father-in-law, who
replied that he had no objection to my going and staying with them, provided I
was prepared to observe the rules regarding a Brahmin widow. They thought I
would be a useful drudge and it seemed they wanted some help very badly. So the
moment they received my uncle’s consent, my father-in-law came in person to
take me home. The question of maintenance did not arise so long as he was
prepared to have me in his house as a member of his family. It was proposed to
prepare me for the role of a widow at some holy place on the way. My uncle was
not allowed to have any say in the matter. The consensus of opinion in the
village was in favour of surrendering me to the care of my father-in-law. I had
become a piece of their property by marriage. I had known the lot of the
widows, of whom there were many in my village. Many of them knew what it was to
have a husband and family of their own. I had not had even the remotest
impression of what my husband was like. But who was there to consult my wishes
in the matter? Others had somehow acquired a right to mould my life. I was no
better than my father’s cow. My duty was to go where I was led. It was on the
way to my father-in-law’s that we had to spend a night at the choultry in
Hassan. It was then I met the man in the photo. He is my husband, nay, my God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that moonlit night. I was completely captivated by his personality. Our bodies
touched, just by accident. I lost all my self-control as well as power of
reasoning. I felt like offering my whole self at his feet. He was alone in the
room to which he led me. He closed the door and went to open the windows. I was
standing by the bed. The moment the windows were opened, a beam of moonlight
streamed into the room. It illuminated the ivory idol of God Srinivasa that was
kept on his suitcase. This was the only object visible to him as he turned
towards me from the window. Everything else was plunged in utter darkness. He
walked rather slowly back to where I stood. He was gazing fixedly on the idol.
He came quite close to me. With an effort he transferred his gaze from the idol
to me. Some mysterious change came over him. He fell suddenly prostrate at my
feet. He began sobbing. I sat down on his bed immediately, and putting his head
in my lap tried to comfort him. He continued to weep spasmodically like a
child. I allowed his head to rest in my lap and tried to console him by
stroking his cropped head. I may as well confess that I was prepared to yield
anything to him if he so desired. You may call me wicked or shameless or
anything you please. I think people have no means of knowing what I went
through that night. They naturally think in terms of sin. But it pleased God to

followed my parents-in-law like an animal going to the sacrificial altar. That
holy place was on the banks of the Cauvery. We reached our destination just
after sunset. We lodged within the spacious compound of the temple. It was said
that some officer occupying a high position had likewise sought the same
refuge. They had come there to offer the hair of their first born as a
sacrifice to the gods. The same fate was awaiting me in the morning. God alone
knows how much I suffered that night. Times out of number, I must have taken
out the photo to look at it under cover of the night. Early in the morning I
came to know who exactly camped there opposite to us. My girl friend Lakshmi
greeted me cordially and took me to the room where her family stayed. The big
officer was her husband who had taken her as a second wife, after the death of
his first. We knew all about it. But she did not know anything concerning my
fate. I found her to be a sympathetic listener when I narrated to her all the joys
and sorrows of my life. I confessed to her what had happened the previous night
when I met the young gentleman. I told her also the purpose for which I had
been taken to that temple. We wept together for what I had been through. It was
the first time in my life when I deliberately sought the comfort of tears for
all the woes of life. But it was also perhaps the last time when I felt so
helpless. My friend consoled me by saying that it was useless to cry over what
had passed. I should take courage in both hands and try to think of shaping my
future. It was lucky for me that all my people had left the temple temporarily
on various errands. Lakshmi informed her husband of all the circumstances of my
unhappy life. He was glad to meet the daughter of his old Guru who had taught
him the scriptures soon after his <i>Upanayanam. </i>As Lakshmi also happened
to have learnt the <i>Veena </i>from my father, the couple felt very kindly
towards me. Lakshmi’s husband asked me not to cry and assured me that he would
do his best to help me out of the impending trouble. As soon as my
father-in-law returned to the place, the gentleman began remonstrating with
him. Eventually a <i>panchayat </i>was held to decide my fate. Lakshmi’s
husband persisted in advocating my cause. At last Lakshmi came to me and said,
“My husband is willing to take you with us to Poona. There we can arrange for
your education. You had better say good-bye to your parents-in-law and come
with us.” I had never exchanged a word with my relations during the two days
that I had spent with them. They too did not show any desire to converse with
me. I made my salutation and left the place, taking my things with me. I never
thought of their feelings. I was only too glad to be rid of them. I was
admitted to the Sevasadan as soon as we reached Poona. There came about a
complete revolution in my way of life, in about two days’ time. No longer was
there any need to cast stolen glances at the photo. I placed it along with the
idol of Srinivasa on the table and worshipped both. People imagined it must be
my husband’s photo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

For, she could not pretend to know all the subtleties of the Hindu philosophy.
She had neither the ability nor the leisure to understand such a profound
subject as the Vedanta. Her philosophy was very simple: ‘The greatest bliss and
the highest happiness of a woman is found in the exercise of the instinct of
motherhood. This was brought home to me when he laid his head in my lap and
allowed me to arrange the curls of his cropped head. That prompted me to study
Medicine and acquire proficiency in the subjects of maternity and
child-welfare. I have helped several women. After a successful operation, they
are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of motherhood. I always invite them to my
nursing-home for their first delivery–not without a selfish desire to share
their joy. I do my best, God willing, to see that the above pleasure is shared
by as many women as come to me for help.’ I told her that she was doing great
good to the people. She asked me not to praise her for her work. She merely did
what she considered to be her duty. Then she got up, brought the tea tray,
placed it on the teapoy and moved it near me. I took the tea and remarked, ‘I
have always felt that there was a mystery attaching to your name. Now it has
come true.’ She thought I was referring to her surname <i>Sanketh, </i>which
means mystery, and replied, ‘I am called Sanketh because I belong to the
Brahmin sect called <i>Sankethis. </i>I come from Mysore and I am a Kannadiga.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is generally believed that the world underwent an intellectual revolution round
about the beginning of the present century. Drawing its inspiration chiefly
from Darwin and Marx who stand in the remote background, this revolution took
new turns. The rapid progress of science and technology caused much distress
and destruction. The scramble for<i> </i>political domination, and national
animosities, culminated in that terrible catastrophe of the first world war.
Terrible indeed it was–but it seems to be only a beginning in this final act
of, what Wingfield Stratford would call, “civilisaiion’s all but complete
suicide.” The world echoed and re-echoed with the humming of air raids, the
booming of machine-guns, and the helpless cries of millions of innocent people
who were tortured to death. The paradox of untold misery overtaking a mighty
nation like England, soon after her tremendous victory over Germany, puzzled
every one. In every home in Britain, there was at least one casualty due to
war. The immediate past was agonising, the imminent future a blank. There was a
deep sense of frustration and disillusionment in the minds of the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first world war testified to the spiritual barrenness, moral anarchy, economic
instability and scientific superstition of the modern age. The literary artists
felt the shock in all its intensity. They were already fed up with conventional
themes and techniques. There was a steady reaction against nauseous
Victorianism. To express the new experiences a new technique was felt
necessary. Under, these circumstances a new literature sprang up. Wilfred Owen
declared, “the poetry is in the pity”–“in the pity of war.” Disillusioned
ex-servicemen became the heroes of many a novel overnight. Trench warfare was
the epic theme of many pacts. Presently Dr, Sigmund Freud appeared on the scene
with his brilliant thesis on psycho analysis which violently shook the
foundations of human thought. That man has got a sub-conscious–a reservoir of
suppressed thoughts and desires–was an eye-opener to many. Freud declared that
every little action of man–even his dreams, reveries, half-expressed and
unexpressed thoughts–could be traced back to his sex instincts. People now
began to look at things from a new perspective. Experiments were commenced in
the light of psycho-analysis. ‘Stream of consciousnees’ was one such
experiment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is possible to trace back the origins of the exploratim of the consciousness to
the <i>Upanishads, </i>to Shakespeare, to Wordsworth, and to Dostoevsky. The
famous sleep-walking scene in <i>Macbeth </i>where Lady Macbeth laid bare her
guilty conscience, is a splendid portrayal of the sub-conscious feelings. The
complex thoughts of Hamlet, the victim of indecision, are also fathomed by
Shakespeare successfully in his soliloquies. Wordsworth exploited the same
process in his <i>Prelude </i>an autobiographical poem. Dostoevsky dissected
his characters with an incisive psychological penetration. We may come across
excursion into the subconscious realm in the novels of Samuel Richardson <i>(Pamela),
</i>Laurence Sterne <i>(Tristram Shandy) </i>and Henry James. The last named,
in his <i>The Portrait of a Lady </i>(1881) told the story almost fully in
terms of the inner life of his protagonists. His characters register
impressions rather than set about deeds. Charles Lamb in his well-known essay, <i>Dream
Children: A Reverie, </i>gave us a classic example of this method. There may be
some other writers who experimented with this process occasionally. But as an
effective and full-fledged technique in fiction, it was only in the nineteen
twenties that it became important. In the work of James Joyce, Marcel Proust
and Virginia Woolf, it attained perfection. Broadly speaking, we may say that
this was a simultaneous innovation made in Ireland, France and England, by
Joyce, Proust and Miss Dorothy Richardson respectively. But Prof. B. Ifor Evans
contends that the real originator of this technique was Edouard Dujardin to
whom James Joyce himself acknowledged his debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
technical aspects of this method may be considered briefly. Now, it is no
longer the plot, characterisation, story and external actions that mattered.
The temperaments, moods, fantasies, associative memories, momentary
observations and subconscious thoughts of the leading persons in the novel
assumed a greater significance than before. “It is an axiom with this kind of
writer,” says Frank Swinnerton, “that all reality lies in the consciousness.”
He realised that the soul or Payche is like a “a vast fluid, or even vaporous
mass, wide-spreading, far beyond the feeble village lights of our conventional
reading of character, deep-sounding into our nervous animal organis</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ation,
into childhood.” Our consciousness which is part of our soul does not proceed
logically or coherently, except at certain times and for certain periods under
the pressure of some urgent practical need. Generally it follows a freakish
association of ideas whose progress cannot be charted. The soul is singularly
indifferent to the past and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>future,
near and far. The exponents of this new technique also believed that Psyche is
the focus of all our experience of life. In their thirst for fresh technical
devices, they had to trespass the conventions. Instead of regularity of form
they showed a “tendency to deformalization”. Diversity and complexity
supplanted the former uniformity and simplicity. A continuous action seemed to
them quite unlike ordinary experience. “They feel that the sense of life is
often best rendered by an abrupt passing from one series of events, one group
of characters, one centre of consciousness to another.” So they deviated from
the convention of chronological continuity. They broke up Time into atomic bits
and scattered them as they liked, whereas the Victorian novelists “clung on to
the calendar and clock”. They believed that “Time has no positive quality; its
value and duration are relative to their fluctuating factors; one person’s
whole life-story may have no greater time-value than twenty-four hours in the
life of another.” This annihilation of the tyranny of Time necessitated the
minimisation of plot, almost complete elimination of action, and sometimes even
the eschewing of thought, which as A. C. Ward tells us, is also “susceptible of
a certain fixity”. But the consciousness remains–bottomless and endless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the destruction of the time-factor is the sole criterion of this technique,
then Somerset Maugham’s <i>The Razor’s Edge </i>and Aldous Huxley’s <i>Eyeless
in Gaza </i>also belong to it. But this technique is also concerned with, as
James D. Hart puts it, “the depiction of the mental and emotional reactions of
characters to external events, rather than the events themselves; as opposed to
the usages of conventional plot-structure, description, and characterization,
the action is presented in terms of images and attitudes within the mind of one
or more central figures.” That is to say, the mental and spiritual life is
presented in these novels. Our thoughts, nebulous and complex and
in-expressible as they are, are photographed as it were and placed before us in
the album of a novel. The inner life of man–the growth and development of his
mind and the glorification of his soul–is much more important than his outward
movements and actions. It is the quintessence of life. Other things are there
only as a framework. These innovators do not specially care about neatly
finishing off a given action, following it through to the fall of the curtain.
The imagination has the faculty of filling up the gaps in an action present</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ed
in fragments, of getting the impression of an entire life from a mere hint of
the high moments. Though there is a want of continuity, there is a sort of
rhythm–rhythm constituted by repetition, by recurrence of themes–and a
wave-like progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Generally
the narration in these novels is rhetorical. Often the real and imaginary
accounts slip into each other like the colours of a rainbow. There is no clear
dividing line between them two, so much so that the reader is at pains to
distinguish the one from the other. It is said that William Faulkner uses
italics for all imaginary digressions. This mixing up of real and imaginary
narratives indiscriminately, is borrowed from the modern ‘flash-back’ technique
in cinemas which is perfected in Germany, Russia, France and other European
countries. These innovators do not care very much for sentence structure and
grammar. They try to use words in their original picturesque sense, and they do
not mind interchanging a verb with a noun, if it suits their purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
novelisits have great fondness for dissonances which originated in the
symbolist school of poetry in France. The swift change from the elevated and
poetical style to the familiar and ironical, appears as a sardonic commentary
on the meanness and prosiness of life. A similar effect is produced when there
is a change-over from the real to the ideal. There is also a not-too-harmonious
mingling of tones as in T. S. Eliot’s <i>The Waste Land.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is yet another aspect–the linguistic–of which James Joyce was the greatest
master. Two or more words are taken and each is split up into two. Then the
split-up pieces are re-assembled to form a new word with a greater
significance. This may be called a sort of linguistic double decomposition
which is evidenced in Lewis Caroll’s <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>and Edward
Lear’s <i>Book of Nonsense. </i>In James Joyce’s <i>Work in Progress, </i>a
character says ‘alcoherently’which obviously is a product of reassembling
‘alcohol’ and ‘incoherently’. Added to this linguistic gymnastics, are bits of
conversation as in Virginia Woolf’s <i>Jacob’s Room </i>which reflect the
meaningless babble of our modern society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
we may, in passing, consider the work of the chief exponent of this technique.
Miss Dorothy Richardson, in her twelve serial novels with the common title <i>Pilgrimage,
</i>deals with the life of a single woman. Marcel Proust’s “Remembrance of
Things Past,” also in twelve volumes, seems to be a far more lasting work than
the former. James Joyce in his <i>Ulysses </i>(1922) depicts the life of a
single man–an Irish poet and school teacher called Stephen Dedalus–in Dublin
during twenty-four hours. He tried to picture the “obsession of the soul’s
secret life” and “express the subconscious in terms of the new aesthetic laws.”
He takes us along the “flow of images in the consciousness” and shows us the
“chaos of human experience” by means of a series of episodes, incoherent, but
still convincing. “<i>Ulysses</i>,” says a famous French critic, “is the
powerful confused synthesis of all the mental disturbance, and all the quest
for new forms, that stirred in the post-war literature.” <i>Finnegan’s</i> <i>Wake</i>,
which took seventeen years to complete, gives us a clear picture of Joyce’s
deep erudition and great linguistic attainments referred to earlier. A. C. Ward
tells us how, “distorted sound echoes of sense-making phrases can be caught
from time to time, while the whole may perhaps be better considered as a kind
of musical notation for the communication of profundities incommunicable in
standard language.” It is said of Joyce that he pursued his technique beyond
the point where it can serve the ends of art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Virginia Woolf following in the footsteps of James Joyce, as far as technique
was concerned, wrote <i>Mrs</i>. <i>Dalloway</i> in which she portrays the life
of an aristocratic lady in London during the course of a single day. Here is a
slice of life bearing the impress of the richness, variety, colour and
intensity of the whole life which goes to prove that, in a single moment, a
whole life-time may be re-lived as it were. Mrs. Woolf explored the kingdom of
the subconscious with a delicate poetic sensibility in <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and
<i>To the Lighthouse</i>. Her work is a splendid counterpart of Joyce’s work.
Joyce’s characters–Miss Rirhardson’s–are all normal people in the full
possession of their faculties. But Mrs. Woolf depicted even abnormal types,
such as Septimus Warren Smith in <i>Mr</i>s. <i>Dalloway</i>, whose agonising
story lead to his shocking suicide is really heartrending. And Mrs. Woolf is
not alone in this venture. Conrad Aiken and William Faulkner have found this
technique particularly suitable for the portrayal of abnormal states of mind.
In one of Aiken’s novels, a man suffering from a schism in his nature and
feeling inferiority complex is shown. In Faulkner’s famous novel <i>The Sound
and the Fury</i>, there are sane and mean characters as well as an imbecile and
a victim of suicidal mania. To return to the contrast of Mrs. Woolf with Joyce:
Where the latter<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Is “static, masculine,
egotistic, rational”, she is “fluid, feminine, impersonal, emotional”. But both
of them–in fact, every one who succeeds with this technique–are poets, or
‘prose poets’ as J. B. Priestley would call them. They are poets in the sense
that they envisage “the communication of personality with personality, by an
extension</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> of their own personality”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
technique is quite akin to surrealism. Whereas the former is generally
restricted to the sphere of fiction, surrealism envelops the whole domain of
Art. The surrealists or super-realists, as Waddington tells us, isolate an
object completely from all its normal associations and thus bring to the
surface of the mind a whole set of other associations with a peculiar emotional
intensity. A work of surrealist art has the quality of a dream-image, when
things are so often incongruous and slightly frightening in their relation to
time or place”. Just as every one can dream and have irrational notions, we may
get into an ‘unmatter-of-fact frame of mind’–and the expression of such a state
is surrealism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stream
of consciousness’ has weathered the storm and come to stay. It is being used in
other literary forms like the drama, the biography and the essay. Elmer Rice in
his <i>The Adding Machine </i>endeavours to project the inner workings of the
mind into the theatre. Likewise, Eugene O’Neill in his <i>Strange Interlude, </i>tries
to reveal the subconscious by coupling soliloquies and asides, indicating what
the characters are thinking, to the dialogue which they are speaking. These
soliloquies and asides are media for the images and reflections which reveal
“hidden half-conscious motives and help to illumine the contrast between the
inner and the outer life”. In this respect they are unlike the Elizabethan soliloquies
which are often poetic declarations and nothing more. As regards biography, we
have Virginia Woolf’s <i>Flush </i>dealing with the life of Elizabeth Barrett
Browning. Mrs. Woolf, instead of narrating in a straightforward fashion, told
the story as it passed through the mind of Mrs. Browning’s dog. She tries to
make us see the world as a dog’s world which requires a substitution of human
values by canine values. “Smells and tastes are more important than sights and
sounds, instincts dominate thoughts.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have said that this technique has come to stay. But people, like Galsworthy are
sceptical about the survival of any of the innovations. They think, it is only
the novel of character and manners that will outlive these methods. We can only
leave this “imaginative shorthand” to Time and await its decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

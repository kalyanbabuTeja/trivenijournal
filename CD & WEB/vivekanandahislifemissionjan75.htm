Vivekananda did not seem to belong to this world but appeared to be a radiant
being descended from another and higher sphere for a definite purpose. He was a
seer, an illumined soul, very much different from the ordinary run of mankind.
His mind was luminous; he had that supreme knowledge of which the <i>Gita </i>speaks
and which results from the realization of oneness with the Supreme Being.
Besides, he had within himself a fountain of energy to carry his message not
only to the different parts of India but to the West also. He never prepared
his speeches and addresses, but poured forth the deepest spiritual truths in
words of imperishable beauty. Once Sri Ramakrishna said about his young
disciple, Narendra, who is known to the world as Swami Vivekananda: “He is not
a pond, he is a reservoir. He is not a pitcher or a jug, he is a veritable
barrel. He is not a minnow or sardine, he is a huge red-eyed carp. He is not an
ordinary sixteen-petalled lotus, he is a glorious lotus with a thousand
petals”.<sup>1</sup> The master also said on another occasion: “Narendra is not
a twig floating in a river–a twig that links even if<i> </i>a bird alights upon
it. Rather is he a great tree-trunk carrying men, beasts and merchandise upon
its chest”. <sup>2</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

beautiful summing up of Vivekananda’s personality suggests about his strength,
vigour and endurance. A strong athlete, a Herculean figure having broad face
spotted with large eyes and vast forehead, he bore in himself a storehouse of
power and strength, granite faith and rock of self-confidence, immeasurable
passion of a warrior and the Napoleonic ambition for a world conquest. At the
same time, he possessed a burning desire for renunciation of all earthly
empires and for casting off all his chains and roaming like a wandering unknown
pilgrim, sheltering under a tree or meditating alone in a lonely cave in the
Himalayas. “I long, oh, I long for my rags, my shaven head, my sleep under the
trees, and my food for begging…” (January 1895) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

one word can speak out and signify the life and mission of Swami Vivekananda,
the patriot and prophet of modern India, it is strength. A lion among men he
roared and thundered forth rousing the leviathan of the sleeping nation from
century-old slumber and mental stupor, to rise on its feet and march on freely.
He wanted in us the sleeping divinity to awaken that austere elevation of
spirit which rouses heroism. “Never forget the glory of human nature! We are
the greatest God that ever was or ever will be. Christs and Buddhas are but
waves on the boundless ocean which I am.” (1895, in an interview at the
Thousand Island Park, U. S. A.) Vivekananda found the essence of the Upanishads
and religious scriptures in one word ‘manliness.’ It was due to his message of
courage and fearlessness that he was described as a ‘tamer of souls.’ Delegates
at the Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893, were left spellbound
after having heard him and referred to him as the ‘cyclonic monk from India.’
Wherever he went, he carried an air or kingliness and power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

whose real name was Narendranath Dutta, was born in an aristocratic Kshatriya
family of Calcutta on the twelfth of January, 1863. He was blessed with a sound
constitution and grew up into a healthy and vigorous youth. As a college
student, he made his mark in many fields and became popular as a debator and
conversationalist. But he also had a meditative strain that often made him appear
aloof and indifferent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Vivekananda came under the influence of rationalist
thought of his time. He was much impressed by European science, liberalism and
the democratic pattern of Western society as expressed in political and
sociological literature. He studied the ideas of J. S. Mill, the philosophers
of the French Revolution, Kant and Hegel. He even entered into correspondence
with Herbert Spencer and offered criticism of some of his ideas. Vivekananda’s
studies were confined not only to Western thought, but he was also drawn
towards India’s religious and philosophical heritage through the writings of
Brahmo Samaj leaders. </p>

account of his varied, though somewhat unsystematic, studies and enthusiasm for
reason, Vivekananda developed an agnostic, even sceptical, outlook on life. But
his meeting with the Ramakrishna in November, 1881 and his close association
with his the master for about five years brought a turning point in his life.
His aggressive faith in logic was toned down, and he was made to be understand
the value of personal realization as distinct from intellectual conviction. The
master carried him by easy stages into his own spiritual realm and led him,
step by step, to the highest pinnacle of inward experience.<sup> 3</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ramakrishna’s
death in August, 1886 again brought a change in Vivekananda’s life. After the
death of his master, he embarked upon extensive travels from the Himalayas to
Cape Comorin with an urge to spread the message of Ramakrishna and see the
natural beauty of the Motherland, and visited all the important centres of
Indian culture. For years no body knew what had happened to him. He allowed
himself to be completely ‘swallowed up in the immensity that is India’. Through
his travels, he not only saw India’s cultural wealth, the strength of her
traditions, her assimilative powers and her latent spiritual energy, but he
also saw her grinding poverty, her social backwardness and her mental inertia
into which she had fallen. Although he wandered without any plan, wherever he
went he learnt something new and gained new experiences. During his stay at
Ahmedabad he was attracted towards Jain and Islamic traditions; and while at
Alwar in Rajasthan he developed a keen interest in History and expressed the
necessity of a school of Indian historians, steeped in modern scientific
methods. He had thus a fair knowledge of both the Western thought and India’s
religious and philosophical heritage and her manifold problems. His visit to
America and Europe developed in him a good deal of admiration for the West. The
dynamism, social awareness, spirit of adventure, capacity for hard work and
concern for practical values that he saw in America and Europe made a deep
impression upon him. Although he saw the triumph of human spirit in the
achievement of science, he also became aware of the limitations of Western
civilization. On his second journey to the West in 1899, he was left
disillusioned in many ways.<sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>4</sup>

he had gone to the West a second time. Vivekananda had undertaken a whirlwind
tour in India, carrying the message of resurgent Indian spirituality to every
part of her. The messages, which he delivered at different places, were later
published under the title, <i>Lectures from</i> <i>Colombo to Almora. </i>These
messages did much to restore the self-confidence of Indian intellectuals, and
to stimulate the study of Indian philosophy and religion. In 1897, he
established the Ramakrishna Mission at Belur, near Calcutta. He died on the 4th
July, 1902 before he had attained fortieth year of his life. Although he died
long ago, his great voice is still present to fill the sky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

should now be amply clear from the preceding short account of Vivekananda’s
life that he came to this earth with a mission and was fully conscious of it.
That mission was to make India aware of the role which religion had played in
her life from time immemorial. He often reminded his Indian listeners that
religion alone constituted the real life of the people and that they, as a
nation, would cease to exist, if they forgot their religion. In his reply to
the address of welcome, presented to him at Ramnad, he commented: “Remember, if
you give up that spirituality, leaving it aside to go after the materialistic
civilization of the West, the result will be that in three generations you will
be an extinct race; because the backbone of the nation will be broken, the
foundation upon which the national edifice has been built will be undermined,
and the result will be annihilation all round”.<sup> 5</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
must be noted that Vivekananda did not like any kind of orthodoxy in matters of
religion, in spite of his strong faith in the indispensability of religion in
the life of a nation. He advised his co-religionists to avoid the old
orthodoxy, which he condemned as ‘kitchen religion’ and ‘don’t touchism’. But
he preferred it as against the trend towards Westernisation, for he thought
that the orthodox man had at least the necessary strength to stand on his feet
and stick to his position, which the Westernized person had no such strength
and was simply shifting his ground again and again. At Madurai, he stated in
his address that India had been constantly supplying spirituality to the world
throughout her long history. He spoke: “She contributed it long before the
rising of the Persian Empire; the second time was during the Persian Empire;
for the third time during the ascendancy of the English, she is going to fulfil
the same destiny once more”.<sup> 6</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

did not agree with those, who held religion responsible for the social
backwardness and political subjugation of India. Although he admitted that the
rigidity of caste system, its social exclusiveness, the spirit of fatalism and
other factors, which had come to be accepted as essentials of Hinduism, greatly
contributed to her decline, he was of the view that it was not the fault of
Hinduism but of the people, who misunderstood it and failed to translate its
fine principles into practice. According to him, India declined because “she
narrowed herself, went into her shell, as the oyster does, and refused to give
the life-giving truths to thirsting nations outside the Aryan fold.” He urged
his countrymen to break through the walls or that social exclusiveness, and to
go out and give to others what they possessed. He argued that the secret of
life was to give and take. India can learn mechanism and scientific devices
from the West and, in return, can give to it the spiritual message of Hinduism.

drew the essence of Hinduism from the <i>Upanishads, </i>the <i>Gita </i>and
the <i>Sutras </i>of Vyasa. He used the term ‘Vedanta’ to cover the systems of
thought expounded by Sankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Chaitanya and others. In other
words, Vedanta includes the Advaita, Visishtadvaita and the dualist systems of
thought. Vivekananda maintained that there was no incompatibility between the
various systems of thought. The human mind begins with dualism, rises to
qualified dualism and ultimately reaches the qualified monism or Advaita, which
proclaims the highest truth: <i>Tat Twam Asi </i>(Thou Art That). Thus Vedanta,
according to him, is an attempt to find out the ultimate unity of things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
phrase <i>Tat Twam Asi </i>implies that man is not as he appears to be. He is
neither the body nor the mind and intellect. But he is the Soul or <i>Atman, </i>which
cannot be pierced into or cut by a dagger or a sword, burnt by fire or made wet
by water. It does not perish at all. In other words, it is birthless, deathless
and changeless; it is infinite and eternal. Because of these qualities, it is a
part and parcel of the <i>Parmaatman </i>or the Universal Soul. From this
conception of man as <i>Atman, </i>certain conclusions may be drawn. First, man
is not inherently bad or a sinner as is taught by some religions. He is
inherently and essentially pure, divine, and partakes of the nature of <i>Sat-chit-ananda.
</i>It is wrong to think that man is weak, evil and sinful. Hence Vivekananda
urged the people to cast off this wrong notion and to believe in the divinity
of man. Secondly, if each one of us is divine and a part and parcel of <i>Parmaatman,
</i>all of us become one. This also leads to the concepts of equality of man
and the unity of mankind. If the same God is present in all of us, there can be
no other relationship between man and man than that of love and service.
Vedanta thus preaches the message of universal love and service. As love and
service demand the spirit of sacrifice and renunciation, the message of Vedanta
also insists upon it. As a strong believer in the philosophy of Vedanta,
Vivekananda also found the real essence of India’s religion and spirituality in
the observance of love, service and sacrifice and renunciation. According to
him, the religion of India, which may also be called as religion of the
Vedanta, is a man-making religion, a religion of strength the observance of
which would make any people brave, courageous and pure. No nation becomes great
just by making material progress and enacting good laws. It is the strength of
character of her people, which makes her great and strong. As the Vedanta wants
to raise or improve the quality of men by infusing in them the strength of
character, it goes to the very root of the matter. That is why Vivekananda
wanted to give to the West the message of Vedanta in exchange for the means to
improve the conditions of the poor in India. He thought that the whole world
needed the help of India; her spiritual treasures could not be allowed to be
destroyed as the treasures of several other civilizations had been. The people
of India, he thought, were also to be reminded of their own rich spiritual
traditions, which they had forgotten partly due to their long subjection to
foreign rule and partly due to their own ignorance and inertia. India could not
afford to loose anchorage to her age-old tradition of spiritualism.
Vivekananda’s life-mission was to open the door of spirituality to everyone. He
felt that religion was bound up with India’s destiny. “For good or for evil,”
he said, “religious ideal has been flowing in India for thousands of years. It
has permeated the atmosphere, has entered our very blood, tinged with every
drop in our veins, but become one with our constitution, has become the very
vitality of our lives. Can we give it up without rousing the same energy in
reaction, without filling the channel which that mighty river has cut for
itself in the course of millennia? Do you want that the Ganges should go back
to its own bed and begin a new course”?<sup> 7</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vivekananda
was, however, realistic enough to realize that the truths of Vedanta would have
little appeal for a hungry man. He recalled the words of his master that religion
was not for empty stomachs. Spiritual message would melt in the air before the
wrath of hunger, the penury and sad spectacle of the poor, demoralised and
degenerated mass of people, devoured by senseless credulity and fetishism.
Vivekananda in his compassion for the downtrodden said: “...but the crying evil
in the East is not religion–they have religion enough–but it is bread that
suffering millions of burning India cry out for with parched throat. It is an
insult to a starving man to teach him metaphysics”.<sup>8</sup> What right have
we to speak on religion, metaphysics or high moral principles to poor millions
if we fail in our primary task to give a morsel of food to hungry stomachs, and
elevate them from the dark, dingy hovels to bright sunshine and the glimmering

was highly impressed by the material brilliance of the Western civilization,
when he first saw it in the city of Chicago. But gradually its darker side also
began to be revealed to his keen vision. He discovered the love of lucre, the
spirit of greed, and the ferocious struggle for supremacy which lay at its
basis. In a letter to Sister Nivedita. written at a later date, he explained
his mind: “Social life in the West is like a peal of laughter; but underneath
it is a wail. It ends in a sob. The fun and frivolity are all on the surface; really
it is full of tragic intensity... Here (in India) it is sad and gloomy on the
surface, but underneath are carelessness and merriment”.<sup> 9</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thought that what the West needed was the great spiritual truths, enumerated by
the Vedanta. He told his Western audience that there was a nobler aim than
accumulating wealth and conquering external nature, and that materialism could
never permanently satisfy the soul of man. He further told them that the man is
Atman and that the chief aim of life is to realize the divinity latent in man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

placed before the mankind some important facts about religion. First of all, he
told that the origin of religion lay in the innate struggle of human mind to
transcend the limitations of human senses, and not in nature-worship or
ancestor-worship. The second important fact that he explained about religion is
that it is neither word nor doctrine; it is realization. “It is not hearing
accepting. It is being and becoming.” It is possible to realize God in one’s
lifetime. This realization is open to everyone. The important fact about
religion, according to him, is that renunciation is an indispensable
pre-requisite of a true religious or spiritual life. The Idea of renunciation
is an old one, and it was neither discovered by Sri Ramakrishna nor by Swami
Vivekananda. But the stress on service, which Vivekananda laid, was something
new. He was not satisfied with the idea of personal salvation to be reached by <i>Jnana
</i>(knowledge). He, therefore, dedicated his entire life to the service of the
poor. The Ramakrishna Mission is the outstanding monument to this ideal. The
fourth important idea about religion, which Vivekananda placed before us, is
that of Universal Religion. He struck the first note about it, when he said in
his opening speech in the Parliament of Religions that he was proud of
belonging to a religion “which has taught the world both tolerance and
universal acceptance.” He made it clear that the Hindus ‘believe not only in
universal toleration’, but also ‘accept all religions as true’. In support of
his claim, he cited the famous teaching of the <i>Gita. </i>Lord Krishna says
in the <i>Gita. </i>“...In that way in which they worship Me, I give them fruit
accordingly. O Paartha! whichever path is followed, a man ultimately comes and
joins into My path”.<sup> 10</sup> Vivekananda spoke some ten or eleven times
during the session of the Parliament of Religions, and each time he advocated
the idea of Universal Religion in which all men could be united without limits
of space and time. He stated that the same truths could be found in every
religion, and that good and perfect men had been produced by every creed. He
maintained that every religion consisted of three parts–its philosophy and
ideals, its mythology and its rituals. The last two varied from one religion to
another, but there was an essential identity in regard, to the first. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

also explained his mind regarding the usefulness of image-worship. Although he conceded
that the worship of an image could not lead a man directly to Mukti, he did not
disregard its usefulness. He considered it necessary for a common man to
prepare his mind for the realization of God. He regarded it as a preliminary
stage in our spiritual unfoldment. Image worship is as necessary for the
realization of God as infancy and childhood are for the maturity and wisdom of
an old age. Idolatry can be wrong only if childhood or youth is a sin. But he
was also conscious of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fact that mystery-mongering cult,
so-called Yogism or magic had crept in the soil of India for long. He
considered it responsible for the spiritual and social downfall of the Indian
people. Likewise, as of the view that dogmatism in any realm–life or letters,
idea or belief, theory or practice–is the sure enemy of progress. It stifles
our souls, regiments our thoughts and trims our creative adventures into narrow
groups of slavish minds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hence,
Vivekananda strongly pleaded for adopting a free and rational attitude towards
religion. According to him, freedom is the keynote of spiritual life. Religion
consists soley in inner spiritual urges. Wherever religion is estranged or cut
off from its vital spring, spiritualism, it is degenerated into dry formalism
or dull mechanised drilling, a routine affair of life. True or dynamic religion
lifts us out or our ruts. It is also “the function of philosophy to provide us
with a spiritual rallying centre, ‘a synoptic vision’ as Plato loved to call
it, a <i>Samanvaya </i>as the Hindu thinkers put it, a philosophy which will
serve as a spiritual concordant, which will free the spirit of religion from
the disintegration of doubt and make the warfare of creeds and sects a thing of
the past”.<sup>11</sup> Vivekananda declared in the Parliament of Religions with
all the emphasis that he could command: “The Christian is not to become a Hindu
or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the spirit of the
others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to the law of
growth….. If the Parliament of Religions has shown anything to the world, it is
this…. ‘Help and not fight’, ‘assimilation, and not destruction’, ‘harmony and
peace and not dissension’.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
religion, according to Vivekananda, does not consist in subscribing to a
particular creed or faith but in spiritual realization. The divinity within
must be brought to one’s perpetual level. Vivekananda believed that in
spiritualism lies India’s real greatness. This spirituality does not mean the
changing manners and customs but the idea of “oneness of all, the infinite, the
idea of the impersonal, the wonderful idea of the eternal soul of man, of the
unbroken continuity in the march of beings, and the infinity of the universe”.<sup>
12</sup> This is what the Vedanta tells us, and that was the reason that
Vivekananda accepted its sound metaphysics and universality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vedanta fulfils the objectivity of all religious quest. It, according to
Vivekananda, consists of eternal principles which stand upon their own
foundations, without depending upon the authority of persons or incarnations.
It alone can be regarded as Universal Religion, for it teaches principles, not
persons. No religion built </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Vivekananda was a great nationalist of India, who wanted to revitalize the
nation through the vitality or religion. He believed that religion constituted
the “centre, the keynote of the whole music of national life of India”. In him
the Hindu renaissance became “self-conscious and adolescent.” He was born at
such a critical period in the history of India, when all the higher impulses
were overborne by the onrushing tide of materialism. The educated people were imitating
foreign habits as they felt that the real solution to the problems of India and
her progress lay in the acceptance of the Western methods and institutions.
Vivekananda tried to stem this tide, and placed before his countrymen the
splendid and invigorating message of the Vedanta which combined the
spirituality of the East with the spirit of social service and organisational
capacity of the West. This is what his philosophy of neo-Vedantism stands for,
and which he used to effect a synthesis of cultures of the East and the West
and thereby to find out the real salvation of humanity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

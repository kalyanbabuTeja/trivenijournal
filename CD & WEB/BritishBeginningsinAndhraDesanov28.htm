<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The good ship <I>Globe</I>, commanded by Captain Hippon, first visited Masulipatam in January 1611, under instructions from the Directors of the East India Company to negotiate with the Sultan of Golconda for commercial facilities.<SUP>1</SUP> Thus was the first settlement of the British on the East Coast established under the grant of Sultan Kutub Shah Abdulla, as a subordinate establishment, sometimes to Bantam and sometimes to Surat.<SUP>2</SUP> The rival Dutch East India Company, also with its headquarters at Bantam, established factories at Masulipatam and Pulicat lying 160 miles southwards to it. The English, hampered by the exactions of the Kings of Golconda, amalgamated for sometime with their rival factory at Pulicat in the year 1621. But in 1625, another establishment at Armagam, near Nellore, was brought into being and later on abandoned as of little importance.<SUP>3</SUP> <I>Farmans</I> and <I>Cowles </I>were obtained from the Sultans of Golconda from time to time, at once confirmatory and additional, in the interests of the British trade. In 1633-4 the first <I>Farman </I>(No.1 below) was granted to Captain Joyce. Captain Cogan reached Golconda on July 19, 1638 and a confirmation of it was obtained.<SUP>4</SUP> On October 25, 1639, the factors at Masulipatam wrote to the Directors of the Hon'ble Company at Home that it was not fit to be a chief factory on the East Coast.<SUP>5</SUP> About this time, Francis Day obtained a grant from the Raja of Vijayanagaram for the erection of a fort on a small plot of ground near Mahilapuram, the present Mylapore of Madras, and in the year 1653 Fort St. George became the presidency town with two factors and ten soldiers.<SUP>6 </P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such was the early history of the English on the East Coast. But, until a very late period, the Northern Circars, which form the main districts of the Andhra Desa, played an important part in determining the course of the vicissitudes in the fortunes of the British in India. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The progress of the British in the Andhra Desa is determined by <I>Farmans </I>and <I>Cowles, </I>a selection of which is printed below. With the authorisation of the above, the so-called subordinate settlements were established at different places on the coast line between Pulicat and Ganjam. The first settlement at Vizagapatam dates to 1682.<SUP>7</SUP> Madhavayapalem or Madopollam (1678), Injaram (1708), and Bendamurlanka (1751) in the Godavari District were likewise settled. The Coringa of the present day in the same district was ‘built’ in 1759.<SUP>8</SUP> Again, settlements were established at different times at Jagannadhapuram, now part of Cocanada, Ganjam and other places, even though trading facilities were secured much earlier, as can be seen from the <I>Farmans </I>of the Nawabs of Golconda. Incidentally it is to be noted that during his Deccan campaign in the year 1689, Aurangzeb not only conquered Golconda but also seized the English factory at Vizagapatam.<SUP>9</SUP> But, an Imperial <I>Farman </I>was obtained for the same on the 23rd April 1690, renewed again on 28th December of the same year.<SUP>10</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To complicate the peaceful career of the E.I.C., a new Company was formed on the basis of a charter from King William III of England, whose government, faced with severe financial embarrassments, was only too eager to make something out of paper and pen and ink. Thus was the ‘New English East India Company trading to the East Indies’ established on the 5th September 1698, with the proviso that the old or ‘London’ E.I.C. was to continue its operations all the same till the year 1701. Sir William Norris and Andrew Cogan were sent out as &quot;the New Company's Ambassador and Consul&quot; respectively. There was an evident quarrel between Thomas Pitt, Esq, President-Governor of Madras on behalf of the old E.I.C. and the new officers. It was resolved by the former to resettle the Northern Circars, and accordingly eight civil servants and a detachment of troops were sent to accomplish this. News reached Madras on the 6th May 1703 of the union of the two companies with Thomas Pitt as the Governor-President.<SUP>11</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The English now entered upon an era when recourse was had to arms. Early in the <I>Farmans, </I>mention was made of assistance being required of them by the Sultans of Golconda in cases of necessity. But it was not until 1747 that the English had direct access to the Nizam, as there were constant intrigues between the servants of the East India Company and those of the French who enjoyed a monopoly of influence at Hyderabad.<SUP>12</SUP> In the year 1757, the finest flower of Andhra Chivalry perished behind the walls of Bobbili in defending their honour against the hordes of M. Bussey and the henchmen of the Nizam. Orme's vivid description of this event from contemporary sources is a classic in historical literature.<SUP>13</SUP> Then began the decline of the French power. In fact, Bobbili is the beginning of the end, however successful their arms might have been there. The English just then began to test their strength in the open field. Clive ought to have taken the field. But an able general in the person of Colonel Forde won the day at the battle of Kondur in 1758, not a mean achievement for the Andhras who fought under the banner of the Raja of Vijayanagaram against the combined forces of the French and the Nizam.<SUP>14</SUP> Forde followed up the victory with a general's eye, and Masulipatam fell into the hands of the English in 1759 after a protracted siege.<SUP>15 </P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the fall of Masulipatam, English power in the Circars may be said to have been set on a secure foundation.<SUP>16</SUP> Rajamahendravaram was captured by Henry Cosby (later, General Sir Henry Cosby, Kt.) in 1769.<SUP>17</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the English never claimed the Circars as a matter of conquest. Theirs was essentially a claim by grant. This was effected by the famous ‘Request’ of Col. Forde to Salabat Jung in 1759 which was agreed to.<SUP>18</SUP> More than this, a Farman was obtained from the defunct Mughal Emperor in the year 1766, and this seems to be the ostensible source of British claims to the Circars.<SUP>19</SUP> But still the tribute to the Nizam was agreed to as due and just, though generally accumulated into arrears. It was on September 18, 1788 that the Nizam handed over to Captain Kennaway an instrument for the surrender of the Guntur Circar, after a series of shameful negotiations clearly condemned by Sir Thomas Munro in one of his minutes. Hence forwards, the English may be said to be the regular masters of the Northern Circars even though troubles beset their administration until comparatively recent times. Curiously enough, at one time Warren Hastings nearly ceded them to the Nizam for a consideration, but Lord Macartney, the newly appointed Governor of Madras of the day, fought tooth and nail with the Governor-General at Calcutta on the one hand and the Court of Directors in England on the other, to retain possession of them.<SUP>20 </P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following <I>Farmans </I>and <I>Cowles </I>are self-explanatory. I print them as I found them in the archives of the Library of the India Office, London, with a few notes, wherever necessary, to help the reader, as almost all the place-names contained therein are familiar to the Andhras whatever their spelling and transliteration.</P>

The particulars are these which are mentioned according to abdulla and abulla Hussun grant five Towns free three near Pollicat and two near Metchlipatam. Pollicat Towns are Eer Caum, Maucha Warrum, and Warra Waccha. Metchlepatam Towns are Pollicull and Coonfere and according to their former Grant they desire to have their share of the customs of Pollicat and the liberty of a Mint which I have granted them. –Every candy pays 4 pagodas and a 1/8 –The Government is to have 2 pagodas 7/8. the Dutch 11/4, The smaller Customs and equal Dividend after the officers charges are deducted; likewise Bale Goods that amount to 4 Pagodas a bale custom some lesser and some at 11/4 an equal Dividend Bales of Long Ells qt. 20 Ps. that come out of the Country paying 3/4 custom an equal share. What Els is sold in the Town 2 part's custom to the Government; and one to the Dutch; Ground Rent equal shares; likewise the mint and all goods imported and transported and coinage of Silver Gold and copper being 3/4 custom and the same in all Merchants money brought into the mint and what Goods the Merchants bring into Pollicat or buy to carry out equal shares –For Metchlipatam according to their former custom, Inland Trade custom free and Oxhire five pagodas they desire to pay but 4 according to their former Grant; so all this I have gave them according to their request and that they shall only pay their Oxmen as they shall agree with them; and that they shall not be molested by any officers on that account. The Dutch have had the Fort of Pollicat a great while so that the Portuguese have nothing to do with it. If any broils or quarrels should arise in that place I order that it shall be decided by the Dutch and Governor; but if of great consequence to the Suba of Golconda as formerly they used to the King. Golopollam and Coonda Warrum, near Dasheroone they kept Washers here paying for the two places one hundred fifty pagodas yearly and have now desired to pay no more according to the old Grant; which I have consented to, and that no officers whatever shall molest them nor their people; at Nasapore they have a piece of ground and a House upon't for the conveniency of building Ships and a place for their carpenters and Smiths; and if any of the same trade should come and live there they shall not be molested by any officers; all which I grant as by their old custom. The Washermen in Nassapore that used to wash for the Dutch paid three pagodas yearly for their house which they must still pay. There's Mash Warrum near Metchlepatam where are forty houses washermen lived in (till the famine and death drove them away) having now but six left, they paid three Rupees a year, the Rent was in the Dutch power, so none must hinder their washermen; and if at that place they should want water they may go to and wash there and none shall hinder them upon no account. They like wise desire to be free of all customs as by their former Grant which I consent to–For Coolies &amp;c. they must pay as other Merchants, and the Coolies and Lascars that work at the Barr Town or Seaport Towns must be paid same. The Road custom from Bimlepatam, Siccacull, Burrada, Ellore Rajamihendrum, Dasheroone, Pollicull, Naugoole Wuncha. Policat and Metchlipatam for provision I grant them free, and the same for all manner of merchandize imported or transported of what commodity so ever. If they sell any Bullion of Gold or Silver to any of the Merchants they must be allowed the difference of the Mint by them, as if they had coined it themselves; and if they coin it themselves must pay half charged of the 3/4 custom and difference of Policat and Madras Pagodas. I have also that their Merchants, Factors &amp;c. shall free of Guddam, that imposition of taking by force grain at the officers price.&quot;</P>

is no wonder, in whatever language Indians write, that their national themes
and ideas–notions and beliefs–creep into their creative art. And it is no
exception with regard to Indian writing in English. One of the peculiar
excellences of Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span> literature is that it is
rich with <span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span> thought which has attracted and
charmed the West immensely. While the scope for philosophic musing through
direct expression is ample in poetic rhythm, certainly it is limited in fiction
wherein the main concern is to present, in vivid hues, pictures of social
life–the bright and black in society, primarily in terms of a plot. Only an
able artist like <span class=SpellE>Mulk</span> <span class=SpellE>Raj</span> <span
class=SpellE>Anand</span> or R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> can fit
philosophy into his plot in a natural way <span class=SpellE>moulding</span> it

excellence in the work <span class=SpellE>Anand</span> and <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>,
two of the top-ranking Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span> writers, is in
that they could blend splendidly philosophy and commonplace themes. In other <span

plots in their novels. The Indian sense of salvation, as it were, knowingly or

mature novels of <span class=SpellE>Anand</span> and <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
portray this theme in suggestive terms with <span class=SpellE>chiselled</span>
perfection, while in some others of their novels we find this theme on its way
to perfection or in its raw and incomplete form. But, their approaches to the
theme are different: whereas <span class=SpellE>Anand</span> admits external
evil, evil of the society, cruelty of man to man, as the scorching torch that
affects the soul driving it to strive for salvation, what <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
has employed is internal evil-self-inflicted evil, that is, suicidal deception.
<span class=GramE>Both the views or</span> ways are, of course, based on <i>Karma
</i>Vedanta. The two great artists are doubtless experts in their own ways in
handling their chosen approach to the theme. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
<span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> novels the theme mainly revolves round a
simple central character–say, a <span class=SpellE>Gangu</span>, a <span
class=SpellE>Bakha</span>, or a <span class=SpellE>Munoo</span>, who symbolizes
the soul or spirit–whom the society exploits and tortures reducing him much,
more, most, and finally to <span class=SpellE>nought</span>. In other words <span
class=SpellE>Anand</span> charges and blames the society as the sole cause for
the lot of the ‘downtrodden and underprivileged’ with a ‘<span class=SpellE>Dickensian</span>
piquancy’ or vehemence. This is all that is found on the surface; a deep pry
would, however, reveal the latent didactic motif and symbolic theme of
salvation. A graded evolution of the theme can be found embedded, for instance,
in his <i>Two Leaves and a Bud, Untouchable, </i>and <i>Coolie. </i>In the
first novel the theme of salvation is in its hinted-at stage; here the external
evil is the cruelty of the European bosses that pesters the hero and his
family. The novel is designed as a painful tragedy dealing with the disastrous
death of the hero. <span class=SpellE>Gangu</span>, a <span class=SpellE>labourer</span>,
along with his family thrusts himself unknown into <span class=SpellE>into</span>
an evil trap, the <span class=SpellE>Macpherson</span> Tea Estate in Assam,
which can be described aptly as Earthly Hell dominated by the Europeans, where
the <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> are literally put to tortures and never
let go out. He suffers much; his wife becomes a victim to malaria; he himself
embraces tragic death, shot dead in his attempt to protect his daughter; Leila,
from being raped by the lustful assistant manager, Reggie. The innocence of the
soul (symbolized by <span class=SpellE>Gangu</span>) is, to some extent, though
not <span class=SpellE>succcssfully</span>,<i> </i>hinted at, but it is lacking
in striking the purity of it.<i> </i>In<i> Untouchable </i>the span of evil
finds expansion into larger </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dimensions of the town, <span
class=SpellE>Bulashah</span>. Cruelty is presented in the form of caste-hatred.
The hero of the novel is <span class=SpellE>Bakha</span>, a tiny young boy of
eighteen, who has to perform the strenuous job of cleaning rows of latrines
many a time, daily, single-handed. The novel narrates a day’s experiences of
the hero: the boy perceives Kali <span class=SpellE>Nath</span>, the priest, in
lust, making improper suggestions to his sister, <span class=SpellE>Sohini</span>,
which infuriated him; he attends painfully the marriage of his friend’s sister
whom he has been barred to marry simply for the reason that she belongs to a
higher caste than his own; that he has scored a goal in a hockey match played
in the afternoon against the Punjabis lead to a free fight; trying to lift up
an injured child, he has to court rebukes for having polluted the child; and,
finally, when he returns home his father, <span class=SpellE>Lakha</span>, the <span
class=SpellE>Jemadar</span> of the town sweepers, charging him with the guilt
of idling away time, necks him out with which ‘<span class=SpellE>Bakha’s</span>
cup of frustration and misery is full’. Consequently, towards the end of the
book the frustrated boy is seen in a state of bewilderment and awe with his
mind torn between extremities–whether to embrace Christianity to end his caste
restrictions, or to remain in the hope of Mahatma’s casteless or creedless
society or the future advent of the machine that cleans human dirt and animal
dung. Selecting a young eighteen year-old boy as the hero, who is scarcely
aware of, or just beginning to understand, what are called sin and evil, <span
class=SpellE>Anand</span> makes the boy symbolize the pure and semi-innocent
soul or spirit that suffers suffocation under the heavy weight of external
evil; suffering nourishes spiritual anguish; yet the spirit is hardly ripe for
salvation with the flame of hope for life still burning within. The soul is
left in a state of a sort of mystic dilemma in the <i>Untouchable. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> handling of the theme
of salvation reaches its apogee in his mature novel, <i>Coolie; </i>the
treatment is simply superb. Really, it is the prose epic of modern <st1:country-region

expanding both in time and space. It presents the biography of a young

boy who wants to <span class=GramE>thrive</span> runs from place to place, to
escape from one place of evil to another; wherever he goes he is exploited,
made to starve and suffer. It is something like the soul’s journey through a
life’s desert–where there is all trouble, wild winds, sand- storms, hot sands
and scorching heat–running after hope for salvation. <span class=SpellE>Munoo</span>,
indeed, comes across some oases, oases-like good characters, in his journey of
life, who are also disabled in the hands of the greedy, well-to-do and
high-handed members of society. All this forms the superstructure or the
spectacular part that meets the eye immediately in concrete terms. But, the
basic core, the grandeur, of <span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> art is the
latent theme of salvation embedded. <span class=SpellE>Munoo</span>, the
innocent orphan-boy–who knows, nor tries to know, no evil short-cuts to thrive–symbolizes
the pure and simple soul; external evil, exploitation or cruelty of society,
haunts the soul; frustration and ever-increasing physical suffering result in a
gradual spiritual advancement of the soul; the pure and innocent soul finally
attains redemption into salvation through death. In fact, our scriptures say
that the souls of children that die as children early are as pure as flowers
and reach the One untainted with sin or evil. In this novel, the symbolic theme
of salvation is unmistakably evident. The irony of fate, the note of tragic
death awaiting <span class=SpellE>Munoo</span>, is hinted at frequently, for

to Jay Singh, the village landlord’s son: <span class=GramE>‘No, never; I never

succumbs, clasps consumption and becomes weak day by day, step by step, with

on the earlier novels: the present and the past are cunningly jumbled to
produce a somewhat tantalizing effect’. The narrative technique
employed–albeit, ingenious indeed–is no alien one grafted to the plot;
obviously, it is conversant with, rather natural to, the mode of the latent
symbolic theme of salvation. The essential part of the theme is the germination
of spiritual anguish, the culmination, and the sacred redemption of the soul
through death, that is, the later half of<i> </i>the hero’s life after his
release from the prison. As a sign of the spiritual anguish set in, or
beginning to set in, the sinner is to review his sinful past and know his own
follies and foibles, when the spirit unconsciously surrenders itself to the
Divine. But, the novelist should keep on narrating the current events essential
to the theme. So, the past is presented as reviewed by the sinner, the hero, in
the first person; the present is told in the third person by the author. Quite
aptly to the theme, the present and the past are to be narrated <span

released from jail has actually intended a real life anew. But, fate hardly
allows him. It is all <i>Karma </i>driving the soul to the goal, and <span

as the transmitter to his voice: of <span class=SpellE>Raju</span>, she merely
said, ‘I felt all along you were not doing the right things. This is <i>Karma. </i>What
can we do?’ The foul career with a reaped-consequence that passed, and the

down to the river, stood facing up stream with his eyes shut, and repeated the
litany. It was no more than a supplication to the heavens to send down rain and

is, thus, obvious that whereas <span class=SpellE>Anand</span> has employed
extern evil, <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> seeks the internal evil, and
repentance as the means of purifying the soul for salvation. <span
class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> job seems rather easy for he straightaway takes up
a pure and innocent character (usually a boy) representing the soul and
concentrates much, on deriding the society as the external evil pestering the
spirit, and in laying bare the miserable lot of the downtrodden. In other words
in his novels–as in Raja <span class=SpellE>Rao’s</span>–there is much
spectacular that meets the eye at once. <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
task is rather difficult, since he (generally taking up a grown-up man as the
hero symbolizing the soul) has to present the various developing phases–the
sinner’s evil life, repentance, achieving self-awareness, regeneration, and,
finally, salvation. <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> novels provide food for
thought and meditation. The apparent simplicity poses a deceptive immaturity;
but, he, in reality, could succeed in effectively integrating the material and
the spiritual more than any of our novelists could. His novels are masterpieces
finely spun. They bear ‘the <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> trade
marks–unhurried pace, unfailing good <span class=SpellE>humour</span>,
kindliness, gentle satire.’ Both <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Anand</span> are the storytellers, <i>par excellence. </i>Both,
thus, could successfully blend philosophy and human drama, could supremely
paint the former in symbolic <span class=SpellE>colours</span> of the latter.
Dickens has exposed and scoffed at the evil society–say, in his <i>Oliver Twist</i>–like<i>
</i><span class=SpellE>Anand</span>; but what Dickens or even Hardy perhaps
failed at, or hardly attempted, <span class=SpellE>Anand</span> could achieve:
to raise human drama to the heights of spiritual significance in novel. And
what <span class=SpellE>Anand</span> has just achieved <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>

is born for justice,” said. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cicero</st1:place></st1:City>.
But what is justice? There is no more elusive or baffling term to define. One
thing that can be predicated with certainty is that it excludes arbitrariness.
The <span class=SpellE>cartman</span> in London who when asked to drive to the
Royal Courts of Justice first expressed mystification and then, as
enlightenment dawned, inquired of his fare, “Do you mean the law courts ?” was,
no doubt, not a conscious cynic. But the old joke has a sting of truth. And the
justice of the law courts may at times be a much different thing from the ideal
virtue of Aristotle’s Ethics. In his <span class=SpellE>Nichomachean</span>
Ethics, Aristotle distinguishes between natural justice on the one hand and
legal or conventional justice on the other. He observes: “Natural justice is
that which everywhere has the same force and does not exist by the people
thinking this or that. Legal justice is that which is originally indifferent,
but which, when it has been laid down, is not indifferent.” <sup>1</sup> Legal
justice according to him derives its force from being laid down as law, <i>whether
just or unjust, </i>whereas natural justice derives its force from what is
based on human nature everywhere and at all times. While, in his Rhetoric,
Aristotle advocates appeal to universal law where the written law tells against
a party, and appeal to positive law as against unwritten law whenever the
former supports him, in his Politics, he definitely identifies justice with positive
law. He said: “For justice is a political virtue; by the rules of it, the State
is regulated, and these rules are the criteria of what is right.” </span><span

justice be done, though the heavens fall,” is a time-<span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
precept. But it would be difficult to postulate an objective definition of
justice. <span class=GramE>Unrelated to political ideals.</span> Legal theory
may formulate political ideals in terms of justice. It cannot however provide
any magic formula of justice which can state once for all what is just and what
is unjust. <span class=GramE>Aristotle points out that justice demands equal
treatment of those equal before the law.</span> But it will be for each
political order to prescribe who are to be</span><b><span style='font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>treated as equals or
otherwise. It is a function of positive law to state who is equal before the
law. Matters like the status of armed forces and civil service, the civic and
political rights of citizens and aliens, limitations on franchise, have great
political and juristic significance and are indisputably and closely bound up
with the political and social conditions of the period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

utility as a component in the con</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cept of law is pressed
into service. Broadly speaking, equality is <span class=SpellE>generalisation</span>
and utility is <span class=SpellE>individualisation</span>. Justice in the
concrete requires the striking of a just balance between individual and
community. It has to achieve a synthesis of these two conflicting factors. Even
the highly individualistic economic philosophy of <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span>
<span class=SpellE>recognised</span>: “The principle of equality requires that,
so far as may be, without taking away the inducement to productive Industry and
frugality, the opulent few should be precluded from doing injury to the
indigent many, by means of the power necessarily and properly attached to
opulence.”<sup> 2</sup> It is in the imparting of concrete content to justice
that political ideologies have in the past been a deciding and decisive factor.
Lord Wright once observed: “Law is not an end in itself. It is a part in the
system of government of the nation in which it functions, and it has to justify
itself by its ability to sub serve the ends of government, that is, to help to
promote the ordered existence of the nation and the good life of the people.”<sup>2</sup>
Law is obviously concerned with a number of things, politics, economics, social
life, ethics, etc. The ultimate direction given to it no doubt depends on the
underlying political ideology, but the latter will have no significance if
unsupported by solid social foundations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Soviet legal theory takes the matter further. Its approach to the problem of
justice is different. According to it law call never <span class=GramE>be</span>
higher than the economic structure of society. It points out that while it is
true that law not only reacts on economics but is also influenced by various
forms of social consciousness, like religion and philosophy, it is economics
that really dominates and must be dominant in the concept of law, because men
must eat before they can <span class=SpellE>theorise</span> and the evolution
of productive forces is the independent variable making possible a dynamic
interpretation of society. The Soviet legal theory postulates that it is the
inherent needs of the economic system that determine the framework within which
legislation must operate and the needs it has to satisfy. Hence according to
it, so long as there is a class society there is bound to be also class
Justice. Apart from any individual or group bias due to social origin,
traditions or education, the Judges will regard it as their duty to preserve
the existing social order and its functioning. Another point brought out by the
Soviet jurists is that in as much as law in the traditional sense secures the
equality of all citizens, independently of their social origin, by generally
enforcing its rules without regard to the actual inequality of the individual
citizens </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as regards personal abilities and individual
needs, the law ceases to be a desirable method for the ultimate organisation of
social l</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ife. A different pattern of social regulation
would therefore be needed which would differ from law in the traditional sense
in content as well as in the mode of enforcement. Instead of being general the
rules of law will take note of individual abilities and needs, and will be
enforced not by a special organism separated from society through a division of
<span class=SpellE>labour</span> but by public opinion. Also what is conducive
to collective welfare should necessarily conduce to the welfare of the
individual. So the task of justice will be to defend and safeguard society from
all encroachments whatsoever and the courts of justice will be only for
inculcating discipline. Naturally the Judges who can inculcate that discipline
can only be those who are imbued with and believe in the particular pattern of
social regulation. Courts of justice are therefore to be built (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) so as to enable every member of the population to take
part in their functioning, (ii) so as to provide for Judges being elective,
(iii) so as to make the Judges independent and subordinate to law only, (iv) so
as to have the proceedings in the language of the particular region, (v) so as
to secure publicity and immediacy, and (vi) so as to enable an accused to have
facilities to defend both in a material as well as in a formal sense. The
courts will have little to do with individual rights or<i> </i>privacy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in those systems of legal thought where the function of law is taken to be to
strike a just balance between private interests and public good, it has been
recognized that any amount of constitutional safeguards cannot by themselves be
sufficient, or do away with the need for a large amount of discretionary
authority, and that, in fact, under modern conditions, no government can
function without it. The real task is therefore to <span class=SpellE>canalise</span>
and control the direction and sweep of such authority. While theoretically <span
class=SpellE>emphasising</span> that Justice is the highest, the most certain
and assuredly the most durable interest of all, in practice the contrast is
drawn between justice and expediency. In the felicitous language of Lord <span
class=SpellE>Atkin</span>, “convenience and justice are often not on speaking
terms.” It is therefore all the more necessary that the Judiciary should have a
corrective jurisdiction against abuse of the discretionary authority by the executive.

function and form of judicial independence as found in the different countries
differs widely. In some countries it does not exclude the election of Judges.
In some it is regarded as compatible with the existence of a Ministry of
Justice exercising control on the administrative side of justice including

taken to be consistent with a sociological interpretation of laws. While Judges
can seldom be pioneers of social progress; they can and often do play a large

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This, however, is a
relatively small matter. A Judge can help social progress in various ways. He
can draw attention to the <span class=SpellE>obsolence</span> of an existing
law or to the inadequacy of an existing law to satisfy the legislative or
social ideal which inspired it. In America, for instance, where the ideal of
freedom of contract is basic in the structure of its laws, it was some of the
Judges that pointed out how the transformation of the country from a State of
pioneer farmers into a State of large-scale industries required a corresponding
re-interpretation of the ideal in contracts as well as in executive and
legislative measures. It is again familiar knowledge that in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> also
where the ideal of freedom of contract was fully believed in, it was the Judges
who pointed out how at a particular point that freedom would become a travesty
and accordingly readjusted the law relating to restraint of trade. Again, a
Judge may often give an impetus to social progress by his interpretation of
rather widely framed legal principles in accordance with changing conditions.
The Judge will also be facilitating social progress when by reason of his
contact with reality he finds a law to be bad or oppressive or conducive to
misery and draws pointed attention to the need for a change in the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is sometimes said that a Judge reaches by a hunch his decision as to what is
fair or just. It is often found that a technical interpretation or literal
application of a rule is not satisfying. And in the case of administrative
bodies or tribunals wielding quasi-Judicial powers, their decisions may, on
occasions, <span class=SpellE>savour</span> of arbitrariness. In all such
cases, both in <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> and
in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States of
  America</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the necessary corrective is sought
by invoking what has been variously described as principles of natural justice,
equity, universal reason etc. One distinguished English Judge, no </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>doubt,
referred to the principles of ‘natural justice’ as “that vague jurisprudence
sometimes attractively styled ‘justice between man </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
man’”<sup>4</sup> and proceeded to describe it as “sadly lacking in precision.”<sup>5</sup>
Apropos of it, Lord Wright remarked: “So it may be, and perhaps it is not
desirable to attempt to force it into any procrustean bed.”<sup> 6</sup> The
noble Lord suggested that the term natural justice seems to be used in contrast
with any formal or technical rule of law or procedure. There is general agreement
that what is compendiously called ‘natural justice’ stands for the following
requirements: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) opportunity should be given to the
concerned parties to be heard before any final decision is taken against them,
(ii) a person cannot be a judge in his own cause, (iii) every decision should
be reached in good faith, and (iv) in whatever manner evidence is taken a fair
opportunity should be given to the opposite party to contradict it. Even in
regard to administrative decisions or decisions of statutory bodies, conformity
to the requirements specified above is generally insisted on. In <span
class=SpellE><i>Spackman’s</i></span><i> case, </i><sup>7 </sup>Lord <span
class=SpellE>Selborne</span> L. C. observed: “No doubt, in the absence of
special provisions as to how the person who is to decide is to proceed, the law
will imply no more than that the substantial requirements of justice shall not
be violated. He is not a judge in the proper sense of the word, but he must
give the parties an opportunity of being heard before him and stating their
case and their view. He must give notice when he will proceed with the matter
and he must act honestly and impartially and not under the dictation of some
other person or persons to whom the authority is not given by law. There must
be no <span class=SpellE>malversation</span> of any kind. There would be no
decision within the meaning of the statute if there was anything of that sort
done contrary to the essence of justice.” Reviewing the cases where principles
of natural justice have in the past been invoked, H. W. R. Wade sums up the
position thus: “A long line of decisions extending back for more than a century
show that the courts have reviewed even administrative decisions affecting any
individual’s rights or liberties, if the party to be affected has not first
been given a fair opportunity to make objections. The court could not, of
course, review the substance of the decision but could control the procedure
preparatory to the decision and require a certain standard of fairness. This
was always regarded as a wise and important general principle which would yield
only to a plain intention to the contrary in a statute creating a power.
Through this, the official endowed with power is kept in the light leading
strings of fundamental justice.”<sup> 8</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
controlling too aggressive an exercise of individual right where it would injure
public interest, the English Judges have applied the doctrine of public policy.
The principle of public policy has been a fundamental agent of legal
development. The principle has been described as a principle of law which holds
that no subject can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to
the public as against the public good.<sup> 9</sup> According to Lord <span
class=SpellE>Atkin</span> the doctrine could only be invoked in clear cases in
which harm to the public is substantially incontestable.<sup> 10</sup> While in
internal English law its function has been disabling, as a criterion<i> </i>of
the applicability of foreign law before an English court its function has been
enabling and far reaching. Principles of personal freedom, monogamous character
of marriage, freedom of trade, discrimination against illegitimate children
etc., have all been held out in the name of public policy to exclude foreign
law. Public policy has thus become a reflection of the general ideological
foundations of English law and constitutes in the hands of the Judges a potent
agency of social progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in no other country has the law, and through it<i> </i>social life, been so
largely affected by higher law principles based on a specific interpretation of
natural justice as in the United States of America. There the Constitution has
set forth certain fundamental principles and linked them up with judicial
progress. The Supreme Court is made the watch-dog and guardian of the
Constitution against executive as well as legislative invasion. And it has been
shown that in the interpretation of the “due process” clause in the 5th and
14th Amendments, economic doctrines could be applied under judicial cover. It
was through the opinions of Judges like Holmes, Brandeis, Stone, <span
class=SpellE>Cardozo</span>, Frankfurter and others that in course of time a
proper legal perspective fell to be attained, which <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
that regulation of social life is a matter for the legislature and not to be
attempted by the Judiciary. As a requirement to which acts of the legislature
and, executive should measure up, the “due process” clause, though described as
a “gossamer concept”, has been held to involve according to Willis (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) notice, (ii) opportunity to the affected party to be
heard, (iii) an impartial tribunal, and <span class=GramE>(iv) an</span>
ordinary course of procedure.<sup> 11</sup> The doctrine of due process thus
seems to measure up in this respect to what is understood generally as the
essentials of natural justice. The application of the “due process” clause in
practice by the Judges has not been uniform and has often been puzzling to
non-Americans. Carl Swisher Brent points out that there are three well-marked
stages in the application of the doctrine. During the first period covering
roughly the first century of government, the due process clause was interpreted
principally as a restriction on procedure and largely on judicial procedure.
During the second period extending roughly speaking to the end of 1936, “due
process” was expanded to serve as a restriction upon the substance of the
activities in which the government might engage, and during the third period,
the period subsequent to 1936, the use of “due process” as a substantive
restriction has been largely abandoned, leaving it principally in its original
status as a restriction on procedure.<sup> 12</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

at any moment is What the Supreme Court makes of it. The Indian Constitution
has however provided for the complete independence of the Judiciary, and the
Supreme Court has been invested with powers and jurisdiction to protect the

constitutionality of legislative enactments. In <i>A. K. <span class=SpellE>Gopalan’s</span>

that the last power will not justify the court in imposing any limitation on
the general powers conferred upon the legislature under the notion of having
discovered something in the spirit of the Constitution, and the omnipotence of
sovereign legislative power cannot be limited by judicial interposition, except
so far as the express words of the Constitution give that authority. Apropos of
the position of the Supreme Court under the Constitution, <span class=SpellE>Patanjali</span>
Sastri C. J., put the matter felicitously in <i>State of Madras v <span
class=SpellE>V</span>. G. Row</i>.<sup>14</sup> He said: “We think it right to
point out<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>what is sometimes overlooked,
that our Constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of
legislation as to its conformity with the Constitution unlike in America, where
the Supreme Court has assumed extensive powers of reviewing legislative acts
under cover of the widely interpreted ‘due process’ clause in the fifth and fourteenth
Amendments. If then, the courts in this country face up to such important and
none too easy task, it is not out of any desire to tilt at legislative
authority in a crusader’s spirit, but in discharge of a duty plainly laid upon
them by the Constitution. This is <span class=GramE>specially</span> true as
regards the fundamental rights, as to which this court has been assigned the
role of a sentinel on the <i>qui vie</i>. While the court naturally attaches
great weight to the legislative judgment, it cannot desert its own duty to determine
finally the constitutionality of an impugned statute.” Article 21 of the
Constitution has provided that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty
except according to procedure established by law. This last phrase has been
held not to carry with it the implications of the “due process” clause of the
American Constitution which had an evolutionary history behind it, nor to be
synonymous with natural law. Nevertheless, courts in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> have repeatedly been invoking
the principles of natural justice in <span class=SpellE>scrutinising</span> the
validity of acts and decisions of administrative bodies, statutory tribunals
and others vested with the duty of reaching decisions affecting the rights of
persons. In setting aside the award of a Labour Tribunal as being in violation
of natural justice, <span class=SpellE>Mahajan</span> J, said: “It seem to me
therefore that the procedure adopted by the Tribunal was against all principles
of natural justice and the award is thereby vitiated and should be set aside.”<sup>
15</sup> In another case,<sup> 16</sup> in holding that there was no case for
the issue of <i>certiorari</i>, <span class=SpellE>Mukherjea</span> J,
observed: “The records of the case do not disclose any error apparent on the
face of the proceeding or any irregularity in the procedure adopted by the
Labour Commissioner which goes contrary to the principles of natural justice.”
In fact even previously to the coming into force of the Constitution, the
principle of natural justice has been drawn upon by the courts to correct
abuses and arbitrary action of various bodies exercising quasi-judicial powers
or even taking administrative decisions. The principles were held to operate
regarding expulsion of members from clubs,<sup> 17</sup> from stock-exchange,<sup>18</sup>
regarding cancellation of examination of candidates by the State Medical
Faculty without giving notice to them of the charges against them or an
opportunity to be heard,<sup> 19 </sup>regarding disqualification of a
candidate who had obtained pass marks from getting his B. A. Degree without
giving him an opportunity of a personal hearing,<sup> 20</sup> regarding
assessment to customs duty under a different item on the basis of the report of
a Chemical Examiner without giving the importer a right to be heard on the
matter or to rebut the evidences regarding convictions in violation of the
principles of natural justice etc.<sup> 21 <o:p></o:p></sup></span></p>

foregoing survey makes it clear that whatever ideal of justice is adopted, the
western ideal or the Soviet ideal, Judges have a large part to play in social
welfare and social progress. No enlightened Constitution can afford to dispense
with an independent judiciary. In the Soviet system, the Judges administer law
so as to inculcate discipline and secure the ideals of the State. In other
systems where the constant aim of the law is to strike a balance between the
interests of the individual and the interests of the community, the role of the
Judges is even more important as on the one hand being a bulwark against
executive invasion of individual rights and privacy and on the other
controlling excessive assertion of individual freedom where it clashes with
social and community interests through the doctrine of public policy. It was
revealing information that Dr. <span class=SpellE>Katju</span> gave that in
1953 as many as 470 petitions and other proceedings were filed seeking the
issue of writs of <i>habeas corpus, certiorari </i>etc., and that in 215 cases
up to the end of November such writs had been issued. This shows the extent to
which the Judiciary has come to be regarded as the guardian of liberty and
rights by the people and the confidence reposed in it by the public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

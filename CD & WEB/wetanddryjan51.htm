<h1>By Prof. N. S. PHADKE</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hira,
the maid servant, nodded to herself knowingly as she watched her mistress,
Indumati, standing before the stall of the moving wax figures in the
brilliantly illumined premises of the Industrial Fair. The Wax figures,
depicting a scene from a popular play, were drunken husband beating his wife.
The man lifted the stick in his hand. It slid down slowly, and hit the woman on
the head with a thud. The woman turned her face. Then the stick moved back, was
lifted by the man again, who brought it down once more until it struck the
woman with a clicking sound. Little Ashok, Indumati’s son, whom Hira held by
the hand, stood before the exhibition, wonderstruck, following the movement of
the stick with his admiring eyes. “Look, Ma. He will hit her now. Look.” He
called out to his mother every time the stick began to come down, “Hira, keep
looking at the man. He will give her a blow.” He pulled Hira’s hand and made
her look. “There!” he cried when the stick clicked. He wasn’t at all willing to
move away from the stall. And Hira could guess why his mother too stood gazing
at the wax figures. The scene had for her a meaning which was beyond Ashok’s
comprehension. There was a sign-board on the stall with a big lettering on it:
‘Prohibition be Blessed’. Little Ashok didn’t care to look at it; and even if
he had read it he wouldn’t have understood its meaning. How could a child know
that his father was a drunkard, and that since the coming of prohibition he had
been required to give up his drink? But his mother, Hira knew, lingered before
the wax figures because they had a secret personal meaning for her. They had a
similar meaning for Hira too. Because her father also was an addict and had
been reformed by the new prohihition law. There must be many women like herself
and her mistress, Hira thought, who must be daily watching these wax figures,
thinking of their own lives, and blessing the Government for having cured their
men of the drink habit... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Well,
Ashok,” Indumati said at last, “Let’s make a move. There are yet many other
stalls to visit. Come.” But Ashok stood rooted to the spot. “Wait a minute,
Ma,” he said, “Let him strike again just once. Let us watch it–just once more.”
“All right” his mother said, with a wistful smile on her face. The stick came
down and clicked on the woman’s head. Indumati was about to drag her son away,
when the chief organiser of the Fair happened to come along and greet her.
“Hullo!” he said, “So we have the pleasure of your visit. Did you like this
show?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gave a start when she saw him. She knew this man...She would have liked to run
away. But she couldn’t do such a strange thing. She therefore only turned her
head away. But even in so doing she looked at the approaching artist again. And
she was convinced that she had recognised him rightly...She knew this man. She
heard her mistress complimenting him “What beautiful figures you have
modelled...” And she also heard the organiser telling Indumati, “He is a great
artist, you know. And Government are very pleased that he is popularising
prohibition by his show.”...But she didn’t care to hear their further
talk...Her mind had gone back over four years, and she remembered what were
perhaps the sweetest and also the bitterest years of her life...This artist
whom the organiser was praising was then an ordinary young man...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He lived in the ‘Toy-Makers’ lane. He belonged to a
family whose profession for several generations had been that of making dolls
from rags. Rajan was a clever boy. He began to make small clay figures, and
although there was no one to guide him, he soon became known for his beautiful
clay figures. Images of God Ganapati are worshipped by the Hindus in the month
of ‘Bhadrapada’, and are in great demand in that season. Ganapatis made by
Rajan became very popular. People registered their orders two months in
advance, and Rajan’s house assumed the look of a small factory when he was busy
making Ganapatis in various sizes and poses...Hira first began going to Rajan’s
house as a servant girl whose business was to prepare the clay and to pound the
rags....</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Her father had a job as a ‘Pattewala’ in an office.
But his salary was too small to provide him with money enough for his evening
drink. It was necessary for the daughter to earn a few annas every day. It
became easier for him to have his evening drink when Hira began to work in
Rajan’s factory. He also got a fine image of Ganapati free once a year, when
the Ganapati festival came round. He was therefore quite pleased with the
arrangement...She was of a marriagable age now. But he was not very anxious to
marry her away, and lose the money which she brought home every day. So he
tried to shut his eyes to her blossoming youth...</p>

her youth and her pretty looks attracted Rajan towards her. In the beginning he
had taken her just for an ordinary working girl, not caring to look at her. But
one day something happened within him as he went near her and stood before her
just to see whether she was kneading the clay properly. Wanting to test if the
clay was sufficiently soft and even, he bent down, and looked into her face.
And in that instant he was amazed by her beauty. She had a fine nose, big, dark
eyes, and long dark tresses, sweeping back from her broad forehead, dangling in
a loose knot en the nape of her neck...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was amazed by the change in Rajan’s style of living. Formerly he had occupied
only the front portion of the house in the ‘Toy-Makers’ lane. But now he also
owned the tiled courtyard beyond it and the rear portion of the house which
opened into another narrow lane. The front portion was occupied by his studio
and factory. The room on the first floor overlooking the courtyard was used as
a living room, and the spacious but dark building beyond the yard presented a
look which utterly puzzled Hira. And she was simply astounded when Rajan
explained to her what the place was being used for. For a moment she couldn’t
believe him, and kept staring him. “Rajan, are you mad?” she whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the poor who go to Jail. Men who can block the way to prison by spreading
bricks gold are never caught. You too can become rich, if you join me this. You
will be an ideal help to me, taking this stuff secretly to big monied men who
thirst for it. This is a gold mine, remember.” He waved his hand at the
distiller and the utensils and tubes in the half-dark room.</p>

shook with fear as she looked at that ‘Gold Mine’...So Rajan ran a secret
liquor distillery...The place was indeed ideally suited for the business. There
was Rajan’s Studio in the front part of the house. Who would suspect the
existence of a distillery in a respectable house like this? The rear portion of
the house had a door opening into a narrow by-lane so that liquor could be sent
out without anybody’s noticing it. Rajan had earned the Government’s goodwill
as a supporter of prohibition by his exhibition of wax figures. He wore
handspun ‘khadi’. Who would ever think it credible that there was a distillery
in his house? The whole thing was indeed very cleverly conceived...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rajan’s house after a couple of hours she went straight to the nearest police

“I have something very serious to report;” she said, and told him everything

be impressed by the news, and to ask her to take him to Rajan’s house. But he
did no such thing. He kept sitting where he was, and smoking. “Do you know,
woman,” he said in a threatening voice, “people are sent to jail if they give
false information?” Hira remembered Rajan’s words. Rich men are never caught,
he had told her. It was no use, she understood, arguing with this policeman.
She turned to go away. But the policeman wouldn’t let her go. “You will have to

had always wanted that someone would whip him and brand him…She thought of
telling all this to the officer…She even thought of rolling up her sleeve, and
showing him the big dark-blue scar on her arm, which had been to her the symbol
of both woman’s helplessness in this unjust world and man’s vile power to sin
and to escape punishment...She wished to show the scar to the officer, and to
confess to him that she had exposed an offender against the ‘dry’ law because
her own heart was wet with the dripping blood of silent suffering...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

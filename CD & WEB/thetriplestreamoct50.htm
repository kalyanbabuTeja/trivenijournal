Presidential address of Sri Purushottamdas Tandon at the Nasik session of the
Indian National Congress allayed the fears of those amongst us who had looked
upon Tandonji as a reactionary and an obscurantist. Since the partition of
India, he has been a consistent–and even vehement–critic of the Nehru
Government’s policy towards Pakistan. In his mental make-up he seemed to be
more akin to Khare and Savarkar than to Rajaji or Maulana Azad. It was also
well known that Gandhiji had to break with the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan because
of the almost fanatical opposition of the ‘Tandon Group’ to Hindustani as
conceived and adopted by him. To crown it all, Tandonji created a difficult
situation in the Constituent Assembly by his excessive zeal for Sanskritised
Hindi and for Hindi numerals. It was the united resistance of the Congress
members of the Assembly from the non-Hindi areas, and the eventual acceptance
of the Munshi-Iyengar formula, which averted a crisis. In the course of the
election campaign for the presidentship of the Jaipur session, the issue between
the candidates was narrowed down to ‘Hindu revivalism’ <i>versus </i>‘State
Secularism’. The Hindu Maha Sabha took Tandonji’s defeat as its own, and
similarly, right up to the eve of the Nasik session, it rejoiced over
Panditji’s success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Against
this background, and taking into account the pre-election statements of Nehru
and Mashruwala, it looked as if Tandonji’s election as President might result
in a reversal of the Congress attitude to secularism in politics and even
hasten a conflict within the Congress Executive between the Nehru-ites and the
Tandon-ites. But Tandonji went a long way to conciliate his opponents; and the
delegates to the Nasik session expressed confidence in the Home and Foreign
policies of the Nehru Government. But one crucial problem was not solved. That
related to the setting up of a special body to select candidates to the
legislatures all over India. Pandit Nehru was keen on this, but no formula
acceptable to all sections could be evolved at Nasik. This gave rise to
misgivings; and the prolonged negotiations with Nehru to induce him to join the
new Working Committee reproduced in a measure the post-Tripuri atmosphere. But
Tandonji has fared better than Subhas Bose, and, for the time being, a Working
Committee which is united on essentials can guide the Congress to success in
the coming elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
to people who are not conversant with the happenings behind the scenes, the
situation is not merely obscure but baffling. The President of the Congress is
the Executive Head of the Party which runs the Government at the Centre and in
the States of the Union. The Prime Minister is the Head of the Central Cabinet
charged with the responsibility of carrying on the administration of the
country. And just as the Prime Minister is free to choose his team of Ministers
the President of the Congress is free to nominate the members of the Working
Committee. But in both cases, the freedom is restricted in practice. The Prime
Minister chooses his colleagues in consultation with the Working Committee, and
the Congress President chooses <i>his </i>in consultation with the Prime
Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and others, who are not only the leading
lights of the Central Cabinet but also top-ranking Congressmen. Some kind of
liaison is thus promoted between the Party Executive and the Cabinet. As a
broad statement, this sounds satisfactory; but when there are ideological and
even temperamental differences between the Prime Minister and the Congress
President, an intriguing situation is bound to arise. Conventions have to grow
by which any possible deadlocks can be resolved. The nation must be thankful
that even at the last moment a semblance of peace was patched up between Pandit
Nehru and Tandonji. It is devoutly to be hoped that the peace will be a lasting
one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was for lack of a similar adjustment between the
Ministerialist group and the group that dominated the Provincial Congress
Committee in Andhra that the Congress suffered a total eclipse in that
ill-fated area. It it worth while recalling that Andhra was the first unit in
India to be accorded a separate Provincial Committee based on language. At the
Calcutta session of the Congress in December, 1917, Dr. Pattabhi put up an
admirable fight in the Subjects Committee, and, with the support of the late
Lokamanya Tilak, secured permission of the Congress to inaugurate the Andhra
Congress Committee. At the first meeting of the Committee at Vijayawada,
Desabhakta Konda Venkatappayya was elected first Secretary of the organisation.
At Nagpur, in December 1920, the whole of India was carved out linguistic
provinces for Congress purposes. The Non-cooperation, Satyagraha and ‘Quit
India’ movements found some of their most noted adherents in Andhra, and the
people as a whole played a heroic part in these movements. But, after the
advent of freedom, personal and group loyalties worked havoc in Andhra public
life. The split between the Prakasam-Ranga faction and the Pattabhi-Kala
faction has been the bane of Andhra politics. It was bad enough that the
Central Government found in this split a convenient pretext for postponing
indefinitely the formation of an Andhra State. But it was worse that the split
led eventually to the suppression of Andhra Congress Committee. At Nasik,
Andhra was represented by a handful of delegates who were deemed to have been
elected unopposed. The elections to the Congress Committees in Andhra have yet
to be held, and judging from the experience of the last two or three years,
there does not seem to be any reasonable chance of their being held in a
peaceful atmosphere. It is not necessary to apportion blame for this sad state
of affairs but people who have not learnt to swear by the leaders of either
faction, are gradually learning to swear at them all. Without intending it, the
leading Congressmen in Andhra have brought about an impasse in political
affairs, which has had its repercussions even in the literary, artistic, and
economic spheres. There is a sense of frustration in Andhra, and while
individual achievement is high, there is an almost total absence of
co-operative effort. The literary academies, the art associations, and the
joint-stock companies languish and face a slow, painful death. It is not a new
leadership that is wanted, but a spirit of harmony and friendliness between the
present leaders. Even now, it is not too late. The men at the top in Andhra
must make up their minds to restore unity or retire.</p>

<h4>The Hindi Mission</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Hindi Sahitya Sammelan is the leading cultural association of North India, and
amongst its members are to be found great scholars, poets and essayists who
have contributed to the enrichment of modern Hindi Literature. Now that Hindi
has been accepted as <i>Lingua Indica </i>for inter-State contacts, political
and cultural, the leaders of the Sammelan are touring the southern States with
a view to promote friendliness between North and South. This goodwill mission
is meeting the litterateurs in different areas and making it clear to all of
them that there is no desire on the part of the Hind-speaking people to
dominate the rest of India. There will be no intrusion of Hindi into the
internal administrative, educational, or legislative activities of the various
States of India. The Study of Hindi as a second language has to be promoted,
but each State, according to the Mission, will be free to devise measures for
this purpose. Compulsion is not a necessary element in this process, nor is it
contemplated that children of tender age should be taught Hindi before they
have progressed in the knowledge of their mother-tongue. These assurances
became necessary in South India, because there is a widespread feeling that the
growth of the regional languages might be stifled by undue importance being
given to Hindi. This was due to the vague generalities indulged in by some
advocates of Hindi. For Instance, they talked of ‘driving away English’ and of
‘Hindi taking the place of English’. Now, nobody in any non-Hindi area wants
either Hindi or any other language to take the place English occupied while
Englishmen ruled in India. Every regional language must, at long last, come
into its own, and be the vehicle for the expression of the loftiest thought and
emotion of the people. It must be enthroned in the University, the High Court
and the Legislature of the State of the Union where it is the principal
language. Hindi can be learnt as a second language and treated as the Federal
language. The question of getting rid of English does not arise. Indian
Universities will teach it compulsorily, and some Indians will write in English
as also in their own languages. The interpretation of Indian culture through an
international language like English, and more especially the rendering of the
best in all Indian literatures into English, is a vital condition of our growth
to an international level of achievement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

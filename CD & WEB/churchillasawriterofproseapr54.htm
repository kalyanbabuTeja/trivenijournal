outside <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
know Churchill as a writer of prose and a literary craftsman of a very high
order. He is widely known all over the world as a politician, statesman,
parliamentarian, Prime Minister and a successful and astute war strategist. He
is remembered as an Officer in the British Army who saw service in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other parts of the world.
This year’s award of the Nobel Prize for Literature has spotlighted him as a
litterateur, a literary artist, who all through his political career was doing
something or other to distinguish himself in the realm of letters. He is
discovered as the author of about thirty-four books which include several
volumes of original historical research and an early novel. His literary career
dates back to 1892, almost the same time as he began his career in the Army,
when his first book ‘<span class=SpellE>Savrola</span>’ was published. His
second work was ‘The Story of <span class=SpellE>Malakand</span> Field Force’
(1898) which contained his commentary on warfare and exhibited his great power
of recapturing with the gift of apt phrase the day to day events of war and
original conceptions of military tactics. He wrote an authoritative biography
of his father Lord <span class=GramE>Randolph and his grandfather the Duke of
Marlborough.</span> The world should indeed feel obliged to him for vindicating
the character of the Duke of Marlborough, so adversely <span class=SpellE>criticised</span>
by <span class=SpellE>Macaulay</span>, and placing him in a true light. Then
came to be published ‘the Story of River War’ (1899) ‘London to Ladysmith’
(1900) and ‘Pan Hamilton’s March’, which are some of the most important
examples of his war correspondence. His other </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>important works
are ‘The World Crisis’ (1923-29), ‘Unrelenting Struggle’ and ‘Into Battle’
(1941), ‘My Early Life’ and ‘Great Contemporaries’ (1937) and the five volumes
of the story of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Second World War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Churchill’s
prose works, for the sake of convenience, may be divided into three classes.
First <span class=GramE>come</span> his works written in the quiet precincts of
his study, where every point was recollected with care and stated with
deftness. ‘Lord Randolph Churchill’ (1906) and ‘Marlborough: His Life and
Times’ in four volumes (1933-38) belong to the first class and are <span
class=SpellE>characterised</span> by a design and a measured pattern, and a
particular point of view. To the second category belong his diaries and notes
written in haste amongst his multifarious engagements. ‘The World Crisis’ and
the five volumes of the Second World War come in the second category. The third
category comprises his collections of speeches delivered at different places
and on different occasions. ‘Unrelenting Struggle’ and ‘Into Battle’ should
also be placed in the third category. It should not be forgotten here that the
second and the third type of his prose works, as different from the first,
obviously have the defects of casualness, haste and absence of care in their
composition, having been written in an environment of<i> </i>breathless speed
and carking anxiety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The society he lived in and wrote for was of Balfour
and Chamberlain, <span class=SpellE>Rosebery</span> and Morley, Asquith and <span
class=SpellE>Curzon</span>. It was an <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> of persons who wavered
between the might of Imperialism and the suspicion of Liberalism. No definite
decision was made by Englishmen either wholly for this ideology or for that. They
were torn by a conflict of the opposing ideologies of Imperialism and
Liberalism. Churchill was an out and out <span class=GramE>Imperialist</span>,
one who was in the line of <span class=SpellE>Kipling</span> who believed in
building an empire and maintaining by force of arms the one already built, and
this tendency of his mind has come to be clearly reflected in his literary
activities as well. “My thought was much more in accord with <span
class=SpellE>Kipling</span> than with Bernard Shaw,” he remarked after the
award of the Nobel Prize. “On the other hand Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kipling</span>
never thought much of me, whereas Mr. Shaw often expressed himself in the most
flattering terms.” The genesis of his prose style may thus be traced to the
rhetorical flair of the Victorians, although Morley’s ‘Compromise’ had created
a deep impression on his mind. He lacks the magnificent sobriety and tranquil
poise of Morley and the profound wisdom and sharp wit of Shaw.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Style
is the thinking out of language into words. It was Newman who once declared
that thought and <span class=GramE>expression are</span> inextricably bound up
with each other. Style is the body to which thought is the soul, and through
which it expresses itself. “Of the soul the body form doth take; for soul is
form and doth the body make.” We can arrive at a definite conception of
Churchill’s prose craftsmanship, if only we examine those elements of his
prose-style which have gone to make him one of the finest writers of Modern
English prose and one of the greatest orators of all time. Churchill is A1 man
of England; the broadcasts of his speeches are heard with attention throughout
the English-speaking world, not only because they emanate from the lips of the
British </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prime Minister and represent the British
political point of view, but hearing them and noting the strange twists and
turns and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>niceties and subtle nuances of his speech, the
average man’s sense of form is satisfied. In these times of great emotional
stress, the prose of Churchill grew in abundance in the form of his speeches
delivered in the British Parliament and in his writings. All these emerged from
his heart in a continual outpouring of white-hot patriotic sentiment, like
molten lava. Churchill spoke because he must; he wrote because he had to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It
is the victors who must search their hearts”, he said towards the end of his
speech on May 13, 1945, “in their glowing hours and be worthy of the nobility
of the immense forces that they wield.” These are words most relevant to our
purpose. We must, indeed search Churchill’s heart, dive into the dark corners
of his soul, limn out the intricacies of his innermost being–for that is the
process most successful–in order to dwell upon his prose craftsmanship. For
Churchill puts himself into his words. He lays his soul bare in them. His style
is that of the man. You cannot separate his words from their context, without
completely distorting the sense of the passage, in whole or in parts. Behind
his passages it is not difficult to note the contending forces fighting in his
breast. Throughout the speech from which we have just now quoted, the two
contradictory powers of the usual <span class=SpellE>Churchillian</span>
arrogance and his pose of evangelicalism are struggling to get mastery over his
heart. As is quite natural, arrogance overpowers evangelicalism, and the speech
shows the same old Conservative, arrogant, expressing his wish, declaring his
purpose and giving an assurance to the subject people of an alien country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us not forget that Churchill is never good at hypocrisy or cant. It is
difficult for him to conceal his feelings. They must be out. Churchill is a
die-hard Tory. He is the perfect specimen of racial arrogance. His words are
marked by an antagonism of the bitterest type and an aloofness which is
killing. The following sentence from one of his speeches is indicative of his
sense of racial superiority: “The British Commonwealth stood more united and
more effectively powerful now than at any other time.” Like all imperialists
and Capitalists, Churchill takes the gains and losses as a divine dispensation.
Such and such a thing happened because God willed it. England had won the War
in Europe along with U.S.A. and Russia; Germany had been defeated. Not that
Germany was weak or England was strong, but the Fates were on the side of
England. England escaped Germany’s fate only by a fortuitous chain of
circumstances. Note Churchill’s frankness of speech when he says: “We nave
never failed to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> the immense superiority of
power of the United States in the rescue of France and the defeat of Germany”,
or, “Certainly we are in a far better state to cope with the problems and
perils of the future than we were five years ago.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Churchill
knows the art of working up a climax. He is a past master in it. Examples of
his artistic quality are many in the collection of his speeches. Here is an
example of a fine climax: “In the past we had a light which flickered; in the
present we have a light which flames; and in the future there will be a light
which shines over all land and sea.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Churchill
is a great master of words. He uses just those words which are adequate to his
purpose. Restrained when he desires to keep himself in check, he is rhetorical
and flamboyant, when the occasion demands it. Churchill’s imagination sometimes
strikes a deeper note, it takes a wider sweep. His writings and speeches are
not tuned to a single strain. His work is a mosaic of many patterns. Churchill
speaks like a poet, almost in a frenzy, in the following: “I have nothing to
offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.” Can there be words more descriptive
of war than this? These words were uttered at a time of grave danger. They did
their work, evoking a spirit of bravado and wild courage among the troops
abroad and civilians at home. Another memorable speech in the same strain was
obviously meant to inspire in the minds of the English people the desire to ‘scorn
delights’ and achieve fame: “Let us so bear ourselves that if the British
Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will still say, ‘this
was their greatest hour’. Fight on, for the glorious path of fame burn brightly
in the distance for the brave.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art,
it is said, lies in concealing art. The <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> of
the artist is always towards revealing infinity in a grain of sand. In his work
more is meant than meets the eye. This is possibly achieved by means of
suggestion. Sometimes a word or two, or a phrase, itself not pregnant with any
rich feeling, by its power of suggestion, revives a thousand memories, which
assail us by association on reading them. Churchill’s style shows this quality
in a remarkable degree. His words stir the depths of our innermost being. One
or two examples may be given here: “Never in the field of human conflict was so
much owed by so many to so few,” praise the airmen, and “Never did so mocking a
fantasy obsess the mind of mortal man” suggest a reference to the sadist tendency
and demoniac insanity of Hitler. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
a period of war a spirit of national glorification sweeps over the country from
one corner to the other. Leaders in a country shake the souls of their
countrymen, to rouse them to make glorious sacrifices. Their spirits are raised
to the highest pitch. So great is the enthusiasm that nations fight blindly
even in the face of defeat. Germany was on the brink of a colossal tragedy, but
not even a short while earlier did the German war-lords sound a note of futility,
for that would have been fatal. To inspire their fighting hordes, words of
encouragement were necessary, Churchill was leading England through the most
troublous times in its history. He proved worthy of the task entrusted to him.
Clouds loomed large on the horizon. But Churchill never lost faith in victory.
An unshaken idealism kept Churchill cheerful, in the hour of danger. And the
contagion spread all around. This note of idealism never forsakes Churchill:
“In the hour of extreme danger men’s minds penetrate to the heart of things. In
the flash of bursting bombs they see a vision of the eternally precious things
of life.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Other
qualities of Churchill’s style, which entitle him to a high rank as a speaker
and writer of English prose, are: the quotable and memorable quality of
phrases, even lines, from his speeches; their reminiscent character, (sometimes
there is an echo of Brooke, at another time a turn from Shakespeare, or even
from a memorable speech of one of his contemporaries,–for Churchill’s mind
assimilated a good deal of what he had read, and he read widely as is indicated
by his wonderful command over the English language), the originality of his
vituperation, and the array of fine words and phrases, which are brought in
again and again to achieve <span class=SpellE>marvellous</span> effects in
speech.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

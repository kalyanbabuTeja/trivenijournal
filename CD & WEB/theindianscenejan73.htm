in the Indian scene since the review made last September may as usual be
studied under two broad heads–developments in external affairs, and those in
internal affairs. So far as external affairs are concerned it is a matter for
extreme regret that our relations with Pakistan and China have not become <span

with the United States continue to be a little strained. In this discouraging
atmosphere it is a matter for gratification that our relations with
Soviet-Russia and <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>
continue to be close and friendly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

concluded nine months ago that steps would be taken to <span class=SpellE>normalise</span>
the relations between the two countries but such hopes have not been <span
class=SpellE>realised</span>. There was considerable delay even in the
demarcation of the line of control in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jammu
  and Kashmir</st1:place></st1:State> and the military withdrawal from the
occupied territories across the international border. <st1:country-region

<span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> and that this
would be followed by official level talks for the release of prisoners of war,
for the final settlement of the <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>
problem and for the restoration of diplomatic relations. But President Bhutto
has chosen to adopt delaying tactics in the matter of <span class=SpellE>recognising</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. At one stage
he expressed the view that he would do this after the March general elections
in <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> which he
tried to influence in a variety of ways. He perhaps expected that the
opposition parties would gain some strength–especially the pro-Muslim League
and the pro-China and anti-Indian parties. But disappointment over-took him as
Sheikh <span class=SpellE>Mujibur</span> <span class=SpellE>Rehman</span> was
returned with a thumping majority. Even now he is averse to <span class=SpellE>recognising</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

should be clear to him that even though it is financially burdensome to keep
90,000 prisoners of war, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will not release them unless <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span

would be forthcoming unless he <span class=SpellE>recognises</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. He is trying his
best to <span class=SpellE>mobilise</span> international public opinion and
bring pressure on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to release the prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva <span
class=GramE>convention</span> and also on humanitarian grounds. But <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is not
prepared to yield to such pressures. To her the continued friendship of <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> is far more important
than the so called international goodwill. This friendship has now become an
integral part of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
foreign policy. Peace and stability can return to the sub-continent only on the

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>President
Bhutto perhaps is unable to adopt a course which in the long run will prove
beneficial to his country because of the internal and external pressures on
him. Internally the army clique and the elitist ruling groups in the civilian
population especially in <st1:place w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place> are not yet
become reconciled to the new situation in the sub-continent created by the war
of December 1971. They still hope that with the help of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> they could take vengeance on <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Punjab
is the key Province in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
and so long as the attitude of Punjabis continues to be hostile to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span> Bhutto cannot do
much, whatever his personal convictions may be. There is also the pressure from
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
To the ruling circles in that country keeping up tensions in the Indian
sub-continent is necessary if <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
is to be prevented from becoming a major political power in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 Asia</st1:place>. They are prepared to extend any amount of military and
financial aid to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> to
make her an effective instrument for the execution of their policies, and the
President is he as unable to overcome the pressure from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> as he is
unable to meet the pressure from his own military clique. In fact the two are
closely related. There is also the influence of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> on him. This
super-power continues to regard the maintenance of a balance between <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
to be in her national interest and this is why she has resumed the supply of
arms to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This encourages Bhutto and the military clique in their hostile attitude
towards <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Normalcy in the relations between the countries is being delayed and both the
countries are compelled in consequence to divert a good proportion of their
limited resources to <span class=SpellE>defence</span> expenditure. Economic
and social development suffers. Herein <span class=GramE>lies</span> the
tragedy of the whole situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
is a feeling in the ruling circles in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
that <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> is reconsidering her
policies towards this country and that she might give up her blatantly hostile
attitude just as she did in the case of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Among the indicators
noticed by the Government of India are higher level Chinese officials attending
Indian Republic Day Reception in Peking, a more senior diplomat being posted to
head <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the<i> </i></span>Chinese embassy
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
and the Chinese officials in general in different parts of the world showing a
more normal attitude in their contacts with their Indian counterparts. These
are a few <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> straws in the wind and it is not
as yet clear how much significance has to be attached to them. It is only when
the situation is so changed as to make it possible for opening a dialogue in
regard to border disputes in the Himalayan and <span class=SpellE>Ladakh</span>
areas that one can think of closer relations between the two countries. Such a
situation might have arisen but for the Indo-Soviet Treaty of friendship. To <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> to-day
her disputes with Soviet Russia on her borders with that country are of the
greatest importance. Her foreign policy is being <span class=SpellE>moulded</span>
with a view to the settlement of the border tensions. That <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> has come closer to Soviet Russia in consequence
of the Treaty of friendship is a matter of some concern to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the
context of her relations with Soviet Russia. She knows that it is purely a
defensive treaty. In spite of this she has not chosen to substantially change
her attitude towards <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and all the moves we have so far made to bring about a change have not borne
fruit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
recent resumption of arms supply to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has retarded the pace of more normal relations being established between the
two biggest democracies in the world. All arms supplied in the past to <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> were used against <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and there
is nothing to show that they will not be so used again. It is quite possible
that the resumed supply is a part of the execution of the new policy of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> in the region of the <st1:place
w:st="on">Persian Gulf</st1:place>. All the same <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has every justification to
entertain misgivings about its ultimate effect on the peace and stability in
the sub-continent. It is true that the resumption of arms supply to <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> has been accompanied by the resumption
of economic aid to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
But this has not completely expelled the fears of this country. It is a matter
of history that Super-powers live on tensions between lesser powers. They
create tensions where they do not previously exist. This explains why <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> entertains doubts about the <span
class=SpellE><i>bonafides</i></span><i> </i>of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> in resuming her arms supply to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this discouraging atmosphere one bright spot is the victory won by the party
led by <span class=SpellE>Mujibur</span> <span class=SpellE>Rehman</span> in
the first <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>
general elections in March. His party is wedded to democracy, socialism and
secularism–the ideals which <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has set before herself. More important than this is the interest of his party
in maintaining friendship with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
We<i> </i>should not forget that there are powerful elements in <span

and pro-Pakistan and pro-Chinese. They have campaigned against <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> during
the general election. Though they have been defeated they continue to be a
force. It is in this context that the return of <span class=SpellE>Mujibur</span>

her own men or women, as chief ministers of states, the ostensible reason being
that the factions inside the Congress party were incapable of selecting proper
leaders. This method has suffered from two serious shortcomings. One was that
it interfered too much with the autonomy of state legislature parties to choose
their leaders. It came into conflict with the basic principle of federalism.
Regional sentiment continues to be strong in the country and events have shown
that in a conflict between national and regional loyalties it is the latter
that appeal to the politically conscious sections of the people. A second
shortcoming of the new method is that almost all the Chief Ministers imposed
from above had no local base of support and they showed little capacity and
willingness to build such a base. They felt that local support was not needed
so long as they commanded the confidence of the Prime Minister and the central
leadership. They cared little for their own colleagues in the council of
ministers and for the leaders of different groups in the state legislatures or
in the state Congress <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>. Even on matters
of little or no importance they sought the advice of central leaders in
preference to that of local men of influence in their own party. They spent
most of their time in making visits to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New

1967 and 1972 political instability in some of the states was due to no party
having a majority in their assemblies and coalition ministries coming into
existence. Such ministries did not last long because of internal quarrels.
Several states came consequently under President’s rule. The electorate was
consequently dissatisfied with the role and functioning of the parties in
opposition to the Congress and this was one of the main reasons for the debacle
of these parties in the elections of 1971 and 1972 and the restoration of Congress
dominance at the Centre and in the states. The electorate realized–and this is
the view of political observers and commentators–that it is only through
one-party dominance that political stability could be secured. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Recent
events have shown that even under one-party dominance it may not be easy to
secure real political stability. In Andhra the Congress majority under the
chief <span class=SpellE>ministership</span> of <span class=SpellE>Narasimha</span>
Rao failed to give stability because of factionalism inside the party. Those
who were at heart opposed to the Prime Minister’s imposition of his chief <span
class=SpellE>ministership</span>, took advantage of the controversy over <span
class=SpellE>Mulki</span> rules, started the separatist movement in the Andhra
region and brought about the downfall of the ministry and made President’s rule
inevitable. A similar situation developed in Orissa leading to the fall of <span
class=SpellE>Nandini</span> ministry followed by President’s rule. Similar
moves are actively afoot in <st1:City w:st="on">Mysore</st1:City> and <st1:place
w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place> and to some extent in U. P. also. All this is due
to rampant factionalism inside the Congress party and factionalism exists
because of the conviction that no opposition parties would be able to take the
place of the Congress however intense the internal quarrels may be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

morality has always been at <span class=GramE>a low</span> ebb in the country
and it is at the lowest ebb to-day. There is bitter struggle for power among
the <span class=SpellE>partymen</span> in Congress. This is responsible for
factionalism in the party and the attempts made by each faction to oust one
ministry in office and replace it by another. Lip sympathy is paid to ideology
and the so-called socialist programmes. When persons come into power they use
it mainly to further their self-interest and a second place is given to public
interest. When a faction or group is unable to come into power it defects from
the party. It is defection that is responsible for the fall of the <span
class=SpellE>Nandini</span> ministry. There has been a large amount of talk on
the need to undertake legislation against defectors but, as in many other
cases, the talk has not resulted in any action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

developing countries. He also refers to the widespread corruptions prevailing
in these countries as one of the forms of this indiscipline. That there is
considerable truth in his observation is borne out by the unscrupulous conduct
of the factious elements in the party in power and the unashamed way in which
politicians defect from one party to another. In very few democratic countries
do we find the kind of “defecting” “<span class=SpellE>Aya</span> Rams” and “<span

dominance has not only failed to secure real political stability in states but
also contributed to the frustration of opposition parties and their frequent
resort to extra-constitutional activities to create trouble for the party in

this leads to the conclusion borne out by the experience of mature democracies,
in the world that democracy works best only when there is a balance between the
party or parties in power and those in opposition. The question is not whether
there should be only two parties or a multi-party-system. Political stability is
possible under both systems <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>provided
that </span>parties in opposition at <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>one
time </span>have chances of coming to power later. It is this kind of
interchange that ensures adherence to constitutional norms. Our electorate is
immature as yet and does not understand the need for strong parties in
opposition. This is partly due to the parties in opposition not spending
adequate time and energy in building their strength in the electorate and in
evolving policies and programmes which really appeal to the electorate and
educating the mass of voters in the utility of such policies and programmes. If
democracy has not yet produced the kind of results which it is expected to
produce, the responsibility for it lies not merely with the Congress party
which has almost all along been in power but also with the parties in
opposition and with the electorate. It should also be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
that more cannot be expected from the electorate–illiterate and tradition-bound
as it is. The initiative should come from political parties. They should
develop more of public spirit; their standard of morality should reach a higher
level both in respect of the means they adopt to get power and influence and to
retain them. There is need for more discipline and less corruption. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

growth of violence has been another feature of the internal situation in the
country in recent months. All direct action appears to start peacefully but it
is not really so. It takes a violent form immediately. In the areas where it breaks

Bengali-speaking minority should have the freedom to use a language other than

a small editorial in a <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>
daily that led to serious riots. In Andhra the aim to start with was the
scrapping of <span class=SpellE>Mulki</span> rules but a short time later it
took the form of a demand for a separate state. Campus violence has become a

is valued primarily because it opens avenues for the peaceful settlement of
issues. Its significance is brought out by the oft-quoted statement that it
substitutes ballots for bullets. Those who rule the country under a democracy
are the representatives elected by the people themselves and not alien or
indigenous groups whose authority is imposed on them. Whenever an issue <span
class=GramE>arises</span> which needs settlement, there are various peaceful
channels open for settlement. It is open to those interested in the issue to
make representation to the government of the day. Meetings for shaping public
opinion may be held. The press may be used for the same purpose. Public
attention may be attracted through processions. If the issue is a serious one
there is scope for calling for <span class=SpellE>bandhs</span> and strikes.
There are the legislatures which serve as forums for expression of popular
opinion and also for taking action on all public issues. Is it not a folly to
resort to violence when so many peaceful and less costly methods are open for

is repeated from all platforms. Even if there is some truth in this argument,
the less costly course is to try peaceful methods first and when it is clearly
established that all such methods have failed violence may be thought of. It is
also not true that Government yields only to violence, and violence has not

is paradoxical that in a country like ours where even freedom from alien rule
was secured through non-violent co-operation under the unique leadership of

are of little significance. What the cost of violence has been was very well
brought out by Sri I. B. Ramakrishna Rao who led the 107 days marathon strike
of N. G. O’s in Andhra. He said in justification for calling off the strike: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

greater violence in carrying out its task. It is the people that became victims

for retaining such a small advantage it was worthwhile to resort to large scale

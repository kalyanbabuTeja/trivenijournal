Federation of All-India Local Authorities has recently sponsored a Goodwill
Mission to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Federation is a representative organisation comprising about 1468
Municipalities and corporations, about 678 District Boards and thousands of
Panchayats in the twenty-two States of India. It was formed about seven years
back under the name and style of “All-India Local Bodies Conference” and Sir Gulam
Hussain Hidayatulla, the Premier of Sind, was the first President. After
Partition, Srimathi Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was elected as President, and while
going out to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as Indian Ambassador, she entrusted the work to Sri R. K. Sidhwa, M P., and an
ex-Mayor of Karachi City Corporation. But ere long Sri Sidhwa himself became a
Deputy Minister at the Centre, and he laid down the office only after the
General Elections in 1952. A conference of elected representatives of the
various Local Bodies in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
was held at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
in April 1953, and Sri Sidhwa was re-elected President of the Federation
unanimously, by the one thousand and odd delegates who attended the conference
from the different States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Goodwill Mission left <st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City>
for <st1:City w:st="on">Karachi</st1:City> on the 25th November last year,
under the leadership of Sri Sidhwa, and came back to <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
on the 5th December, after touring <st1:City w:st="on">Karachi</st1:City> and
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">province</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Sind</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. Besides Sri Sidhwa, Mrs. Sulochana

the Parsi community, Mr. Md. Tahir, a Muslim M.L.A., and myself constituted the

reputed to be one of the finest cities in the East, is now the Metropolis of
Pakistan and the seat of both the Central Government and the Provincial Government

a separate Province, and negotiations are progressing on the question of
compensating the Sind Government for developing <st1:City w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:City>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
were really surprised by the enthusiasm and cordiality with which we were
received in <st1:City w:st="on">Karachi</st1:City> and <st1:place w:st="on">Sind</st1:place>,
both at the Government level and by the cross-section of the people we met. Our
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mission</st1:place></st1:City> has
evoked a spurt of goodwill and spontaneous enthusiasm for restoration of
friendly relations between the two Governments and the people. At the various
gatherings we addressed, sentiments of friendship were expressed freely and
un-equivocally, and we were assured that after the frightful happenings of the
post-Partition era, conditions had really settled down and there was a
resurgence of popular opinion in favour of establishing friendly relations with
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Emphasis was laid on the restoration of trade between the two countries and
when Mr. Mohamed Tahir, one of us, frankly but delicately pointed out that if
Pakistan was importing coal from South Africa, wheat from Argentina, matches
from the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia, and several other consumer goods from
distant European countries at uneconomic prices, it was the people of Pakistan
who paid through the nose and that a friendly India could export all these and
more with a reciprocal arrangement and at economic prices, he was loudly
cheered and applauded. Similarly when Sri Sidhwa said that the heart of the
masses on both sides of the Border was sound and it was only the leaders and
the intellectuals who were trying to keep apart the two countries, for their
selfish ends, his speech drew a spontaneous applause from the gathering, which
consisted primarily of intellectuals and leaders of politics and business. Not
content with merely appreciating the effort of our <st1:City w:st="on">Mission</st1:City>,
they assured us at different levels that such exchange of Missions would go a
long way in restoring friendship and that they, in their turn, would send a <st1:City
w:st="on">Mission</st1:City> to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after June 1954. Even the Pakistan Prime Minister, Mr. Mohammed Ali,
appreciating this gesture of ours, remarked that things had been allowed to
drift over these five years and more, and an attempt has to be made at some
time or other to check this drift, and that he would lend his moral support to
the exchange of such Missions more frequently, as, in his opinion, restoration
of goodwill and friendship between the people is bound to have a salutary and
chastening effect on the Governments also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
thing that impresses a visitor most is the rapid pace at which <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
trying to build up her industries. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Karachi</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> which did not have a
single textile mill prior to Partition, now has over 32 textile and 16 allied
textile mills in full commission, with seven more under construction. The Sind
Industrial Trading Estates, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Karachi</st1:place></st1:City>,
a Government organisation, has acquired and earmarked an area of 4250 acres of
land in the city for industrial purposes, and 100 factories of all types and
trades are now working, with 29 more under construction and 153 yet to come up.
With their labour colonies, and smoking chimneys, they constitute a fully
developed city by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similarly
in <st1:City w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:City> (<st1:place w:st="on">Sind</st1:place>),
textile mills–the largest with 50,000 spindles–a razor factory and a glass
factory have been constructed. The Government has been helping these industries
in several ways, and, to afford protection to the nascent textile industry, has
put an embargo on import of cloth. But the price of cloth in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> is so
frightfully high and the cost of living has risen so steeply, that the
Government have now decided on importing cloth worth 4 crores of Rupees, at
Government level, against which decision the mill magnates and the Press are
putting up a stiff fight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>Agriculturally also <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is advancing swiftly. The Sukkur Barrage over the Indus River, which had turned
the desert of Sind into a fertile valley of plenty, supplies perennial water to
7 lac acres of rice fields, 8 lac acres of cotton fields, and 11 lac acres of
wheat fields, with a total acreage of 38,66,251 under both Karif and Rabi
cultivation. The Barrage, constructed prior to Partition, is a marvel of
engineering skill and efficiency, and is the biggest single irrigation project
in the world. The seven canals which take off a total discharge of 46,617
cusecs of water per second are estimated to irrigate 5.25 million acres, and
the channels themselves run to a length of 6473 miles. The Barrage with<i> </i>the
canals involved a capital outlay of 20 crores and had yielded a return of 9.3%
even by 1945-47. But the <st1:place w:st="on">Lower Sind</st1:place> area is
not served by this scheme and hence the Sind Government is now putting up
another barrage near Kotri known as the “Lower Barrage Scheme”. The masonry
construction of 67 spans of 60 feet each is almost complete, and the earthern
Dam has yet to be put up to turn the course of the river, and to send it
coursing through the Masonry Dam. Though the scheme is scheduled to be
completed by about 1960, water will be supplied by about the middle of 1954 to
Kalri-bagar canal which supplies water to the <st1:place w:st="on">Lower Sind</st1:place>
area. Yet another project for producing Hydro-Electric power from the Sind
waters is in the final stages of scrutiny, and is planned to be built up with
foreign aid.</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question of prime importance and interest to us in India is the position of the
Minorities in Pakistan. Minorities constitute about 14% of the total population
of Pakistan and 25% of the population of East Bengal. Prior to the Partition,
there were over 3 lacs of Hindus as against 4 lacs of Muslims in Karachi City.
But we find hardly 4000 caste Hindus, 20,000 belonging to Scheduled castes, and
5000 Parsis in Karachi City, which has now a population of over 14 lacs.
Similarly in Hyderabad and Sukkur which had a predominantly Hindu population, we
find very few Hindus today. The Sindhis by nature are a peace-loving and
good-neighbourly lot, and it was the evacuees from the Punjab and other parts
of India that were mainly responsible for forcing out the Minorities. But it
must be said to the credit of the Sindhis, that they could avoid the massacres
and spoliation that had blighted the Country-side in the Punjab. The few that
have stayed back remained under the protection afforded by the local populace,
and their representatives who met us assured us that normal conditions have
been restored and that they are getting on well. But in the Services, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there
are practically no representatives of the Minorities, and in Sind, in
particular which was formerly manned by efficient officers </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
other ranks, this depletion is still having its effect on efficiency in
administration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
several places we visited, the question was repeatedly put by well-meaning
Moslems with sincere feeling and perplexity as to why the Minorities,
especially the<i> </i>Hindus, were still leaving Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
post-Partition events left an indelible mark on the minds of the Minorities,
and the recent happenings at Lahore aimed at the Ahmediya Moslems have a
depressing and a foreboding effect. Though the Mulla Board has been negatived,
the Constitution names Pakistan an “Islamic Republic”, in which Moslems alone
are entitled to nationality. Maulana Sultan Ahmed, President of Jamait-i-Islami
Pakistan, recently declared that his party would stand for declaring all
non-Muslims as ‘Zimmy’. According to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the Quoran there are
two types of ‘Zimmy’, by conquest<i> </i>and by agreement, and they are
debarred from military duty. The </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Maulana stated that
the ‘Zimmy’ should hold no responsible post and could only be returned to the
Legislatures to protect their sectional interests. This party consisting of
Mullas has a deeper base amongst the refugees, and this is but a sample of
unrestrained propaganda carried on in Pakistan by religious leaders, fanatics
and self-centred politicians, who vie with each other for establishing the
undisputed rule of the Quoran and the Sunnah according to their light and
tenets. The cry of “Islam in danger” is not infrequently resorted to by them to
divert the attention of the masses, and there is no knowing when the match
would ignite the powder keg. The masses are an inflammable material as of old,
and no one can foretell when and how the conflagration flares up. Like the
desert wind, the trouble starts in a corner and suddenly encompasses a whole
area with inevitable fatality and fury, and dies down with equal abruptness,
leaving behind a maddening heartache and a trail of destruction and
devastation. Those who read the signs on the wall, live under the shadow of
uncertainty and perpetual fear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Added to this, there has been a sharp cleavage
amongst the rank and file of the Muslim League Party, which alone counts in
Pakistan; and this cleavage had been accentuated by the assassination in broad
daylight of Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, the former Premier and heir to Quaid-E-Azam
Jinnah. A whispering campaign is being insidiously carried on by each group
against the other as being responsible for this open assassination, and
influential dailies like ‘The Dawn’ and ‘Evening Star’ have taken up the fight
against the Government. The Government have retaliated by withdrawing all
official patronage from these papers, and this has further sharpened the
cleavage in the ruling party Mr. Altaf Hussain, the influential Editor of ‘The
Dawn’ is out for a fight and has sworn to unseat Noon and Gurmani from their
positions of Power. In this affray no stick is too small to beat the opponent
with. The two groups vie with each other to capture the masses, by distorted
propaganda and by misquoting the Quaid-E-Azam and the Prophet. This bitter feud
has an unsettling effect on the Minorities.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sincerity and the refreshingly broad outlook of the Premier, Mr. Mohammed Ali,
is a green spot in this desert expanse, but it is felt that he is not fully
secure in his grip over the party or the people, and, at any rate for sometime
to come, he cannot but depend on the stalwarts of the party. But it is
generally appreciated by all sections of the people that, in the interests of
the country, his hands should be strengthened, but till such time as he is

recent overture of Pakistan for military aid from America has its repercussion
on the people. Any situation which sharpens the tension between India and
Pakistan casts a gloomy spell over certain sections of the people. The British
have already bases in Cyprus, Suez, Bagdad and the Jordan, and America has
contrived to secure for itself bases in Dhorum-Amer in Saudi Arabia and Turkey
in the Middle East, besides its bastions in Alaska, Formosa and the Philippines.
In their intense anxiety to complete the belt of bases round the girdle of the
U.S.S.R. and China, and to strengthen the flanks of Iran, the sick man of the
Middle East, America is bent on securing a foothold in West Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

get them all at any cost. It is equally natural for India to look askance at
this sudden change in the balance of power in the East, and apprehend danger to
Kashmir and even to its own borders in the present context of things, and
Pandit Nehru has not minced words in denouncing this alliance. All the
level-headed countries of the Middle and Far East are appalled at the
frightening prospect opened up by this sudden and determined move of America,
and the cold war, so distant to us, is now upon us. This tension, in its wake,

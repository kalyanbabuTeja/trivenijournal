<h1>BY MADAN GOPAL, Lahore</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Premchand, the veteran Hindustani writer, raised his
voice and cautioned us, as early as 1904 against the tide of Western
civilisation which, foolishly imitated by the intelligentsia of the land, was
tending the deterioration of moral standards in Indian social life, and leading
to a lamentable hybridisation of culture. The position of woman in the family
and in society early attracted his attention and forms the central theme of all
his novels that appeared before 1920 and <i>Ghaban </i>and <i>Nirmala </i>later.
As an important secondary thread, it exists in almost all the others. His
attitude, as reflected in his books and which was in line with the ancient
Indian ideal of self-denial, self-sacrifice and self-control–ideals which
placed woman on a higher pedestal than man–remained consistent throughout his
life; there was no appreciable modification. That way Premchand was a
conservative writer. But in his last novel, <i>Godan</i>, his views on the
various aspects of this problem were crystallised and are brought out with
great artistry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Miss Malati, an England-returned doctor, is a
social butterfly. She is vociferous and demands equality with man in regard to
votes and the right of courtship. Chance brings her info contact with the
philosopher Professor Mehta, who may be said to be the mouthpiece of Premchand,
and to express the author’s views. She falls in love with him and ultimately
forgets all about her ideals. But Mehta does not love her; his outlook on life
is different; he envies Mr. Khanna, an industrialist and banker who sucks the
blood of the poor labourers another prototype of John Sewak in <i>Rangabhumi</i>,
because of Mrs. Govindi Khanna, who is ten times more sensible and practical
and honest than her greedy husband. She is the ideal woman of Premchand’s
conception and has few faults, although for these qualities she has once to
leave her house, the real cause being Malati whom Khanna loves, in spite of the
fact that she merely flirts with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But Malati, or Mehta, or Khanna, or Rai Sahib form
only the second important theme of the novel: they all belong to the middle
classes, which formed the central theme of Premchand’s pre-1920 novels, that
is, till the time Gandhiji came on to the Indian stage and Premchand resigned
his job to participate in the Non-co-operation Movement of 1921. From now
onwards the central theme of all his novels was, primarily, the peasant. <i>Premasram</i>,
<i>Rangabhumi</i>, <i>Kayakalp</i>, <i>Karmabhumi </i>and <i>Godan </i>are all
agrarian novels, wherein everything else revolves round the life of the
peasant. In <i>Premasram </i>or in <i>Gosha-i-Afiat </i>(Urdu), it is his
struggle against the Taluqdar or the hereditary landlord; in <i>Rangabhumi </i>or
in <i>Chaugan-i-Hasti </i>(Urdu), the struggle is against the
pseudo-nationalist industrialists; in <i>Karmabhumi </i>or in <i>Maidan-I-Amal </i>(Urdu),
it also envelops the Harijans and the labour class in the fight for the
vindication of their rights. The shame-faced and ruthless exploitation of the
peasant by the moneylender is the theme of <i>Godan</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The last of his agrarian epics, <i>Godan</i>, is
also the last of Premchand’s novels, published in the year of his death, 1936.
And it is his best. For its characters are more Chiseled, polished and
realistic, the plot more coherent, although herein, as in most of his novels,
the two main themes run parallel to each other and touch only at a few points
and that too only at the surface. The ideas are more systematically arranged
and the dull monotony of long speeches and harangues is broken by the periodic
criticisms and interruptions by Pandit Onkar Nath, the editor of the <i>Bijli</i>,
and in the speech of Mr. Mehta on women’s demand for equality with man.
Premchand’s art is seen here at its best. Unlike far too many of his novels,
wherein the characters die unnatural deaths, by epidemics, suicide, murder or
drowning and far too many improbable happenings and coincidences take place, in
<i>Godan</i>, these defects cannot be pointed out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Besides, the language herein used is unparalled in
homeliness, vivacious simplicity, spontaneity and suggestion. There is the
excellence of style and narration. The novel is quick with the rhythm of life.
Those messages wherein the author expresses his own philosophical or
metaphysical reflections are superb, because, although they are polished and
finished to a great degree, the language used is very simple. Rural and homely
words come to him without the least effort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In all his novels that preceded it, idealism almost
always swayed him. Herein realism and its twin-brother, pessimism, are
predominant. In all his novels before <i>Godan</i>, he created idealist heroes,
Premshankar in <i>Premasram</i>, Sur Das in <i>Rangabhumi</i>, Chakradhar in <i>Kayakalp
</i>and Amarkant in <i>Karmabhumi</i>, all of whom bear the indelible imprint
of Gandhi and Tolstoy. Valiant fighters against tyranny, inspired by the
highest and noblest ideals of love and service of the down-trodden masses whom
they organie for mass-scale satyagraha, they always pursue, undeterred by the
sacrifices they are called upon to make, the path of Truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Perhaps the only idealist character in <i>Godan </i>is
Prof. Mehta, who is sagacious, but verges on eccentricity, and he figures only
in a minor theme in the story. Save one very isolated strike in Mr. Khanna’s
mill, there are no strikes, let alone mass movements. One wonders if Premchand,
in his last days, lost faith in the efficacy of non-violent struggle. And if he
did not lose his faith, he at least came to entertain some doubts about the
same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Unlike all other agrarian novels, <i>Godan </i>does
not end in a compromise, in the triumph of the peasant. As a matter of fact,
herein Premchand refrains from suggesting any solution to any problem, an idea
so dear to his heart. He had absolutely no faith in votes for the peasant, in
Councils, in elections and in popular ministries (they had not come into
existence then, and Premchand had before him only the 1919 experiment.) They
could not ameliorate the lot of the peasant. He makes Tanakha say that
democracy is the rule by the big bankers and traders. The futility of rural
reconstructions, a fad started in those days, is reflected in what Malati,
after her conversion and dedication to a life of service, achieves. She
analyses the problem of rural indebtedness as being due to fragmentation of
land and the extravagance of the peasant on social functions; But she suggests
no real solution. She merely employs Gobar as a <i>mali </i>and gives him a
rather privileged position in her family; it is more or less by way of charity.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>When we first meet Gobar, we find him a rebellious soul.
We hope that, like all other characters of Premchand, which are dynamic and
never static, changing with the changing environments and always developing the
traits talent in them. Gobar would grow into, perhaps, a Socialist leader and
would organise people for a struggle against moneylenders and the system which
grinds down the peasant into a paste. Our hopes are, however, belied. Gobar
becomes a part of the system which victimises the peasants and against which
Gobar was to raise voice. Instead, he now hates the village and prefers to be a
poor servile labourer in the town where, in the first instance, he carves out a
place for himself. He earns some money and lends it to others at exorbitant
rates, which, if the moneylender charged from Hori, perturbed Gobar. In a way
he becomes a cog in the machine which is responsible for Hori’s ruination and
ends in his death. But could Gobar help it? Perhaps not, for, as Premchand
says, in the society as it is constituted to-day, either one is an exploiter or
is exploited. There can be no third alternative. The only solution of the
problem, Premchand said, was a thorough shake-up of the present system. And
till that comes the peasant’s fate would be the fate of Hori. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Hori’s is the most realistic characterisation in
Premchand’s works. It is indigenous to the Indian soil. Hori is not merely an
individual; he is the representative of a class, whose virtues and failings he
shares. If you know Hori intimately, as you actually do from <i>Godan</i>, you
know almost everything important about the peasant in India, for the U. P.
peasant is not much different from, say, the peasant from South India, as also
about the class or stratum he comes from. Indeed, Hori is the class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is significant that <i>Godan </i>is a romance in
ugly names. Hori, Gobar, Jheengur, Dhaniya, Paniya, Jhuniya, Nokhe Ram, Magru
Shah and Chuhiya–all bring to our mind their proximity with the soil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To Hori, ideas count for little. For him feelings
and instinct are the only real things. Realism is the backbone of his life. He
does not believe in Gobar’s reasoning, which may all be very sound, but cannot
be put into practice, because Hori’s ancestors did not act that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gobar resents Hori’s kowtowing before the Rai
Sahib, when he enjoys no concession and pays almost the same taxes as others
do. But Hori knows that his mere visits to the Rai Sahib raise him in the
estimation his fellow-peasants. Indeed, without any teachings of Dale Carnegie,
he is the master of the engineering of the human mind. He is clever that way;
he sympathises with Bhola, in the latter’s difficulties in re-marrying, and
promises to help him–all this because he has an eye on one of Bhola’s cows, an
objective wherein he ultimately succeeds. By speaking highly of middle-aged
Dhaniya, he tickles her vanity, so that she may give hay free of charge to
Bhola without any fuss. All this is instinctive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sheet-anchor. He is a slave to custom. He believes in things, he acts, he
behaves exactly in the same way as did his forefathers and does so because they
did so. He does not have anything, not even a rupee, to offer at the altar of
the idol at the annual “Katha” and feels remorseful, not because he is poor but
because he could not offer anything, his mite at the altar of God, whom he
truly fears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the Council of Five may be wrong. Nevertheless, its orders must be obeyed:
“In Council of Five resides God.” And he obeys its orders because its orders
had always had the seal of sanctity which was respected by his forefathers. And
if he disobeyed, the family’s <i>izzat </i>was at stake. So when the Council
actually fines him Rs. 100, almost his entire produce of the season, for giving
shelter to Jhuniya, a widow whose hand had been accepted by Gobar <i>in camera</i>,
and who had no other place to go to with her five months old burden, knowing
that he is already under heavy debt, he borrows money to pay the fine. Besides,
his children are starving. And he also knows that those who have fined him are
fornicators themselves. Still, Hori cannot, must not, defy the Council. It had
the seal of sanctity and custom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pained. He is even restless and sends an emissary for him to come and have a
look at it little knowing that Hira is jealous and harbours sinister designs on
the animal. He poisons the cow and, because of the crime, leaves home. By doing
this, however, he has sealed the fate of Hori, for the death of the cow is only
the signal for calamites after calamities. Hori has seen Hira approaching the
cow in the dark with his own eyes. He does not report to the police, and when
police does come he swears by his son that he has not seen Hira near the cow.
To his already heavy debts he adds more by borrowing more money to bribe the
police, so that they may not search the house of Hira, because Hira’s <i>izzat </i>is
his own <i>izzat</i>. During Hira’s absence, Hori first tills and cultivates
Hira’s fields and then is own, for he asks who else would help Paniya if he did
not. As a result whereas there is plenty in Paniya’s house, Hori’s own children
starve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

working at midday in the hottest month of the year. He lives under conditions
of forced and convict labour. Life for him is no <i>feast</i>; it is not work

others’ battles, others who would stop at nothing short of devouring him. There

literary gifts too and writes occasional skits. At heart, he says, he is a
Socialist, believing in the nobility of manual labour and recognising the
inherent injustice of the present system. But that is theory; in practice he is
not a whit different from other brutish landlords. When the labourers refuse to
give “begar,” he is wild with rage. When the mercenary editor of the <i>Bijli </i>voices
the grievances of the peasants, he shuts the editor’s mouth with subscription
for a hundred copies. He raises 500 rupees from the poor peasants to be spent
on drinks, though the party is in connection with “Dhanush Yagy.” Again, when
Hori is fined by the Council of Five he feels that injustice has been done to

is dark; he sees no way out; all his senses are dead and dulled; before his

is dead. His eyes are without a beam. At dusk, jackals roam about his house.

out to them: ‘Brethren, I deserve your pity. I never knew what the June heat or
what the winter chill or rain was. Dissect this body and see if there is life
in it. See how hard it has been kicked to pieces and trampled under foot. Ask
it: ‘Have you ever known what comfort is? Have you ever enjoyed shade?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

expected. He is heavily under debt. To earn his bread and to pay the interest
on the loans, he has been forced by circumstances to take loans and these are
ever piling up, he makes ropes by night and works on double shift as a labourer
on the road, for now only that is left to him. After days of semi- starvation,
one day he collapses on the roadside, to be brought home to die. There is no
money in the house to send for the doctor. And now again, the moneylender comes
this time in the shape of the heartless brahmin, with the sanction and
authority of religion and custom behind him. Pandit Data Din says: “The end is
come. Let Hori give away a cow with his dying hand to seek his salvation.” But
there is no cow in the house, nor is there money for it. There are only 20
annas in the house, the previous night’s earnings. Dhaniya brings it, puts it
into the hand of the brahmin and says: “Maharaj, there is no cow in the house,
not even a she-calf. And there is neither money, save these 20 annas, which is
all that is left in the house. This is his <i>gaudan</i>.” She faints: Hori
dies. The curtain drops: The novel ends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

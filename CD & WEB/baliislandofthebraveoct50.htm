style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BALI,
Literally meaning “the island of the brave”, is a small island of irregular
shape lying to the East of Java. It is less than 100 miles in length and 50 in
breadth, half of which only is inhabited by a population of a million and a
half, the other half consisting of forests and hills being left to the denizens
of the wilderness. But nonetheless this charming island, where nature has
poured forth her unlimited bounties, has a special interest for India. While
the rest of Indonesia is now Muslim, Bali, since its colonization by the
Indians in the early centuries of the Christian era, has remained mainly H</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Very
little is known of the early history of Bali. The first historical name we come
across in the inscriptions of the early 10th century is that of Ugrasena, the
ruler of Bali. Towards the end of the same century, Dharmavamsa, the king of
Java, conquered Bali and appointed Udayana, a Balinese nobleman married to a
Javanese princess, as his Governor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
offspring of this union was Erlangga, a name famous in Javanese history, who
after passing through many vicissitudes of fortune conquered Java in 1035 A.D.
and became the combined ruler of Java and Bali. During the next three centuries
Bali had a chequered history, sometimes as an independent kingdom and sometimes
as nominally subordinate to Java, until it was overrun in 1343 A.D. by Gaja
Mada, the famous Prime Minister of the Majapahit rulers, and annexed to the
Javanese empire along with many other islands of the archi</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was a turning point in the cultural history of Bali, as from this time onwards
it came under the direct influence of Javanese culture. Towards the end of the
15th century, not able to withstand the onslaught of Islam, the last Majapahit
ruler, together with the other Javanese who wanted to save their religion and
culture, took refuge in Bali which remained free from the Muslim incursion and
had preserved its independence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Bali was already divided into nine principalities,
each under a separate Governor more or less independent. A Majapahit prince,
now made himself the overlord of Bali under the title of Deva Agung with Gelgel
as the capital. After its destruction in the 17th century the capital was
shifted to Klungkung.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Dutch came into contact with Bali as early as 1597, but they did not interfere
with its internal administration till the middle of the 19th century. But in
1814, during the British occupation, Boeleleng was occupied for a short while
by the Raffles Government because of some domestic trouble. But all this time
internecine quarrels were going on among the chiefs, resulting in misrule and
continuous shifting of power. This gave an opportunity to the Dutch to
gradually bring one district after another under their own administration
through military expeditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in their midst in full regalia seated on his golden chair which was carried on
the shoulders of his trusted ministers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
first, fearing an attack, the army opened fire, but there was no reprisal. At a
given signal a priest in white robes raised his sword and struck it into the
breasts of women and children about him. When the amazed soldiers refused to
fire, the women and children begged to be killed as they preferred death to a
life of subjugation and dishonour. The prince was the first to fall and with
him were many of his brave followers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few who could be caught alive were interned on the neighbouring island of
Lambok and Klungkung was formally incorporated into the Dutch empire. With this

society is divided into four Vamsas or castes–Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaisya, and
Sudra, the same division as in Ancient India. Polygamy is not forbidden and a
man is allowed to take a wife from a lower caste but not from a higher one.
They believe in Vedas, and their principal deities are Brahma, Vishnu and Siva,
who form the Hindu Trinity, the last occupying the highest place. There is also
a host of subsidiary gods and goddesses well-known in India, besides the
numerous sea, mountain and forest deities and also wicked spirits. Their 18
Sasanas take the place of Indian Smritis and their social laws and rituals are
guided by them. The pedendas or priests conduct all ceremonies but the
Brahmans, who consider themselves spiritually higher, do not worship images in
temples. This lesser form of worship viz., idol worship, is left to the members
of the subordinate castes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
life of the Balinese is centred round their temples. Each household has special
shrines for ancestors where offerings of food and flowers are kept for the
departed. In addition, there is the common village temple which is not only
used as a place of worship but for everything connected with village community
life. The temple gates are guarded by figures of demons who are ever awake to
ward off evils. Beyond the main gate is a succession of three courtyards, each
part for a particular purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three principal ceremonies in the life of the Balinese are the teeth-filing
ceremony, marriage and funeral. The teeth-filing ceremony is confined to the
male and is performed on attaining puberty. Not more than six teeth are filed,
and unless this is done one is not allowed to hold any responsible position in
the village.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Boys
and girls are quite free to mix with one another and to choose their own mates.
But permission of the parents on either side is essential. After sanction has
been obtained comes the betrothal ceremony, when a number of relatives and
friends of both sexes visit the girl’s house with presents of clothes,
ornaments, betel leaves, and other eatables. Then on an auspicious day fixed by
the priest, the boy, accompanied by his parents and others, goes to the girl’s
house to fetch the bride. The marriage ceremony is performed by the priest in
the temple of the boy’s village in the presence of his people and the village
headman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Balinese cremate their dead and cremation is their most spectacular and
expensive ceremony. The expenses are so heavy and the auspicious moments are so
rare, that one has to wait two to three years before it can be performed. In a
rich family the body is kept mummified by a special process in a specially
built pavilion near the home of the deceased. Offerings of food and flowers
have to be made for the dead several times a day and the body cannot be left
unattended even for a minute. The neighbours always come to help in the vigil
and they have to be entertained with food and drink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day of the cremation is a great one and crowds gather from miles around. It is

offerings on silver platters and bowls; then come the Kris (ceremonial knife)
bearers in their full regalia. They are followed by another group of women
carrying the holy water, and last of all are carried the ceremonial articles
required for cremation. Most striking among the latter is the decorated
cremation tower–carved in wood and got ready at great cost after month of
labour–where the body is placed in a niche and the coffin made in the shape of
an animal (usually that of a cow), in which the body is to be cremated later,
is on view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the arts and crafts of Bali the most famous are wood-carving and silver repouse
work, both of great antiquity. The art of painting on cloth and illuminating
palm leaf manuscripts according to traditional designs are also ancient. The
preparation of Batik cloth with intricate designs, in gold when meant for
ceremonial use, is of more modern origin and acquired through Java.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Balinese are artistic by temperament. Whatever they do there is always an
artistic touch about it. There is an art even in the laying out of rice-fields
in endless terraces, watered by the age old system of irrigation. This has been
found so satisfactory that the P.W.D. have preferred not to change it. The
distribution of water is left to the water conservation associations organised
by the Balinese themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

women vie with one another in producing the most artistic arrangement of cones
of fruits, flowers and rice cakes as offerings to the temple. With very simple
materials such as banana plants, bamboos and the hearts of the cocoanut palm,
all of which they possess in plenty, they produce wonderful decorative designs.
On the occasion of the tour of the Indonesian President and the Prime Minister
of India, practically the whole of the 100 mile route was decorated with such
objects. Even the several dozen gateways which were put up on the route had as
their decorative material only leaves, flo</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

our recent visit, in every village and town were received with Gamelan music.
Boys and girls stood lined up on either side of the road shouting “Merdeka”
(liberty); in some places girls threw flowers at the guests or danced, prettily
dressed, to t</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Besides Wayang, or shadow plays, which are popular
throughout Bali and Java, Bali has its own special dances, which must be
performed in the temple courtyard and of which there are half a dozen
varieties. Ketjak or the monkey dance is the most exciting. Of the secular
dances the most popular is the Djanger, performed by boys and girls, and may be
termed the Balinese opera. Most of the stories are taken from popular legends,
both ancient and modern, and are accompanied by the Gamelan orchestra and
intermittent songs.</p>

of the oldest dances in Bali is the Radjang where the dancers impersonate the
celestial nymphs dancing in honour of the gods. This dance is confined only to
the boys and girls of the villages of Tenganan and Asak in the province of
Karangasen. These villages are the only remnants of ancient Bali and have their
own traditions which are different from the rest of the island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he stepped down from the train at the subnrban station he noticed a large crowd
in front of the station-master’s office, and also people rushing from all sides
shouting, “Hold him!” “Down with the beggar!” “Let him go!” “You will have to
let him go!” He didn’t wish to be inquisitive and find out what was going on at
the centre of the crowd. He would have liked to pass through the gate and be on
his way home. But his way to the gate was blocked, and he had to halt “What’s
up?” he asked a constable on duty, trying vainly to keep back the crowd. “These
refugees!” the constable growled, “They are always creating trouble.” “That’s
usual” he commented. “Yes, that’s common,” the constable agreed.
“Gangsters–that’s what these refugees are,” somebody said, “I wonder what our
Government’s doing. Are they sleeping?” The constable pretended not to have
heard this....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sudden demise of Mr. T. S. Eliot has removed from the literary firmament a
brilliant star that illuminated the world for over four decades. Perhaps no
other litterateur has influenced his contemporaries <span class=GramE>so</span>
profoundly as Eliot did. He has a unique place among English writers–unique in
the sense, that in him are combined poet, dramatist, essayist and, above all,
critic. In fact there was no form of literary expression that he touched and
did not adorn. To present a bird’s eye view of the services he rendered to the
cause of literature is the main aim of this essay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
man of great erudition, Eliot began his literary career as a poet. By that time
English poetry was dominated by the <span class=SpellE>Georgean</span> poets,
who were trying their best to continue the Victorian Romantic Tradition. Eliot
strongly reacted and revolted against the exoteric nature of the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Georgean</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> of poetry. He
believed that poetry ought to be esoteric. Not only in regard to the nature of
poetry but also in several other things like the language, the <span
class=GramE>usage</span> of poetic idioms, and rhythms, Eliot had something
original to say. Thus by the time he appeared on the English poetic scene,
Eliot was ready with his own theory of poetry which he had put into practice in
all his works. Poets and critics who were faithfully following the Romantic
tradition were both surprised and shocked at the views of Eliot. In the words
of Eliot himself, “The twentieth century is still the nineteenth, although it
may acquire its own character in course of time.” This affinity of people with,
and their liking for, the nineteenth century tastes made Eliot a controversial
figure in the literary world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
early poems of Eliot like “The Love Song of J. Alfred <span class=SpellE>Prufrock</span>,”
reveal him as a poet of disgust and disillusion. As Miss <span class=SpellE>Bradbrook</span>
points out, Eliot’s early poetry published during the war of 1914-18, depicts
in ironic and epigrammatic terseness the little anxieties, social
embarrassments and unacknowledged vacuity of the polite society of <st1:City
w:st="on">Boston</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>.
We discern in it little more than the atmosphere we come across in the novels
of James Joyce. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is after the publication of “The <span class=SpellE>Wast</span> Land”, in 1922,
that Eliot was <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> as a great poet. Though
there was a big controversy about the poem, its publication was hailed as a
landmark in the history of English poetry, equal in importance to the
publication of “The Lyrical Ballads.” Based on an ancient legend in which a
knight saves the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Waste</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType> from drought and restores the youth of an old
king by riding to Chapel Perilous and questioning the Lance and the Grail
(symbols of the male and female principles), the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Waste</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
presents ironic pictures of modern manners with an astonishing variety of
imagery and rhyme. The poet compares modern civilization to the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Waste</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and suggests in an allegorical manner that we can obtain youth and life-giving
rain by journeying far, questioning our condition and learning a hard lesson.
Despite the praise lavished on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Waste</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, the criticism, that
it is un-understandable to the common reader, cannot altogether be ignored. The
reason for this may be found in the anthropological background of the poem, and
in the symbols drawn from kindred myths and religions. Only those with some
knowledge of Buddhism, Dante’s works, and the Jacobean Drama can understand and
appreciate the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Waste</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, which is unique in
more than one sense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the later works of T. S. Eliot, like “The Hollow Men” and “The Four Quartets,”
we find the philosopher becoming predominant. This does not mean that Eliot
ceased to be a poet. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As Eliot himself points out elsewhere,
“though we may read literature merely for pleasure or entertainment or aesthetic
enjoy</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>ment, this reading never affects simply a sort of special
sense; it affects us as entire human beings; it affects our moral and religious
existence.” Thus he justifies the philosophic note being predominant in his
works. The main difference between Eliot and other poets is that in Eliot the
philosophic statements and poetic images are so inextricably interwoven, that
we cannot say, which is the philosophy and which is the poetry. It is by this
characteristic that Eliot’s poetry acquires universality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
Eliot began his literary career as a poet, he had from the beginning a strong
desire to write plays. As a preliminary to this he published several essays on
the technique of the drama even in the twenties. In a way during those days
Eliot was making </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>necessary preparations to write those famous
plays which were to place him in an enviable position among the English
dramatists. Unlike many of his predecessors, Eliot has chosen, and has chosen
rightly, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the poetic drama. In “A Dialogue of Dramatic
poetry,” Eliot states that if we want to express the permanent and the
universal, we should express ourselves in verse. In his view poetry and drama
are not separable elements. Eliot’s name as a dramatist will be long remembered
for two reasons. He is to a large extent responsible for the revival of the
poetic drama in the twentieth century. Though stalwarts like Shelley and Hardy
attempted poetic dramas, it is only after the production of “The Murder in the
Cathedral,” “The Family Re-union,” and “The Cocktail Party” that the poetic
drama has had a firm footing. Besides, Eliot’s dramas have a coherency,
consistency, and actability which have won for him a high place among the
English dramatists. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In her monograph on the work of T. S. Eliot, Miss <span
class=SpellE>Bradbrook</span> observes, “Had he not become the most famous poet
of his time, Eliot would have been its most distinguished critic.” As in
poetry, in the field of criticism also Eliot formulated certain principles
which he had <span class=SpellE>practised</span> in his critical works. If his
essays entitled, “The Perfect Critics”, “The Imperfect Critics” and “Tradition
and Individual Talent,” were so popular, that they formed the material for two
new schools in criticism, known as “The Cambridge School” and “The New
Criticism,” his work upon individual writers was even more influential in
redirecting the taste of the day. These works of T. S. Eliot had been a source
of inspiration for the young critics and poets who were just beginning their
careers. They looked upon him as a literary giant and a versatile genius. Thus
this great Nobel laureate dominated the literary world for over four decades.
If literary historians consider the present era as the age of T. S. Eliot, they
are hardly mistaken. The death of this literary dictator of the twentieth century
leaves a vacuum, which cannot be easily filled up in the near future.</p>

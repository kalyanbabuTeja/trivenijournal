<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri Aurobindo was not a
literary critic in the professional sense of the term. <span class=GramE>Nor in
any other ordinary sense, for that matter.</span> But never did he cease <span
class=SpellE>criticising</span> literature, or interpreting life itself, during
his years on the earth. He was essentially a poet. If the greatest of his
poetry was “supra-mental”, the greatest of his criticism was creative as well
as cerebral. It was not only an exercise of the intellect, but an expression of
the “over-mind”. His criticism, no less than his poetry, bore the transforming
touch of his Yoga. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In one’s response to the
criticism or poetry of Aurobindo, two or three factors press forward for one’s
attention. One is that he was a classical scholar steeped in the literary
heritage of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rome</st1:place></st1:City>. English was
virtually his mother-tongue and few could be more thorough in their
acquaintance with the master-minds of the language, like Shakespeare and
Marlowe, Milton and Dryden, Blake and Wordsworth, Keats and Shelley and
Browning and Meredith. Besides, he had a good knowledge of French, German,
Italian and Spanish among the modern European languages. Though coming late to
the Indian languages, of which he learned Bengali, Gujarati, <span class=GramE>Marathi</span>
and Hindi, besides Sanskrit, he was steeped in the Indian tradition. He was
anxious that no one in this country should lose sight of Indian values in life
and literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Baroda</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, he must necessarily have had to
indulge in literary criticism of some kind. But that was at a different level,
though Sri Aurobindo was incapable of doing the smallest thing, without a sense
of complete involvement in it. Nor is he known to have left anything, be it of
the spoken or the written word, which does not bear a trace of his depth of
thought and integrity of imagination, intellectual and emotional. The more
mature of his essays in criticism were provoked by the books of others, or
written in reply to the request of literary-minded seekers at the Ashram, or
recorded as an illustration of his own<i> </i>method of study and translation
of the Indian classics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with him or not.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
He has also well-defined views on the world’s masters of literature, including
a comparative estimate of their worth. He chooses eleven of the world’s great
poets for the first class (in his letters on <i>Poetry and Literature </i>as
mentioned by Mr. K. D. <span class=SpellE>Sethna</span>). Of these, he places
four in the very first row on an equal basis of essential excellence: <span
class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>, <span class=SpellE>Vyasa</span>, Homer and
Shakespeare. The six who come in the second row are: Dante, Kalidasa, <span
class=SpellE>Aeschoylus</span>, Sophocles, Virgil and Milton, more or less in
that order of merit. Goethe alone stands in the third row, in a sort of
isolated grandeur. The French Racine, the Spanish Cervantes, and a few others
might form a supplementary list for the third and last row! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> represents, for him,
the supreme poet and seer–the <span class=SpellE><i>Vates</i></span><i> </i>of
the Greeks. All the poets of the topmost class have the elemental creativity as
of a demiurge. They might differ from one another in some<i> </i>particular
aspect of their art but not in the force of their creative element. <span
class=SpellE>Vyasa</span> might be the more intellectual in his approach, more
masculine in his style, more austere in his art, more philosophical in his <span
class=SpellE>characterisation</span> than <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>,
but no less creative and, on that account, no less a poet. By the same token,
Homer might have more of the Bard in him and the playwright might be more
prominent in Shakespeare, but they are both poets of the highest class, all the
same, in the alchemy of their imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In comparing Shakespeare
and Kalidasa, Sri Aurobindo does not fall a prey to the dictates of national
chauvinism, as many Indian patriots tend to do, in judging of matters, cultural
and literary. He finds Kalidasa perfect in form, polished in language, but as
for the themes of his creation more limited in his range. He agrees, by
implication, that Shakespeare is a “myriad-minded” poet. The latter’s variety
of <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span> was indeed unparalleled. Sri
Aurobindo does not quote the actual words of his idol, <span class=SpellE>Bankim</span>,
in support of his argument in this context. It is, however, worth recalling
that <span class=SpellE>Bankim</span> compared <span class=SpellE>Kalidasa</span>
to a pretty, formal garden neat and well-trimmed, Shakespeare to a huge
forest–vast, <span class=SpellE>unweildy</span>, all-inclusive; the one to a
beautiful and placid lake, the other to the mighty ocean, deep, surging and
unruly. <span class=GramE>Sri Aurobindo finds both of them natural and
convincing in depicting the paternal rather than the maternal instinct in the
love of children.</span> No <span class=SpellE>Kausalyas</span> here–only <span
class=SpellE>Kanvas</span> and King <span class=SpellE>Lears</span>. He admires
<span class=SpellE>Kalidasa’s</span> prose and Shakespeare’s blank verse to<i> </i>an
equal degree, finding parallels in verbal euphony and felicity of expression.
He makes no secret of his feeling about whose psyche is the more dynamic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nor does Sri Aurobindo
let any one go away with the notion that he is merely indulging his personal
whim or making value judgments in his classification of the world poets. He has
good reasons of his own for it, which <span class=GramE>are</span> sustainable
at the level of reason, with argument and illustration. Not only does he
distinguish between the various levels of poetic creativity but between
different poetic styles, which might sometimes occur in one and the same poet.
The first is the “<i>adequate</i>” style, which just manages to cover the
immediate impact of a thing in a language proper to it. The second is the
“effective” or “dynamic” style, which responds to the subject in a more
complex, vibrant manner. It is illustrated in the lines from the well-known
soliloquy of Hamlet: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

special sense, with an <i>“intone” </i>as well as an <i>“in-look.” </i>It is<i>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The criteria of literary criticism adopted by Sri
Aurobindo were well-defined and his artistic models were from the highest level
of human achievement. But he was eclectic in his taste, within limits. His
approach was far from being rigid. It was, in fact, surprisingly flexible,
willing to consider anything of real poetic value from Emerson, Thoreau and
Whitman, AE and <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span> to <span class=SpellE>Arjava</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Harin</span> <span class=SpellE>Chatto</span> and the more
poetic among his own disciples. He would welcome sonnets and Alexandrines and
heroic couplets as also blank verse and free verse or any other form, provided
there was true merit in the writing. He was not against the use of the
colloquial and the slang, provided it served a poetic purpose, and not resorted
to merely for a modish effect. It would be too fastidious on the part of anyone
to find fault with him for his sympathy and understanding towards the efforts
of some Indian disciples who tried their hand at English verse. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the subject of Indian
writing in English, in general, which has never been quite free from
controversy, Sri Aurobindo took a point of view that would appeal to reason and
common sense. Writing in 1943, in reply to a friend, he said something
refreshingly free from dogma and jingo: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cases that one can’t write first-class things in a learned language. Both in
French and English, people to whom the language was not native have done
remarkable work, although that is rare. What about Jawaharlal’s autobiography?
Many English critics think it, first-class in its own kind; ... If first-class
excludes everything inferior to Shakespeare and Milton, that is another matter.

success and personal fame but to arrive at the expression of spiritual truth
and experience of all kinds in poetry, the English tongue is the most
widespread and is capable of profound turns of mystic expression which make it
admirably fitted for the purpose; if it could be used for the highest spiritual
expression, that is worth trying.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In his approach to the
Indian tradition, it was lucky for us that Sri Aurobindo came with a literary
background and intellectual training very different from that of the average
oriental scholar. He was thereby spared the banalities of “<span class=SpellE><i>Ramodanta</i></span><i>”</i>
and the verbal mechanics of “<span class=SpellE><i>Amarakosha</i></span><i>”</i>,
not to speak of the grammatical arithmetic of ‘<span class=SpellE><i>Kaumudi</i></span><i>’</i>;
all of which are likely to deaden the finer sensibilities of a potential ‘<span
class=SpellE>Rasika</span>’. It was, therefore, with a pleasant shock of
recognition that the wealth of <span class=SpellE>Vyasa</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Valmiki</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kalidasa</span> came to a
scholar-poet whose sights were set on Homer, Dante and Shakespeare. It enabled
him to tell the artificial from the artistic and separate the dazzling glitter
of decadence from the subdued glow of cultural maturity. While he could see the
merit of <span class=SpellE>Kalidasa</span> and <span class=SpellE>Bhavabhuti</span>,
for what it was he could never go into raptures over the complex artifices of <span
class=SpellE>Magha</span>, the elaborate <span class=SpellE>rhetorics</span> of
<span class=SpellE>Bana</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhatta</span>, or the
breath-taking acrobatics of the lesser poets of Sanskrit. The distance from
which he proceeded to the subject not only lent enchantment to the view but
provided the correct perspective, denied to the conventional scholar of Sanskrit,
who would take many things for granted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

poetry too, the East-West encounter in the layers of his sensibility helped Sri
Aurobindo to strike a balance between the artistic and the spiritual. It was a
kind of harmony between Oscar Wilde and <span class=SpellE>Anandavardhana</span>.
Nobody could have been more impressed by the <span class=SpellE>Beardsley-Pater</span>
theory of art for art’s sake and influenced by the Indian theory of art for the
soul’s sake. In his thesis on “<i>The Future Poetry</i>”, he lays stress on the
power of the spirit, when he says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

make its substance or its subject, this growth of the power of the spirit must
necessarily bring into it a more intense and revealing speech, a more inward
and subtle and penetrating rhythm, a greater stress of sight, a more vibrant
and responsive sense, the eye that looks at all smallest and greatest things
for the significances that have not yet been discovered and the secrets that
are not on the surface. That will be the type of the new utterances and the
boundless field of poetic discovery left for the inspiration of<i> </i>the
humanity of the future.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the achievement of the “overhead” level in poetry, Sri Aurobindo lays great
store by the inspired rhythmic patterns of word music rather than the clever
fluctuations of free verse. For all his preoccupation with the spiritual values
of ancient India and the dynamics of Yoga, Sri Aurobindo has his own criteria
of literary judgment in estimating the true worth of secular poetry. For
example, he places the blank verse of a non- philosophical poet like Shakespeare
higher than the free verse of Walt Whitman, whose thoughts remind one of the <span
class=SpellE>Upanishadic</span> affirmations. The occasional flashes of
spiritual insight that Shakespeare might reveal (in the speeches of Prospero
and the soliloquies of Hamlet, for instance) are due to a shrewd understanding
of human nature and the ways of Providence rather than an avowedly spiritual
bent of mind. Without transmitting any obvious spiritual message, they are
likely to attain, on the wings of rhythmic intensity, added to the intensity of
word and vision, the overhead level, according to the acknowledged authority on
Sri <span class=SpellE>Aurobindo’s</span> poetry, Mr. K. D. <span class=SpellE>Sethna</span>.

achieved, in secular terms, through his poetic rhythm and revelatory word, Sri

progress from the stage of normal poetic vision through that of the <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
struck me most at the hundreds of concerts I attended </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>during
nearly four years of stay in <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
and <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> was the perfect silence in which
even thousands of people listened. The doors </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>were closed
when the concerts started, and were opened only in between </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>songs.
Consideration for others is highly developed in the West. At our Concerts even
educated people talk audibly, and address others, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>while
entering or leaving, during a performance. The audiences at night performances
are often more attentive, as only people interested in music take the trouble
to attend them. Moreover, concerts are held here during social occasion also,
when naturally people come and go and want to talk with others. And they are
not real social functions either, as people cannot talk freely or make new
friends when the chairs are arranged only as for a concert. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
reason why so many people come late or leave early at our concerts is that our
concerts are too long. It would be said that our </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>people want a
long concert. Then why do they <span class=GramE>not</span> stay till the end
when it is at its best? And how can working people attend at 5-30 P. M. on a
week day? It is surprising that so many people are free to attend. Then the
main performance in the Academy season goes on even after 8.30 P. M., while the
next one starts at 9-30 P. M. Westerners cannot spend so much time at a
concert, for time counts for them. A musician should make a person want to hear
more, and should not satiate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
loudspeakers and radios shout music, and the fluorescent tubes and ugly
advertisements in the concert halls jar the eye. When easterners adopt western
innovations they do not seem to know how to see them artistically. Even before
I went to the West I used to wonder why they were used so crudely in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I never
saw them so used during all my travels through hundreds of cities from Coast to
Coast in <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> and <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. Their acoustic arrangements, the mellow lights,
pleasing <span class=SpellE>colour</span> schemes, the comfortable seats and
the absence jarring elements are so soothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
musicians can use their creative powers much more than Western musicians, as
the prelude, <span class=SpellE>pallavi</span> <span class=SpellE>swaram</span>,
<span class=SpellE>ragam</span>, <span class=SpellE>thanam</span> and <span
class=SpellE>pallavi</span> are the musician’s own creation. So there is more
stylistic difference among our musicians. And our musicians <span class=SpellE>memorise</span>
much more than their western counter-parts. Orchestral, choral and community
singing are much more developed in the West. I heard <span class=SpellE>Mitropoulous</span>
conduct an orchestra and chorus of five hundred at an indoor stadium. Every
Wednesday the music-students of our university held orchestral and choral
concerts; students joined the school and college band which played at pep
rallies and floats, and held band concerts. The college band which marched past
in various formations at football games was more interesting to me than the
game. People interested in music gather together and sing with scripts in hand;
and in church the whole congregation sings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Westerners
are particular about stage manners; and the artists would not blow their noses,
contort their faces or shake their bodies on the stage. Our listeners are also
more emotional than Westerners and show their appreciation by nodding their
heads and saying, “Ah, ah!” An artist’s popularity is measured in the West by the
number of curtain calls, the audience clapping at the end, and the artist
responding again and again. Westerners lay stress on outward forms, and the
Musicians wear formal black and white, and tie and collar, if the concert is
held outdoors. Some of our <span class=SpellE>katam</span> and <span
class=SpellE>nathaswaram</span> players still play with bare bodies. Our
women-singers dress modestly, though the Indian film stars and dancers,
especially from the north, have started to imitate the Westerners, while our
people boast about our culture. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> sex is introduced even in
music. A musician would be described as sexy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
music festivals also include dance performances. In fact one sees a dance at so
many places, at social functions and in movies, (a dance must be introduced in
a play or a picture whether it is necessary or not), that it is surprising that
people are not satiated with it. It is fashionable to teach dancing to a child,
whether it has aptitude or not, and though there is no novelty about it. Our
dance performances are also too long. One Westerner said she found it boring
and repetitive, with stilted movements. And the whole audience has to wait
while the dancer wants to show off her various saris. <span class=GramE>The
lesser the talent the more the show.</span> A dance could be appreciated better
if its meaning was explained in the programme. All Western concerts, etc., have
programmes. The dancers, as the Westerner said, wear too many jewels and
display clashing many-<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> clothes. A few jewels
and fewer <span class=SpellE>colours</span> would be more effective. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
<span class=SpellE>harikathas</span> when included in the festivals would be
better if the <span class=SpellE>Bagavathars</span> did not come out with their
knowledge of English now and then. Moreover, while a modem analogy can tell a
point better, anachronisms arise when a modem thing is introduced in an old
story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
music and cultural activities, like other things in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, are permeated by an official
atmosphere. Ministers and officials are asked to open or preside at cultural
conferences. I did not hear any politician or Governor speak at any concert or
opera during all the years I was in the West. And the famous <span
class=SpellE>Ravinia</span> Festival Souvenir does not mention any outsider
opening or presiding. It was all musicians and composers. Once I saw the
President of our University sitting in a back seat at our university concert.
That was reflective of American democracy wherein, as one <span class=GramE>said,</span>
a grocery man was paid the same respect as a Governor. Our musicians even greet
people they know from the stage. One would think that cultural <span
class=SpellE>organisations</span> would want to be independent, but in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> various
associations want Government patronage. So long as they are not able to stand
by themselves, they have not come of age. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> the Government has started to
<span class=SpellE>patronise</span> the <span class=SpellE>Sangeet</span> and
other Academies, and, since we did not have guilds started by the artists
themselves, the people do not mind it. But so long as art depends on Government
support, it cannot be independent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
of our music festivals are still held during the Christmas Season, though the
Christmas holidays are curtailed now. Most Western music festivals are not held
during Christmas, though there are more holidays then. If the festivals are
held at different times more people could attend them. Experiments could also
be made in various forms of music. Our orchestral and group singing could be
developed further. Operas and puppet operas could be <span class=SpellE>organised</span>.
Operettas are an old art form in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The latent talent of many
people could be developed further. Now, though musicians are <span
class=SpellE>honoured</span> in our country, the artist’s profession is not
considered as high as a Government job, though it is more difficult to master
an art. Artists are appreciated much more in the West.</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
we talk of Hardy we invariably think of pessimism. But perhaps this is an
unfortunate term that is often associated with Hardy and his novels. Hardy did
not like to be called a pessimist and he stoutly maintained that he was no
atheist. While referring to pessimism he remarked: “Pessimism (rather what is
called such) is, in brief, playing the sure game. You cannot lose at it; you
may<i> </i>gain. It is the only view of life in which you can never be
disappointed. Having reckoned what to do in the worst possible circumstances,
when better arise, as they may, life becomes a child’s play.”<sup>1</sup> So
pessimism was no negative attitude with him. Equally enlightening were some of
his comments on philosophy and atheism. “Let every man make a philosophy for
himself out of his own experience”<sup> 2</sup> and on another occasion he
observed, “Much confusion has arisen and much nonsense has been talked latterly
in connection with the word ‘atheist’. I have never understood how anybody can
be one except in the sense of disbelieving in a tribal god, man-shaped,
fiery-faced and tyrannous...”<sup> 3</sup> These lines should clearly indicate
to us that he was no village atheist brooding and blaspheming over village
idiots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
his own day critics were very much upset by his concluding remark in <i>Tess, </i>“The
President of the Immortals has ended i his sport with Tess.” This was taken as
an expression of Hardy’s faith in an all-powerful being, endowed with baser
human passions, who turned everything to evil and rejoiced in the mischief he
had created thereby. Hardy was vehement in opposing this misconceived view of
the critics. Nothing could be more emphatic and at the same time palpably clear
as the reply he gave on this occasion: “As I need hardly inform any thinking
reader, I do not hold, and never have held, the ludicrous opinions here assumed
to be mine–which are really, or approximately, those of the primitive believer
in his man-shaped tribal God.”<sup> 4</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

poems also had come in for a good deal of criticism, for some of them suggested
the non-existence of some Supreme Force controlling the universe justly and
wisely. In poems like <i>Hap </i>and <i>Nature’s Questioning </i>this tone was
marked and predominant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contradict them as a whole–and this especially when they are scattered over a
period of fifty years…..A poem often quoted against me, and apparently in your
mind in the lecture, is the one called <i>Nature’s Questioning </i>containing
the words, ‘some Vast Imbecility’ etc., as if these definitions were my creed.”<sup>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
these replies that Hardy had given to the bitter critics of his day would enable
us to come to certain conclusions. Hardy was not a pessimist or an atheist. Nor
was he a philosopher in the strict sense. He no doubt read the works of
philosophers like Bergson but his comments were not very favourable.<sup> 6</sup>
So his philosophy (as he himself said) was based on his own individual
experiences. What then were the experiences that led him to probe into the
mysteries of the universe? What exactly was the type of the world he lived in
and created for others?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
two questions require a careful study. The world he lived in was essentially a
rustic world, with the old order giving place to a new one. The certainties
were no longer accepted as such and much of that ‘obstinate questioning’ was
reflected in his novels. The world he created for the others, through his
novels especially, was a tragic one. Tragedy according to him “may be created
by an opposing environment either of things inherent in the universe, or of
human institutions.”<sup> 7</sup> So the tragic stress in his novels was based
on the opposition of the unseen forces or by the cold unfeeling society. His
experiences, as far as his own private life was concerned, seemed to be quite
pleasant.<sup> 8</sup> But with his sensitive nature he was rudely shocked in
seeing much of<i> </i>marital unhappiness and general misery all around him. He
naturally asked himself why there should be all that misery if there had been a
loving and benevolent God above. So all his novels and his poems were
expressions of his doubts, misgivings and perplexities as regards the justice of
God. When he thought of God he had the concept of the impersonal one in his
mind. He was not clear whether this spirit was capable of doing good or bad. To
what extent men and women were responsible for their deeds and whether they
were completely free–these problems also were taken up by him. To a large
extent he believed in Man’s Free Will, though he also accepted Predestination.
He even wondered whether the blind and brute chance alone was working in this
universe. With his spirit of interrogation he could not just be a blind
fundamentalist, nor could he be a thoroughgoing rationalist.<sup>9</sup> His
love for Nature and his refined sentimentalism could not make him blind to the
existence of some Supreme Spirit. It was indeed a difficult task for him to
reconcile within himself these two warring elements, one taking him away from
everything accepted and the other drawing him nearer to convention again. Each
one of his major novels bears this conflict. However, a superficial study of
his novels is bound to leave us with the impression that something is wrong
with Hardy’s presentation of life. It does not seem to be satisfying or
satisfactory. An unbalance, a restlessness, a spiritual vacuum and an
undignified humanity–these are the different phases of the world of Hardy’s
novels. We realise and feel the utter futility of earthly longings. Crass
casualty and pitiless Fate seem to be dominating the whole show. What a gloomy
picture! But this is only one side of the picture, unfortunately the better
known one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
closer and more sympathetic examination of Hardy’s novels, his correspondence
and memoirs, will yield an altogether different picture. His writings always
present his inward struggle–his admiration for everything new and at the same
time his hesitancy to accept the innovations as complete and final. A few lines
from <i>Tess </i>will illustrate my viewpoint. Tess is seduced and Hardy comes
forward with a series of questions, and within these few lines he presents the
various worlds of thought that had been prevalent in his day: “But, might some
say, where was Tess’s guardian angel? Where was the Providence of her simple
faith?” This may have been the reaction of the simple country folk believing in
the justice of God. The next few lines, “Perhaps, like that other god of whom
the ironical Tishbite spoke, he was talking, or he was pursuing, or he was in a
journey, or he was sleeping and not to be disturbed,” suggest the unbelief and
the interrogative attitude that has come as a result of rationalism and the
rationalist school of thought. Then in the following lines, “Why it was that
upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as gossamer, and practically
blank as snow as yet, there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it
was doomed to receive; why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the
wrong man the woman, the wrong woman the man,” there is the world of
philosophical speculation trying to formulate the basis for the glaring
inequalities, unfairness and marital disharmonies that loom large in the world.
There is also the reference to the psychological thought with its due emphasis
on Heredity and Environment as deciding factors in life, for good or for bad,
as the case may be. This is well illustrated when Hardy comments<i>,</i> “One
may, indeed, admit the possibility of retribution lurking in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
present catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess d’urberville’s mailed ancestors
rollicking home for a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly
towards peasant girls of their time.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 10 </span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ultimately
he quotes the popular saying of the humble rustics of Wessex, “It was to be”.
This exactly is the world he lived in. Like the above mentioned rationalists,
analytical philosophers and psychologists, he has also tried to understand the
complicated problems of life. But as he expresses quite towards the close of
his life in one of his letters, “the scheme of things is, indeed,
incomprehensible; and there I suppose we must leave it–perhaps for the best.
Knowledge might be terrible,” </span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>11</span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
he nearly accepts the last possible explanation for Tess’s seduction, “It was
to be”. This apparently fatalist observation does not in any way mean an
acceptance of defeat and a willful subordination of one’s own will to some
unseen Force. Hardy does not portray his characters that way. They put in a
mighty effort; if they fail they are not to be blamed. There is free will, but
predestination can neither be ignored, nor lightly taken. Again this
predestination is not a completely binding force. Henchard, Tess and Jude–they
all fight to the end. They die nobly and gloriously. But peculiarly </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>enough
Hardy is always suggesting the justice involved in each one of these tragic
ends given to these characters. Henchard has </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>himself to
blame. His wrongheaded diplomacy, his eerie superstition, his sentimental
nature–all these make a travesty of his life. Tess murders Alec–rightly or
wrongly–and she has to pay for what she has done. Jude with his unfortunate
uxoriousness enters into a bad alliance with Arabella, the crude voluptuous
woman and later into an unholy alliance with Sue, the romantically passionate
woman. He ends up miserably. These three major creations of Hardy are
essentially tragic. Despite their fall, Henchard, Tess and Jude win our
sympathies, if not our admiration. To sum up, Hardy presents before us the
mighty potentialities of Man, his capabilities and resources to create or to
destroy. But even these powerful men and women have to go down, because ‘it has
to be’. There is something greater than Man’s will. As yet–by the time he
writes his novels–he has not used the term ‘Immanent Will’. It comes only with
his writing of the <i>Dynasts, </i>his epic-drama. So man’s will, however
powerful it may be, has to yield to the Immanent Will. But this tragic end
given to these major characters is not based on any illogical system. They
deserve their fall, they merit it. That is justice. Hardy harps on this
repeatedly. It does not appear as though some wicked force is pulling down
Henchard and Jude and tearing them to pieces. They have created for themselves
such circums</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tances that they can never escape their doom.
Winterborne, of all Hardy’s characters, is taken to be more sinned against than
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>sinning. But in the novel itself there are certain clues to
prove the contrary. Grace tells Winterborne. “Giles, if you had only shown half
the boldness before I married that you show now, you would have carried me off
for your own, first instead of second.” Winterborne is cold and moody; he lacks
the persuasive eloquence of Fitzpiers and he does not possess even the assertive
attitude </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of Gabriel Oak and Diggory Venn. Besides, his
absolute indifference towards Marty South can never be justified. He knows full
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>well that she is devoted to him and that he is in a way
torturing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>her by not accepting her hand. Still he keeps himself
busy with thoughts of Grace. Hardy could not have given to Giles what </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
had given to Gabriel Oak and Diggory Venn–ultimate success in love. So on the
whole Hardy’s attitude towards life is one of accepting justice as the most
predominant factor in the universe. But this word ‘justice’ does not have any
mystic significance for him. It is simply based on the law of causation.</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
If certain deeds are done they will have their consequences. We can never </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>escape
the fruits of our action. It is not blind chance that is ruling the universe,
it is a systematised process where each one of our actions will have a bearing
on our future. This is the type of the world he has actually presented in his
novels, not the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>erratic one as it is generally supposed to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
characters fit into this world. In Shakespearean tragedies there are certain
characters like Cordelia and Desdemona who yield without much of a struggle for
existence. No doubt Desdemona pleads for her life in the last minutes, but this
is neither a strong plea. nor a timely one. Why should Cordelia die? Evidently
there is no answer. Then it must be the perverse Fate that has dealt them a
fatal blow. If this be our explanation, when surely Shakespeare too is a
pessimist. And so many other writers of tragedies also come under this
category, for in every tragedy there is the predominance of evil over good, at
least temporarily. If we argue in this manner we will be misunderstanding the
concept of tragedy itself. In some of the great tragedies there is the suggestion
of retribution, whereas in some others the tragic end alone is presented.
Sophoclean tragedy stresses the “death accepted in calm of mind, with strength
unshaken.” Just because the good are made to suffer we need not come to the
conclusion that the writer is disbelieving in the ultimate prevalence of
justice or of righteousness. In the silent suffering of Desdemona and Cordelia
there is the grand Sophoclean theme of tragedy. In a similar fashion the
intense suffering of Henchard. Tess and Jude–apparently suggestive of
pessimistic faith–is essentially the basic principle for tragedy of the
Sophoclean type. As we read Hardy’s novels, especially the major ones, we tend
to comment, “Tragedy’s preoccupation is with suffering....There is no dignity
like the dignity of a soul in agony...The suffering of a soul that can suffer
greatly–that and only that, is tragedy.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:

often presents life as a battle. Of the six major novels <i>(Return of the
Native, Far from the Madding Crowd, Woodlanders, The Mayor of Casterbridge,
Tess </i>and <i>Jude) </i>in the first three there is only the presentation of
the tragic stress. They are not tragedies in the real sense, as the last three
are. Their happy endings–a concession to popular taste–artificial as they are,
prevent them from being great masterpieces of tragedy. In these three novels
the conflict is presented at the emotional level. Bathsheba <i>(Far from the
Madding Crowd) </i>plays a crude prank with Boldwood and falls passionately in
love with Sargeant Troy. The latter has already deserted Fanny, so he has to
pay for his deed. Bathsheba ultimately gets Oak, the staunch, faithful type of
lover as her husband. Eustacia Wye <i>(Return of the Native) </i>the passionate
type of woman marries the cold Clym Yeobright, and Wildeve the passionate man
marries Thomasin, the simple, modest woman. Thus affections are misplaced, and
after the storm and stress of all these ill-suited alliances, Thomasin gets
Venn, the raddleman, a husband she deserves. Grace <i>(Woodlanders) </i>makes
herself miserable by getting married to a gay, unreliable person like
Fitzpiers. In these three novels Hardy’s main purpose is to show the
temperamental differences and indicate how these incompatibilities lead to
tragic plights in the marital sphere. No doubt the world he presents here is a
limited one–it is the world of lovers, that too unthinking, if not foolish
lovers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

need not find fault with anyone, not even with his own Fate. Hardy here poses a
problem–Character or Destiny, which is more important and significant in
shaping and moulding the life of Man? All thinking persons, right from the day
of creation to the present day, must have thought of this relationship of
Character and Destiny. Divines and theologians have waxed eloquent over this
perplexing problem of Free Will and Predestination. Hardy therefore is now
taking up a theme of universal interest and Henchard is all through colossal
and grand. But Hardy does not make this problem so simple as that. With his own
undecided mental make-up to put absolute faith in Free Will or in
Predestination, he wavers between these two and presents a conflict at a <i>personal
level. </i>Henchard seems to be fighting with what is predestined for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last two novels, <i>Tess </i>and <i>Jude. </i>Here these two great figures,
Tess and Jude, have to fight the social laws, however meaningless they may be.
Tess wishes to forget her past, her shameful past with Alec, and start afresh
with Angel Clare. But it is not such </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>an easy job as she
expects. She does not realise the risk she is taking when she allows herself to
be seduced by Alec. The consequences of that ignorant but foolish action–the
birth of the child, its irreligious baptism and its ultimate exit from this
world–are too distressful to be narrated. It is the social wrath that obliges
Tess and her family to leave Marlott, for, “It was, indeed, quite true that the
household had not been shining examples either of temperance, soberness or
chastity.” <i>(Tess). </i>Her unfortunate alliances with men doom her
completely. Her suffering comes to a close only when the black flag is flying,
thereby bringing before us the Sophoclean world where suffering and its
annihilation through death are the essential factors for the presentation of
tragedy. Jude defies society; he gets Sue, his married cousin, to live with
him. This unlicensed marriage, rather relationship with Sue, takes him away
from his original plan of becoming a scholar. From place to place he moves,
for, the moment the truth is known about his abnormal sexual life with Sue, he
is persecuted. Hardy presents this conflict that comes at the </span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>social
level </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with any amount of sympathetic understanding.
Tess and Jude wish to live and live happily, if they can. Tess violates the
social laws unknowingly, whereas Jude does it deliberately and with considered
Scorn for the narrow conventionalities of society. The end is dismal for both
of them. It is bound to be, for, any flagrant violation of social laws will
certainly have its own repercussions. Sue’s moral scruples towards the close,
as contrasted with the stubborn refusal of Jude to bow before tradition, once again
shows Hardy’s immense interest in and hesitancy for the new social set-up that
is fast coming up towards the beginning of the twentieth century. His liberal
attitude towards Tess and Jude need not be stressed at all, for it is quite
well known. At the same time his philosophical doctrines and his aesthetic
preference for tragedy almost compel him to give only tragic ends to his
otherwise beloved creations–Henchard, Tess and Jude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a word about the machinery, the supernatural element in his novels; here omens,
astrological predictions, superstitious beliefs mar the pleasant atmosphere and
create a dark and dismal world. Chance coincidences always tend to be for the
complete undoing of Man. They never help him; they mar his prospects. This
device of Hardy is taken as an instance of his pessimistic faith. But how does
Shakespeare manipulate the tragic heights of <i>Othello</i>–only<i> </i>by the
dropping of a single handkerchief. A simple accident like this destroys the
idyllic life of Othello and Desdemona and brings about an end that is pitiful
and harrowing. Hardy does the same thing in weaving a net of unpleasant
accidents and chance coincidences. Stray lines are often the basis for
unhesitating comments on Hardy’s pessimism. Here is a scene from <i>The Return
of the Native. </i>Eustacia is talking to Clym Yeobright: “Yet I know that we
shall not love<i> </i>like this always. Nothing can ensure the continuance of
love. It will evaporate like a spirit, and so I feel full of fears.” Eustacia
and Clym are at the height of their emotions. This is an occasion for
triumphant declarations of love and faith. But peculiarly enough Eustacia talks
in a halting, suspecting vein. Unfortunately, according to the critics, this is
a typical example of Hardy’s pessimism. Surely it is, if we read these lines
alone. Her frank comments coming immediately after this cold calculated speech
indicate to us certain valid reasons for this gloom. She has loved another man,
and as she puts it, “Your mother will find ours that you meet me, and she will
influence you against me.” She is correct in her fears. Her not-too-fair past
is known to Clym’s mother and she is afraid of that disclosure and the possible
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>influence of the mother over her son. Eustacia is shrewd; so
the above lines suggestive of her gloom are not out of place. With a realistic
approach she believes that, all her happiness may be only short-lived. In fact
such lines given to the various characters in the novels should be taken only
as dramatic utterances and should not be confused with the novelist’s way or
thinking or his sincere faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he realises the limitations of Man’s efforts, however great they may be. There
is always that conflict between Man’s limited will and the all-powerful will
dominating the universe. This struggle is often a losing one for Man, but that
does not matter, for Hardy is interested only in the presentation of the strife
and not in bringing it to a successful close for Man. That is because of his peculiar
poetic bent of mind. Even in great tragedies poetic justice is often not very
effective. Apparently flawless persons receive the most crushing blows, that
too for no fault of theirs. Yet in Hardy’s novels the sense of justice is to a
large extent maintained and reflected. Despite his strong temperamental bias
for Jude and Tess, he gives them the ends they deserve. These tragic ends are
partly based on the law of causation and also on his individual preference for
the glorification of suffering and strife in Life. Hardy has thus brought about
a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:

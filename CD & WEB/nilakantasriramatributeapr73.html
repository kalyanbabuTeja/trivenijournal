N. Sri R am, International President, Theosophical Society, passed away on
April 8, 1973, at Adyar, Madras. He was gentle and unassuming and was never
guilty of a harsh word or thought, however provocative the circumstances. He
gave a silent message and a benediction to all who were in his presence. One
gets a feeling that he belongs to the line of Bodhisatvas and Buddhas. Such men
are very rare. <span style='mso-tab-count:2'>               </span>–Editor] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
the passing away of N. Sri Ram, the Besant tradition in the Theosophical
Society might be said to have faded away. The only residual link with the
Besant era still active in the Theosophical arena, is Sri Ram’s talented
sister, Srimati Rukmini Devi. The other associates or Dr. Besant who are happily
with us, but are not very much in the Theosophical fold, though active
elsewhere, are Sri B. Shiva Rao and Sri V. K. Krishna Menon, each of whom has
achieved eminence in his chosen field of activity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Ram was just another name for consecration, dedication and self-abnegation. It
is perhaps all right to be loyal to an individual leader in his or her
life-time–but being loyal to the memory of even a noble leader, like Dr. Annie
Besant and to cherish and nourish the ideals she stood for, are rather different
cups of tea. History, and more particularly Indian History, is replete with
instances of disciples who spent the span of their residual lives, keeping the
lamp of their preceptor’s or leader’s memory burning–and in most instances,
they were otherwise inconspicuous as to their qualities of leadership or
dynamism. Indeed when you had praised such a person’s capacity for personal
loyalty to a leader and after the leader had departed the scene of his earthly
labours, to his memory, you had by and large said all there was to be said
about him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the case of Sri Ram, he was a man of rare mental
calibre, wide reading and ineffable personal charm. He could speak faultlessly
and without a propensity to thump the table to drive his point home or drawing
on other such accessories out of a demogogue’s tool-bag. He depended on the
effectiveness of his logic to drive his point home and spoke softly and without
the slightest perturbation or excitement. He was by upbringing modest and
unobtrusive and almost instinctively inclined to take a rear seat at
functions–till somebody felt guilty enough to get the anomaly rectified. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was a great journalist and could have held the editorship of a paper with
conspicuous competence–though he was not a hard-hitter–being mentally absorbed
with principles rather than personalities. Of course, he would have been
perfectly at sea in the world of modern sensation-mongers and
pornography-purveyors and those who would allow salacious or malicious
paragraphs to go into print–in order that the paper may sell a few more copies.

world was an island of gentleness, decency and good fellowship–where faith in
man’s evolution through the constant exercise of rectitude and self-abnegation
into the higher man, was a deep one. His elevation to presidentship of the
Theosophical Society and his re-election twice to that office, seemed to those
who knew him and the Theosophical Society a matter of course. He let the mantle
of office of International Presidentship sit lightly on him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

first heard of Sri Ram in my own adolescence, when as head of the family (his
esteemed father Nilakanta Sastri had passed away by then) he had to face the
fierce blast of public criticism over his sister Smt. Rukmini Devi’s marriage
to Dr. George S. Arundale. A premier South Indian newspaper, renowned for its
sobriety, wrote a succession of editorials which bespoke religious
obscurantism, bigotry and intolerance–under the heading “Adyar’s Ways”. This
was way back in 1920–fifty-three years ago. Dr. Besant, the born fighter that
she was, wrote in the columns of her popular Daily <i>New India </i>counter-editorials,
rebuking the paper for its intrusiveness and its perverse editorials. Sri Ram,
who was in his early thirties, stood up with forbearance and fortitude against
the almost cyclonic remonstrances at the time. I am aware that a later Editor
of the paper which wrote these critical editorials, used to express his remorse
over these editorial impertinences of an earlier era. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Ram’s oratorical abilities were seen in their fulness, when Dr. Besant launched
her “Commonwealth of India Bill”. Indeed it must be within the recollection of
the elder generation that hers was the first concrete reply to an insolent
challenge thrown by the then Secretary of State for India, Lord Birkenhead,
that India had not spelt out what she wanted in preference to the Montague
Chelmsford Reforms of progressive realization of responsible Government, of
which the country was critical. The Commonwealth of India Bill came in for
criticism that it did not go far enough, that the system of graded franchise
spelt out therein failed to reckon with the needs of the masses and so on. I
remember Sri Ram going about his campaign with all the fervour and sincerity of
an apostle or crusader and speaking with rare lucidity and eloquence. If he had
been spurred by personal ambition to seek a career in public life, his valuable
equipment would have hoisted him on the pedestal of political affairs without
great effort. But his distaste for the lime-light and the total absence of
careerist motivation in his build-up, made the philosophical seclusion of the
Theosophical Society his clear personal choice. It is true he was thrice
elected President of the world body, but he never asked as it were, to get the
feel of the sceptre or the bauble of the exalted office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a devoted son to his centenarian mother, whom he visited almost daily, when
in Adyar and he spent time with her. He was a no less devoted husband and
father. His wife, Srimati Bhagirathi Sri Ram who pre-deceased him by a few
years, left a vacuum, which his daughter, Srimati Radha, worked strenuously to
fill up. Srimati Radha looked after her father Sri Ram in his advanced years
with diligence and deep understanding. Sri Ram’s passing has left an ominous
vacuum in Srimati Radha’s life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have lost in Sri Ram a great Karma Yogin, a man of culture and probity and one
who had deep consideration for his fellow human beings and for their opinions.
He was an example of the graciousness that emanates from restraint. That is why
though he died full of years, we all feel we did not have enough of him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

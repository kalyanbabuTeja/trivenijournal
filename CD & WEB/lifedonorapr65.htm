thoughts, dreaming in that sleep and imagining that her <span class=SpellE>daypream</span>
got withered–she used to shudder in her heart of hearts, imagining that she was
sinking down into the deep depths of the under-worlds, from Heaven. But the
expected ambrosial vessel had not become a mirage for <span class=SpellE>Niraja</span>.
Why did it not happen so? Was it due to her grand-father’s self-confidence? Was
it because of the sanctity of her previous births? Or was it the grace of God? <span

silently penetrating through their din was heard from a marriage function,
celebrated at a distance. It was an old song. Still it was very sweet. In the
song, a beloved was questioning herself “who am I, who am I”. Age is bad. It
would search for those who would enable us to know that we are such and such
and somebody. Perhaps such a doubt might arise in that search. This novel idea
dawned on her mental horizon like an impulse from a flower garden. As this idea
struck her like the sprouts of a <span class=SpellE>neem</span> stem, might not

with the usual bricks. The pavement was plastered upon pebbles. Credit goes to
the architect for having constructed such a nice house–that does not permit
much breeze and light inside–fit for the dwellers on this earth. The wall looks
like a specimen arena of a battle-field with innumerable blood marks smeared
over them. Mildew formed over the roof like a canopy cloth. Black flies
proclaimed their skill and knowledge, having started a musical concert in that
room–decked with all these facilities. Some dailies lay scattered round the

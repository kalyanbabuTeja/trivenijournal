style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
session of the Indian National Congress held at New Delhi in the middle of
October was perhaps the quietest, least spectacular, if not somewhat most tame,
among the sessions during its long career. The election of Pandit Nehru as
President by the A.I.C.C. in August was fulfilled by the holding of a plenary
session. The only excitement was provided by the short-circuiting of electric
fittings which burned up the Congress pandal on the eve of the general session.
The sober atmosphere of Delhi, with its heavy preoccupation with the
administrative responsibility for the governance of the whole nation, made this
incident pass off almost unnoticed. The President himself having somewhat
exhausted himself by his public statements, Press conferences. Reports to the
A.I.C.C. at its Bangalore session, etc., made one of the quietest and most
unemotional speeches of his career. The usual resolutions on Foreign Policy,
Five-year Plan, Congress Manifesto for the coming General Elections, were
passed. One missed altogether the thrill, the novelty, the excitement and the
enthusiasm generally associated with a session of the Congress. It was a very
sober function; the President, overweighed with his heavy responsibilities,
cast his mood over the gathered Congressmen, and the all dominating General
Elections to come were occupying the minds of all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dastardly outrage, the assassination of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat
Ali Khan, sent a wave of horror all over the two nations. The reaction of the
event in India proved clearly the real bonds of sympathy that still unite the
whole sub-continent. The sincere messages of sympathy and condolence sent by
Pandit Nehru and the President to their opposite numbers of Pakistan evoked the
kindliest feelings. Almost at a stroke the strained relations between the
sister States subsided. The expression of fellow feeling from several public
bodies and leading organisations in India flowed in a continuous stream towards
the bereaved nation and acted as a soothing balm to the lacerated hearts of the
better elements of Pakistan’s national life. Not a little of this effect may
perhaps be due to the close resemblance between the end of Liaquat Ali Khan and
the passing of Mahatma Gandhi three and odd years earlier. In the presence of a
large gathering, with prayers about to be recited or just after recital, to be
openly shot-at at close range, to lose consciousness reciting ‘Ram nam’ of the
Quoranic prayer, were features that brought the association with the end of
Mahatma Gandhi very intimate. It was the manner in which a hero, a great
servant of the nation, passes from the earthly scene of his labours in a
chariot of fire and in the presence of his countrymen whom he had served ably
and devotedly. For, Liaquat Ali is undoubtedly the greatest statesman whom
Pakistan has had the good fortune to possess in the first years of its career
as an independent nation. Though somewhat subdued under the masterly leadership
of the late lamented Quaid-e-Azam Mahomed Ali Jinnah, Liaquat Ali was a man of
personal charm, a fine product of culture, suave and collected, and had
excellent personal contacts with political friends and opponents alike. Though
in the pursuit of his nation’s policies and programmes he could wield the
language of provocation and propaganda, no one who ever came into contact with
him failed to recognise the fine type of Muslim gentleman in him. He served the
nation of his choice with single-minded devotion and exceptional ability, and
has carved his name indelibly on the infant history of Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last week of October witnessed the exit from the Central Cabinet of two notable
personalities. Sri Rajaji finally decided to retire from public life, the attainment
of the age of 72 being his main reason. His last duty as a Cabinet Minister in
charge of Home Affairs w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to steer a very unpopular measure, the Press Law Amendment. Under the
leadership of the late lam</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ented Lala Desabandhu Gupta, whose tragic
death occurred in an air crash a few weeks later, the opposition waged a
gallant battle against the restriction on Press freedom. But Rajaji’s ripe
parliamentary technique raised the debate to a high plane, and when the Bill
was passed finally, it was a triumph for the tact and fairplay which
characterised the conduct of the Bill by the Home Minister. In the praises that
were showered on the retiring Minister, in which even the strongest critics of
the Bill joined, one had a glimpse of ripe wisdom and firm handling by this
elder statesman. In spite of the noise created, Rajaji secured for the Press
freedom from executive high-handedness by making judicial authority essential
for the exercise of the penal clauses. On calm reconsideration it will be seen
that, in the absence of a voluntary Press Code of Honour, some restriction was
essential Over the unbridled excesses of the Indian language journals whose
standards compare favourably, of course with honourable exceptions, with the
level of journals in the English language in the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rather sudden exit of Dr. Ambedkar from the Central Cabinet evoked a
controversy in which the learned Doctor came off second best. The immediate
grievance was stated to be the abandoning of the ‘Hindu Code Bill’ by the
current Parliament, a matter on which the ‘Kaliyuga Manu’, as he was
flamboyantly hailed by some members of the house, had set his heart. Dr.
Ambedkar, who was busy with his major achievement of steering the Constitution
Act and other legal measures, suddenly discovered that the Hindu Code Bill was
given the cold shoulder because he did not possess the pull necessary over the
leader of the Government, while other powerful ministers got precedence for
their bills. Following on this, Dr. Ambedkar also realised that, in spite of
his repeated desire, no other portfolio was entrusted to him while the Law
portfolio was insufficient to find scope for his capacities, and he was kept
out of important committees of the Cabinet. He also could not approve of the
foreign policy of the Government, though this disagreement did not disturb his
four years’ tenancy of the Law Ministership. In the event he found it necessary
to resign on the eve of the General Elections, in order to be free to carry on
his campaign as leader of his Party. Added to all this was the paramount
consideration that according to his view the retiring Government had not done
sufficient for the scheduled and suppressed classes, not even as much as was
done for the Muslims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
visit of the Chinese Cultural Mission commencing in the last days of October,
and lasting forty days in all, gave opportunities for forging afresh the
cultural links between the two ancient civilisations of China and India. The
exhibition of paintings and pictures which they carried with them revealed the
time-old affinities between the two cultures, and the warm hospitality
uniformly extended to them in Bombay and other important centres must have
given the honoured guests an inkling into the fundamental bases of the Eastern
outlook on life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
month of November has been monopolised by the choice of candidates by the
various political parties to represent them in the contest for seats in the
legislatures in the General Elections. Varied opinions have been expressed with
regard to the efficacy of the General Elections on adult franchise by an
electorate of 180 million voters, undoubtedly the biggest election held so far
in the history of humanity. James A. Michener, writing in the leading American
journal ‘Life’, says: “To talk seriously of general elections in an area where
ninety per cent of the electorate cannot read, is to mock the very meaning of
democracy.” Mr. C. R. Srinivasan, President of the All-India Newspaper Editors’
Conference, is reported by the A.I.R. on December 5 to have described the
General Elections as the biggest gamble; the very fact of the need of symbols
points to the ignorance of the electorate; the elections will amount to an
exploitation of ignorance; how can the electorate be expected to judge policies
and programmes of rival political parties? Mr. C. R. Srinivasan suggests the
formation of electoral colleges, at the rate of one representative for five
hundred or a thousand voters; election by these electoral colleges of the
members of the legislature would serve the purpose better. But these views
forget that the General Elections will themselves constitute a vital education
to the masses of the country. The usual mistake that is made to confuse mere
literacy with enlightenment. The villager in India may not read or write, but
he is wide awake as to the values of life, thanks to a long tradition of mass
diffusion of culture through indigenous means–pilgrimages, ‘harikathas,’
village minstrels, travelling entertainers, and village assemblies, for oral
spread of general knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
disturbing feature of the situation has been the large number of meaningless
parties springing up, the so-called Independents constituting the largest group
outside the Congress. Pandit Nehru in his Madras speech in November remarked on
the epidemic of eve-of-election affiliations. Sri Jai Prakash Narain speaking
at Gaya on 28th November deprecated the rise of parties on the eve of
elections, called them mushroom parties, and likened them to frogs of the rainy
season. Many of the so-called Independents are really disappointed Congressmen
who, failing to get selected for Congress tickets, resign overnight their
membership and stand as Independents. In Madras State there are over a thousand
of this variety of candidates. All this spotlights the lack of political
training and the highly individualistic tendency of the Indian intellectuals
who, conscious of their own merits, have never learnt the need for political
discipline. In a well-developed democracy such anomalous groups are
unthinkable. Either a candidate stands for a certain programme and policy, or
he steps aside from political contests altogether. To put the person over
against principle and to ask the electorate to choose oneself, is to trade upon
the political inexperience of the electorate and the lack of a diffusion of
general understanding. It is in this context that we can reconcile ourselves to
Pandit Nehru’s resiling somewhat from his earlier declaration to invite men of
integrity and ability to stand for election on behalf of the Congress. As he
pointed out, five hundred men of ability pulling in five hundred different
directions will make a sorry mess of the country’s fate. He said that in India
there are three hundred and fifty million problems and not a score or two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
months of November and December are witnessing Election campaigning by the
leading parties. Foremost among the leaders stands Pandit Nehru who, in the
midst of his heavy duties as Prime Minister, is gallantly touring the States of
the Indian Union in his capacity as President of the Congress. His election
speeches addressing mammoth gatherings have made him cross swords with
political opponents like Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukherji, Dr. Ambedkar, J. P. Narain,
N. B. Khare and other able party heads. Now and then the great leader has let
escape an impulsive remark or two which are seized upon by less generous
opponents to make political capital out of. His reference to the Mahasabha and
its unhappy association with the murder of the Father of the Nation, never
legally established, has brought forth an ominous threat from Dr. Khare.
Speaking on December 7 at the Nagpur Forum at an election symposium, Dr. Khare
is reported to have said: “If he (Pandit Nehru) repeats this propaganda as he
did in Bhopal, scenes like February 1948 will be re-cnacted.” One hopes, for
the sake of the country, that utterances like this will be taken note of in
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
disturbing feature in the situation has been the influence exerted by the ex-Ruling
Princes and Maharajahs by entering the elections or by exerting pressure upon
candidates. Recently the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh had to issue a
warning to the ex-Ruler of Bastar State not to coerce rival candidates to
withdraw from the election contest. Pandit Nehru had to openly remark on the
propaganda methods adopted by the Maharajah of Jodhpur, who is himself a
candidate in the contest. On the top of this comes the great confusion or the
rejection of nomination papers by the various Returning Officers, which has
been characterised by a variation and bewildering perplexity of decision
resulting in suits in every High Court in India. Dr. Mathai’s nomination at

against standing as candidates, recalled his urging the Law Minister, at the
time the Representation of the People’s Act was on the legislative anvil, that
it would be best to have fool-proof rules. But Dr. Ambedkar was satisfied with
his own proposals as drafted by himself, with the result that all over the
country, because of the language not being clear, rejection of nomination
papers has been raging as an epidemic among Returning Officers Sri Prakasa
stresses the need to make clear what is an ‘office of profit ‘ under
Government, what public companies are Government contractors, who is a licensee
under the terms of the Act, whether Vice-Chancellors are Government servants.

Abanindranath, the great artist, the co-inspirer with E. B. Havell of the

great masterpieces in painting like the mendicant Buddha and others, his
co-operation with his great world-honoured uncle, Gurudev Rabindranath, in the
founding and working of the Viswa-Bharati, his versatile gifts as storyteller,
Bengali litterateur and as leader of the neo-Bengal school of painting, have

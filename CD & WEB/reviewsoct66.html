Tantra </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is a classic in Tantra Literature in Sanskrit.
As its very name suggests, it expounds the theory and practice of the <i>Kaula </i>school
of the <i>Saakta </i>cult. “Kula means <i>Sakli </i>and Akula means <i>Siva. </i>A
harmonious relation of <i>Siva </i>and <i>Sakli </i>is Kaula” (p. 17). “The
world is constituted of <i>Siva </i>and <i>Sakti, </i>consciousness and power”
and <i>Kaula Maarga </i>which leads to the equipollence of the two, which is
identical with the Supreme Truth, must naturally be the best of the paths
leading to self-realisation. <i>Kaula maarga </i>and <i>Veda maarga </i>in
essence are one, though they appear to differ superficially, (2-85). Advaita
doctrine in its form <i>Aham Brahmaasmi </i>is accepted by Kaulas also (9.32).
But the method of approach appears to be different. While the Upanishads stress
on renunciation of worldly objects for self-realisation, Kaulas prescribe
worldly objects as means for the realisation. They assert that “success can be
attained by those very things that brought down our fall by an intelligent use
of them (5.50). This path, just like advaita, Kaulikas admit, is not for the
ordinary man. On the other hand, he is cautioned against dallying with it. It
is more difficult, they say, than walking on the edge of a sharp sword (2-122).
But such a path has been abused and decided by those who did not understand the
spirit of the <i>Kaula </i>path which prescribes liquor, meat and fish etc.,
for use in the rituals. But the real significance of these words is explained
in this Tantra as follows: “Nectar-drinking is the Union of <i>Kundalini Sakti </i>with
the Moon–<i>chit.</i> The true meat eater is he who has merged his <i>chitta </i>in
the Supreme. He who controls his senses and unites them with <i>Atma </i>is a
fish eater. True sexual union is the union of <i>Paraasakti, </i>that is <i>Kundalini
</i>with <i>Atman” </i>(V-Ill, 112). This explanation, it is hoped, will
disillusion and disarm the ignorant critics. The Kaulas assert, under the
conditions prescribed, the <i>Saadhanas </i>in this</span><span

teacher and the taught, <i>Praasaada mantra, </i>mantras and their nature and
use, <i>Mahaasodha Nyaasa, </i>preparations of <i>Kaula </i>substances, methods
of worship, practice of yoga, <i>purascharana, </i>and rites done for the
attainment of various objects of desire, are the important subjects dealt with
in these chapters–Sir John Wood Roffe’s introduction of 12 pages gives, in a
nutshell, the substance of the 17 chapters. The text proper is printed in
Devanagari script with variant readings from some manuscripts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which is most popular
among the devotees of Sri Devi is unrivalled for its beauty of composition, and
its spiritual appeal. There are already three commentaries in English on this <i>stotram,
</i>but they do not devote themselves to a detailed exposition of the
significance of the namams from the yoga point of view, though there are about
150 namams which have a direct bearing upon the Yoga system. The author of this
annotation attempts to fill up this lacuna and our hearty commendations go to
him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the preface of 27 pages, among other things, the annotator plains very briefly
the message of the <i>Stotra </i>and the meaning the fifteen lettered <i>mantra.
</i>Then he suggests regrouping of the namams in this <i>stotra. </i>He<i> </i>wants
to split the <i>naama </i>878 into two as (1) <i>Tripuraa-Sri </i>and (2) <i>Vasamkarte.
</i>According to him the <i>Naama, Vasamkaree, </i>stands for the <i>Mudraa
Devi </i>of the fourth <i>Aavarana, Tripuraa-Sri </i>according to all
commentators is the presiding Goddess of the fifth <i>Aavarana. </i>The
annotator says (1) “a combination<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>of
these two does not appeal to common sense.” (2) “In no other place the names of
<i>Chakreeswaree </i>and <i>Mudraa Devi, </i>whether of the same <i>Aavarana </i>or
of different <i>Aavaranas, </i>have been combined.”</span><span

</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Hence he suggests the splitting of the <i>naama. </i>But the
word <i>Vasamkaree </i>need not necessarily mean the <i>Mudraa Devi. </i>Sri
Bhaskararya, the famous commentator interpreted it to mean “controller”. Now
the <i>Naama </i>means “controller of <i>Tripuraa-Sri”</i>, and the
inconsistency pointed out disappears–The annotator’s suggestion regarding the <i>naamams
</i>667, 668 and 907 also requires rethinking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
annotation, on the text proper, from the Yoga point of view, is the main
contribution of the author. One clear example of this annotation can be seen in
the case of the <i>naama “Chturbaahu Samanvitaa.” </i>This normally means “with
four hands “. According to this Yoga annotation, this <i>naama </i>suggests the
four petals of the lotus at the <i>Muladharachakra. </i>The Six coloured
figures showing the locations of the six chakras, and the Gurumandala etc.,
form a unique feature of this book and these are of immense use for a proper
understanding of the text and the annotation thereon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
a careful reading of this book any inquisitive reader may like to know (1)
whether some words like <i>Vissukra </i>and <i>Vissanga </i>denoting the names
of demons, have any symbolic meaning from the yoga point of view {2) how the
author has arrived at the meanings of some words here as given by him–e.g., (1)
“Siva Para” (410) Siva =Veda; Para = Before. “Sri Devi has existed before
Vedas.” (2) “Vyabriti (421) = Established” –“Sri Devi has established herself
as Gayatri in all the worlds”….Quotations from yoga texts in support of his
statements here and there, as for example, “By concentrating on the neck all
the worldly wants can be controlled” (32) will highly add to the
authoritativeness of this annotation. Correct transliteration of Sanskrit words
in the Roman script will enable the readers that are ignorant of the Devanagari
script to read and understand the Sanskrit words more correctly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
talking about modern literature in the Indian languages it is becoming more and
more common for the critics<i>, </i>as well as the authors, to flaunt the
Indian tradition and the native inspiration in the face of all comers, as if
the two magic terms would<i> </i>explain everything. Their importance can, of
course, be hardly over-looked. But it would be just as well to make no secret
of the debt owed, in many cases, to the great models of world literature that
might have, in some measure at least, influenced the Indian writers. Some of
the pioneers in Indian fiction like Bankim in Bengali, Veeresalingam in Telugu
and Madhavaiah in Tamil never tried to persuade their readers to go away with
the impression that they looked back, if at all, only to home-made products of
the familiar type illustrated<i> </i>by <i>Katka Sarit Sagara, Simhasana
Dwatrimsika </i>and the rest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Veeresalingam,
whose <i>Rajasekhara Charitram </i>was rightly claimed as the first Telugu
novel in the modern sense, did not expect his readers to assume that he had not
read an English novel. On the other hand, he expressly mentioned Goldsmith’s <i>The
Vicar of Wakefield, </i>on which he generally modelled his work<i>, </i>though
he had no need to adapt it all too mechanically. Almost in the same way, O.
Chandu Menon, the author of the first Malayalam novel, <i>Indulekha, </i>was
frank enough not to withhold his admiration from the novels of Disraeli and the
other contemporary classics of English fiction. This novel was first published
in 1890, and had seen over fifty editions to date. In the preface, he wrote: “I
began to read English novels extensively after I left Calicut in the end of
1886, and I then devoted all the leisure which my official duties left me, to
novel-reading.” He was a member of the Judicial Service, it may be remembered.
In a letter to the tra</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nslator (a member of the Civil Service),
he explained how he came to write this book: “First, my wife’s oft-expressed
desire to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>read in her own language a novel written after
the English fashion, and secondly, a desire on my own part to try whether I
should be able to create a taste amongst my Malayalee readers, not conversant
with English, for that class of literature, represented in the English language
by novels, of which at present they have no idea...to illustrate to my
Malayalee brethren the position, power and influence that our Nair women, who
are noted for their natural intelligence and beauty, would attain in society,
if they are given a good English education; and finally–to contribute my mite
towards the improvement of Malayalam literature, which I regret to observe, is
fast dying out by disuse as well as by abuse.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
would, perhaps, be enough to convince the reader today of this book (which has
appeared recently in a new edition revised by Mr. T. C. Sankara Menon) that its
author was not labouring either under false humility or the favoured but
crippling, sentiment of linguistic chauvinism. Nor had he any need to, as even
the non-Malayalam speaking reader (for whom the English translation is
primarily intended) is likely to find this story of absorbing interest, after
more than three quarters of a century of its first publication. For this,
perhaps, credit is due as much to the sensitiveness and virtuosity of the
translator as to the originality and imagination of the novelist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
story is simple enough in its basic essentials. The main strand is the love of
Indulekha, the beautiful and intelligent heroine, and Madhavan, the brilliant
and virtuous hero, both members of the same <i>Tharwad </i>(typical Malayalee
family, with all the nephews and nieces, besides the sons and daughters) and
their marriage in the end against the wishes of the powerful old <i>Karnawan </i>(head
of the entire household, a kind of <i>Pater familias, </i>whose word is
supposed to be law in all family matters). Across and around this strand are
woven quite a few others, also typical of old Malabar. There was an attempt by
the obstinate <i>Karnawan </i>to pack Indulekha (iron will under the velvet
glove) off in a customary liaison <i>(sambandham) </i>with a wealthy, stupid,
middle-aged clown, by name Suri Nambudripad, who makes a fool of himself in his
attempt to play the bridegroom. Then a Romeo-Juliet sort of tragedy is narrowly
averted when the hero is away and mis-informed that his lady-love had already
been married away. From Madras, where he is employed under the government, he
takes a trip, in a desperate bid to drown his sorrow, to Bombay, Calcutta and
other cities up north, in the course of which other experiences, exciting and
disillusioning, fall to his lot. Finally, after a lot or suffering on both
sides, they get married, with the approval and blessings of the penitent <i>Karnawan,
</i>and live happily ever after. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
modern standards, the novel might be considered longish, and a trifle too
elaborate in its description and dialogue, and leisurely in its pace. But then,
we have to make some allowance for the Victorian tradition in writing. The
didacticism is ill-concealed. One of the chapters towards the end is devoted to
a threadbare discussion of the policy of the Indian National Congress,
interesting in<i> </i>itself, though not central to the development of the
story. Other faults too it might have. But the fact that it has survived
translation, and is able to sustain reader’s interest at this distance of time,
is proof enough of its vitality and workmanship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

text of this ancient poem was established by the eminent South Indian Scholar
Swaminatha Aiyar, and Ramachandra Dikshitar translated it and edited it for
publication by the Oxford University Press, in l939. It has been thus available
to the English-knowing readers, for a pretty long time, and valued highly for
the astonishing amount of information it provides about the history and culture
of South India, and the civilisation of the people of this part of the country
in ancient times; their arts, customs, religion and philosophy. The story of
the poem has been established in recent times in other regional languages too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Danielou, the author of the volume under review, confesses that “he was led to
the study of this ancient Tamil classic, in the course of his work on ancient
Indian literature, concerning musical theory, but the interest of the novel
seemed to him so great that he undertook a complete translation of it.” He
claims that his interpretation of the numerous technical terms on music, in the
text, many of which earlier editors had considered obscure, is based on an
independent analysis of his own, of the theoretical possibilities of the
ancient musical system, and on parallel theories found in Sanskrit works on
music, dating between the commencement of the Christian era and the tenth
century, A. D. It is for scholars of musical theory to examine his
interpretation and pronounce on the validity of his theory and hypothesis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he has blazed a trail, which might lead to further studies, not only in the
history of musical theory, but in several other aspects of culture, like
poetry, dance, social customs, religious traditions, civil administration, and
military organisation, arts, crafts, trade and commerce, of the different parts
of India, and of their mutual influences and bearings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

novel is a veritable mine of information on various aspects of the life and
culture of the people of South India in ancient times, and a closer
acquaintance with its contents and a careful study of their characteristics, in
comparison with their counterparts in Sanskrit and other regional literatures,
may reveal mutual influences and co-operation, in a continuous process of
evolution, towards a common goal of a synthetic culture, and contribute to
strengthen the forces of national integration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the reader the fundamental and distinguishing features of Indian culture,
common to all the different sections of the Indian people, in the different
regions of the country, and persisting through the different periods of its
ancient history. It is clearly stated in the preamble of the work, in so many
words, that the poem illustrates three eternal precepts, which may be
recognised even now as the distinguishing features of Indian culture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Born
in l866, in a middle-class family, and distinguished even as a youth, for his
character as well as talents, Sri Konda Venkatappayya had a successful
educational career, and qualified for the learned profession of Law. Very soon
he made his mark in the profession and built up for himself a respectable
position of leadership at the Bar in his district. But with a rare spirit of
contentment, and zeal for public service, he gave up a lucrative practice, at a
comparatively young age of 49, in l9l5, and resolved to devote all his time,
energy and talents, to public service. By the time he came under the spell of
the Mahatma, he had thus, already to his credit, a commendable record of public
service in journalism, education and social reform. He was one of the founders
of the Andhra Movement, a movement for the separation of the Andhra districts
of the Composite Madras Presidency into a separate Province. But he was one of
the earliest in his part of the country to respond the call of the National
Congress, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, for a supreme effort to wrest
political independence for the country from the foreign rulers; he plunged
unhesitatingly and whole heartedly into the struggle, and led the Andhras, with
rare ability and leadership, to play a creditable part in the non-violent
fight, facing lathi-charges and courting imprisonment, as well<i> </i>as in the
constructive effort to strengthen the nation through programmes of promotion of
Khaddar and Village industries, propagation of Hindi as national language, and
the removal of untouchability. He lived up to a ripe old age, till after the
transfer of substantial power to the representatives of the people, when
Congress ministries began to run the administration in 1937 and the attainment
of independence in l947. But it is significant that he did not come to <i>occupy
</i>any important place in the Government, or in the Legislature, in the new
set-up. It is a commentary on his character as well as the quality of the new
leadership. He had been the acknowledged leader of the Andhras, and their
accredited representative in the Councils of the Mahatma, during the historic struggle,
when leadership called for courage, selfless service, suffering and sacrifice.
But as soon as leadership came to mean, after the attainment of independence,
and even slightly earlier, the exercise of power and influence, he was
relegated to the background, by the more assertive and aggressive among his
colleagues. He did not seem to mind it, though, but continued to serve the
nation in his own way, to advise, encourage, caution or warn the new leaders,
as and when necessary, without fear or favour. He was always ready to champion
the cause of the oppressed, and expose the ways of the unjust and corrupt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

perusal of the autobiography reveals that he was cut out by nature, not for
political leadership, which perhaps requires a certain capacity for intrigue,
and ambition for power, but for service to the people, which calls for courage,
devotion, suffering and sacrifice. His character stands out as a model for the
youth and the leaders of the succeeding generations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

life is an illustration of the power of character and idealism. Gifted with no
extraordinary talent of eloquence, or organising ability, he rose to the
position of the acknowledged leader of Andhra, and trusted and beloved
lieutenant of the Mahatma, and a universally respected elder statesman. He
dominated public life in Andhra for nearly half a century. His autobiography
therefore turns out to be a document of historical value, comparable to Nehru’s
autobiography, as a record of public life in Andhra, in the social and cultural
as well as political fields, during a critical period in the history of the
Nation and of Andhra. The language is chaste, and elegant, and the style
simple, and straight forward, and transparent, revealing the character in all
its beauty and purity, honesty, sincerity and public spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

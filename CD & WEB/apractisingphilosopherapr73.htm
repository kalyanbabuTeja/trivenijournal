style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of a personality like Sri Sampathgiri Rao, I need feel no
embarrassment to say a few words about him since intimate association could
only give one a more detailed picture of the man and in no manner alter one’s
idea of his essential characteristics, which are now really in the nature of
public property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
know that he has been associated with this institution, I mean the National
Educational Society, for almost four decades. Soon after he qualified himself
as a Literature Honours Graduate of the Madras University, from the Christian
College, he joined the National High School in its previous incarnation. When
owing to certain unhappy circumstances it ceased to function, he joined the staff
of the London Mission High School for a brief period and then became a member
of the English Department of the Central College here. Then it was that I had
the good fortune to be a student of his. He used to wear a suit and a turban,
looking very much like a Sanitary Inspector of the old days. That was the
heyday of the Non-co-operation Movement and as you all know, one of the
constructive items of activity propounded by Gandhiji was <i>National
Education. </i>Even during this brief period of his career as a teacher in the
Central College, Sri Sampathgiri Rao must have been feeling restless under the
urge to find his place in the National Movement, a place suitable to his
equipment, aptitude and temperament. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
college closed for the summer vacation. But before it reopened I found him one
day merrily riding on a bicycle apparelled in the manner that has become
familiar to all of us (Khadi dress) and with a look on his face which betokened
that the long-awaited dawn bad broken. He had joined the re-constituted
National High School as its Headmaster. That was a lucky day for the
institution. It was then housed in a building in New Taragupet. A few years
later, I joined the staff of the school and even today I remember, with a
feeling of exhilaration, the life we led with him as our captain. This decision
by Sri Sampathagiri Rao to change-over meant a great deal more than a sartorial
metamorphosis. It made a great change in prospects and security of tenure, the
consequences or which would last through his life. But obviously it was done
after full deliberation and, ever since then, his mind has not turned back on
the decision. Not only did he fit himself into the new environment of work but
wholeheartedly reconciled himself to the economic consequences of the change.
The latter means much more than appears on the surface and requires much
greater strength of mind and firmness of will than allows people to discern in
his mien. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a matter of great pride for this institution that, all along, it has been
broad-based upon the generosity of the many and does not owe its existence or
functioning to the munificence of a few. Sri Sampathgiri Rao became such a
natural and indeed an inevitable part of the school that he was identified with
the institution and the institution with him. That is, indeed, what one of his
pupils and colleagues, who is now in America, says in a letter written after he
learnt of Sri Sampathgiri Rao’s impending retirement. Numberless batches of
students have studied under him and there is hardly any place in this State or
even in the far corners of this vast country, where he does not find his old
pupils to greet him, with eager affection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
know that even the teaching personnel of the school had a democratic basis and
that one or the other of the teachers would become the Headmaster by the
consent of his colleagues. Though Sri Sampathgiri Rao was the Headmaster of the
school for the larger part of his tenure, there were substantial periods when
he was only a teacher. But every position he has held, he has held as by
natural right. You know that from being the “Prince of the Head-masters” to use
Sri V. S. Srinivasa Sastri’s apposite phrase, he became the first Principal of
the Second Grade College when the Society started one. It looked to everyone as
if that was his appointed place. So did it appear when he ultimately devolved
into Principal of a First Grade College. Now, that a man should have been the
teacher of a High School, the Headmaster of a High School, the Principal of a
Second Grade College and the Principal of a First Grade College, and that it
should be taken for granted that he discharged each one of these duties with
more than the requisite competence, is in itself a testimony to the stuff of
which he is made. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
work in the institution, however, hardly exhausted his energies or resources.
He was associated with many other activities and. amongst them, I may mention
the work he did for the Amateur Dramatic Association and in helping his friend
Sri T. T. Sharman to run his weeklies, particularly the “Mysore Chronicle”.
This has not been his sole sailing into journalism. He finds himself equally at
home in the humdrum business of writing for a daily or a weekly, in the more
staid avocation of editing a School Magazine, and in the exacting task of
steering a patrician periodical like the “Triveni”. Nor can one forget that, in
collaboration with a life-long friend of his (Sri V. Bhaskaran) he edited,
under the auspices of the Amateur Dramatic Association, the journal “The
Theatre” during its brief but colourful career. Talking of “Triveni”, I may
mention incidentally that, when its distinguished Editor, who had made the
cause of culture through the medium of that magazine his life mission, was kept
under preventive detention, Sri Sampathgiri Rao took it upon himself to run the
magazine from Bangalore, secured the co-operation of friends and did the job so
well, that even after the Editor’s release. Bangalore continued to be the home
of “Triveni”, until other exigencies dictated its transfer to another venue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Sampathgiri Rao was in the thick of the movement for the renaissance of
Kannada. He has been intimately associated with the Kannada Sahitya Parish ad
and he has wandered all over the land on its mission and similar missions. You
all know that he has translated into Kannada most of Rajaji’s writings. This
incidentally brings to my mind that he is a great linguist. His so-called
second language, in his early educational career, was Telugu. He lived in the
Tamil land and became proficient in Tamil. He specialised in English. He was
one of the earliest workers in the Hindi field and has picked up more than a
working knowledge of that language. It is refreshing to remember in today’s
context, when there has been an unfortunate recrudescence of linguistic
controversy, that Sri Sampathgiri Rao stands as the personification of
linguistic harmony and establishes the futility of such controversy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
the purely political aspect of our National Movement did not leave him totally
untouched and many of those who actually participated in the movement claimed
his tutelage, his work has mostly been in the constructive field. He has been
associated with the Khadi Movement right from the start and is himself an
excellent spinner. It is his pride that a good part of his clothing is made of
yarn spun by himself. He has been a living exponent of all that Gandhiji stood
for and it is but fitting that he should be the President of the Gandhi Study
Circle (Gandhi Vichar Parishat). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have all learnt with pleasure, though mixed with regret that he is parting from
us, that he has accepted the principalship of an educational institution in
Bihar. His contacts will thus be further extended and he will be our ambassador
there. And if we had the choice in our hands, we could not make a happier
choice. May I, on behalf of you all, extend our best wishes to him for the
success of his mission. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
long and deep educational experience has naturally been availed of by our
University and educational authorities and it is but natural that for long he
has been associated with the management of the Gurukula at Kengeri. He
represented the Teachers’ Constituency in the Legislative Council and was its
temporary Chairman. I do not, however, want to make this a catalogue of all his
activities. But I cannot fail to refer to his association with the Gokhale
Institute of Public Affairs as a member of its Governing Body right from the
start. I am too close to that institution to say more about it. I shall content
myself with saying that it looked as if he built his own abode at the threshold
of the site given to the Institute so as to be its guardian angel. We shall,
indeed, sadly miss </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall now turn to what I may call his human or non-institutional side. He is richly
endowed by nature with the gift of an alert mind, a warm heart and deep
interest in all matters of culture. He has read widely and deeply and he is one
of our most accomplished speakers. He is a great connoisseur of music, art (not
excluding the culinary art) and the drama and I know that he has himself
appeared on the stage. I particularly remember how at a conference of the
Pandits’ Parishad at Srinivasapur it was decided to get up an impromptu drama
under the leadership of Sri Kasturi and they not only improvised the drama
itself, but Sri Sampathglri Rao played one of its leading parts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
a personality like this has necessarily to pay the penalty by giving the
impression that he has the defects of these very qualities. Many think that his
general attitude is one of the un-discriminating benevolence, that he is soft,
that he is not sufficiently assertive that he yields far too much when he ought
not to yield at all, and that he allows himself to be dragged hither and
thither, while his stature is such that he can stand up to any one he has to
deal with. But that would be a very superficial assessment. Obviously, he makes
a distinction between what is fundamental and vital on the one hand and what
constitutes the subsidiary things in life in which it is wise and proper to
accommodate other points of view and others’ desires. He does not enter into
needless controversy. But in regard to any matter which represents the core of
his beliefs and values, you will find that he will deal with it firmly and effectively.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
mind is a rich storehouse of knowledge and experience. The demands made on him
by educational and students’ organisations are endless. His generous heart does
not permit him easily to refuse and you find him scheduled to talk not only in
Bangalore, but in a hundred places all over this part of the country. Could you<i>
</i>find a better companion? Association with him is a continuous process of
education and joy, enlivened as it is by a keen sense of humour, which,
normally gentle in its manifestation, can occasionally be devastating, but it
is never tinged with malice or bitterness. This follows essentially from his
outlook, which is based on equipoise of mind. He has had his quota of trials
and misfortunes in life. But he has not allowed them to sour his heart or daunt
his spirit. On the positive side, he exemplifies the principle that the most
effective way of enriching one’s life is to enrich the lives of those around
oneself. He gives of his very best to the community and he draws the utmost favour
that life offers him. Never seeking to reach beyond severe limitations that he
has imposed upon himself by the choice of his career, he husbands his resources
with great judiciousness. This enables him to be always in good cheer and to
radiate cheer to those around him. I can only say that a man, who has attained
such a scheme of values and lives by them, can with justice be described as a
practising philosopher. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Let me say, this institution is much more than the
brick and mortar in which it is housed. It represents an approach, a spirit and
a tradition which Sri Sampathgiri Rao’s own career has gone to build up. His
personality is a permanent part of its very constitution. It is therefore most
appropriate that his portrait should adorn this hall. I consider it a great
privilege that I should be asked to unveil his portrait and I do so with the
utmost pleasure. And may I express my gratitude to the management for according
me this opportunity of paying this tribute of affection and regards not only on
my own behalf but on behalf of you all. </p>

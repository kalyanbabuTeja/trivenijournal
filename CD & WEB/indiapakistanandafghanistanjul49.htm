a considerable time these three neighbouring countries have been in the
limelight of international news. All of them are members of the UNO and
proclaim that they sincerely believe in its ideals. They are next-door
neighbours to each other, having a common frontier. Afghanistan is a sovereign
independent Islamic monarchy, which has had a history and also made some
history during the two wars in the present century. Pakistan is a new Dominion
with no history behind it, but for the immediate past when the Muslim League in
India preached the doctrine of intolerance and hatred and created an orgy of
bloodshed and arson in the length and breadth of India. Having achieved
Pakistan by preaching hatred against the Hindus, its creators are not able to
control their masses in peace, in support of their State. The passions of the
people are running high against the State itself for a vent. Mr. Jinnah
achieved Pakistan by making wild promises to the Indian Muslims, the British,
and the Arab countries of the Middle East. He promised that Pakistan would be
an Islamic State governed by the Shariat–Rule of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Personal Law.
Many prominent public men in Pakistan, even in the League fold, proclaim that
the present regime in Pakistan is a direct negation of the Shariat. The Pir
Saheb of Manki Sharif, the trusted </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>lieutenant of Mr.
Jinnah in his fight against the Khan Brothers, and a member of the Muslim
League Couneil, is among the disgruntled. He formed a rival Muslim League in
the North-West Frontier Province claiming that it is the genuine one, and
draWing the Muslim masses into his fold by his lead on behalf of the
much-coveted Shariat. Quite baffled </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by the ever-increasing
popularity of the Pir of Manki, the Premier of the Frontier declared the rival
League illegal under the Frontier Regulations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Jinnah promised to Britain that Pakistan would be a member of the British
Commonwealth of Nations and something of a vassal to Britain in the matter of
foreign policy. This has had the approval of the U.S.A. State Department, and
it is now an open secret that the Partition plan was drawn up as between London
and Washington, embodying the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dictates of the Foreign Office and the
State Department. This plan received the unstinted support of the Conservative
diehards of Britain. The creation of Pakistan was ‘Paradise Regained’ for
Britain for the ‘</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Paradise Lost’ in India, and it was so till Mr.
Jinnah’s death. This was proclaimed with evident satisfaction by Commodore
Harvey in the House of Commons. This Conservative M.P. said also that Pakistan
was more friendly to Britain than India and that there were three British
Governors out of a total of four in Pakistan, and a number of Secretaries and
Advisers. He also referred to the commercial and trade concessions that Britain
enjoys in Pakistan as against the position in India. Mr. Jinnah nominated Sir
Francis Mudie, the Governor of the West Punjab, to be his successor, keeping in
view the security of the infant State which he so dearly cherished and also
because of the efficient running of the administration. But then, how did
Khwaja Nazimuddin become Governor-General? The leaders of Pakistan feared that
East Pakistan might walk out of the camp to demand either a separate State, as
the Karens have been doing in Burma, or for a re-union with the real mother,
India, in view of the cold-shouldering by Western Pakistan. They brought the
Premier of East Bengal and installed him in the vacancy “till a successor is
appointed.” The Khwaja was more than satisfied and he helped to retain East
Bengal in the Pakistan fold. West Pakistan also was satisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mr. Jinnah’s Mudie could not keep silent. He began meddling in local politics.
The Nawab of Mamdot’s Cabinet was dismissed and Section 93-A (Pakistan
Constitution) rule established by appointing British Advisers to Sir Francis
Mudie. There were constant bickerings, both internal and external. The Council
of the West Punjab Muslim League has demanded the recall of Sir Francis Mudie
and the appointment of a Pakistani to the post. They have also demanded that
elections should be held immediately to the Legislative Assembly to form a
popular Ministry to handle the affairs of the Province. These demands of the
Muslim League Council have caught the Muslim leaders and Cabinet members of
Pakistan, quite unawares. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan and President
Chaudary Khaliq-uz-zaman started negotiations with Mian Abdul Bari (President,
West Punjab Muslim League) over the affair, but he is sitting tight over the
resolution. Further, there have been meetings, resolutions and demonstrations
throughout Western Pakistan against Pakistan staying in the Commonwealth. Thus
the problems of Pakistan have been ever-increasing, giving the dock to Mr.
Jinnah’s assurances and proclamations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

foreign policy has been, “Stab first; and comprain first that you are stabbed
in the back.” This is apparent in her policies towards India and Afghanistan,
both her next-door neighbours. Afghanistan is an ancient Kingdom, and quite
surprisingly, she has had a policy of antagonism to Great Britain from the very
beginning. She fought the Indo-Afghan wars of 1901 with the active support of
Czarist Russia and Weimar Germany, for which she had to pay heavy reparations
to the British. Again in the Great War (1914-18) she fought on the side of the
Germans and hit the British Empire in India. This opened the eyes of the
British who planned to create a ‘Tribal Belt’ of Pathan Tribesmen with complete
independence, internal and external.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

brings us to the topic of Pathanistan. The problem of Pathanistan is no new
creation, as the Pak leaders allege in their accusations of the Khan Brothers,
India, and Afghanistan. The people of the Tribal Belt between Pakistan and
Afghanistan are of common stock with the Afghans and the Pathans of the
North-West Frontier Province. Great Britain failed miserably in her attempts to
woo the people and bag in this region for strategic purposes. Though British
Imperialism </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>devoured camels, this small, hilly, barren
region has proved a deadly gnat to them. But British Imperialism never accepts
defeat; so it staged a successful retreat, and adopted the policy of ‘Divide
and Rule.’ Four </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>districts inhabited by Pathans were included in
the North-West Frontier Province, coming directly under the British flag in
India, and a Tribal Belt was formed out of the rest, with an assurance that the
independence of the Tribal Chiefs both in internal and external affairs would
be safe-guarded and cherished by the British Government. The Phaktoons are a
freedom-loving and peace-loving people whose energies can be profitably
harnessed for peaceful avocations. This remarkable feat has been achieved by
the Khan Brothers among the Frontier and Tribal Pathans under the banner of
Khudai Khidmatgars in the Red Shirts’ Organisation. The credit of rallying them
under a non-violent programme for peaceful ends goes to this Organisation which
has, for its ideal, freedom from foreign domination through the observance of
the Gandhian principles of Truth and Non-violence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

managed under the supervision of Pakistan, and </span><span style='font-size:

and break their heads over this rocky, barren soil which is less than 7,000

Afghanistan says that Mr. Jinnah gave them an assurance that Pakistan would not
interfere in the affairs of Afghanistan vis-a-vis the Tribal area. But the
successors of Mr. Jinnah in office, who preside over the policy-making, have
not made themselves responsible for carrying on the pronouncements of Mr.
Jinnah. Though Pakistan is the successor-in-title of the British Government
which managed the affairs of the Tribal area, it has also inherited the preaching
of evil and mischief among them, only to put down ruthlessly their ‘own
brethren’ on provocation. The innocent Pathans have often been the victims of
such a dastardly game. During 1946, when the Interim Coalition Government was
in power in New Delhi, this area was bombed by the orders of the British Agent
in Mardan in order to quell a Pathan riot which, according to the British
Government, was spreading disaster and unrest in the otherwise peaceful
Frontier. This was done unilaterally by the Agent, and when it came to the
knowledge of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan he immediately informed Pandit Nehru of it,
and the Pandit stopped the bombing immediately. But the Frontier Muslim League
made political capital out of this incident by propagating that the Nehru Government
bombed the innocent Pathans carrying on their peaceful activities! The same
plot was unmasked by the honest Pathans themselves when Panditji went on his
historic tour of the Tribal area, where he received an enthusiastic reception
at their hands. But this bombing of the Pathans has been repeated several times
by Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
people inhabiting the Tribal area, on either side of the Durand Line, are
Pathans who have affinity with the people of Afghanistan on the western side of
the border and with those of the Pathans in the four border districts of the
North-West Frontier Province. The Khan Brothers demand the right of
self-determination for the people of this ‘no-man’s land’ along with the
Pathans of Baluchistan and Kalat. They contend that the Pathans belong to a
separate blood-group from the Punjabis, racially, culturally, and
geographically. Afghanistan supports this contention and says that such a
democratic right must be conceded to the Pathans of Pakistan who must be
afforded a chance to express their wish to join their brethren on the other
side of the border. Pakistan also says all this in her own favour, in support
of her claims, minus the right of self-determination for the Pathans and the
holding of a plebiscite. The reason is not far to seek: the Pathan is the same
wherever he is, either in Afghanistan, in the Tribal area, Pakistan,
Baluchistan or Kalat. Supposing the Pathans favour Pathanistan and vote for it,
Pakistan will lose the whole of the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, Kalat,
not to mention the Tribal belt. Thus she will lose large slices of Western
Pakistan, retaining only West Punjab and Sind. This remnant of West Pakistan
will be lesser in area than East Pakistan, with only half of the latter’s
population. The agitation that is at present gaining ground with a section of
the League and also of the Congress in East Bengal might then lead to a demand
for the shifting of the capital from Karachi to Dacca or Chittagong. Again,
Pathanistan will have a common border, for a greater length with Indian Union
in Kashmir and they can come closer still. The claim of Afghanistan for a right
of passage through Pakistan to the port of Karachi need not then be pressed.
Afghanistan will emerge as one of the larger States of Asia and the largest
Islamic State. In the event of Pakistan winning the duel, the British, who have
all along been the antagonists of Afghanistan, will reach to her very gates and
indulge in a sinister diplomatic warfare, in alliance with Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recently, Sir Mirza Ismail, former Dewan of Mysore, Jaipur, and Hyderabad,
writing in a London newspaper, revealed that Soviet Russia is behind the claims
of Afghanistan for the fight over Pathanistan. Russia is trying to come as near
as possible to the gateways of the Indian sub-continent. She wishes to approach
India and Pakistan by the land route via Kabul and the Khyber Pass, because the
route over the Gilgit is a highly fortified one, with the heaviest garrisoning
of troops all over the Indian and Pakistan borderlands. There is an overland
railway-and-road route from Kabul to the Frontier, along which commerce is
being carried on during peace time. There is wisdom in his contention, that a
small and backward nation like Afghanistan spoiling for a fight with a powerful
neighbour, supported by a strong international Power, is simply headstrong and
foolish. Both parties invoke divine displeasure, and contend it is contrary to
Islam, humanity, international law and rights, and What not! But in a recent

Afghanistan on the 12th of June. Quite conveniently Pakistan denied the
aggression and explained that the bombing had to be resorted to in self-defence
against the rifle-fire opened on an R.P.A.F. plane by the men of the Faqir of
Ipi and some members of the Afghan Levies on the Pakistan side of the Durand
Line, and that an enquiry is proceeding into the whole affair. But, we in India
know too well what credence to give to the ‘explanations’ of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pakistan’s
aggressions. We know them in Kashmir, We know them in Jaisalmer, and many times
at Ambala, Rawalpindi and in the Tripura State on the East Bengal border. This
time the explanation is offered to a neighbour of ours, while on previous
occasions, the explanation was offered to us, followed by counter-allegations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mirza urged India and Pakistan to be friends and to iron out the existing
differences in view of the impending ‘Red’ menace across China and Burma on the
east, and through Afghanistan on the West. It is significant that the Red-bogey
crosses only the land-frontiers and not so easily the water-frontiers, as may
be seen in the cases of Eastern European countries, China, Malaya, Indo-China,
and finally Burma. Afghanistan also must be viewed in the same context and, if
inevitable, India, Pakistan and Burma as well. The hint must be taken by these
three countries and acted upon quite soon, before being overpowered by the
advancing forces. Moreover, the Muslims of the other countries did not prove
difficult to be converted ‘Red’. So, let us beware.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nationalist public opinion in India is satisfied with the achievement of Pandit
Nehru at the Prime Ministers’ Conference. It is also gratified at the thought
that President Truman has extended an invitation to Pandit Nehru to visit the
U.S.A. The thought itself gives some satisfaction,–that our national leaders
are being promoted to be international leaders of public opinion and that their
counsels are likely to carry weight. Though we have offered to co-operate with
Russia without sacrificing the fundamental concepts of democracy, Russia has
been too shrewd and cautious to waver. We offered to co-operate with her in
Indonesia, on the question of Colonies and Trusteeship, and race-prejudice and
the much talked of ‘white-man’s burden’; but every time we were cold-shouldered
and frequently let down. The first of the occasions was when India and the
Ukraine contested the seat on the Security Council vacated by Turkey. There was
the well-known deadlock over the 2/3rd majority, and India withdrew from the
contest. But the contention of Russia was rather mischievous, that the British
Commonwealth had already three seats on the Security Council–Britain, Canada
and Australia–and this bloc was over-represented. Russia proclaimed this in
spite of our having an independent foreign policy, distinct from that of the
Commonwealth countries, and also our express assurance to Russia that we could
co-operate with her on vital issues. We made an offer of a trade pact which has
been received half-heartedly; the offer for a treaty of friendship, commerce
and cultural relationship is being ‘studied’ by the accredited Russian
Ambassdor in New Delhi, who will advise his Government. Except in the cases of
South Africa and Indonesia, we have not been treated by USSR in the way that we
ought to have been. This is only in politics; but in economics too it is the
same. At the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and Far East
Conference at Ootacamund, when our Delegation pressed for the <i>de jure </i>membership
of Indonesia, there was not the unreserved support of the Russian Delegate
while we were fighting the four die-hard imperialists–English, French, Dutch
and American. Though we have no axe to grind against anybody, whether it is a
neighbour or another, whether it is a big-power or a vassal State, we are
particularly satisfied that our offer of friendship to America has been

politically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

again, Russia is not late for the bus. Mr. and Begum Liaquat Ali have accepted
the invitation of the Government of Russia to visit Moscow. This comes with
special fervour when the Commonwealth Conference has ended and India has agreed
not to snap the silken tie binding India to the Commonwealth with no ‘Crown’ to
‘link.’ Certain circles have expressed the view that Russia now intends to
disrupt the Commonwealth by withdrawing the ‘most faithful member’ of the Commonwealth
in Asia. Whatever Liaquat Ali Khan or Chaudry Klialiq-uz-Zaman may say about
its being a personal invitation to the Prime Minister, the fact remains that
the Kremlin does nothing without a motive: they are always very cautious in the
Palace with Red tapestry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

then? If Afghanistan and Pakistan are to be turned Red, it is only India that
can remain an independent State in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Seeing the
trend of events in Burma and Indo-China, is it not all the more necessary for
the three neighbours with common frontiers to unite and fight the common menace
by forming a Joint Defence Council with a common defence policy? This does not
mean that we should be aggressive towards a fourth nation, as is the case of
the Atlantic Pact countries, but only that we should stop our mutual bickerings
and plan a common defence. This will avoid needlessly heavy individual defence
budgets which are crushing our nationals, and enable us to divert vast
resources to nation-building activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

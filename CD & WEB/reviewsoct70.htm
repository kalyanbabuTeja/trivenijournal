out that for a proper understanding and appreciation of contemporary
philosophy, it is both desirable and necessary to have a background knowledge

to be associated with his name, he cannot deny his indebtedness to the
intellectual climate of his time as well as to the philosophical enquiries that
have preceded him. As the authors observe: “Plato did not set out to express
Platonism, Locke did not set out to express Empiricism, and Peirce did not set
out to express Pragmatism. Each man was impressed by a set of intellectual
problems and combined old modes of thought with newly-invented modes in order
to attack these problems...no philosopher lives in an intellectual vacuum: the
raw materials and gross processes of thought have been made available to him.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

things. I was sitting, stooping forward, head bowed alone in front of this
black, knotty mass. Then I had this vision. It left me breathless. Never, until
these last few days, had I understood the meaning of “existence.” If anyone had
asked me what existence was, I would have answered, in good faith, that it was
nothing, simply an empty form which was added to external things without
changing anything in their nature. And then all of a sudden, there it was,
clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost the harmless
look of an abstract category: it was the very paste of things...How long will
this fascination last? I was the root of the chestnut tree. Or rather I was
entirely conscious of its existence. Still detached from it, since I was
conscious of it, yet lost in it, nothing but it. Time had stopped: a small
black pool at my feet; it was impossible for something to come <i>after</i>
that moment. I have liked to tear myself from that atrocious joy, but I did not
even imagine it would be possible. I was inside; the black stump did <i>not
move</i>, it stayed there, in my eyes, as a lump of food sticks in the
windpipe. I could neither accept nor refuse it. At what cost did I raise my
eyes? Did I raise them? Rather did I not obliterate myself for an instant in
order to be reborn in the following instant with my head thrown back and my
eyes raised upward? In fact, I was not even conscious of the transformation.

short volume, of nearly seventy-two pages, contains some of the wise words
spoken by Sri Vasvaniji, who in his life was a close associate of Mahatma
Gandhi. Even as early as 1921, at the time of Gandhiji’s starting of the
journal <i>Young India</i>, this man of prophetic vision had presaged that
“Gandhi’s name will be remembered down the ages, after so many of the names of
contemporaries have been forgotten.” Himself a pursuer of the path of
renunciation and known for his utterly selfless existence, it is no wonder that
the two saintly spirits carne together in no time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to Karachi or the present Pakistan, he had travelled widely both in India and

are gathered about five talks of his to gatherings at Poona where he discoursed
on the Gita. At such meetings he felt the need to speak on Gandhiji and his
mission on earth. In the first of his talks we have his exhortation upon
fearlessness, which was Gandhiji’s constant appeal to his followers. The next
talk is upon simplicity and humility, both of which were Gandhiji’s inalienable
traits. Again he referred in the third talk to the famous lines <i>Lead Kindly
Light </i>of Cardinal Newman, which happened to be the Mahatma’s favounte daily
prayer song in his Ashram. The next two lectures deal with the conception of
Gandhiji’s love of humanity and his conception of ‘Swaraj’ for India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

references to the great humanitarian work of the Mahatma. It is worth
remembering the words of this saint uttered after the passing away of Gandhiji.
He said: “Where among India’s distinguished patriots is there today, one
disciple of Gandhi, inspired by his love of the Rishis and saints, his
reverence for the village folk, his readiness not to ‘patronise’ the
untouchables but to share their ‘dirty work’ and so to bless them and be

his love for Mumtaj Begum to last till eternity. Jagadisan is inspired by
similar thoughts for Sastri and so this edifice of Sastri in a book form. He
had such love and affection, regard and respect for Sastri, the man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Sastri and the dovetailing, and veneering in the construction increases

them. If rules are not rigid from the start, several semi-geniuses will show
themselves. That is why I am not a martinet. Not that I love order and
discipline the less, but that I love freedom more.” This was the man Sastri in
the truest of terms and this Boswell of a Jagadisan, to Sastri could do no more
to describe Sastri’s mind than recite Johnson’s words on Burke. His stream of
mind was perpetual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jagadisan has indeed made a novel out of Sastri’s life to make it engaging and

was during the last century that a protest and reform movement started in the
order of Jaina monks under the lead of <i>Acharya Bhikshu. </i>He sought to
counter the many evils that had sprung up in the organisation in decadence and
laid down a simple but effective discipline which he called the Thera Pantha.
The life and work of the Acharya is described in detail by Muni Nathmul. The
movement is continued today under the guidance of Acharya <i>Tulsi </i>who has
added the <i>anuvrata </i>movement to the scheme of reformation. The <i>anuvrata,
</i>as the name implies, calls for change in the smallest details of one’s
life, be he a monk or a householder. It is a daily discipline of mind, live and
body. The emphasis is on the individual. <i>Religion </i>as propagated by
Acharya Tulsi, admits the claims of the intellect and science to a great
extent. Elements of Jaina Yoga enter into its practical bearings. In this
perspective <i>Life and Philosophy </i>are not two separate watertight
compartments; life is the field for the application of philosophy. All the
departments of life are legitimate spheres of this rational philosophy of the
Soul. The <i>intellect </i>can not fully understand the truths enunciated in
religion based upon spiritual experience but it has its legitimate areas of
scrutiny. Within its limits reason exercises a wholesome function in keeping
out superstition and ignorance. Like the intellect, <i>Morality </i>too has its
claim; only it must be a living standard based upon the values of the soul.
Morality differs from plane to plane, from time to time. Man must know the
inner bearings of the laws of Morality and apply them intelligently to
situations as they arise. Man is not an automaton to be governed by text-book
rules. He is a living soul endowed with <i>boundless power </i>to work out the
weal of himself and his fellow-beings. Religion, Yoga, Ethics, Philosophy</span><span

Sri is a name to conjure with among writers of modern Telugu poetry. He holds a
unique place among the progressive poets of Andhra. This Miscellany was brought
out on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday with the intention of offering a
sample of the poet’s work to non-Telugu readers. To poesy: A Rhapsody, and
Forward March represent Sri Sri at his best as an inspired and inspiring bard
of Man. His English renderings reveal the poet’s mastery of the language as
well as his keen awareness of the changing trends of Western poets. As one who
keeps the windows of his mind open and lets in diverse influences to permeate
his poetic sensibility, Sri Sri stands as a refreshing example of a poet whose
spirit is universal in its sweep and thoroughly modern in tone as well as
temper. He envisages a rosy future for all mankind and breathes a serener ether
and rarer atmosphere like all great visionaries who discard the sordid world
broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls. He is the harbinger of a
glorious dawn on the horizon of life, and unfurls the banner of insurrection
hurling defiance at all that impedes the downtrodden man’s onward march. As one
who has added new dimension and infused new dynamism to modern Telugu poetry,
Sri Sri stands unrivalled. The Miscellany under review offers some of the
finest specimens of his vintage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The attempt to offer to non-Telugu readers through
the medium of English translation some of the masterpieces of modern Telugu
short-story is quite commendable. Of all the literary forms the short-story in
Telugu has attained a high level of development in technique as well as
content. As an emotional snap-shot of life, the short-story achieves intensity
and unified impact for which we look in vain in a novel that revels in its wide
scope and broad sweep. A compressed novel cannot be called a short-story just
as an expanded short-story can never become a novel. This distinction will
always be borne in mind by a practitioner of the art of short-story writing who
has a keen sense of form and who realises that it almost grazes the lyric in
emotional incandescence and the drama in its concrete delineation. Masters of
modern Telugu short-story whose works are given a fair representation in this
volume have understood the specialty of this literary form and have scored many
triumphs. However we feel that the inclusion of the finest stories of Veluri
Sivarama Sastry, Sripada Subrahmanya Sastry, Viswanatha Satyanarayana,
Karunakumara and Munimanikyam would have made the anthology more representative
and comprehensive. No anthology can dispense with Gurajada Apparao’s
“Diddubaatu” and its omission is conspicuous. </p>

you may want to comfort me the world goes its way caring neither for me nor for
you and carrying all souls good or bad as you may call them with it,” exclaims
one of the characters in the novel. Though it is born out of the crucible of
suffering, the realisation is chastening and comforting. The clash between the
individual will and the inexorable stream of tendency has been perceptively
presented by Mr. Ganguli in this novel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

owing allegiance to the universal community alone but despite his
protestations, there is something of the Vedic mystic in him. Some of his
observations bring to mind the authors of the Upanishads: “What is that
mysterious essence in me, which forms no part of the body and which does not
contact it, even though without it the body I so much love is an untouchable
carcass?” (page 22) ”I am thankful to God for keeping me blind to the future.
If every night when I went to sleep, He wiped off my memory of the day gone by,
I could move light without the painful load of the regrets, pains and sorrows
of the past.” (page 105) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

All this he does, not in the spirit of a Messiah come down to earth to unfold a
gospel, but with the profound realisation that probably like the sand grain on
a mighty revolving stonewheel imagining that it is able to change and regulate
its own activities, our vanity and presumption had been making us relate events

Yet, in India, there does not seem to be any organised effort at collecting and
collating the folk literatures of the various ages and regions of India. True,
folk tales amuse and entertain children mostly and the great majority of such
stories are but feats of imagination and make-believe. But imagination is a
mental exercise in its own right. Besides, each, story has a moral, and a
discourge in virtue is best inculcated through absorbing tales. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

future of the United Nations is entwined with the forces of the mid-twentieth
century. However, the contradictions of the United Nations are only too
apparent. For instance, the Latin American and Arab States have nearly fifty
per cent of all the votes of the United Nations, even though they constitute a
fraction of the total world population. Again the attitude displayed by the
delegates (including the Indian delegates) in dealing with some of the vital
issues of our time has not unfairly exposed them to the charge of being neutral
in favour of some particular bloc. The present malaise is something more than a
political crisis. It is not a question of one group trying to mediate between
the two super-powers; the most important issue is the preservation of liberty.
And it is to be hoped that in the years to come, the United Nations would make
an effective contribution to the gradual fulfilment of what Cicero called
humanitas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book is divided into nine chapters, and the first two give us a clear account
of enormous range of Jain religious literature and the antiquity and history of
Jainism. Chapter III is a clear account of the Jain conception of Reality as
many-sided and subsequent chapters deal about the nature of knowledge, Jaina
doctrine of relativism (syad vaada), Karma and transmigration. Chapter VIII on
Jain conduct is concise and highly informing. The concluding chapter deals
elaborately about art and architecture, the Jain temples, caves in Ellora and
the statue of Gomatesvara and other aspects. The volume is a valuable book on
Jainism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

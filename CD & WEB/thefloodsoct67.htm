sun was shining bright and the sky was in clear blue. But, white clouds were
wandering in the heavens often obscuring the sun; it was as if the sun and the
clouds were engaged in a sort of hide-and-seek game. Consequently, the earth
below appeared enjoying the bliss of light and shade alternately. A cold breeze
was blowing at intervals from the direction of the distant mountains; and the
leaves were rustling to the wind often, as if murmuring about something
impending. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the only two-storey building belonging to the Zamindar of that mediocre
town. The building had all the elegance of sophisticated style: the walls were
thoroughly white-washed; silk curtains were hanging on doors and windows; there
were a big compound before the building and a pavement of cement from the
building to the big iron gate with beautiful flower gardens on both the sides;
in fine, everything was neat and orderly indicating the aesthetic sense of the
inhabitants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the gate, there was a jeep. Aham, the Kumar Zamindar, and his friend Sawmya,
hand in hand, came out of the building. Aham wore a woolen pant and a silk shirt
tucked. Sawmya wore ordinary cotton pant and shirt. A double-barrelled gun was
hanging on Aham’s shoulder. They walked down the cement pavement to the
awaiting jeep; Aham placed his gun on the seat and sat before the steering.
Sawmya took his seat beside his friend. A peon followed them with a covered
basket in one hand and a big flask in the other; he placed the two in the rear
and took his seat on the back seat. And the jeep was ready to start. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the opportunity, a beggar-maid, who had been lurking there since long to beg a
paisa or two any babu that might come out of the bungalow, stretched her hand
towards the Kumar Zamindar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anger
concentrated red in Aham’s eyes. His angry looks surveyed her from top to
bottom. Prakriti was her name, but was rudely called as Pakki by the people
because of her shabby countenance and begging profession. Her complexion was
neither black nor white but an amicable admixture of the two, only appearing
unattractive for want of proper tending. She had an oblong face, wide and
sparkling eyes, a chiselled nose, a well-shaped mouth, and a pointed chin:
certainly not an unattractive figure, but only obscured amid her loose, thick,
and thickly curled hairs whose ends had assumed the colour and stiffness of
copper wires due to lack of application of oil and comb. She wore a dirty
garment hardly sufficient to conceal the curves and turns of her youth. While
she held stretching her right hand towards them, she had a small tin bowl
hugged, between the left arm and the breast, like a mother clasping her baby to
her breast with one hand while doing her domestic work with the other. Her bowl
contained just a cup of rice of different qualities–rough and fine, old and
new, polished and unpolished. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sent his hand down his pocket, took out his cigarette case and lighter, lit one

jeep was wheeling steadily on the road. Sawmya was silent and looking ahead
through the front glass pane at the inclined zigzag road on which the jeep was
running up. Aham’s attention was not steady on his driving; he was thinking
about his friend and his possible inward reaction about his own remark, as
regards the beggar-girl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

availed the chance and in one breath he said: “You know our friends always pine
to hear me talk about different matters. They always applaud me for my
knowledge. They appreciate my courage, pursuits, and aptitudes. But, I find you
seldom agree with me. But, let me be frank; I always try to impress upon you;
till today hardly could I succeed. But, I never hesitate to cling to my views.
You may call it….pride.” He turned the jeep on to the trunk road. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

shrugged his shoulders and said: “Leave my case alone. Let me tell you one
thing. All those who pine for your friendship ’re none but yes-men. It’s more
appropriate to say they hanker after you more for the parties you give, the
money you shell down for them, than for any real friendship. We shouldn’t be
lured away by these face-praisers. Please don’t be offended if I say….”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the have-nots should work and pray for the welfare of all. That’s the basic
pattern of social bondage in this country of ours. That’s, in fact, the keynote
of our philosophy devised and taught by our Vedic sages. To be great or

to have heard a wild roar mingled with the gush of the gale. Aham fired the
second bullet, in which direction he himself did not know. He pressed the
trigger in vain a third time forgetting that both the bullets were released.
Confusion confounded him in which unknowingly he dropped the gun. In the
negligible light, they heard a terrific noise of something taking a leap from
the bush into the shrubs on the other side of the path. Sawmya focussed the
torch light in the direction and cried in panic: “There, there it is!” There
was no response from his friend. He looked back and in the light of the torch
light he found Aham taking up to his heels as fast as he could and the peon was
already out of sight. In utter confusion, he dropped the torchlight and the
leather bag unaware and could hardly refrain from adopting his friend’s example

like an Evening Star in the darkness at a distance, slightly elevated from the

out of charity. As Aham reached the hut, big drops of an impending down-pour
began to fall heavily. Those hitting the palmyra leaves of the hut began to
produce a rhythmic sound. A clear voice from inside the hut invited him: “It’s
raining, get in babu, lest you should be drenched.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of status stood as a huge hurdle preventing him from entering the wretched
dwelling of a dirty beggar-girl. He withdrew his head and looked around, but it
was completely dark. In the dim light available just then for a moment caused
by a lightning, he could perceive that the place was lonely and that no other

violent sounds of the gale, the thunders, and the severe rain. His only concern

Bitterly cold wind was still blowing. He quickly went out of the hut in
knee-deep water. The little sparkling light produced by the frequent lightnings
enabled him to have a view of the situation. The surroundings of the hut were
full of water. He could see the trees and the huge rocks below submerged in the
flood waters. The roaring sounds of waters rolling down the rocky slopes of

took speed vigorously tossing. He had, therefore, had to hold firmly a beam of
the drifting roof to escape being thrown into the water. The fiercely whirling
and circling speedy current implanted terror in his heart. He saw huge branches
and even entire trees drifted by the current. Now and then, dead snakes and
birds, animals and human bodies, were coming carried by the current. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

grieved for food. The gush of the wild wind scorched his throat. The water at
his disposal was dirty. He was so much thirsty, his intestines were so much
squeezed, that he could scarcely refrain from resolving to drink even that
dirty water. He stretched his hand to lift a palmful of it to his mouth. Just
then he was hit on the head by the hanging branch of a tree that could not
withstand the powerful current, and he had a vigorous jolt. And he had to withdraw

aloud for his fate–cried in vain for His mercy. He cried and cried and was
fully exhausted. The tears in his eyes too were exhausted. As he was carried
speedily by the current, dry twigs of hanging branches of trees scraped his
back as he lay exhausted. His shirt was torn, his skin was awfully scratched,
and blood oozed profusely. A hawk or two, now and then pecked at his back. But,

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
little more than a decade ago, our language-area could not be easily located on
the map of India. It is Orissa’s misfortune that the entire period of British
rule, which brought glory and prosperity to most other regions of India, was
one dark night for her. But the Oriyas justifiably proud of the fact that, all
through this dismembered existence, it was their language which kept the
impulse to be re-united, ever green. And so, the Oriyas living in the four
different Provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Madras and Madhya Pradesh, were united at
long last in the year of grace 1936. Orissa, however, is only a diminutive
shadow of the historic kingdom of Kalinga or Utkal, which extended from the Ganges
to the Godavari and from the sea-board to the foot-hills of the Vindhyas. Even
now several million Oriyas live beyond the boundaries of the present Orissa
State. As educational Adviser to the former Eastern States Agency, I have had
the opportunity of hearing Oriya spoken and sung in the entire eastern belt of
the Central Provinces, extending from Bastar State in the south to Jashpur
State in the North and as far west as the Sakti State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hemmed
in on all sides by the sea and mountains and forests Orissa has had a more or
less indigenous growth of her own art, culture and literature. If politically
it is the Indian State with the smallest non-Hindu minorities in its
population, culturally also it is the purest and linguistically the closest to
Sanskrit. If one walks in the streets of Sambalpur even today, one would feel
as though the figures from the walls of Ajanta and Konarka had suddenly come
alive. Those picturesque men and graceful ladies whom we meet in ancient Indian
art, do still exist in real life in large parts of Orissa, if they exist at all
anywhere in India. It is on this soil that you meet the Hindu architecture and
sculpture in perfection and in profusion. The temples of Orissa, gracefully
tapering into the blue heavens and adorned with magnificent carvings, have been
exciting the admiration of all who see them, the Sun-temple at Konarka being a
marvel of beauty in the entire world of Art. In the Oriya language the number
of foreign words might be counted on one’s fingers, the entire body of the
language still remaining almost wholly Sanskritic. And we have had a continual
line of Puritans in the language, ever since the beginnings of English
education, who have tried to maintain its original purity against any
innovations in style and diction. The battle royal is going on even today, the
old guard declaring the western innovations in the language as unnational,
unpatriotic and heretical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
differences between the four East Indian languages, Assamese, Maithili, Bengali
and Oriya are so thin, that if one knows one of them fairly well, there will be
little difficulty for one to understand others. It is just like the close
affinity among the Scandinavian languages, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish which
started individual literatures of their own only the other day. Because of the
close affinity between the two neighbouring languages, Oriya and Bengali the
Buddhist ballads and lyrics of the eighth century A.D., discovered in Nepal and
published by the late M. M. Haraprasad Sastri under the name ‘Bauddha Gan O
Dohan’, are justifiably being claimed by both Bengali and Oriya scholars to be
the beginnings of poetic creation in either language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the 13th century, however, facts about Oriya language and literature began to
take clear outlines out of the wilderness of scholars’ conjectures and
controversies. We see the first prose utterances in Oriya in an inscription of
the 13th century on the walls of a temple at Bhuvaneswar, and the first lyrical
notes were heard almost at the same time. It is significant that prose from the
beginning was employed for practical official purposes, while poetry was the
vehicle for the emotional outbursts of mother Yasoda for young Krishna who had
left Mathura under royal orders. This lyric, popularly known as ‘Kesab Koilee’,
is still recited by school children in thousands of Orissa villages to the
immense joy of aging parents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
this slight beginning in the 13th century to the 20th in our times, this
literature of the Oriyas has grown in dimensions and varieties, as a national
literature is expected to, with a rich harvest of epics, Puranas, Kavyas,
songs, prose poems and lyrics of all categories. Like the synthetic religious
culture for which Orissa is noted her literature also has been fertilised by
streams from all sources. While the language is Aryan, the basis of the entire
metrical system and of the musical compositions is Dravidian. Among the Oriya
poets and litterateurs are fishermen, weavers and aboriginals, Andhras,
Bengalees and Marathas. Bhim Bhoi, the blind Kondh poet of the 18th century,
still enraptures millions of Oriyas through his philosophic Bhajans. The
aborigines are such an integral part of the Oriya people that they always find
a place in our literature from the 14th </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>century down to modern
times, both as authors and as subjects of poetry and fiction. This may be
unique among all North Indian languages. In the temple of Jagannath there is a
prose chronicle of the country and its changing rulers, which is continually
being written by an official chronicler for the last so many centuries. An
immense amount of literature also still lies buried in the palm-leaf libraries
of villages and important families scattered allover the Province. Almost each
village in Orissa and almost each important family still possesses a library of
palm-leaf manuscripts with the village or family priest as its custodian.
Unaided by the State, unencouraged by jealous and contemptuous Brahmins–the
custodians of Sanskrit learning–and without much patronage from the aristocracy,
this literature of the Oriyas has grown up through centuries, entirely through
the magic appeal of poetic creations that Orissa’s poets have made a gift of,
to the nation. The Oriya literature, therefore, unlike its neighbouring
sisters, is mainly a mass literature, born out of the soil and meant for the
soil. I may present the story of our first two giants, who still entertain,
dominate and sublimate the minds of vast masses of Orissa more than any other
poet, ancient or modern, to substantiate my assertions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first to emerge on the horizon is Sarala Das in the 14th century, the poet of
the Oriya ‘Mahabharat,’ the first large book in the language. Almost a
contemporary of Chaucer, Sarala Das exhibits to some degree the same rough and
vigorous qualities, the same unblushing eye for truth and the same instinct for
description and characterisation as the English poet. His descendants are still
flourishing in his village in the district of Cuttack, and his birth place and
burial mound have become places of pilgrimage. It is incontrovertible that he,
a tiller of the soil, was completely ignorant of Sanskrit. Like the Soottish
poet Burns, Sarala Das often got the irresistible impulse to write while
ploughing the fields. And piecing together what he had heard from Brahmin
Pandits, this semi-literate peasant started writing the ‘Mahabbarat’ in a
language which till then contained no more than a few folk-songs and which was
contemptuously looked down upon by both the rulers of the land and the Brahmin
intellectuals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
‘Mahabharat’ of Sarala Das is a grand composition. It could not be a
translation of the original in the very nature of things, as the poet was
ignorant of Sanskrit. And so it has become more or less an original creation.
The poet has upset the order of Books in the original and the continuity of its
narrative. He has narrated the story in his own unhampered way, giving full
freedom to his unbridled imagination, grafting new stories, new situations on
the old tale and throw</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ing away incidents and stories of the
original as he pleased. The whole epic is written in the vital, vigorous,
straightforward language of a rustic, caring little for embellishments,
indulging often in hyperboles and mixing up the realities with the figures and
happenings of the imaginary world. And significantly enough, the realities were
invariably based on the poet’s limited experiences within his environment, thus
turning the whole poem into a picture gallery of men and matters of
contemporary Orissa. The poet throbbed with patriotism for the land of his
birth. He makes the Pandavas visit the important holy places in Orissa on their
way to Heaven, and tries through a half-satiric and half-morbid story, in which
Yudhishthira had to marry again in his old age during this pilgrimage, to prove
that the soil of Utkal is the most heroic and creative in all the world. Indeed
it would naturally have appeared so to the poet, as Orissa in his time was
still vigorously independent, while the entire North India and the major
portions of the South had by that time been conquered and ruled by Mohamedans
for over a century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
finishing the ‘Mahabharat,’ Sarala Das, it appears, wished also to reproduce
the story of the ‘Ramayana’ in Oriya. But the story of the ‘Ramayana’ given by
Valmiki had not much appeal for this peasant who had enjoyed and admired the
zest for life in all its crude and unhampered vigour in the characters of the
‘Mahabharat.’ The poet, because of his peasant-like realistic attitude to life,
had dragged the demigods of the Sanskrit ‘Mahabharat’ from their olympic
heights and made them appear as common men and women battling over petty things
and yielding to the common temptations as we all do. To such a poet the wholly
idealistic tale of Rama and Sita<i> </i>must have appeared tame enough. And so
he wrote a new ‘Ramayana’ in line with his unique ‘Mahabharat’. While Valmiki
had made Ravana rule over a kingdom called Lanka. Sarala Das created an
imaginary land called Villanka whose ruler Ravana, instead of having ten faces,
was given a thousand. The thousand-faced Ravana repeatedly defeated Rama and
his brothers and his generals. He was at last killed, however, by Sita through
the power of her purity and virtue. Such a conception, depicting woman’s
subtler powers as superior to the crude physical energy of the male is
certainly unique, considering the age at which it was born.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Attempts have been made to place before the Orissa
public authenticated translations of the original ‘Mahabharat’ in prose and
verse by Rajas and Maharajas through the help of Pandits, as a counterblast to
the poetic hotch-potch of Sarala Das. But the nation has rejected the offers of
Pandits and Maharajas, and still keeps adoring the rude, unpolished, yet vital
production of a semi-literate peasant of the 14th century. The ‘Mahabharat’ in
the neighbouring language, Bengali, was first written about two centuries after
Sarala Das whose epic, therefore, was translated into Bengali to satisfy the
masses of Bengal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next giant on the scene is Jagannath Das, an absolute contrast to the
peasant-poet Sarala Das, being a Brahmin by caste, a son of a minister to the
king of Orissa, and a thorough scholar in Sanskrit. But to the eternal blessing
of the race, this Intellectual and social aristocrat determined in early youth
to abandon the pride and prejudices of his class and caste, and to make his
life and learning a complete dedication to God and his people. Defying the
contempt of the Court, friends and critics, Jagannath started writing the
‘Bhagavat Puran’ in the language of the masses, to show them a path of faith
and virtue which is difficult for an Indian to find out with a sense of
certainty without a fair knowledge of Sanskrit, of which the masses were then,
even more than at present, completely ignorant. Jagannath Das not merely wrote
the ‘Bhagavat’ in Oriya but wrote it in the most elegant, mellifluous and lucid
diction as yet possible in the language. He invented a new metre, the
nine-lettered metre, better known as ‘Bhagavat’ metre, for this literary
adventure, which too has turned out to be the handiest instrument for
versification in Oriya. It is said that while young Jagannath Das was busy
translating the ‘Bhagavat’ canto after canto, he, as a test of his success,
used to sit under the famous banyan tree within the precincts of the Jagannath
Temple and recite the verses to the crowds of pilgrims which daily visited the
shrine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
pilgrims from all corners of Orissa heard spell-bound this new religious poetry
which was so long a sealed book to them, in the language they spoke daily among
themselves but with the magic touch of a poet and a saint added to it. Young
Jagannath was satisfied that his translations were after all successful, and
his fame and that of his book spread far and wide through pilgrims in a short
time. Scribes started copying it as holy labour, and villages vied with one
another for possessing a complete set of Jagannath’s ‘Bhagavat’ with a house
its own, where the village elders could assemble in the evening after the day’s
toil to listen to it being recited by the village priest. So, almost each
village in Orissa began having a ‘Bhagavat’ house which was a multi-purpose
institution, combining in it the village assembly, the village school, the
village library and the village church. It appears now that the birth of
Jagannath and his ‘Bhagavat’ in Oriya were matters of destiny. Not long after
Jagannath passed away, the dark night descended on the prosperous and
independent kingdom of Orissa, which had defied repeated Moslem and non-Moslem
invasions for centuries. The land was attacked and conquered bit by bit from
the North, the South and the West. The Moghuls, the Pathans, the Mahrattas and
the British overran the country one after another. The kingdom was dismembered,
brothers killed brothers, and through misrule, extortion, famine and
internecine battles, the peasantry–the back-bone of the race–was almost
dehumanised. These dark days continued from the 16th century right up to 1936.
But this long night of misfortune, however, could not kill the Oriya people. In
dismembered and exploited misery, the great cementing force among them was
Jagannath’s ‘Bhagavat’ as it still is. Through three centuries of misfortune
the ‘Bhagavat-ghar’ continued to be the rallying point for<i> </i>the masses in
Orissa. It is still the simple literary ambition of the average unsophisticated
Oriya peasant to be able to read and recite the ‘Bhagavat’ in his old age, or
listen to it being read and recited by his children. In fact he sends his child
to school with the main objective of giving him as much literacy as will enable
him to read, the ‘Bhagavat’ which has so far been the greatest incentive to the
spread of literacy in Orissa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jagannath
was a contemporary of Chaitanya who spent the last 8 years of his life at Puri.
The poet and the saint liked and respected each other as soon as they met. But
as Jagannath and his Oriya literary friends and disciples, who are now
described as ‘five associates’, had already been moulded in their own processes
of spiritual and literary strivings, they were unaffected by Chaitanya’s
religion. Up till then Orissa had a religious culture of her own. It was an
indefinable combination of the Vedic, the Buddhistic and the aboriginal or
Tantric streams of thought and all were symbolised in the Lord Jagannath. From
widely current legends it has been asserted that Jagannath was originally a
tribal God of the Savaras. Later on this God has had Buddhistic and Brahmanic
metamorphosis in which stage he lasts till today. As a Brahmanic God, Lord
Jagannath at Puri represents the reappearance of Krishna in Kali Yuga. So the
Krishna cult had practically turned out to be the Jagannath-cult in Orissa, and
the Beatific Realisation, till Chaitanya came on the scene was through a sort
of Vedantic self-examination and Buddhistic self-purification as also through
esoteric Tantric processes. That is what we find being held out in the writings
of Jagannath and his associates. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the tempting process of sublimated sex-love as the way to Divine realisation as
preached by Chaitanya, and the cheap austerity of ‘Kirtan’ as practised by him,
now began to have the most baneful effects on Orissa’s society, literature and
politics. Misunderstood by feeble and untrained minds, the sublimated sex-love
as a spiritual practice has produced a huge mass of pornographic literature,
both religious and secular, that did not exist before in Oriya and has
considerably vitiated society. In politics also Chaitanya’s stay at Puri
hastened Orissa’s day of misfortune. Charmed by his magnetic personality, his
religious ecstasies and his erudition, many high officials of the kingdom
resigned their posts to enjoy his divine companionship at Puri; and while the
great Krishnadeva Raya of Vija.ysnagara was knocking at the southern gates of
the empire, King Prataparudra of Orissa was spending sleepless nights in his
palace at Cuttack, sending emissaries to the young mendicant Chaitanya to be
favoured with a ‘darsan’. The inevitable happened. Orissa was soon trampled
under the feet of invaders after centuries of glorious and vital independence.
And after this, we reach the second period in Oriya literature with the
background of subjugated and dismembered political existence over centuries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

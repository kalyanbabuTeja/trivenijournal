the whole range of the history of the Andhras, which extends a period of more
than two thousand years, there is no king whose name is more honoured and loved
than that of Rajaraja Chalukya. His personal name was Rajaraja, and the
appellation “Narendra” was added to it as an honorofic. His “abhishekanama”, or
the name that he assumed at the time of the coronation, was the traditional
Vishnuvardhana, and his imperial epithet was “Sarvalokasraya”, “the refuge of
all mankind.” Rajaraja was called after his maternal grandfather, Rajaraja or
Rajaraja Mummadichola, (A. D. 985–1011), the Chola King of Tanjore (Tanjavur).
Rajaraja Narendra belonged to the Eastern Chalukya dynasty of Vengi or Andhra,
which held sway for five long centuries, from the beginning of the seventh to
the end of the eleventh century. The Eastern Chalukyas were a powerful
Kshatriya clan, who traced their descent from the Moon and Atri from Bharata
and the Pandavas. They belonged to the Manavyasa “gotra” like the Kadambas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to the contemporary account of the “Andhra Mahabharata,” Rajaraja was a
handsome man of good stature and powerful build. He was a valiant soldier and a
man of letters who had early in life mastered the Veda, Purana, Itihasa,
Nataka, Kavya and Alankara as well as all the Dharma-Sastras. And he was a poet
too. He gathered round him an assembly of great poets of the country, poets in
Sanskrit, Prakrit and in all the “desa-bhashas,” or languages of the country.
Among those that adorned his court were the renowned poets Betana-bhatta,
Nanniya-bhatta, Narayana-bhatta or Nanni Narayana, Muttay-bhatta and
Narayanakavi. Rajaraja’s court was a seat of learning and culture; his famous
capital, Rajamahendrapura, became the centre of a well-known school of poetics,
the Vengi school ar Vengi sampradaya as it was called in the Dakshinapatha.
Rajaraja is remembered even to this date as the promoter of learning and
culture, as a patron of poets, particularly of Nanniya bhatta, the author of
the first known “maha-kavya” extant in Tenugu. Rajaraja Narendra<i> </i>was a
contemporary of that renowned patron of Sanskrit poets, King Bhojadeva of Dhara
or Malwa. What Rajaraja did for the Tenugu language and literature, Bhoja did
for Sanskrit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rajaraja’s
reign was a long one; it began, as it ended, in a period of trouble. His reign
was not uneventful; nor was it a peaceful period. Rajaraja was not an
ease-loving faint-hearted prince who lived and died as a protege of his Chola
kinsmen, as it is gratuitously assumed. His father Vimaladitya had given up his
faith in Vedic Brahmanism and devotion to Mahesvara-Siva. Sometime towards the
close of his reign (1011-1019 A. D.) he embraced Jainism and turned a sravaka.
According to the political traditions of Vengi, the Eastern Chalukya King was
to be a follower of Brahmanism. He was, therefore, specially hailed at the time
of coronation as the “parama-brahmanya” and “parama-mahesvara”, meaning the
“devout Brahmana’ and “devout worshipper of Mahesvara-Siva.” None who was not a
Parama-Brahmanya and Parama-Mahesvara could sit on the throne of Vengi.
Vimaladitya, therefore, renounced the throne. The throne of Vengi henceforth
became “Tyaga-Simhasana,” ‘the abandoned throne.’ Vimaladitya, however, lived sometime
longer. He ceased to be the “de jure” king and the government of the kingdom
was carried on by the constitutional device of a regency. Vimaladitya would
perhaps have abdicated if his son, the Yuvaraja, had been a grown-up. But
Rajaraja was still a young lad. A regency was therefore created with Prince
Rajaraja as the titular head. Rajaraja had to be assisted in the administration
by his father and his able Chancellor, Vajramatya or Vajjia-preggada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rajaraja-Vishnuvardhana’s
birth seems to have taken place about 1006 A. D. He would be therefore just
thirteen years old at the time of hi8 father’s renouncement of the throne.
Vimaladitya died about the beginning or the middle of 1022 A. D., when Rajaraja
was just sixteen years old. Shortly after that, Rajaraja crowned himself King,
at the express wish of his beloved subjects, according to the contemporary
accounts. Both Betana-bhatta and Nanniya refer to the fact and make a
significant reference to Rajaraja’s ascending the “Tyaga-Simhasana,” in their respective
‘Sasana-kavyas.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vimaladitya’s
death gave the rival claimants another signal to launch upon a war of
succession. There were several rivals to Rajaraja, but history is silent about
them. At any rate, Vijayaditya, younger step-brother of Rajaraja, was not one
of the rival claimants. He was still in his early teens, too young to aspire
for the crown. There were undoubtedly several princes, scions of the juinior
branches of the imperial Chalukyas ruling as feudal lords over small
principalities, scattered all over the country. Some of them were petty rulers
of small kingdoms around Niravadyapura (Nidadavolu), Pishtapura (Pithapuram),
Sarvasiddhi near Yellamanchili and such others. Some of the princes were
descendants of rival claimants to the throne since the days of Ammaraja I
[92l-927 A. D.], Chalukya Bhima II [934–945 A. D]<i>, </i>Ammaraja-Vijayaditya
[945–970 A.D.] and Badapa. They had even assumed the imperial epithets
‘Sarvalokasraya’ and ‘Samastabhuvanasraya’ and the traditional names,
Vishnuvardhana and Vijayaditya, at the time of their accession to their petty
hereditary feudal kingdoms. Rajaraja-Vishnuvardhana was able however to crush
his enemies and opponents in a short time and crown himself as the undisputed
lord of Vengi. His coronation took place at Rajamahendrapura, on Thursday, 16th
August, 1022 A.D.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
reign of Rajaraja Narendra [1012-1061 A D.] was the beginning of the end of the
glorious Chalukyan epoch in the history of Andhra. It was more or less a
turning point: it witnessed the beginning of the dismemberment of the great
kingdom of Vengi, the beginning of the decline of the Eastern Chalukyas. It
also witnessed the dawn of a new age and the close of the ancient period. The
period of Rajaraja was an age of a great revolution. During that period
religion became a mere formality and a farce; it was used as a cloak for
practising hideous and loathsome rites to delude the innocent people, with
pretensions as truths. Jainism and Non-Vedic Saivism came to be widely followed
or preached; they soon began to encourage corrupt and detestable practices
which were abhorred by the people in general. The ignorant and the guileless
were often misled by powerful self-centred elements among the various religious
groups. Society consequently became utterly degenerate, and depraved morals set
in. “Dharma” or Vedic “dharma” was openly flouted, and Brahmanical doctrines
were ridiculed. This decadent state of things was not peculiar to Andhradesa
alone. The whole or the Dakshinapatha became infested with degeneracy in
religion, in morals, and confusion in the social orders of the society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The closing quarter of the tenth
century saw many political changes in the Dakshinapatha and the Far south. Some
of the old dynasties like the Western Ganges and Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta had
disappeared. New powers like the Cholas of the south and Chalukyas of Kuntala
or Karnataka in the Deccan had emerged with </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>greater vigour and
ambition. The new powers were inspired by a fierce and insatiable lust for
conquest and expansion and greed for power and wealth. Consequently, the Cholas
and the Chalukyas of Kuntala came to be constantly at war with each other. In
the wars of this period which lasted four or five generations, the Chalukyas of
Vengi, on account of their nearness of relationship, made common cause with the
Cholas of Tanjavur. The Cholas and the Eastern Chalukyas formed themselves into
a defensive and offensive alliance against the Western Chalukyas.
Rajaraja-Mummadi Chola gave his daughter Kundavamba in marriage to Vimaladitya,
the younger brother and heir-apparent of Saktivarman I [999-1011 A. D.] who
restored the fortunes of his house in Vengi after an “interregnum” of
twenty-seven years. The offspring of the union was Rajaraja Narendra, who
married Ammangadevi, the only daughter of Rajendra Chola, surnamed
Gangaikondan, the son and successor of Rajaraja-Mummadi Chola. The marriage
took place a few years after Rajaraja had established himself firmly on the
throne. Rajaraja Narendra’s son was Rajendra Choda, who afterwards ascended the
throne of the Cholas under the appellation Kulottunga Chola Deva I. In his own
turn Rajendra Choda married Mudhurantaki, a daughter of his maternal uncle
Rajendra Deva. Thus for three successive generations the Chalukyas of Vengi
married Chola princess, and in the end the last of them supplanted the Cholas
in the south, having identified himself with the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Naturally,
therefore, the Western Chalukyas of Karnataka hated their cousins of Vengi, who
were formidably allied to their enemies, the Cholas. Both Ahavamalla-Satyasraya
and his successor Jagadekamalla-Jayasimha, having been worsted on two
occasions, were consequently unable to carry on a protracted war against Vengi
during the reign of Vimaladitya. Their reigns were occupied with unceasing wars
with the Cholas on the one hand and with their turbulent feudatories and their
allies on the other. Jagadekamalla died in 1042 A. D. and was succeeded by his
more valiant son Ahavamalla Trailokyamalla Somesvara. Having been unable to
draw Rajaraja-Vishnuvardhana into war and attack him in the open field,
Somesvara adopted other methods and tactics to insult his adversary and provoke
him to open hostility. Accordingly, he conferred upon Sobhanarasa, the foremost
among his vassals, the title of ‘Vengipuravaresvara,’ or ‘the lord of Vengi’
and received homage and tribute from him. Ahavamalla continued this practice
openly and conferred the later title upon his elder son who afterwards
succeeded him under the name Bhulokamalla-</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somesvara, and later
still upon his youngest son Vishnuvardhana. Vijayaditya. By this covert device,
Ahavamalla-Somesvara enjoyed the vainglorions pleasure of calling a powerful
opponent his vassal. Though provoked in this fashion, Rajaraja-Vishnuvardhana
did not indulge in open hostilities which he loathed very much in the interests
of his country and people. At last, Ahavamalla, unable to drag Rajaraja into a
protracted war, invaded the Chola kingdom in order to avenge himself for former
wrongs, during the last years of Rajendra- deva. That was about the beginning
of 1061 A. D. Ahavamalla- Somesvara knew that the lord of Vengi would hasten to
the help of his brother-in-law Rajendradeva. He therefore despatched large
armies under able commanders to Vengi to intercept and thus prevent Rajaraja
from joining the Chola King. About the same time, Ahavamalla induced
Vijayaditya to rebel against his step-brother and usurp the throne of Vengi for
the second time. Unfortunately for the Andhra country, Ahavamalla Somesvara’s
policy was completely successful. Vijayaditya succeeded in capturing the
capital through treachery by a “coup d’etat” and placed himself on the throne
of Vengi. Rajaraja was away in the south opposing the armies of Kuntala that
invaded his kingdom; he was therefore unable to move immediately to the north,
to punish his traitor brother. He was between two mortal foes, and he could
punish them only one after the other. But that was not to be, for he was
overthrown by overwhelming subversive forces. Somewhere in the south or
south-west, Rajaraja-Vishnuvardhana fell on the battlefield, fighting the
armies of Kuntala about the middle of 1061 A. D. His death under tragic
circumstances was unexpected and it was the beginning of the end of a glorious
epoch. Rajaraja’s only son Rajendra Choda was not in Vengi to retrieve the
position; he was somewhere in the north, in Chakrakuta, fighting his father’s
battles against disloyal tributaries. When be returned, it was too late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
events that led to the composition of the “Andhra Mahabharata” are mentioned in
the poem itself. Rajaraja was ever desirous listening to the narration of the
story of the immortal Epic; it was almost a passion with him. Rajaraja believed
that the “Mahabhrata” proclaimed the eternal dharma, the Manava dharma, the
‘Law of Humanity’ to all mankind. To him, it preached the Vedanta; it revealed
the goal of all philosophy and the end of Metaphysics; it contained the essence
of alt political science, and above all, it was the “Mahakavya” that was
worthily praised by all poets. Rajaraja’s thirst for the “Mahabharata” was not
quenched when he read it and heard it only in Sanskrit. And it was not possible
for every one to read the Epic in Sanskrit; it should be available to the
people in their own language. The King therefore assembled the great poets of
his realm in his Court and proposed that Nanniya-bhatta should compose a
Mahakavya of the story of the “Mahabharata” of Veda Vyasa, in Tenugu, bringing
out its sublime spirit and its sublimer spiritual message, together with its
great moral, to the best of his ability. Raja-raja was confident that of all
the renowned poets of his Court, Nanniya-bhatta alone was competent to achieve
such a great and difficult task. Nanniya-bhatta obeyed the King’s command with
some diffidence. He commenced the composition of the poem with the assistance
of the celebrated Narayana-bhatta or Nanni Narayana who was his co-pupil at the
Gurukula. Strangely enough, Nanni Narayana did not compose a single stanza in
the whole poem. But the assistance he rendered is compared to that of Lord
Krishna’s aid to the hero Partha on the battlefield of Kurnkshetra. The
comparison is significant and pregnant with meaning. Nanniya-bhatta had to seek
the approbation of the assembly of poets, of which Rajaraja was the guiding
spirit, for the “Mahakavya” he had undertaken to write. It was undoubtedly an
uphill task. Like Krishna’s aid to Partha, Nanni Narayana’s assistance was
invaluable and in the end it brought undying glory to Nanniya. Nanniya
commenced the work of the “Andhra Mahabharata” sometime after 1053 A. D. Though
the plan of work was fully conceived at the very outset, Nanniya-bhatta could
not complete the poem during his lifetime. He wrote the Adi and Sabha parvans,
and died without completing the Aranya parvan. To write the “Mahabharata” as a
kavya in Tenugu was a stupendous task; it was inconceivable in that age when
Sanskrit held the field to the exclusion of all Indian languages. And the
extant work of Nanniya reveals its striking originality and the genius of the
poet. The “Andhra Mahabharata” of Nanniya is not a mere translation of the
Sanskrit version of Veda Vyasa. To call it a translation, is a travety of
truth; it is an original work, a classio by itself according to all canons of
criticism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
appears to be still another reason, yet another circumstance, that inspired
Raja raja Narendra to get the “Mahabharata” written in Tenugu. The bloody and
devastating wars of the period which his Chola, Chalukyu, Kalachuri and
Paramara contempories intermittently waged, would seem to have caused immense
grief and misery to Rajaraja. He resembled Yudhishtira who mourned the loss of
all his beloved kinsmen and allies on the gruesome battlefield of Kurukshetra.
He was like Janamejaya who was smitten with a deep sense of sorrow when he
called upon his favourite bard Vaisampayana to narrate to him the story of his
ancestors, the Pandavas and Kauravas of the Bharata race. It was a similar
feeling that roused Raja-raja and inspired him to listen to the “Mahabharata”
in Tenugu. It was the immense unhappiness that plunged the whole country and
his own house in deep sorrow that persuaded him to command his poet to compose
the “Mahabharata” in Tenugu for his own benefit and for the benefit of his
beloved people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a great king; his memory is imperishable. And so his great gift of the
“Andhra Mahabharata” too is imperishable. “As long as the sun and moon endure,”
the name of Rajaraja and that of his poet Nanniya will live. The “Andhra
Mahabharata” is their imperishable gift to the Andhras. Though with his death
the illustrious Eastern Chalukya dynasty of Vengi came to an end, the great
Andhra nation which he loved, inspired and in one sense rejuvenated, still
lives. Rajaraja is to be gratefully remembered, for he knit the Andhras into a
nation by forging for them a great common culture, a great common heritage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

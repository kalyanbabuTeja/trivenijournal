<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Indian term for Art, <i>kala, </i>is significant. The word means a segment, a
fragment, and it suggests a whole of which it is a fragment. The digit of the
moon is a <i>kala </i>and it suggests the full moon of which it is but a part.
The numeralistic grammarian of the arts has listed sixty-four <i>kalas, </i>but
really the <i>kalas </i>or varieties of art are infinite in number. Prominent
among these sectionalised and individualised arts are literature, music,
gesture, painting and sculpture or <i>silpa. </i>This last, <i>silpa, </i>is
considered the supremest art of all. The Universe itself is the <i>silpa </i>or
art-emanation of the Supreme Architect or <i>Silpakara.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
conception of the Universe as a work of art is a fundamental conception of the
ancient Indians. Creation is an expression of this mood of the Supreme Artist,
which is one of infinite Bliss. On beholding it, one falls into the Great
Artist’s mood and loses one’s little self, becoming merged in Him. The votary
of the Arts is on the sure way to everlasting Bliss. Creations of art put him
easily along that way; and the more artistic the creation is, the more easily
is one led on the way to Bliss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art
is divided into particular arts with a view to help the artist in mastering the
particular rules of the grammar of that art, to enable him to produce works
which lift us from our little selves and merge us in Bliss. Although each art
is but a fragment of one comprehensive Art, the function of each art is clearly
defined by the medium of its expression, and the grammar of that Art is
determined by its specific function. But the artist who mastered his grammar
and cultivated his artistic urge is not content with achieving supremacy in his
special art. He has a glimpse of the one infinite Art of which his own
particular art is but a fragment. And he loves to transcend the limitations of
his specific art and to allow the interplay or other related arts and,
sometimes, of unrelated arts also. Thus the sculptor in Ancient India was not
content with the mere exposition of plastic beauty. Several of our old icons,
like, the Nataraja and the dancing Krishna, are not static poses but sculptural
snapshots of dynamic dance-movements, revealing the play of the art of gesture
and of dance on the plastic art. Similarly, we find notable instances of the
influence of painting on the literary art. The <i>Dhyana-sloka </i>of the <i>Sandhya
</i>prayer describes the Supreme Brahma Narayana, who is in everyone of us as
well as in the solar sphere, in these terms: “His body is shining gold. He has
a golden crown and gold garlands. His armlets are of gold and His clothes are
gold.” The <i>sloka </i>a painter’s study in the ruddy yellow of the setting
sun. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
word-picture of Siva is another instance in point. The several attributes of
Siva can be ascribed to the influence of the pictorial art: “Siva dwells on the
Silver peak of the snow-clad Himalayas. He rides a white Bull. His body is
smeared with white ashes. His matted hair gleams white with the glory of the
crescent moon and the cascade of the silvery Ganges.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the red clustering flowers of <i>Kantal. </i>The tusks of the elephant He rides
on are red with dripping blood, for they have gored the <i>asuras </i>to death;

us now pass on to the interplay of the sculptor’s art and the art of the <i>Puranika.
</i>Narasimha has varied forms in sculpture. We have the Ugra-Narasimha in the
cave temples; and the <i>Saumya </i>aspect of Narasimha with Lakshmi by His
side, And we have in the Yoga-Narasimha, the ideal of self-control and of
beatitude. These forms are taken from kindred arts, but the conception of
Sthauna Narasimha is entirely the sculptor’s own. What is more natural for a

out of the ordinary stone pillar of a <i>Mantapa</i>?<i> </i>Narasimha in the

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
illustration is afforded by the group of images worshipped at the main shrine
at Puri. The current <i>Purana </i>story about them is this: Subhadra, sister
of Sri Krishna and Balarama, expressed in her childhood days a wish to be
married to her brothers. That wish is fulfilled, without breach of Dharma, in
their super-mundane existence as icons in the Jagannatha temple at Puri. This
artistic story arose apparently from the old prescription to the sculptor,
which we find embodied in a <i>sloka </i>in the chapter on <i>Pratima Lakshana </i>in
<i>Brhat Samhita:</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Students
of Indian architecture are struck by the wonderful work done on granite as if
it were wood. From a study of such works of art, they infer that the earlier
temple architecture used wood, and that these wonderful relics of architecture
belong to the period of transition from timber to stone. There are some
difficulties in the way of accepting this natural inference. We do not find in
the earliest extant stonework any influence of wood-work. The Pallava
cave-temples are remarkably free from the influence of wood-work. Nor do we
find any evidence in the <i>Silpa sastras </i>about wood-work in architecture.
The ancient Indians knew that wood-work was unsuitable for permanent
architecture in the climate of their country. The marvellous details of
wood-work in sculptural art which evoke the admiration of connoisseurs is
traceable to the ambitions of the master-sculptor to transcend the limitations
of stone-work and to assimilate the peculiarities of wood-work in the finished
products of his art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first ambition of an Indian artist, as of artists elsewhere, is, no doubt, to
master the science pertaining to his art, what may be called the grammar of his
art. The architect must first be an engineer, the painter must attain to a
mastery of the science of colours, the literary artist must have a good command
over words and their meanings, and the musician must know all about the
production of sounds. But he is no artist but only an artisan who merely puts
into practice the mechanical rules of his art and does not allow his
inspiration to transcend those rules. It is in transcending the rules of his
art that an artist is revealed. In so transcending, the artist in ancient India
boldly transgressed to other realms of art: for he felt that all arts were one
and he recognised no boundaries between the several realms of separated arts.
Compartmentalism in art was as yet unknown, and the master-artist in one medium
was frequently found utilising the characteristic features of other art-forms
to enrich his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Saint
Sathakopa has a set of verses which suggest this interplay of the component
parts of Art. The senses of the devotee hunger for contact with God. The eyes
desire to see Him, the ears to catch the flap of Garuda’s wings which presage
His arrival; the hands desire to be clasped together (in <i>anjali </i>pose)
before His Presence. These things are natural to any devotee. But the
sense-organs of the Alvar are superior. His eyes are eager not merely to see
Him, but like the hands to be folded up in the act of obeisance. His ears
strain themselves to catch the melody of Garuda’s wings, no doubt; but they
hunger also to function as eyes and to behold His lovely Form.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
verses of Nammalvar which embody this idea state something which is true not
only of God but also of Art. For, in essence, God is no different from Art. <i>‘Rasa
vai sah’ </i>says the Upanishad. The different senses </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>correspond
to the sectionalized arts. The arts of painting and of sculpture depend on the
sense of vision; the art of music depends on the sense of hearing; and the
literary art gratifies the sixth sense, <i>viz., </i>the mind. But the eye, the
ear and the mind are not separate entities. The Supreme Artist, like the
Alvar’s eyes, ears and mind, transcends the region of his particular art; and
his work displays the excellences of diverse arts at once. In another place, the
Alvar refers to the eyes of Krishna and the words that He speaks. “His eyes,”
says the Alvar, “speak and convey messages. His words behold the thoughts of
the devotee.” True art transcends the regions of the senses and of mind: and
when it is achieved in a work of art, our: senses and our minds are transported
to that region of bliss where all arts blend into one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as the translation reveals. To the non-Indian, the metaphors do not appeal. But
so much of the pictorial art has entered the realms of poetry in India that
every Indian thrills at the use of these pictographic words. The supremacy of <i>Upama
</i>or simile among the <i>Alankaras, </i>and the excessive use of words
denoting concrete objects to indicate abstract ideas, are alike due to the
immense influence that the visual arts of painting, sculpture, gesture and
dance have exercised over literature in India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the supreme artistry arising out of the interplay of the several arts on
literature has been misunderstood in later days. <i>Tiruvacakam </i>says of the
Supreme Being that He fashions the lovely woman out of bones and the noble
horse out of the ignoble fox. And the words are taken at their literal value by
miracle-mongers of a later generation. The Vedas proclaim that <i>Sat, </i>the
supreme Being is One, though the learned call it variously. The sculptor
expresses it in the icons of Siva-Sakti, and of Sankara-Narayana; and when
poets like Sathakopa state in the wake of such sculpture, “The place of Lakshmi
is His chest and of Brahma is His navel,” the literalist makes one deity the <i>anga
</i>or part of the other, quite oblivious of the fact that the poet is here
employing the language of sculpture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me proceed to emphasise another peculiar characteristic of Indian literature,
which is due to the interplay of music and poetry. Words as </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>words
have meanings, and as sounds have sonal values. But more literary craftsmen in
Ancient India than in other countries have yielded to the temptation of
mingling music and Poetry. The golden rule of one word, one meaning,’ was cast
to the winds. Synonyms arose to facilitate the importation of music into poetry
and, often, of music as a substitute for poetry, with the result that there are
very few poems in modern Indian languages which cannot be sung. As a
consequence, there is very little poetry in these song poems. In Tamil, for
example, there is no word to distinguish a poem from a song. <i>Etukai </i>and <i>monai,
</i>jingles and alliterations, have been prescribed by grammarians as
indispensable to poetry, and the distinction has been so completely wiped out
that the Tamilian mistakes his rich treasure-houses of songs for vast
store-houses of music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
with poetry, so with music. The human voice was considered the greatest musical
instrument. Stringed instruments like the Vina and stretched instruments like
the <i>Mridanga </i>were modulated to suit the human voice. Ideas conveyed by
words were mingled with the music of the human voice, and the languages
transgressed into the regions of musical sounds. They got so intermingled as to
obliterate, in the lay mind, all distinctions between language and music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

interplay of other arts in the sphere of any particular art, is the
distinguishing characteristic of ancient Indian Art. Such interplay was
inevitable, according to the Indian conception of the nature of Art. The
oft-quoted passage from the <i>Silpa Sastra </i>brings out this fact. The pupil
asks “Teach me the art, of image making.” The preceptor replies: “One must know
the laws of painting to know the laws of image making.” The pupil “Then, teach
me the laws of painting.” The Preceptor: “The laws of painting cannot be
understood without knowing the laws of gesture,” The pupil: “Then teach me the
laws of gesture.” The preceptor: “They, in their turn, depend on a knowledge of
the laws of music.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

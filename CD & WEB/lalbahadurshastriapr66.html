Bahadur found both nature and circumstances unfavourable to him, when he first
stepped into the world. Born in a kayastha family of minor government officials
on October 2, 1904, in Mughalsarai, a railway colony seven miles from Banaras,
it was not possible for him to hope for a bright future as Nehru did, because
of an affluent family in which the latter was born and brought up. There could
hardly be any match between aristocracy and poverty. While Nehru, the first
Prime Minister of India, saw an enviable wealth and luxury in his childhood,
his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, had to eke out his painful existence during
the same days in bitter and bleak poverty. And to add to the irony of his fate,
his father, a poor school master, died when he was hardly a year and a half
old. Lal Bahadur and his two sisters were brought up by his maternal
grandfather. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lal
Bhadur’s childhood and early youth were extremely gloomy with fatherless
struggle against the heavy odds of life. He had practically to learn to stand
on his own feet and shoulder the heavy domestic responsibilities with a dogged
determination, and at the same time become adept in combating with the icy and
relentless nails of grinding poverty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Movement, launched by Gandhiji, interrupting thereby his school studies. But he
entered into it with full fervour and energy, after having developed a keen
insight into the problems of life<i> </i>and politics under the inspiring
influences of various personalities and by dint of his hard training in the
school of experience at the threshold of youth. Equipped with vast experience
and the knowledge of philosophy, sociology, economics and history at Kashi
Vidyapeeth, Lal Bahadur from Varanasi went forth to do battle with the British
Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the next fifteen years of his life, his contact with politics became wider,
though not much deeper. In 1925, he first came in contact with a top level
leader, Lala Lajpat Rai, who was then organising the Servants of the People
Society and had naturally turned to the Kashi Vidyapeeth for recruits. Shastri
joined the Society as a full-fledged member. He was asked to do Harijan work in
Kumar Ashram in Meerut. He lived there with the Harijans, moved with them, and
during the two years of his work he was able to persuade many caste Hindus to
waive their objections to Harijan boys attending their schools. Unlike many
Congressmen of those days, he started his career as a really constructive
worker, doing it with the utmost enthusiasm and humility. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rai died in 1928 and Purushottam Das Tandon took over the presidentship of the
Servants of the People Society. He asked Lal Bahadur to shift to Allahabad.
From 1928 Allahabad became his home. Tandon found in him a faithful and devoted
worker, carrying out his instructions to the letter, disposing of all work in
double quick time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tandon
was his first political preceptor, and Lal Bahadur proved himself a faithful
disciple by his hard work and sincere, manner. He alone could come up to the
exacting standards of Tandon. Whatever the likes and dislikes of Mr. Tandon
might be, it was however true that he reposed full confidence in Lal Bahadur,
and was mainly responsible for the latter’s gaining importance in the Congress
Party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
period between 1927 and 1931 was of a great ferment and unusual experiences for
Lal Bahadur. One of the most remarkable incidents of this exciting period for
him was the unfurling of India’s flag of independence in 1929 by Jawaharlal
Nehru on the bank of Ravi. Since then Nehru became his idol whom he adored and
obeyed as his most devout follower. Lal Bahadur was 25 years at that time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
above event was followed by the 1930 Civil Disobedience Movement, announced
with a thundering resolution passed at countrywide public meetings. The
resolution called upon the people of India to observe January 26, 1930, as
Purna Swaraj Day. Lal Bahadur’s patriotic spirit was fully awakened, and he
immediately decided to plunge himself into the movement by organisinig a
no-rent campaign in the Allahabad area. He was then the secretary </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
the Allahabad Congress Committee. He made a rousing speech in a village outside
Allahabad, in which he exhorted the villagers to refuse to pay the rent. The
Government reacted to it by arresting him. He was convicted and sentenced to
two and a half years’ imprisonment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
1930 to 1945, Lal Bahadur’s life was one of continuous struggle against the
British Government, and during this period he passed several years in prisons.
After 1930, he was again jailed in 1932, 1934, 1941, and 1942–in all, seven
times and spent a total of nine years behind the bars. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
events followed successively. The British Parliament passed a new Govt. of
India Act, in 1935, according to which autonomy was granted to the provinces.
In 1937, following the new reforms ushered in by the Act of 1935, the Congress
fought the elections to the Provincial legislatures and captured large
majorities in almost all of them. Lal Bahadur, on the recommendation of Babu
Purushottam Das Tandon, also got a ticket of the Congress Party to fight the
election. He won the election and became a member of the U. P. Assembly.
Although as a member of the Assembly, he was just a back-bencher, he could
attract the attention of Pandit Pant, one of the supreme figures of the
independence movement. Being impressed by his unquestionable sincerity and
unimpeachable character, Pandit Govind Vallabh Pant, on becoming the Chief
Minster of U. P. after the 1946 elections, appointed Lal Bahadur as his
Parliamentary Secretary, along with C. B. Gupta. Pant relied on him to assess
the political impact of the measures the State Government proposed to take. In
1947, he was asked by his political boss (Pandit Pant), under whom he served
his political apprenticeship, to take charge of public security throughout U.
P. Lal Bahadur then became Home Minister, in complete charge of Police and
Transport departments. It was a period of stress and storm and the communal
holocaust had unhinged many minds. It was a credit to Lal Bahadur that he
refused to adopt a retaliatory policy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Police Minister, Lal Bahadur performed his duties with courage and sagacity and
became extremely popular both among his colleagues and the public of Uttar
Pradesh. But he was not to stay in U. P. for a long time. Destiny was smiling
on him; and God wished him to play a greater role on the national stage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

shot into all-India politics overnight. Nehru and Tandon never got on good
terms. As Congress President, Tandon took Nehru to task for keeping rebels and
renegades like Kidwai in the Cabinet. Nehru was forced not only to drop
Kidwai’s name from the list of his colleagues, but he also resigned from the
Working Committee of the Congress. This action of Nehru turned the situation in
his favour. Tandon was well aware that without the active cooperation of Nehru,
he could not pull on as Congress President. He, therefore, resigned the
Presidentship and asked Nehru to take over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru became the President of the Congress, he appointed Lal Bahadur as the
General Secretary on the recommendation of B. C. Roy. B. C. Roy, then Chief
Minister of Bengal, had suggested to Nehru that he should appoint Lal Bahadur
as the General Secretary with a view to facilitating the work of the Working
Committee. Nehru accepted the suggestion and appointed Lal Bahadur. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gradually,
Nehru began to develop greater and greater faith in Lal Bahadur, because he had
proved himself a man of peace and compromise during the course of his past
political life. Further, he had raised his position in the eyes of Nehru by
conveying a hint to him that after Patel’s death, Pant was leaning more and
more towards Tandon and that one day he would be completely with him. Under the
circumstances, Nehru wanted such a man, who could resolve differences between
Congress leaders without magnifying them. And that man was Lal Bahadur. No
wonder, Nehru had him step into the shoes of Pant and other ‘Congress leaders
just to read their minds. Whatever the case may be, it is a fact that Lal
Bahadur, after taking over the charge of the office of General Secretaryship,
yielded to Nehru completely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

General Secretary, Lal Bahadur demonstrated his unrivalled abilities as an
organiser and proved a glutton for work. He worked round the clock, toured the
country intensively, addressed Congress workers all over, chalked out election
strategy to suit the local requirements of each region, helped State Congress
Committees to prepare their lists of candidates, and in the process,
familiarised himself with the merits and abilities of Congressmen in the field
and saw for himself at close quarters the new human material coming into the
Congress since independence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the new parliament met, Lal Bahadur was persuaded to stand for election to the
Rajya Sabha and was duly elected. Soon after, he was appointed Minister for
Railways and Transport in the Nehru Cabinet. Thus, within about 15 years of his
joining the U. P. Government as a junior Parliamentary Secretary, he became a
relatively senior member of the Union Government and ministerial head of the
largest State undertaking in the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a Railway Minister, Lal Bahadur brought about many reforms in the railway
system in order to improve the lot of the railway employees and tried his best
to put the railways firmly back on their rails, after the disorganisation they
had suffered from the partition. But the thing that attracted the attention of
the people countrywide was his assuming constitutional responsibility for the
Ariyalur railway disaster in November, 1956 and his forthwith resignation as
Railway Minister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Incidentally, the railway disaster came in time. Lal
Bahadur was relieved of his duties as Railway Minister and put in charge of the

all kinds of political problems arise, whether of relations between the States

of the internal affairs of a State Congress, or the affairs of the Congress
organisations of two neighbouring States; dealing with them frequently becomes
a test of the Home Minister’s personal qualities, not his constitutional
power–his ability to smooth tempers and to set fears at rest. In these tasks,
Lal Bahadur succeeded admirably, assisted by his temperament, reputation and
the knowledge of the Congress, which he acquired in successive party jobs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he had to leave that post, when the Kamraj Plan was brought into operation. Lal
Banadur, along with five of his colleagues in the Central Cabinet, handed in
his resignation to the Prime Minister, which the latter accepted on August 24,
1963. At the time of his exit from the Home Ministry, no one could imagine that
one day he would replace Nehru as Prime Minister of India. But, when he was
called back to assist Nehru after his illness at Bhubaneshwar, it was felt in
some political circles that of all the probable contenders, Shastri was the
most suitable man to be the future Prime Minister. And the speed with which the
possibility won acceptance was proof of the general belief that he would make
no sudden departure or break from the traditions set by Nehru. He was seen as a
continuation of the Nehru era, though in a modified form. When he handled the
work of shaping Indian relations with Nepal, he pulled them out of a mess with
speed and skill; during a brief intervention in the affairs of Kashmir, he
showed himself capable of political daring, a gamble if it was needed. But that
did not interfere with general expectation that this would be an influence in

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Lal Bahadur Shastri was an extra-ordinary
hard-working man. He seemed to put in, in the course of a single day, what
others could take many days to do. Anyone who knew him was struck with
amazement at the amount of work that he could do in a single day. How he
managed to do so much, and kept himself in constant touch with men and affairs
all over the world all the time, is difficult for ordinary folk to understand.
In work, La1 Bahadur was indefatigable as was Mr. Nehru. He was up at 5.30 a.
m. After going through important files and newspapers, he was ready to meet
people around 8 a. m. He indulged in no recreation. He hardly went to see a
film. Rarely did he retire before 12 or 12.30 in the night. </p>

doubt whether there are many who have this spirit to the extent he had. He had
had his pangs and sufferings. He got over them in the spirit of the <i>Bhagavad
Gita, </i>knowing that one should not worry for what was bound to happen or
what was beyond man’s power. He was perfectly a man of action. He attended to
his work in the spirit of the great scripture that says that “yoga is
efficiency in action” <i>(yogah karmasu kaushalam) </i>and also that “all acts
should be done without attachment” <i>(yogasthah kuru karmani, sangam tyaktva
Dhananjaya). </i>So he did his day’s hard work, and then did not worry about
it. He appeared–without, perhaps, knowing it–to follow Lord Krishna’s
injunction: “Thy duty is to do thy tasks regardless of results” <i>(karmanyevadhikaraste
ma phaleshu kadachana).</i> Many of us are more worried about the results than
about the act itself. That dose not enable us to use our full capacity and
energy, or put our mind and attention to the work in hand. It would be good, if
we followed Lal Bahadur Shastri in this respect and worked hard, whatever the

good and bad deeds alike. This is what <i>Yoga </i>enjoins for the perfect
state of mind. Yoga consists in the skill of doing one’s act in the right
manner. Because Lal Bahadur remained free from all types of attachment, and did
not feel unduly elated by agreeable experiences, nor unduly depressed by
disagreeable experiences, he might be called a stable-minded person according
to yoga. Explaining <i>Buddhi Yoga, </i>Lord Krishna says that the mental
attitude of even mindedness or the spirit, in which an action is done, is a
most important factor in the performance of action and, therefore, a person
should always be mindful of the spirit which moves him to act.<sup>1</sup>
According to Goethe, an eminent German thinker, “a man should not expect from
life happiness, or care for the results of his activities. He is to engage
himself for the realization of good, impelled as it were, by inner necessity.
Whoever desires to be active must resemble that unreasonable sower in the
parable who casts the seed without worrying as to how large the harvest will
be, nor where it will come up.” Again in a letter written to one of his friends
in 1782, he says, “All I can assure you is that in the midst of happiness, I
live in a perpetual state of renunciation and that each day, with all my
troubles and works, I see that it is not my will that is done, but the will of
a higher power whose thoughts are not my thoughts.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the above sense, Lal Bahadur was perfectly an even-minded person, as he
remained ungloved and unperturbed in the midst of trials of life. His was a
life of constant dedication. He had seen many pits and pinnacles in life, and
the hard hits of cruel fate could never deter the course of his life. “Hard and
devoted work is equal to prayer” was one of Shastriji’s mottoes. Being brought
up in the religious and philosophical traditions of India, he took things with
a spirit of resignation and tried to lead completely a detached life. Although
he was not a saint in the customary sense, he was more than a saint as far as
his way of living and thinking went. Nothing could detract his attention from
the work which he consciously took up in hand. Even the love and care of his
own children and the members of his family could not check him from discharging
his duty. For him, duty was more important than love or anything else in life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

expected to give in writing that he would not partake in the Congress movement,

written undertaking not to engage in any political activity during the extended
period of parole. Lal Bahadur flatly refused to give any such undertaking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an early age, but his career was dependent upon the affectionate upbringing of
a charitable Welsh uncle. But that uncle had strength, ability and ambition,
and impressed upon his nephew, David, that if he wanted to succeed in politics
he should not only give, but absorb the ideas and aspirations of the people and
even interpret their passing moods or fancies to those around him. The nephew

conscious of this quality of his character, but his thoughts and actions fully
represented it. And his humanism was more positive and wide than that espoused
by several European thinkers, like Berdaev, Maritain, Kant, Santayana or
Russell. While the average European philosopher has been on the defensive
against the disintegration of European society through the pull of the
cash-nexus, unbridled competition, insecurity, lack of faith, aggrandisement

understand what lay behind those millions of eyes that stared at him, and felt
extremely grieved to see there untold sorrow and unexpressed misery. He knew that
India was a poor country, and her average man could not afford to procure even
one meal in a day. He was also conscious of the fact that till the lot of the
common man was improved, democracy in India would not be consolidated. This is
equally true of every country in the world. As Lal Bahadur himself lived in
dire poverty, struggling against want and misery for most of his life, it was
but natural that he should have utmost sympathy for the downtrodden people of
the world. Without wasting his energy in ideological controversies, he
ceaselessly and quietly worked for the people and did whatever he could for the
improvement of their lot. He was in favour of such a society which would meet
the material requirements of the people by giving them a better standard of
living without denuding them of what we had always held precious through the

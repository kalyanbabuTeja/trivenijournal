<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>After the fourth general election
India has politically ceased to be what she was during the twenty years which
followed the achievement of freedom from British rule. She now enters on a future
which is full of uncertainties. The fourth general election has created the
possibility of the triumph of anti-democratic and anti-national forces. There
is now the danger of the country having to face an alternative between orderly
development and chaos, between democracy and some kind of dictatorship, and
between the maintenance of the political unity of the country under a fairly
strong Central Government and the emergence of a number of independent States. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>History
has always a tendency to repeat itself. What happened in 1947 was the fall of
an empire which maintained the unity of the country and preserved internal
order and security for at least a century. Its fall, however, was like the fall
of all previous empires–the Mauryan and the Gupta in ancient times, the Afghan
and the Mogul in medieval times. The fall of every empire left a power vacuum
behind it and ambitious seekers after power tried to fill it. Every schoolboy
is familiar with what happened after the collapse of the Mogul empire with the
death of Aurangazeb in 1707. It gave the opportunity in due course for a Nizam
of Hyderabad, a Hyder Ali of Mysore, an Ali Verdi Khan of Bengal and a
Shujauddawlah of Oudh to establish themselves in authority while the Peshwas in
Poona and the Sikhs in the Punjab expanded their power. A period of internecine
warfare commenced and it continued until the British overthrew them all and
established their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>empire.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is true that the struggle to fill the power vacuum after the fall of the
British empire in 1947 has taken a different form. It has come to be carried on
in a formally democratic situation with appeals to the electorate to decide as
to who should rule over them in the country as a whole and in each of the
States. The struggle was not, of course, among military leaders at the head of
armies. It was among the leaders of political parties and in several cases
among persons with local influence and not attached to any party. In essence,
however, it was all a struggle for power and from this point of view it was no
different from similar struggles in the past. The various parties in the
country the Congress, the Communist, the P. S. P., the S. S. P., the Swatantra,
the Jan Sangh, the D. M. K. etc., have been the Nizams, the Ali Verdi Khans,
the Hyder Alis and the Peshwas of today. They have not been averse to the use
of violence in several cases to get into power. Each party has been trying to
create for itself a regional nucleus where it can hold an entrenched position
and extend itself to the other parts of the country. The Communists have their
stronghold of this kind in Kerala, the D. M. K. in Madras, the Akalis in the
Punjab, the Communists and leftists in West Bengal and the Jan Sangh in the
Hindi-speaking region. There is the possibility of some of these starting
secessionist movements and declare the region over which they have been able to
secure a hold as an independent state. This is the ultimate purpose of their
constant reference today to an unresponsive Centre and to the need for greater powers
being transferred to states. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are not as yet a mature democracy in the sense that the British, the Americans,
the Scandinavians and the Swiss are. They have attained maturity because of
their longer experience in the working of democratic institutions. We have, it
is true, an electorate just as they have, but ours is an immature electorate
with no emotional attachment to democracy. Very few among our countrymen will
care to die for preserving a democratic political system if someone tries to
overthrow it. This is borne out by the fact that it is only the leaders of
political parties that resent the imposition of President’s rule in a State
while the masses are either indifferent or even welcome it. Even in the sphere
of municipal government we often come across the spectacle of rate-payers
welcoming the suppression of elected Government and the appointment of a
Commissioner to manage municipal affairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

large majority of the electorate are incapable of thinking for themselves and
decide as to how they should vote. Their voting behaviour can be easily
manipulated. Their vote can also be purchased. This is the present situation.
Other democracies were quite as immature and as unenlightened in the early days
of their history. Corruption was widespread among them. If democracy is given
the fullest opportunity to grow in our country for three or four decades,
people will then be in a position to appreciate its value. Today it is mostly
wire-pulling by influential brokers–the presidents of Zilla Parishads and
Panchayati Samitis, the office-holders of co-operative societies and the
so-called social service institutions receiving grants from Government, the
contractors who have been benefited by the plan projects and the local
landlords that shape the voting behaviour of the electorate. There are, of
course, sections of people who are politically conscious and who know what a
vote means. But they are to be found mostly in urban areas. Most of the youth
in cities belong to this category. Unfortunately they have little faith in
democracy. They are attracted to communism and to various types of leftism.
Political analysts have already told us that it is their vote that has to a
great extent led to the debacle of the Congress in the fourth election. The
youth have revolted against the Congress party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fourth general election has resulted in the Congress party not securing a
majority in Bihar, Kerala, Madras, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and
West Bengal. Non-Congress coalition ministries have been formed in six of them,
while there is the D. M. K. ministry in Madras and President’s rule in
Rajasthan (at the time of writing). Although in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh
Congress ministries were first formed, they later on gave place to coalition
ministries because of several members of the party crossing the floor. Today
nearly two-thirds of the country’s population, so far as state subjects under
the federal system are considered, may be said to be ruled by non-Congress
coalition ministries. This is the most arresting feature of the situation
brought about by this election. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is also the likelihood in the coming months of some more states having
coalition ministries. This possibility arises because, as events in Haryana and
Uttar Pradesh have shown, the members of the Congress party have no regard for
principles or for any standards of public morality. The greed for personal
power has taken root in them. Factionalism and corruption, which have overtaken
the Congress and which, according to most observers, are the causes for its
defeat, have completely demoralised the members. For the sake of a ministership
they are quite prepared to desert the party and join the ranks of opposition.
The so-called independents are no better or worse. They are also prepared to
attach themselves to some party or other, and gain a ministership. In this
situation it will be no surprise if some more states come to have non-Congress
coalition ministries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is also a similar possibility even at the centre. In the Lok Sabha the strength
of the Congress party is 281 in a house of 521 members. If twenty leave the
party, the Congress ministry will have to resign. The members of the Congress
party in Lok Sabha are of the same mould as those in State Assemblies. To add
to this there is the rivalry between the President of the Congress and the
Prime Minister–the kind of rivalry which encouraged factionalism in the State
Congress parties. Besides these sources of internal weakness there is the
strategy of the opposition parties which may result in the Congress ministry at
the Centre toppling down. The opposition parties have been proclaiming aloud
that they won’t rest satisfied unless and until the Congress ministry at the
Centre is driven out of office. It is their strategy to see that a mid-term
election is held. They do not want to give to the Congress party any time to
recover from the rout it suffered at the last election. They are prepared to
resort to action of any kind, violent or non-violent, inside and outside
parliament, to bring about the fall of the Congress ministry. They are not as
much interested–at least for the time being–in the good government of the
country as in dealing a final and fatal blow to the Congress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is these factors–the immaturity of the electorate, the revolt of the youth, the
unscrupulousness of the members of the Congress party and the strategy of the
parties in opposition–that are responsible for the uncertainty regarding the
future of the country–the future which has emerged out of the fourth election. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1947 the British withdrew after transferring power to the Congress party. The
Congress had a monopoly of power for twenty years. The fourth general election
is a revolutionary event in as much as it has led to the complete breakdown of
this monopoly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may, however, be argued that there is nothing revolutionary in this change. In
a democracy there is nothing unusual in one party going out of office as the
result of a general election and another party taking its place. It may even be
argued that such a periodical change is a sign of health as no one party should
be permitted to monopolise power for long periods of time and get corrupted by
its uninterrupted enjoyment of power. Both these arguments assume that it is
through the strengthening of the democratic forces in the country that the
collapse of the Congress has been brought about and that it would further the
cause of democracy. There is, however, no warrant for such an assumption. The
defeat of the Congress is the result of an unholy alliance between a few
disgruntled democratic parties and a number of parties which have no faith in
democracy and which are bent on murdering it. In this process there was also
the help given to them by parties moving towards regional separatism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poll-analysists
have told us that what distinguished the fourth general election from all the
previous ones is the united front formed by opposition parties in almost all
states for defeating the Congress. In the previous elections the non-Congress
votes were split among a number of opposition candidates and the Congress was
enabled to emerge as the party having the largest number of votes, even though
it might be a minority of votes cast. In the fourth election the position was
reversed. The opposition parties joined together and put up only one candidate
in very many constituencies against the Congress candidate. There was not,
therefore, any split in the non-Congress vote and it was this that led to the
defeat of the Congress. We have begun to speak of the growing maturity of our
electorate as symbolised in more votes being cast by them in favour of
non-Congress parties. No one denies that there was some maturity of this kind
though it was marginal. It is, however, the new strategy of the opposition
parties than the growing maturity of the electorate that led to the defeat of
the Congress. The electorate could be credited with more maturity if, while
casting fewer votes in favour of the Congress, they indicated clearly by which
parties they wanted the various States to be<b> </b>governed. They failed to do
so. Their verdict had only a negative character about it. In some cases more
than half-a-dozen parties had to join together to form a ministry. The
electorate was not perhaps entirely to be blamed for this. The multiplicity of
opposition parties was more responsible for this situation. Very few regret the
fall of the Congress. The general feeling is that it richly deserved such a
blow. But t»ere is widespread regret that as a result of its fall the political
future of the country has become most uncertain.</span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have now to consider why the future is uncertain. One reason for drawing such a
conclusion is that, except in Madras where there is a D. M. K. ministry with a
strong party majority behind it, in all other non-Congress States ministries
are of a coalitionist character. Coalition ministries are generally unstable.
This is borne out by the experience of such ministries in Kerala and Orissa in
the past. The only bond that keeps them united today is their hatred of the
Congress. But this is too negative a bond to produce a lasting effect. If
foreign experience is to serve as a guide to us in this connection we have to
say that coalitions have been successful only in small countries like
Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They are countries
which are not faced with many complicated problems. Moreover they have
coalitions of like-minded parties without extreme ideological differences like
those which exist in our states between the Swatantra, the Jan Sangh and the P.
S. P. on one side and the Communists, the S. S. P. and the other leftists on
the other. In a fairly big country like France, with complicated problems of
domestic and foreign policies, coalition ministries have been unstable, no
ministry being in power for more than ten months on an average. Ministry-making
created so much difficulty that a De Gaulle had to revise the Constitution and
establish a sort of constitutional dictatorship. There are, of course, eminent
leaders in our country who see no, instability in coalition ministries and who
even advocate the formation of such ministries. But their views have no basis
in experience. In any case coalitions of parties with extreme ideological
differences are bound to be unstable. Sri Balraj Madhok was more realistic when
he observed recently that at the national level a coalition, with Jan Sangh and
the Communists as parties in it, would be extremely difficult because of policy
differences. No efficient government or good administration will be possible
with unstable ministries. There will not be any continuity of policy. It will
produce an undesirable effect on the permanent civil service with their
political bosses changing rather frequently. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
may ask if there is any alternative to this. The alternative consists only in
like-minded parties, which do not differ very much in their ideologies,
entering into a coalition. The coalition which we now have in Orissa has this
character. If the Congress is prepared to enter into coalition with the Swatantra
or Jan Sangh there is some chance of stable ministries. At present the Congress
is averse to enter into coalition with other parties. There is no justification
for such an attitude. In the larger interests of the country it has to revise
its policy in this matter. But this will be possible if the more
democratically-minded opposition parties like the Swatantra give up their
bitter hatred of the Congress party and recognise that it has a right to exist.
Such changes in the attitudes of like-minded parties are absolutely necessary
as there does not seem to be any likelihood of the multiple party system in our
country giving place to a two-party system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

dangerous. Unfortunately the fourth general election has brought into existence
such ministries in several States like Kerala, West Bengal and Bihar. With
their faith in class-war and hatred of parliamentary democracy the communists
and leftists are a peril even when they are outside the ministries. They become
a source of greater peril when they are a part of the government. There is
nothing to show that their democratic colleagues will be in a position to tone
down the extremism of communists. Experience shows that it has always been the
other way. In Czechoslovakia and in several other countries of Central and Eastern
Europe the coalition ministries, of which the communists formed a part, enabled
them to ultimately sieze power. They value coalitions merely because they give
them an opportunity of this kind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a view that communist-dominated ministries are not dangerous in States and
that they become dangerous only when they are formed at the centre where they
can control the army and shape foreign policies. But this is a mistaken view.
In our federal system the States have a large amount of power. The police who
are the guardians of law and order are under their control. There are the State
civil services on which the whole administration depends. Education,
agriculture, co-operation and industries are within their jurisdiction. They
are in a position to levy taxes of various kinds. Those who believe in
class-war and in the doctrine that without liquidating the vested interests,
the land-lords and the capitalists by revolutionary means no reconstruction of
society is possible are sure to use their power as ministers to bring such a
revolution, nearer. They can so manipulate their policies and administrative
actions to secure Communist domination in the ranks of the police, the
teachers, the managers of co-operative societies and in Panchayati Raj
organisations. Adherence to a policy like the one announced by the West Bengal
Government that the police would not be used to suppress disturbances caused by
labour strikes or that announced by the Bihar ministry that the police will not
be allowed to enter academic institutions indicate in what direction
leftist-dominated ministries are likely to move. There are also other steps
taken by them in regard to procurement of grain, the siezing of hoarded rice or
wheat which may create social tensions of an undesirable character. The
situation created by the fourth general election has thus become a perilous
one. It has placed power in the hands of anti-democrats and the advocates of a
system of government similar to that in Soviet Russia or Mao’s China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is also another source of danger in the emerging situation. It is the danger
arising from resort to direct action–a weapon which has increasingly come to
use in the post-independence period. There is no space in an article like this
to deal comprehensively with the nature of direct action and how it will kill
democracy if it is frequently resorted to. The tragedy of the situation lies in
the fact that even parties like the Congress and the P. S. P., which profess to
believe in democracy, have resorted to direct action whenever they thought that
they could gain their immediate objective through it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

action has taken two forms–non-violent and violent. Individual and group
Satyagraha, mass processions in which hundreds and thousands of people
participate crying all sorts of slogans, hartals and bundhs are theoretically
the non-violent forms of direct action. Destroying Public and private property,
looting shops, setting fire to police stations, railway stations, railway
wagons, buses, and motor cars, forcibly driving away people from schools and
colleges and from the offices are some of the violent forms of direct action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

alleged purpose of every kind of direct action is to directly bring pressure on
Government to take some action which those who resort to it think it necessary.
It may be the location of a steel plant in a particular place, the repeal of a
certain law; the abrogation of a certain tax or the grant of a certain
concession. Government is coerced to take action without paying consideration
to all the issues involved. Almost all kinds of direct action are coercive in
character. Even the so-called non-violent action like hartals and bundhs have
invariably resulted in violence. There is no analogy between Satyagraha as
advocated by Mahatma Gandhi and the Satyagraha of today. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

resort to it as a weapon of last resort when all constitutional action has been
tried may have some excuse. There may also be some justification for resorting
to it in protest against governmental measures like conscription for which one
entertains a conscientious objection. But there is no justification whatever to
resort to it as a normal method of political action in a democracy where there
are constitutional methods of various kinds available for influencing
governmental policies. A democratic political system cannot function if people
resort to the extra-constitutional method of coercing Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the fourth general election the danger of discontented groups resorting to it
has become greater. This is because the political parties which have been
encouraging it are now in power in many states and they are anxious to create a
situation in which it becomes impossible for the Central Government to
function. To create chaos is their objective. We have had in the past the experience
of Government employees in U. P. going on strike for nearly two months and
bringing all administration to a standstill. We have the more recent experience
of the police strike in Delhi and several leftist parties espousing their
cause. There is now a feeling among them that with the defeat which the
Congress met at the polls it has become weak and that the capacity of the
Central Government to take decisive action in the face of a threat of violence
and disorder is at a minimum. The country will therefore have to be prepared to
witness resort to direct action on an unprecedented scale, leading to chaos and
confusion and making orderly development impossible. Can democracy survive
under conditions like these? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

revenues between the Central and State Governments. There are also provisions
enabling the Central Government to make other grants to states and such grants
have been made in the past and there is no reason to think that they will be
discontinued simply because some non-Congress Governments have been formed at
the state level. This has been made quite clear at the recent conference of the
Central and State ministers in charge of finance. The only factor which may
interfere with the making of such grants is the financial position of the
centre itself which at present is not very hopeful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the centre on some pretext or other and magnify their importance simply

teachers and to provide more for social services. All these are laudable
objectives. But the policy of an increase in expenditure is inconsistent with
that of unwillingness to tax the people. The ministries wish to gain cheap
popularity and in this game they have been making large demands on the centre
for financial assistance. They have even suggested that the centre should
satisfy the demands by reducing its own expenditure on defence. All this shows
a high degree of irresponsibility on the part of non-Congress ministries. It is
a step preparatory to making the centre a sort of scapegoat in all their
difficulties and create hostility between the people in the states and the
Central Government. Here is one cause of unnecessary tensions. Nothing will so
much strain the relations between the centre and the states as this tendency on

is sure to lead in the same direction. A nation has according to these
protagonists the right of secession and self-determination. It will not be a
matter for surprise if they utilise the power they have in Kerala and in West
Bengal to promote secessionist movements in them. It is appropriate to recall
in this connection the plea put forward by the Kerala Chief Minister that the
foreign exchange obtained from the export of rubber should be utilised to
purchase food for Kerala. There are other ministries which wish to have direct
dealings with Soviet Russia, Communist China, and Burma so as to enable them to
get food from those states. They have shown a tendency to ignore that foreign
policy is a subject exclusively within the jurisdiction of the centre. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of unity. Unfortunately the new governments are working in a direction quite
opposite to this. Let us also not forget that we have in Kashmir and in the
Punjab an open secessionist movement and that it was only recently that the D.
M. K. gave up the idea of an independent Tamil Nad and that even in Maharashtra

more active phase after the fourth general election. It ought to be the

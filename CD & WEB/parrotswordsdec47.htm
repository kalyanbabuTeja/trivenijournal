style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>At a very young age, when I was hardly a few days
old in this world and had not yet learnt the secret of giving flight to my
fresh-fledged wings, I came into the possession of Tara Sundari. Since then,
though my life has been that of a captive bird behind the cage bars, it has yet
been one of general pleasure and pleasantness–What with sweet fruits, dainty
delicacies and my mistress’s tender caresses....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Loveliness personified, beauty incarnate is Tara
Sundari! Her luxurious black hair clustered round her face like dark leaves
round a blossoming flower. The roses flowered perpetually in her cheeks. Smiles
trembled on her lips eternally. Her complexion was a romantic colour–milk and
roses mixed. Her gait was that of a swan, graceful, measured, royal. O, she was
a sunbeam of life,–a creature born out of poetry and brought up in the
atmosphere of a play. Cupid could have learnt how to bend his bow and shoot his
arrows from her perfectly arched eye-brows and her unfailingly lacerating
glances....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Tara was fortunate in securing as her husband one
in every way worthy of her. He was a model youth, a typical hero of a pattern
romance, yet……yet it was his good looks that deceived us all in the end! Who
could have dreamt–when Tara vowed to be his for life–that he would turn out to
be a curse and a damnation to her? Skim milk masqueraded as cream....!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>When Tara went to her husband’s house, followed by
every conceivable item of aristocratic paraphernalia, I too went with her. She
couldn’t think of leaving me behind—me, who had been her boon companion for
years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>My residence was just opposite her apartment. High
up in the verandah hung my gilded cage and I could see my Tara always, except
when she was not in the room. Every night after dinner she used to come to my
cage before retiring and speak to me affectionately, pat me endearingly. As a
rule at night she used to wear a spotlessly white muslin saree, from, behind
which shimmered the beauty of her form and the radiance of her complexion like
moonlight reflected from behind a transparent gauze of clouds. Having removed
all her jewels and ornaments by that time, she used to be exquisitely bright in
her own natural loveliness. Her full-moon face–which was an abiding nest for
sweetness–shone with an inexplicable joy; and love trembled in laughter on her
rose-petal lips. O….she could have taught even the gods how to love!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A romantic tickle on my cheeks with her delicate
fingers was her usual way of bidding me good-night. And then–as the door of the
room was bolted–she was out of my sight–but not out of my hearing at times–and
certainly not out of my thoughts at any time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As Dawn’s dewy hand swept with delicate white the
dull olive-tinted expanse of the sky, she used to step out of a half-opened
door–like a goddess from her pedestal. She was the first to greet me every
morning with a sweet smile. O, how I used to feel proud, happy, elated at the
privilege! And how I used to yearn for the precious gift of human speech to
articulate to her my deep sense of thankfulness and my happiness as her
favourite pet...!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was known to everyone, She was in her seventh
month! She was shy to acknowledge the fact,–when anyone questioned her about
it, either for verification, for information or for fun, She used to blush, as
all good and true maidens do in the dawn of their motherhood! Romantic to her
finger-tips, modern in her views, up-to-date in her outlook, Tara yet had the
spirit of ancient Indian womanhood in her blood. From the time that her eyes
had learnt to search for a hero for her life’s drama, she regarded marriage as
the symbol and sacrament of love, and dreamed of motherhood as the crown and
consummation of womanhood. She longed to live the poetry she could not realise
in writing–longed to be Life’s masterpiece...!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As days advanced, she became weak and used to sway,
while walking, like the stem of a slender plant, and when sitting droop like a
water-lily weighed with its own heavy pollen. And even in this state she never
failed to feed me, to caress me, to bid me good-night and good-morrow. My joy
at my mistress’s radiant motherhood knew no bounds. I used to long for the
feathers of a peacock, in order to demonstrate through dance my delight at the
event. But my joy and hers, and every one else’s that knew her was not to be
for long. She became unwell unexpectedly and miscarriage trod on the toes of
illness. Those were anxious days and nights, doctors came and went with mute signs
and hushed whispers, and nurses attended on her by turns, moving about as
noiselessly as the dim-white streaks of dawn. From my cage, I could see every
little thing that happened to my angel. I was there in spirit near her all the
while and prayed to the merciful gods to spare her life at least, if not that
of the unborn one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Tara was on the road to recovery. Her progress was
slow but steady. All her illness disappeared, but only after leaving its victim
pale and weak. She could never be her former self again, never could get back
her original health and hilarity. The painful experience toned down much of her
buoyancy and much of her beauty. Yet she felt happy because she had been given
another lease of life. Tara was Tara, as far as love of life was concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>That night, Tara felt restless in her bed. She
changed sides–as often as a politician changes sides–stared with wild eyes into
the enveloping darkness. She suddenly leapt to her feet and came straight to my
cage. There seemed to be a terrible fire in her head. Her body was quivering
like an aspen leaf and disappointment peeped from her tearful eyes. My heart
reached out to her in the hour of her tribulation and I showed my anguish by
nestling near her as much as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unjustified. I recalled to my mind how in days gone by, in the era of the
epics, in the period of <i>Puranas </i>and <i>Prabandhas</i>–parrots played
their part as messengers of romance, as aribtrators of the love-tangles of
estranged lovers. And is not the chariot of Cupid drawn by parrots? Yes….I
remembered that, as a race, we had our honoured place in human loves, as
love-makers and peace-makers. But that was in the mythic past–in distant
forgotten days! We have fallen, I confess with shame, from that high and palmy
state. I felt wretched at my own inability to console my beloved rnistress,–to
be of any service to her in the terrible hour of her tragedy. I felt wretched,
but I could realise the truth that the eyes that once have learnt to wonder at
the artificial but alluring parade of paint and powder will never like to look
at domestic beauty,–that the bee that once sips the honey of glittering and
gaudy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>flowers will never think of
simple, lovely flowers! But….how I tell her this?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in that rather violent impact the cage door got loose. It was a timely hint
from Providence which I was not slow to catch. Without a thought of her or her

thought, to notice my escape. I hopped on to the balcony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

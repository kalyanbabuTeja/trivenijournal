mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>WITH reference to the future relations between
India and the British Commonwealth, as it has been known hitherto, Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru is reported to have said in London recently that he was a prisoner of
past commitments on the subject. It should be noted however that they were
made, not always on their merits, but as a challenge to the then British
imperialism in India. An instance of it is adult franchise. Few in India would
have advocated it at the time they did, on its merits. India has attained her
independence. It is no longer necessary to speak with an eye on British
imperialism. A proof of our independence is the revaluation of our past
commitments and adherence to only those which can be justified on merits in the
present circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>During the days of British rule there was a demand
that India should have a <i>swadeshi </i>Constitution made by a <i>swadeshi </i>Constituent
Assembly, to displace the then Constitution which was ‘made in England’ and by
England, and was therefore foreign and unacceptable to India. Ultimately, it
was the British Government that set up the Indian Constituent Assembly with all
the communal and other anti-national handicaps associated with the British-made
Indian Constitution. The British quit India on the 15th of August 1947. But not
the Constituent Assembly created by them. No new <i>swadeshi </i>Constituent
Assembly has been called into existence by India since she attained her
independence. The present Assembly owes its origin and character to British
imperialism; it is not <i>swadeshi</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Draft Constitution also is not <i>pucca
swadeshi</i>. Indeed, one of the bitter criticisms against it is that it is
largely foreign. In his authoritative article on the Draft Indian Constitution,
published in the Independence Number of <i>The Hindu </i>of Madras, of the 15th
of August 1948, Sir B. N. Rau, the Constitutional Adviser to the Government of
India, admitted that the Draft Constitution borrowed largely from other
Constitutions, and more particularly from the hated Government of Indian Act of
1935. It borrowed not only the substance but also the very language of the Act
of 1935! Sir B. N. Rau defended it as not only inevitable but also wise. And he
was right. There is however no need to pretend that it is a <i>swadeshi</i> <i>Constitution</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One may well wonder if it was at all necessary to
have set up the Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution. Was it
necessary to draft a whole new Constitution at all? India has not been without
a Constitution; there was no constitutional vacuum to be filled for the first
time. Even without the new Constitution drafted by the Indian Constituent
Assembly, India has achieved the most fundamental changes in her Constitution:
she attained national independence and achieved responsible parliamentary
government at the Centre and in the Provinces. By August 1948 most of the
Indian States had acceded to the Indian Union and also obtained responsible
government these great and fundamental changes were brought about by the
amendment of the Government of India Act of 1935. India is now free to make
further changes which, by comparison, can only be minor in character, by a
similar process of amending the same Act, as and when necessary, one clause at
a time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Those who longed for a really <i>swadeshi</i>
Constitution lamented that the Draft Constitution did not take note of India’s
indigenous village system and start from the village as the base, and work up
to the Province and the Centre. Sir B. N. Rau defended the exclusion from the
Constitution of provisions regarding local government on the ground, among
others, that their inclusion would make the Constitution even more ‘rigid’ than
it was in the Draft, for, their amendment would require, the <i>special
procedure prescribed for the amendment of the Constitution</i>, and that such
special procedure was not necessary in the case of provisions concerning local
government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It will be noted that the Constitution of India,
which is in operation today, though a ‘written’ one, has been made and amended
by a bare majority of members of the Legislature, present and voting. In this
respect, it follows the procedure for making and amending the so-called
unwritten Constitution of Great Britain. The Draft Constitution of India,
though it can be enacted by a bare majority of members of the Constituent
Assembly, present and voting, provides for a larger majority, and some cases,
ratifications by the Provinces and acceding States, to amend it subsequently.
In this it follows, though not closely, the pattern of the American
Constitution. <i>It is a fundamental departure from the present Indian pattern</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Is there any justification for this innovation? If
it is a good and wise provision, why deny it at the local government level,
for, as Sir B. N. Rau rightly said, the Constitution of a country deals with
organs of government at various levels, which includes the local government
level as well? If it is not, why introduce it at the Province and Centre
levels? Have England and India suffered because their Constitutions at all
levels have been made and amended by an ordinary majority? Eave countries like
the U.S.A. gained by the adoption of special procedure for amending their
Constitutions at the higher levels? Would India gain by replacing the present
procedure by the special procedure? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Does it stand to reason that a Constitution can be
made by a bare majority of members, present and voting, but that it cannot be
amended subsequently except by a larger majority and a special procedure? If a
larger majority is a safeguard against hasty and ill-considered amendments of
the Constitution, would it not stand to reason that a similar procedure should
be adopted for enacting it in the first instance? And should not the same
special procedure be adopted for all Legislation: indeed be made universal?
Should we safeguard only constitutional amendments from hasty and
ill-considered action by the legislators, but not other laws which affect the
welfare of the citizens even more vitally and extensively? The laws affecting
property agriculture and industry, education, marriage and inheritance, peace
and war, which affect the mass of the citizens very vitally, may be made and
unmade by an ordinary majority, but not Sec. 47 (b) of the Draft Constitution
which prescribes that the candidate for election as President of the Indian
Union shall have completed the age of thirty five years! Of the 315 Sections of
the Draft Constitution few, if any, are more consequential to the welfare of
the citizens than, say, an annual budget which may impose heavy and crushing
taxation, or the amendment of the Army Act which may enforce conscription. And
yet, the former are proposed to be protected against hasty amendment while the
latter are not! If the Legislature can be trusted to act wisely and well with
major and more consequential issues like the budget, there is no reason to
distrust them in dealing with the comparatively minor issues, say, the
emoluments of the President under Sec. 48 (4) of the Draft Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It has been contended that the special procedure
for amendment is necessary to safeguard fundamental civil liberties against
infringement by the Legislature and the Executive. It is common ground that
civil liberties should be protected. But is it necessary to list such liberties
in the Constitution, which only means that they can be abridged by the special
procedure prescribed for amendments of the Constitution? Civil liberties are
entrenched in the Constitution in the U.S.A.; in England they are at the mercy
of a majority in Parliament. But, by all accounts, they do not seem to be in
greater danger of infringement in England than in the U.S.A. Indeed, it is
generally admitted that they are better protected in England than in the U.S.A.
For instance, the Constitution of the U.S.A. guarantees equal rights to all its
citizens. But it has not been able to secure them to the Negroes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Draft Indian Constitution, surprisingly enough,
does not really safeguard civil liberties, while professing to do so. Part III
of the Draft enumerates the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution,
which can be amended only by the special procedure, but almost every such right
is subject to infringement by laws that may be enacted by the Legislature by
the ordinary procedure! For instance, Sec. 13 (1) (b) says that all citizens of
India shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, but Sec. 13
(3) says that it is subject to any existing law or any law that may be passed restricting
the right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It has been suggested by some critics of the Draft
Constitution that the civil liberties or Fundamental Rights should be made
absolute as in the Constitution of the U.S.A. For instance, the First Amendment
in the ‘Bill of Rights’ in the American Constitution provides that no law shall
be enacted which would prohibit the free exercise of religion, or abridge the
freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the citizens to assemble
peacefully, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Nevertheless, Fundamental Rights are not really
absolute in the U.S.A. Only the power to abridge them has been exercised by the
Judiciary instead of the Executive or the Legislature. Such action of the U.S.
Judiciary is however without warrant in the Constitution. Indeed, if there were
a judicial tribunal to pronounce on the constitutional validity of the
Judiciary of the U.S.A. abridging the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in absolute
terms by the American Constitution, there can be little doubt that the verdict
would go against the Judiciary. The only constitutional way to abridge the
Fundamental Rights, necessitated by practical politics, is by a constitutional
amendment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is a matter of political philosophy and
practical politics whether the inescapable abridgement of Fundamental Rights on
occasions should be at the discretion of the Executive and the Legislature, or
the Judiciary. The Legislature, reflecting public opinion, and even more the
Executive, with sources of information not wholly available to the public, are
in a better position to judge if and when Fundamental Rights should be
abridged. The Judiciary is not, by its very nature, equipped for the purpose.
At best, it can step in only after the abridgement, and pronounce whether it
was justified or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Executive is equipped to take immediate and
preventive action; the Legislature can meet in an emergency session, and after
due and public deliberation, sanction abridgement of civil liberties
temporarily but the Judiciary can act only <i>post facto </i>and carry out a <i>post
mortem</i>, as it were. It is ill-equipped to cope with an emergency calling
for immediate but temporary abridgement of civil liberties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Under the Constitution of the U.S.A., the Executive
is not ‘responsible’ to the Legislature. They remain in office for a period
which is fixed in the Constitution; there is no resignation of the President,
or the dissolution of the Congress in response to public opinion. of the
President and the Congress shock public opinion by arbitrary infringement of
Fundamental Rights, the public have no immediate remedy. But in the
Parliamentary system, as prevails in England and in India, the Executive is
continuously responsible to the Legislature, and the Cabinet can resign and the
Legislature be dissolved at any time that they forfeit the confidence of the
public by their unwarranted abridgement of Fundamental Rights. Even if there is
some justification in the U.S.A. for vesting in the Judiciary the discretion to
abridge Fundamental Rights, there is none in England and India which have the Parliamentary
system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>If it is still desired that Fundamental Rights
should be ‘protected’ from abridgement by the Executive and the Legislature,
and that for that purpose they should be incorporated in the Constitution,
then, the Constitution may be limited to them only. There is no need to insist
on the special procedure for amendment of the other of the 315 Sections in the
Draft Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Constitution will then be a very short and
terse statement of Fundamental Rights and Obligations of the Indian citizen. It
can then be memorised by everybody, particularly by children in the schools,
like the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to the American
Constitution which every child in the U.S.A. repeat as a <i>mantram </i>every
day. The Indian Constitution may even be made the National Anthem and be
inscribed on the Indian National Flag like the Edicts of Asoka. Such a document
and such presentation will grip the imagination and engage the emotions of the
citizens and evoke their veneration and loyalty. The present Draft
Constitution, with its three hundred and odd Sections, will, like the Indian
Penal Code or Criminal Procedure Code, interest only lawyers and pandits. It
can have no public appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Further, there are several Sections in the Draft
Constitution amendable by special procedure which are subject to ordinary laws
made by the ordinary procedure. It is not an advantage to make constitutional
laws subordinate to statutory laws. It is a disadvantage to distinguish two
kinds of laws, the only difference between which is the procedure for
amendment. The validity of laws passed by the Legislature becomes liable to
question in the Courts. Laws sponsored by the Executive and enacted by the
Legislature in compliance with an electoral mandate, may be declared <i>ultra
vires </i>by the Courts. This may happen long after the law concerned has been
in operation, and only when some aggrieved party prefers a complaint. For, the
Courts do not pronounce on the constitutionality of a law while it is still in
the formative stage. No Executive will propose, and no Legislature will enact,
a law which they knew beforehand was unconstitutional. The very fact that they
enacted the law means that their law-officers, no mean experts, had opined that
the law was constitutional. Nevertheless, long after, when the law is
challenged in the court, it may be declared unconstitutional and <i>ultra vires</i>.
Not infrequently, the judgment of the court is not unanimous, nor even by a
large majority, but by a majority of one! It is not to be supposed that the
minority judges were incompetent or ignorant of the Constitution or necessarily
perverse. Thus, a law passed by the Legislature operates in an atmosphere of
insecurity until the court has occasion to pronounce on it, and even then, its
validity or otherwise turns often on the opinion of a single judge, who may not
be wiser than the rest!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

judicial decisions are incalculable in advance. There has been, therefore, the
temptation to appoint judges favourable to the policies of the Executive. The
late President was openly accused of appointing ‘political judges’ who would
support his policies! That amounts to corrupting the Judiciary for political

can override the Presidential veto, and (3) concurrence of seven out of the
nine Judges of the Supreme Court to sustain judicial veto. But any one of these

Constitutions, borrow what is good and reject what is bad. It is the part of
wisdom to do so. India may rightly borrow from other Constitutions, even from
the Government of India Act of 1935. But it is not wise to borrow what is
questioned and discredited in other Constitutions. It would be a political
blunder to import and impose for the first time handicaps which other
Constitutions are trying to get rid of, and from which India has been happily
free. <i>The sovereignty of the Indian Parliament at New Delhi should be
absolute in the legislative sphere, and legislation passed by the Indian
Parliament should not be subject to review by the Judiciary. There is no need
to distinguish in India, for the first time, between Constitutional Laws and
Statutory laws, and make the former subject to judicial review or to amendment
by special procedure, while the latter are open only to judicial interpretation
and amendment by the ordinary procedure. </i>As far as their enforcement by the
Judiciary is concerned, there is no difference between constitutional laws and
statutory laws, or even laws enacted by local government bodies like
municipalities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

constitutional laws can be amended by a special procedure, while the ordinary
laws are made and amended by the ordinary procedure. In so far as the special
procedure involves a larger majority than the ordinary majority of fifty-one
per cent of the legislators, present and voting, it vests a veto in the minority.
If the constitutional law can be amended by a majority of, say, two-thirds, as
proposed in Sec. 304 of the Draft Constitution, a minority of one-third <i>plus
</i>one can veto the will of the majority. If majority rule is sometimes an
evil, minority rule is worse. Minority veto cuts both ways; if it sometimes
arrests unhealthy legislation, it also arrests healthy legislation. Lord Bryce
noted that several measures considered very desirable and necessary by a large
majority of people in the U.S.A. were not introduced in the American Congress,
or not ratified after enactment by the Congress, because of the great
difficulty of securing the requisite majority in the Congress or in the States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the case of India, the Constituent Assembly can
claim no higher or better competence or wisdom than the Legislature, for, both
are one! The same body is the Constituent Assembly and the Indian Parliament.
It is very odd that the very same body can enact a brand new Constitution by a
simple majority, and without ratification by the Provinces or States, but
cannot amend it subsequently except by a two-thirds majority and, in some
cases, only after ratification by the States. It is absurd to contend that the
present British-appointed Constituent Assembly, based on communal electorates
and partly nominated and partly elected, and the latter indirectly elected on a
restricted franchise, is competent to enact a brand new Constitution by an
ordinary majority and without ratification’s, but that a Parliament brought
into being under the new Constitution, perhaps wholly elected, cannot amend it,
in the same manner! Further, it is extremely unwise to make a ‘rigid’
Constitution when the polity of India is still in a state of flux and while
revolutionary changes are taking place. From every point of view, there is no
need to distinguish between constitutional and statutory laws in India at the
present time; indeed, it is unwise to introduce such an innovation.</p>

criticisms, and suggested that during the first five years the new Constitution
should be amended by an ordinary majority like other statutory laws. So far so
good. But this compromise only postpones the inherent illogicality for five
years. Indeed, it will be even more odd, nay, stultifying, to tell the new
Indian Parliament that its political wisdom and competence in the matter of
amendments to the Constitution can be trusted only during the first five years
but not subsequently! It may be urged that during the first five years Parliament
would have gained some experience and could therefore be trusted better for it
later on. If the special procedure for amendment is really a safeguard against
ill-considered and hasty amendments, the danger is greater now, when Indian
polity is a revolutionary flux, than at the end of five years, when the tempo
of change might slow down. If the polity settles down after five years, there
will be less need or constitutional amendments, but not greater need for
safeguards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

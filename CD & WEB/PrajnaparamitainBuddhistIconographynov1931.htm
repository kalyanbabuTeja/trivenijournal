<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the <I>parinirvana </I>of Sakyamuni Buddha, dissensions crept into the Buddhist camp, and at Vaisali, it was divided sharply into two, that of the Elders and that of the Youngers. Those who stuck to ethics and moral discipline, were called the <I>Theravadins </I>and those who trifled with these two but stuck to metaphysical and altruistic doctrines were called the <I>Mahasanghikas. </I>One of the <I>Theravadin </I>sects, the <I>Vibhajyavadins </I>or the analytical sect was, we are told, much patronised by Asoka, but later on it deteriorated and lost its prestige, owing to the persecuting zeal of Pushyamitra and his successors. Consequently, it fled to the South and made Ceylon its home. The Youngers, <I>i.e., </I>the <I>Mahasanghikas </I>made fast friends with the new settlers of India, the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Pahlavas and the Kushanas. They seem to have made headway particularly at the time of Kanishka, and in the council held in his time made a commentary on the sayings of the Buddha called ‘Vibhasha.’ In that council the <I>Theravadins </I>were feebly represented while the <I>Vibhajyavadins </I>were not in evidence. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same council there was also a small but pushing sect called the <I>Ma hayana </I>which did not however count in the council, but made great headway two generations later under Nagarjuna and his disciple Aryadeva, both of whom were <I>Sunyavadins. </I>&quot;All speculations beyond Arhatship, Buddha discouraged as of no use. But bolder spirits after him could not resist the temptation of speculating, and their speculations ended in the time of Nagarjuna in <I>sunyavada.</I>&quot;<I> </I>But in a short time <I>Sunyavada </I>was found to be unsatisfactory and Maitreyanatha, one or two generations after Nagarjuna, added <I>vijnana </I>to it and founded the <I>vijnanavada </I>or what developed later on as the <I>Yogachara </I>system. The controversy between the <I>Sunyavadins </I>and the <I>Vijnanavadins </I>raged for several centuries. <I>Vijnanavada </I>was also found unsatisfactory and in the 8th century another element was added on to it which was called <I>Mahasukhavada, </I>so that &quot;after ordinary <I>nirvana </I>there were three elements, <I>Sunya, Vijnana, </I>and <I>Mahasukha.</I>&quot;<I> </I>It is from this <I>Mahasukhavada </I>that <I>Vajrayana </I>originated, and <I>Vajrayana </I>is the system rich in iconographical ideas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Buddhist philosophy there are four theories or schools that have to be adjusted within the three <I>Yanas </I>or ways. The schools are <I>Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Yogachara, </I>and <I>Madhyamika, </I>and the <I>Yanas </I>are <I>Sravakayana, Pratyekayana, </I>both being also called <I>Hinayana, </I>and <I>Mahayana. Sravakayana </I>and <I>Pratyekayana </I>are explained by the theory of the <I>Vaibhashikas. Mahayana </I>is of two kinds, <I>Paramitanaya </I>and <I>Mantranaya. </I>Paramitas are explained by the theories either of <I>Sautrantika, Yogachara </I>or <I>Madhyamika; Mantranaya </I>is explained by the theories of <I>Yogachara </I>and <I>Madhyamika </I>only<SUP>1</SUP> and begins with the abstruse theories of <I>Sunya </I>and <I>Vijnana.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hinayanist is selfish inasmuch as he strives for his own <I>nirvana, </I>while the Mahayanist makes compassion <I>(karuna) </I>his motto and works for the uplift or mankind. We may remember that <I>Mahasukha, </I>from which <I>Vajrayana </I>originated later on, is not possible to attain without the aid of <I>Sakti, </I>the embodiment of compassion <I>(karuna). </I>To the Hinayanist the Buddha is the Progenitor of the Law, a superman with extraordinary intellect, and the order in which he would worship the Buddhist <I>Triad </I>is as Buddha, Dharma and Sangha <I>i.e., </I>the Promulgator of the Law first, the Law second, and the Sangha or the congregation last, while to the Mahayanist the Buddha is an eternal being coming to earth only to liberate the beings tortured by Mara, the Satan of Buddhism, and the order in which he would offer worship to the <I>Triad </I>is as Dharma, Buddha, and Sangha, attributing the highest place to the Law and the next higher place to the Promulgator of the Law. The Mahayanist calls Dharma also as <I>Prajna </I>and speaks of it as eternal and the highest object in Buddhism, while Buddha is to him only the means of obtaining that <I>prajna, </I>which is diffused into the masses through him. And &quot;it took a considerable time, though we cannot definitely say how much, for the idea of <I>prajna </I>and <I>upaya </I>to evolve from Dharma and Buddha&quot;.<SUP>2</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question whether <I>nirvana </I>meant <I>sunya </I>(emptiness) or <I>vijnana </I>(consciousness) the Mahayanists were divided. The exponents of the <I>Yogachara </I>were not prepared to believe that all the efforts of sentient beings should only end in <I>sunya </I>or nothing. They, with their chief Maitreyanatha, held that even in <I>sunya, vijnana </I>or consciousness remained; hence they were also called <I>Vijnanavadins. </I>The <I>Madhyamikas </I>were of opinion that <I>sunya </I>did not mean void or emptiness but only meant &quot;a transcendental state (not annihilation), about which neither existence, nor non-existence, nor a combination of the two, nor a negation of the two, can be predicated.&quot; <SUP>3</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire iconography of the Buddhists proceeds from a correct understanding of the doctrine of <I>Sunya. </I>The creation of <I>Vajrayana, viz., </I>the various forms of gods in union with their <I>Saktis, </I>or as the Tibetans describe it, in <I>Yab-yum, </I>was an outcome of the dual conceptions of <I>Sunya </I>and <I>Karuna </I>or compassion, ‘both of which were conceived and represented, but which ultimately proved to be one and the same’. As Buddhism was intended to become a mass religion it was too much for the propounders of the <I>Mahayana </I>to expect the mass to understand the philosophical import of <I>Prajna </I>or Dharma, <I>Upaya </I>or Buddha and <I>Nirvana. </I>To drive home their significance these ideas were reduced to the form of icons of worship. And to <I>Prajna, </I>which was treated as one of the <I>paramitas </I>or perfections that a Bodhisattva must needs practise, the term <I>paramita </I>was tacked on, the whole standing for ‘Perfection of Wisdom’ or ‘Divine Wisdom’ and representing the <I>summum bonum </I>of Buddhist philosophy. And the legend grew that <I>Prainaparamita </I>is the embodiment of the scripture of <I>Bodhisattvayana, </I>another name for <I>Mahayana, </I>that this scripture was also known as <I>Prainaparamita, </I>that it was first dictated by the Buddha himself and committed to the care of the Nagas in the nether regions, as in his time men had not attained sufficient wisdom to comprehend the doctrines embodied in it, and, that when the time was ripe, Nagarjuna restored it from the nether regions in the second century A. D. This Book of ‘Transcendental knowledge,’ this <I>Prainaparamita, </I>became an object of worship among the Mahayanists particularly, and became the standard work of the two main sects of the <I>Mahayana, </I>the <I>Sunyavadins </I>and the <I>Vijnanavadins. </I>That of the <I>Sunyavadins </I>was divided into 32 chapters and was called <I>Ashtasahasrika Prainaparamita</I>; and the same work as modified by the ideas of Maitreyanatha became the <I>Panchavimsatisahasrika Prajnaparamita </I>(divided into 8 chapters) of the <I>Vijnanavadins.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before describing the iconography of this Prajnaparamita, we shall examine the philosophical and metaphysical significance of the term, as such an examination is apt to lead to a correct understanding of the former <I>(i.e., </I>iconography). The term can be divided into <I>prajna </I>and <I>paramita. </I>A Bodhisattva must practise six or ten <I>paramitas </I>(perfections). The term <I>paramita </I>is derived from <I>parama </I>and as such means ‘highest condition, point or state, perfection,’ complete attainment, transcendental virtue. &quot;The <I>paramitas </I>are so called, because they are acquired during a long period of time <I>(pardmena kalena samudagatah) </I>and are supremely pure in their nature. They also transcend the virtues or qualities of the <I>Sravakas </I>and the <I>Pratyeka-Buddhas </I>and lead to the highest result <I>(paramam cha phalam anuprayachchhanti) </I><SUP>4</SUP>. The <I>paramitas </I>are extolled to the skies in Buddhist literature as ‘a Bodhisattva's best friends,’ ‘the Teacher, the Way and the Light, ‘the Father and Mother to all,’ even the Buddhas being their children, ‘sublime, disinterested, supremely important and imperishable,’ ‘lead to welfare, happy rebirths–successful concentration and the highest Knowledge.<SUP>5 </SUP>Greatest importance is attached to the <I>paramitas </I>because they tend to distinguish the Bodhisattvas from the inferior <I>Arhats </I>and the <I>Pratyeka-Buddhas </I>who are regarded as representing merely negative ethical ideals, while the Bodhisattvas attain a high state of positive moral development with the aid of these <I>paramitas. </I>The <I>paramitas </I>were not new, but the new method of juxtaposition was the work of <I>Mahayana, </I>as it was felt that the 37 <I>bodhi-pakshya-dharmas </I>of <I>Hinayana </I>were ‘too monastic and anti-social in their scope and tendency.’ The practice of these <I>paramitas </I>is of the highest degree when they are acquired by the Bodhisattvas for the liberation of all beings. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Six <I>paramitas </I>alone were considered to be the chief ones as being the primary factors in a Bodhisattva's discipline, while four more were occasionally added to them as being merely supplementary in nature. While six of these alone are mentioned and discussed in almost all works on Buddhism in Sanskrit, the four additional ones are mentioned only in a few passages without being explained in detail. The six <I>paramitas </I>are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. <I>Dana-paramita, </I>(liberality, generosity), 2. <I>Sila-paramita </I>(morality), 3. <I>Kshanti-paramita </I>(patience, forbearance), 4. <I>Virya-paramita </I>(energy), 5. <I>Dhyana-paramita </I>(rapt musing), 6. <I>Prajna-paramita </I>(the perfection of Wisdom). The four supplementary <I>paramitas </I>are: 7. <I>Upaya </I>or <I>Upaya-kausalya </I>(skill in the choice or adaptation of means for succour), <I>Pranidhana </I>(aspiration or resolution), 9. <I>Bala </I>(strength), <I>10. Jnana </I>(knowledge). </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>Madhyamikas </I>declare that the <I>Prajna-paramita </I>‘is the mother of all the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas,’ ‘is greater than all the other <I>paramitas </I>as the moon is greater than the stars’ and that all other <I>paramitas </I>should be transmuted into it as it includes them all. In short, they declare that ‘the other <I>paramitas, </I>without <I>prajna, </I>lead to the lower stage of the <I>Hinayana, </I>while this <I>prajna-paramita </I>is the essence of the <I>Mahayana </I>and is even sufficient by itself without the other Perfections’ and that it ‘produces, maintains and promotes them all.<SUP>6</SUP> It is equated with <I>Sunyata </I>(void), a term which they explain in two ways, as ‘Conditioned Existence’ and as ‘Non-existence’. They invoke it as if it were a substitute for the <I>Triratna, </I>the Dharma, the Buddha and the Sangha, and reply to it the epithets, <I>arya </I>(noble) and <I>bhagavati </I>(worshipful). The <I>Vijnanavadins </I>on the other hand explain it in a positive manner as ‘the knowledge of the supreme Good or the supreme Truth’ or simply as ‘Knowledge’ and identify <I>praina </I>with perfect knowledge, regarding it as ‘insight into Reality <I>(tathata).</I><SUP>7</SUP><I> </I>Both are agreed in saying that <I>prajna </I>is the source of a Bodhisattva's moral strength, who after acquiring it, is not attached to anything and is perfect and flawless in character. &quot;He loves rapt Musing, and cannot be shaken or conquered by the hosts of Mara. . . He is animated by deep and great Love and Mercy (<I>adhimatra-karuna). </I>He acquires all the <I>dhyanas, samadhis </I>(modes of concentration) and <I>samapattis </I>(Attainments) of a Buddha&quot;.<SUP>8</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crowning achievement of Indian art is indeed the spiritual creation of Sarasvati–Divine Wisdom–or <I>Prajnaparamita, </I>her Buddhist counterpart, as a concrete expression or material manifestation of the power of the Spirit–its virtue or <I>Sakti. </I>This <I>Sakti </I>is more often contemplated as the consort of the <I>Adi-Buddha </I>and as the Mother of the Universe who acts in unison with <I>Adi-Buddha </I>and becomes an abstraction of nature's manifestations &quot;as well as the progenitor of all the Tathagatas and the mother of all the Bodhisattvas, <I>Pratyeka-Buddhas </I>and Disciples.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who is <I>Adi-Buddha? </I>He is a creation of <I>Vajrayana, </I>the Primordial Buddha from whom even the five <I>Dhyani Buddhas </I><SUP>9</SUP><I> </I>are said to have taken their origin. When represented in human form <I>Adi-Buddha </I>is called Vajradhara and is conceived in two forms single and <I>yab-yum. </I>When represented in <I>yab-yum, </I>he should be embraced in <I>yab-yum </I>by his <I>Sakti, </I>whose name is <I>Prajnaparamita </I><SUP>10</SUP><I> </I>and who besides being richly decorated with all ornaments should hold the <I>kartri </I>in the right hand and the <I>kapala </I>in the left. The conception of <I>Adi-Buddha </I>originated at the Nalanda monastery in the beginning of the 10th century A. D., while there is no mention of the five <I>Dhyani Buddhas </I>in the <I>Mahayana </I>literature prior to the time of Indrabhuti (700-750 A.D.). But however, as Havell has pointed out, the conception of <I>Prajnaparamita, </I>as the <I>Logos </I>or &quot;Divine Wisdom&quot; is much older. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The worship of <I>Prajnaparamita </I>was so popular that Asanga of the sixth century composed a <I>sadhana </I>for her worship that could confer on her devotees wisdom. Owing to her antiquity, she could not be assigned to any particular <I>Dhyani Buddha </I>like the other deities, as the conception of the <I>Dhyani Buddhas </I>itself was not in existence when Nagarjuna brought the <I>Prajnaparamita </I>scripture from the nether regions. The <I>Sadhanamala </I>contains nine <I>sadhanas </I>relating to her worship, two of which assign her to the cult of Akshobhya, one of the <I>Dhyani Buddhas. </I>As an emanation from a combination of the five <I>Dhyani Buddhas, </I>she is ranked with Kuru-kulla, Sitatara and Vajratara. She is of golden colour and bears the images of the five <I>Dhyani Buddhas </I>on her crown. Her hands exhibit the <I>Dharmachakra mudra </I>while from under her right and left armpits issue two lotuses bearing the <I>Prajnaparamita </I>book. A stone image in the Indian Museum<SUP>11</SUP> answers this variety.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have now to deal with <I>Prajnaparamita </I>as an emanation of Akshobhya from whom eleven goddesses, most of them fierce in nature, emanate. <I>Prajnaparamita </I>is however one of his peaceful forms, and two <I>sadhanas </I>relate to two of her varieties, one white <I>(sita) </I>and the other yellow <I>(pita), </I>the former called <I>Sitaprajnaparamita </I>and the latter <I>Pitaprainaparamita. Sitaprajnaparamita </I>is two-armed, bears the effigy of Akshobhya on the crown, sits in the <I>vajraparyanka </I>pose <I>(asana) </I>on a white lotus, with a red lotus in her right hand and the <I>Prainaparamita </I>scripture in her left. She is white in colour, should be decorated with all sorts of ornaments and should have a beautiful appearance. Much similar to this variety is the other, <I>Pitaprajnaparamita, </I>who is, however, yellow in colour and displays the <I>vyakhyana </I>pose (exposition) in her two hands while on a lotus to her left rests the scripture <I>Prajnaparamita.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all the images of <I>Prajnaparamita </I>we have singled out one, easily the best (<A HREF="Frontispiecenov1931.htm">frontispiece</A>), for reproduction here as it is the most exquisite specimen of the Indo-Javanese school of sculpture answering well the description of <I>Pitaprajnaparamita </I>given above.<SUP>12 </SUP>This statuette which has gone down as ‘the masterpiece of Buddhistic sculpture from Java’ was found in a wood near Malang and in the neighbourhood of Singasari, East Java, as early as 1819 A. D.<I> </I>and is now exhibited, we are told, in the Leiden Museum. Seated in a state of complete abstraction on a lotus flower, the symbol of purity and divine birth, in the fixed pose of a <I>yogini, </I>the goddess performs with her hands the divine <I>mudra </I>or sign of spiritual instruction, while her charming face has &quot;that ineffable expression of heavenly grace which Giovanni Bellini, above all other Italian masters, gave to his Madonnas. <SUP>13</SUP> The head-dress, ornaments and dress, with which the goddess is provided are exquisitely and elaborately worked. The scripture is placed on a lotus flower to her left, the stalk of which is twined round her left arm. Judged from any standard, we have no hesitation in acclaiming with Havell that this wonderful specimen is &quot;worthy to rank as one of the most spiritual creations of any art, Eastern or Western,&quot;<SUP> 14</SUP> though Gangoly and Coomaraswamy dismiss it as ‘somewhat weak and superficially attractive’ <SUP>15</SUP> and superficially lovely and exquisitely ornamented but without vitality.’ <SUP>16</P>
</SUP><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the date of this sculpture Havell had conjectured rightly in 1908, judging from the style of its execution, that it must, belong to the later period of Buddhist art in Java, for it follows in the main the classic ‘Indian style of Central Java’. Today we have so much research done on the history of Java by Dutch scholars and Indian scholars such as Dr. B. R. Chatterji and Mr. Gangoly that we are able to date this statuette almost precisely. The history of Java is gleaned from two <I>Kavi </I>chronicles, the <I>Nagara Kretagama </I>and the <I>Pararaton </I>which cover the Singasari (1280-1292 A.D.) and the Majapahit (1294-1478 A.D.) periods in the history of East Java. The former stops with 1365 A.D. while the later goes on till 1478 A.D., up to the end of the Hindu period of Javanese history. According to the <I>Pararaton, </I>Ken Arok, the ancestor of the Singasari and Majapahit lines, was a son of Brahma, an <I>avatar </I>of Vishnu and a relation of Siva, and was guilty of heinous crimes, such as theft murder, etc. A Brahmin from India came to know from supernatural sources that Vishnu had incarnated himself in Java in the person of Ken Arok. He came to Java and entered the service of Ken Arok whom he helped easily to get into the service of the Singasari prince who was himself a feudal of Kediri. &quot;Then he (Ken Arok) falls in love with the wife of the prince, Dedes, the most beautiful woman in Java, of whom had been foretold that her husband would be a Chakravarti (monarch). After a series of disreputable adventures, the Kediri prince is disposed of by means of a dagger which is destined to prove fatal to Ken Arok and his descendants down to the 7th generation. Ken Arok ascended the throne of Singasari in 1220, and married Queen Dedes. He assumed the title of <I>Rajasa Sang Amurvabhumi </I>and had succeeded in consolidating his conquests before he was murdered in 1227.&quot;<SUP> 17</SUP> Our image is ascribed to his reign (1220-27 A.D.) and is believed to represent the features of his queen Dedes who furnished the model.</P>

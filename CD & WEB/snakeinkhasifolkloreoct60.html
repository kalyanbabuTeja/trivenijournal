amongst humans is as old as the hills: When some evils struck, the search for a
remedy was on. Some myth was then built up to calm the simple folk. In this
respect, the Khasis of Assam are no exception. <span class=SpellE>Bivar</span>,
an authority on the Khasis, has given one of the best definitions of Khasi
religion, “as forms used to cure diseases and to avert misfortunes, by
ascertaining the name of the demon, as the author of the evil, and the kind of
sacrifice necessary to appease it.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Khasis worship both good and evil spirits. They also worship their ancestors
whom they appease by performing special ceremonies. They believe that there is
existence after death, and that, after funeral ceremonies have been observed,
the spirits of the dead live in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">garden</st1:PlaceType>

Khasis have many supernatural beings in their folk-lore. One of them is U <span

human sacrifice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a cave near <span class=SpellE>Cherrapunji</span>, so goes the tale, there once
lived a huge snake or <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>, which created great
havoc among men and animals. None ventured to go near the cave fear of being
devoured by the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>. <span class=GramE>But one
youth, braver than the others, cautiously entered the cave with a herd of
goats, which he offered to the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> one by one.</span>
Soon the snake became so friendly that, at a word from the youth, it began to
open its mouth to receive lumps of flesh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

confidence thus established, the youth following the advice of the god, U <span
class=SpellE>Suidboh</span> (who, according to belief, lives in a grove near <span
class=SpellE>Sohrarim</span>) heated a lump of iron red-hot in a furnace.
Making the monster open its mouth at his usual signal, the youth threw in the
red-hot iron, and killed it. Cutting the monster’s body into small pieces, the
brave youth sent them in every direction with orders for the people to eat
them. Wherever these orders were obeyed, the country was freed of the <span
class=SpellE>thlen</span>. However, it is said, one small piece remained
uneaten. From it arose many more <span class=SpellE>thlens</span> to infest the
residents of <span class=SpellE>Cherra</span> and its environments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
a <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> began to live in a family, there was no means
of getting rid of it, although it is said that occasionally it left of its own
accord. Often it followed family property, given away or sold. The reason was
that the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> attached itself to the property,
bringing prosperity and wealth to the owners on condition that it was supplied
with blood. Its craving came on at uncertain intervals. Then there was illness
or increasing poverty of the family owning the property. It could only be
appeased by human sacrifice, and, since no human killed himself for it, a
murder had perhaps to be committed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
setting out on his unholy mission, the murderer prepared himself by drinking “<span
class=SpellE>ka’iad</span> tang-shi-<span class=SpellE>snem</span>” (liquor
kept for a year), which was thought to give him courage and power of selecting
a suitable victim for the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>. He had to provide
himself with “<span class=SpellE>u’khaw</span> <span class=SpellE>tyn</span> <span
class=SpellE>dep</span>” (rice mixed with turmeric after certain incantations
had been sung), a pair of silver scissors, a silver lancet to pierce the inside
of the nostrils of the victim, and a small bamboo cylinder to receive the blood
drawn there-from. He had to arm himself with a short club for killing he
victim, hence his name “<span class=SpellE>nongshonoh</span>” (one who beats),
for it was taboo to slay a victim on such occasions with an iron weapon,
because iron had proved fatal to the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>nongshonoh</span> made it a point to catch his victim
unawares, and threw a little rice over the latter. This was supposed to stupefy
he victim, who then fell an easy prey to the murderer. After the killing, the <span
class=SpellE>nongshonoh</span> cut off the tips of the hair of the deceased
with the silver scissors, and also the finger nails. He then extracted from the
nostrils of the victim some blood, which he put into the bamboo cylinder. He
took them home and offered them to the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
it was not always possible to kill a victim outright, the murderer resorted to
other ways to appease the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>. He cut off a little
of the hair or the hem of the garment of the victim, which he offered to the
monster. The effect of this was considered to be disastrous to the victim, who
eventually died after becoming ill. The <span class=SpellE>songshonoh</span>
sometimes contented <span class=GramE>himself</span> with merely throwing
stones at the victim or knocking at the door of the latter’s house at night,
after which he returned home. He would then inform the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>
that he had tried his best for a human sacrifice, but had been unsuccessful.
This was supposed to appease the snake-god for a while. Soon the <span
class=SpellE>thlen</span> would manifest its displeasure for the failure to
supply it with human blood by inflicting sickness on one of the family of its
keeper. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> was said to have
the power of reducing itself thin as thread, thus rendering it convenient for
its keeper, called “<span class=SpellE>nong-ri</span> <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>”,
to secure it in an earthen pot or in a basket kept in a safe place. When the
selected hour, usually at dead of night, struck for offering a sacrifice to the
<span class=SpellE>thlen</span>, the keeper would spread costly clothes on the
floor of his house. <span class=GramE>keeping</span> all the doors open. He
would then lay a brass plate on the ground, in which he placed the blood or the
hair or a piece of cloth of the victim.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the family had gathered round, an elderly member began to beat a small drum,
invoking the snake-god by chanting, “Oh maternal uncle, father, come out, here
is some food for you. We have done all we could to satisfy you, and now we have
been successful. Give us thy blessing, that we may attain health and
prosperity.” The <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> then crawled out from its
hiding place, after which it expanded to its full size and approached the
plate, where it remained expectant. The victim’s spirit then appeared, standing
on the plate, laughing. Beginning at the feet, the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>
gradually swallowed the figure, immediately after which the victim died. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the Khasi Hills, known or even suspected to be <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>-keepers,
were dreaded. The superstition was so deeply rooted amongst the Khasis that,
until recent times, in <span class=SpellE>Cherrapunji</span>, and even in
places in and around Shillong, the Khasis dared not venture out alone after
dark, for fear of being attacked by a <span class=SpellE>nongshonoh</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

money, ornaments and property of that house or family must be thrown away”, as
in the case with persons possessed by the demon, ‘ka <span class=SpellE>Taroh</span>’,
in the <span class=SpellE>Jaintia</span> Hills. None dared touch any of the
property for fear that the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> would follow it.
Since it was commonly believed that a <span class=SpellE>thlen</span> could
never enter the <span class=SpellE>Siem’s</span> clan or his house, the <span

is a story dating some sixty years ago. A <span class=SpellE>Mohammeden</span>
domestic in Shillong once fell victim to the charms of a pretty Khasi maiden,
and proceeded to live with her. Soon he learnt that his mother-in-law kept a
devil in the house. Although he asked his Khasi wife many times to allow him to
see the devil, she evaded an answer. After a long time, however, and extracting
from the Mohammedan a solemn promise not to divulge the secret to anyone, she
took him to a corner of the house, where she showed him a little box in which
there was a tiny snake, thin as the spring of a watch. When she passed her
hands, over it, the snake grew until it became a huge cobra with, hood erect.
The Mohammedan was scared almost to death. He begged his wife to lay the
spirit. She then passed her hands down the monster’s body which eventually
shrank to a tiny size. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Nongkhrem</span> and <span class=SpellE>Mylliem</span> <span
class=SpellE>Siemships</span>, until recent time regarded the <span

mention the names of the <span class=SpellE>thlen</span>-keepers for fear that
evil might befall them. Snake-worship had an ancient origin not only in East
Asia, but also in adjacent territory, where the serpent race or <span

had long been held in superstitious reverence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

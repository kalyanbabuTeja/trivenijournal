an old striped bag in her hand, and leaning confidently on a knotted stick that
looked as if it was wriggling with some intense pain, the Black Grandma came
out of the cheap grain shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Old age had made her almost transparent, and her
lean twiglike hands trembled eternally. She had to use extra strength to drag
her feet as if they suddenly became laden when thus moved. She put one foot
almost touching the other, and even then after every ten steps, she stopped for
breath. Her thick lower lip always quivered which gave the impression that she
was talking to herself. Perhaps often she did talk to herself, remembering
something of the past, trying to touch one shadow out of a vast crowd gliding
silently through grey mist. But because of this, the little girls in that
school at the corner pointed at her with glee and mischievously called her mad
grandma.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For the last so many years, there was not the
slighest change in her dress–the same dark blue socks with innumerable holes, a
frock that had all but lost its cheap black colour, and on that something that
looked like a jacket but was so loose that it almost became a short overcoat.
The man who kept the restaurant near the school swore that he was seeing that
dress since he opened his restaurant and that was saying a lot. Her battered
hat looked like an abandoned nest and tried pathetically to cover her thin
flaxen hair.</p>

was a time when the restaurant man saw her only once a week–on Sundays,
crawling towards the white little church among a few drooping trees. But since
the war started–she did not know where–she, could be seen twice a week dragging
her slightly swollen feet towards the cheap grain shop. When the sun was yet
young and yellow, and shadows stretched gracefully long on the wet grass, she
could be seen walking on the extreme right of the road. After some time, she
returned with her weekly ration of rice in the striped bag, her only demand on
an indifferent world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

two or three weeks back, Domingo Fernandez closed for good his stationery and
grain shop. Till then Grandma rarely bought anything outside. But now, Domingo
told her, there was yet another war. “How many wars these men fight, I do not
know!” she said to herself in her </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

have nothing, Grandma,” said Domingo, shrugging his shoulders, “I must close my
shop. I have absolutely nothing here. I have not sufficient rice to feed a
sparrow. Kerosene? Don’t talk of it. I am using old moth-eaten candles which I
would not have even thrown at that dog there. I tell you Grandma, this war is
terrible.” He waited for a moment as if he wanted to deliberate before he
delivered his final judgment about that war, shook his head and said, “Simply
terrible!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heaved a sigh and returned. She did not know how she was going to get any rice
at all. But she was afraid to ask Domingo about it. The next day Domingo came
and flourished before her a long red card.” Here Grandma, you can take this
coupon to the cheap grain; A shop near the school, and you will get
rice–perhaps a little wheat flour too!” he said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was really glad. Her frozen, glass-like eyes lighted a little. You merely show
that coupon, and you get rice and wheat flour! Now she could save some money
and in good time too! The money in the small sandalwood box was slowly
disappearing, and she was always afraid that it would not last till the last
day of her life. Like an ailing person who thinks the night choking and
eternal, she thought that her dead dry life also stretched unendingly. She was
utterly tired of it; but it would never snap, not even through sheer time’s
decay. But now God sent that coupon, and you had merely to show it to get rice
and a little wheat flour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that; you show the coupon and also pay,” he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cheap grain shop gave rice and wheat flour on Fridays. On these days she got up
earlier than usual. She dressed without hurry for, she was afraid that those
flimsy threadbare clothes would give way if roughly handled. Usually she took
half an hour to dress, but on these days, she dressed even more carefully. She
liked to dress like respectable persons. She would have died of sheer shame if
somebody had turned his head to have a second look at her dress. She wanted to
live also like respectable persons, without attracting anybody’s attention.
Then she took the striped bag and started. Many houses in the lane were yet
closed and looked sleepy. But then it was not necessary for those people to get
up early. They came after her, and returned before she even reached the shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Leaning on the stick she walked on. Colossal
military cars roared past her. Her heart thumped so much that she often laid
her hand on it, as she hurriedly moved almost in the gutter, till those
monsters disappeared in a blaze of red dust. Slowly the dust settled down. She
gave a gentle shake to her clothes, and moved on. Often the road was full with
insolent looking buffaloes with long pointed horns, and her heart became as
small as a sparrow as she threaded her way through them. But all the time, only
one thing existed for her–that cheap grain shop. She always feared that the
shop would close before she reached it. Many people stood in a long queue
before it, often fretting at the delay. Grandma patiently stood at the end,
clutching the bag and mechanically moved one place till she reached the
counter. But her knees ached, and she wanted to lie down. She always heaved a
sigh of relief when she got her quota of rice and smiled gratefully at the man.
But he was always very busy and never even looked at her. On her way back, she
was happier. There was no necessity to hurry to the shop. She moved slowly,
looking here and there. Every week, she saw the same pieces of life scattered
about her.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
a little distance from the shop, there was that Girls’ School. Whenever she was
passing by it, she always saw a few girls on the play-ground, running, and
jumping wildly. When they saw her, some came near the fence and shouted: “Mad
Grandma! Black Grandma!” Grandma looked up vacantly, almost unaware of their
existence, and walked on, as if such painful moments were all dead, lying
across her life, like dead beetles on the road. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
near the school on the left side, there was a very beautiful bungalow, all
surrounded by slender trees standing like tall proud maidens. When the breeze
moved, the rustling sound among the leaves slowly came down filtering through
the branches. There was a red gravel path which mysteriously disappeared at the
very first turning. The bungalow was always unbearably quiet. She never saw
anybody picking those gorgeous flowers nor moving on the parrot-green lawn. Yet
the whole picture was perfect–those graceful trees that always quivered with
some strange ecstasy, the garden almost burning with colour, and the grass that
looked so green that one was almost certain that the fingers would become green
if they touched it. Everything seemed to be patiently waiting for something to
happen, for somebody to appear...outside the fence. Sometimes she saw a few
girls collecting fuel, twigs that were dropped down by the giant trees, perhaps
out of sympathy for those tiny creatures below....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>On the right at some distance, could be seen the
railway station and a few goods wagons that were always there. On the lane that
wound towards the station, there was an avenue of trees, a long green chain
which was suddenly broken by one stray Gulmohor tree. If there was any strong
wind on the previous day, the lane was strewn with green leaves, and the space
below the Gulmohor tree was red with petals. The purple gold patch in the
ribbon like green lane looked like embroidery on a piece of green silk.</p>

from those railway quarters came out young girls, supple and very proud of
their youth. Grandma always felt an exquisite pang whenever she saw them moving
gracefully in high-heeled shoes. She remembered her Rosemary. She also would
have been of the same age, would have walked with the same young pride and
grace. She would have even laughed the same full warm smile for no apparent
reason at all.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
this, however, her journey was quite bleak. On both the sides only waste land
stretched and before her went on the endless red road. Many pointed stones
jutted in the middle of the road, but the sides were covered with soft dust. A
strange thought often teased her like a fly. When she was gone, the footprints
would tell, at least for a few minutes, that she had passed that way. But there
was nobody left in the world to tell that, she had lived there for many
indifferent years, had her full share of misery, and perhaps of happiness too–!
She had not left any footprints in her life which was as drab as the landscape
around her now. There was not a single patch of green that could cool the
burning eyes. There was one memory only; but even that seemed shattered like a
crystal vase. Only a few fragments remained...the memory of her Rosemary....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day she saw the same sights, the same movements. Her life continued without any
change like a log that lies without any hope of sprouting. When she laid her
aching body on the bed, she always prayed that she should not be made to see
another day. The candle in the niche should die when she was still praying, and
she too should close her eyes as the vast darkness closed round her. But the
next day, when the morning sun filled mercilessly her sordid room, she sighed
with utter anguish, took the bucket and went out for water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she had come a little earlier from the cheap grain shop, She came near the

moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

those gay flowers, the lawn were all waiting patiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her clothes would be soiled, and beckoned to the girl. Her lips quivered and
her throat seemed to contract suddenly, crushing the few words that were
struggling to come out. Exactly like Rosemary! It was as if the dark opaque
curtain of so many years was suddenly rent and the past stood before her once
again. It seemed that the eternal flux of time had suddenly stopped, and one
moment out of it stared at her. It was like a monster’s opening one of its
million eyes, paralyzing her with its gaze. Grandma ran her hand on the girl’s soft
hair and looked at her with eyes like two berries that had seen the spring and
were ready to drop down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

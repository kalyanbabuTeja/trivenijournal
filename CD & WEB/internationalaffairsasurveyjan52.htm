<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Middle East in ferment is the key to the current
international situation. Everything else has become secondary to this. This
problem has been engaging the attention of statesmen to a far greater extent
than even the truce talks in Korea, the problem of Germany, federation of
Western Europe, and the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly
which is holding its session in Paris. It will be of some value if at this
stage a few of the salient features of situation in the Middle East are noted
clearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
one speaks of the Middle East it is best to understand that it consists of all
the countries on the coast of Northern Africa from Morocco to Egypt, the
countries in the Eastern Mediterranean including Greece, Turkey, Syria,
Lebanon, Israel and Jordan and Saudi Arabia Iraq and Iran. Excepting Greece all
the other countries in this are Islamic; and except Turkey and Iran all the
other Islamic countries are more or less Arabic, though here and there are to
be found some minorities like the Berbers in Morocco. The major problem of the
Middle East is therefore a problem of the Arabic world. This is not to say that
the non-Arabic countries are less important. They are, as a matter of fact, of
greater importance in certain respects and this applies especially to Greece,
Turkey and Iran. Bordering as they do on Soviet Russia they are, from the
strategic standpoint, of greater significance than the countries further South.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
problem of the Middle East is a highly complicated one. There are various
factors which form part of it and in certain respects there is conflict among
these factors. One feature of the problem is the intensity of national feeling
in the Arab world. It is as intense in Morocco as it is in Egypt. Peoples in
these countries are determined to get rid of foreign rule and of foreign
influence, however small it may appear to be. In Morocco, Tunisia and Algiers
the fight is against the French. In Egypt it is against the British. In Iraq
the anti-British feeling is a little dormant for the present, but it is bound
to come to the surface sooner or later. How strong the anti-British feeling is
in Iran the whole world knows by this time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
French have succeeded in seeing that the subject of their rule in Morocco or
Tunisia is not brought up for discussion in the present session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. But this does not mean that there is nothing to
be discussed. On the other hand the French are terribly afraid of their
intrigues, tactics and highhandedness being exposed to the world and it is this
that is at the back of their unwillingness to have the subject discussed at
all. In a recent look on ‘The Sultan of Morocco’, Mr. Rom Landan, a well-known
author, has described in a most convincing manner the nature of French rule in
Morocco. Any amount of pressure has been brought to bear on the present Sultan,
Sidi Mohammed V, by the French authorities to prevent him from working for the
independence of his country–a cause which he has taken up as his life mission.
But the only result of this pressure is that the leading political organisation
in the country–the Istiqlal–has risen considerably in the estimation of the
public. It is now carrying on the nationalist agitation with redoubled vigour.
All other political parties have now made common cause with it and the rest of
the Arab world is determined to give it all the support that it can. There is
thus a crisis in Morocco which is of a sufficiently serious character and it
does not look as if the French will succeed in resolving it. The difficulties
they are experiencing in Indo-China have to some extent their counterpart in
Morocco, though the world knows less of th</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
situation is equally bad in Tunisia. The political parties in that French
Colony have also planned a kind of joint action to secure self-government. They
are not satisfied with the formation of a Franco-Tunisian State, to be ruled by
the French and the Tunisians as joint partners, which was recently recommended
in a French memorandum. Party leaders are now active in discussing the subject
of their country’s independence with the responsible leaders of the other
countries in the Islamic world and with the Secretary-General of the Arab
League.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Conditions
have not improved in Egypt during the last two months. On the other hand they
have grown worse. Actual war has been going on in the Canal Zone, though
neither party–Egypt or Britain–is anxious to precipitate a real war on a large
scale. The oil crisis in Iran is not nearer solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Observers
of the conditions in the Middle East have drawn attention to several other
factors besides the growing force of nationalism. One is the economic
backwardness of the people. A hundred million people have to be supported in a
region which is mainly a desert. The cultivated area is subject to feudal
landlordism, with all the evils associated with it. There are very few
industries of the modern type. The result is that the standard of life of the
people is low and economic discontent is acute. Till recently the masses were
given to a fatalistic view of life and did not complain very much of their
poverty. Things have however, undergone a great deal of change in the post-war
years. The masses have begun to attribute their poverty to the selfishness of
the owning classes. The Communists have taken advantage of this and they have
been carrying on their propaganda systematically. This has been responsible for
the large amount of political instability that is found throughout the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
course the situation has become more complicated with the establishment of the
State of Israel. The whole Arab world regards it as an intruder. No Arab State
has as yet extended its recognition to it. There has been an armistice between
it and the Arab States which fought against it in 1948-49 and in spite of the
efforts of the U.N. Special Commission, which has been working there for the
last three years, no treaty has become possible. There is still uncertainty
regarding the future of Israel, its boundaries and the status of Jerusalem.
There is also the problem of the thousands of Arab refugees who had to flee
from their homes in Palestine when the Jewish State of Israel was founded.
Until the question of Israel is amicably settled there cannot be real or
permanent peace in the Middle East. It has, therefore, become one of the
complicating factors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are two other features associated with the internal economy of the Middle East.
One is the large amount of misunderstanding existing between State and State
and the mutual suspicion that it has created. Egypt is suspicious of Jordan and
its Greater Syria movement. Saudi Arabia is suspicious of Egypt. This has made
any kind of concerted action among them an impossibility. The Arab League which
was founded in 1945 remains a league like the discredited Leauge of Nations. It
has not become a live force. The other feature is the backwardness of
governments. They are all medieval in their outlook. They continue to be
strangers to any kind of modernisation. To perpetuate their paternalistic
feudal rule is their only objective. This has created a dilemma especially in
the minds of the Americans who are anxious to do something to introduce
conditions of stability thro economic aid. There is no guarantee that any funds
which they may place at the disposal of these governments would be utilised to
modernise agriculture or industry and to improve the economic conditions of the
people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The most important factor responsible for the
complicating situation in the Middle East has now to be noted. It is an area
where the rivalry between the two Power blocs–the Soviet and the
Anglo-American–is most intense. Each is anxious to bring it within its sphere
of influence, and this for two reasons. One reason is strategic in character.
The Middle East is at the meeting place of the three Continents of Europe, Asia
and Africa. Any bloc which secures control over it can prevent the other bloc
from making use of it for obtaining access to these Continents. If, for instance,
Soviet Russia were to establish its control over it, she would gain access to
the Indian Ocean and to the Mediterranean, and she would be in a position to
place obstacles in the way of Britain’s communications with Pakistan, Ceylon,
Malaya, Australia and New Zealand. One of the life-lines of the British
Commonwealth would thus be completely cut off. Naturally the Anglo-American
bloc is anxious that the Middle East should never fall into the grip of Soviet
Russia. The other reason is the vast oil resources that the Middle East
possesses in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other regions; and in this age of oil
the economic reconstruction and the rearmament programmes have to depend for
their efficacy on regular supplies of oil. If today the Anglo-American bloc is
concentrating so much of its attention on formulating a plan for the joint
defence of the Middle East, it is because of considerations like these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the whole question is whether any defence plan can be worked out if it is
opposed by the nations of the Middle East–nations like </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Egypt
and Iraq. Every one realises the utter futility of all schemes of defence to
which these nations are not a party. So the immediate issue is how to get their
co-operation. It is only by treating them as equals, by conceding to them the
full rights of sovereignty and by withdrawing all foreign military troops
stationed in their territories, that this co-operation could be obtained. It
was through the transfer of power into the hands of the people of India and
Pakistan in 1947 that the British have been able to secure their goodwill. If
today relations between Britain and these countries are less bitter and more
friendly, it is due to this complete transfer of power and to the complete
withdrawal of their forces. The same policy has to be adopted by Britain in
respect of the countries of the Middle East, if it is to regain their goodwill
and organise a workable plan of defence. Otherwise she will be aiding the
introduction and spread of Soviet influence–the very thing which she wants to
avert.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
British and the Americans should also realise that the peoples the Middle East,
like the peoples of most of the other countries of Asia, are not enamoured of
democracy and free enterprise about which they know little; and they should
also realise that these peoples cannot expected to dislike or hate Communism
with the same bitterness as the free peoples of the West do. Under these
circumstances they must adopt a different approach to the problems of the
Middle East–different from the approach to those of Western Europe for
instance. They have not as yet discovered this method of approach and every
delay in this connection makes the problem more complicated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is, therefore, no wonder that at his first Press Conference since his return
from the sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations in Paris, Dean
Acheson, the U.S. Secretary of State, said that the Western nations had lost
ground in their efforts to obtain some reasonable solution of the Iranian and
Egyptian crisis and that the situation in the Middle East had grown more
serious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
all the weeks of this growing seriousness of the situation in the Middle East,
the General Assembly of the United Nations was sitting in Paris and carrying on
discussions on a variety of matters, of which the debate on disarmament has
attracted much of the attention of the world. Naturally the public have raised
the question whether the United Nations Organisation is of any value at all and
whether anything would be lost if it were scrapped. The question is natural
because so far the U.N.O. has not done much to remove threats to peace, to
suppress aggression and to establish security and order on an international
level, even though these were the purposes for which it was founded. In many parts
of India people have recently been celebrating the United Nations Day and the
Human Rights Day in spite of such questions being raised. Of course the
instinctive answer would be that nothing would be lost if the U.N.O. is
scrapped. It has now become merely a forum for mutual recrimination and
mud-slinging by the delegates of the two Power blocs. But this does not appear
to be a correct or a healthy answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
more than one point of view it may be asserted that the U.N.O. deserves to
live, and every lover of humanity should strive his best to make it stronger
and more useful. Those who have given serious thought to the subject have shown
that it is only through the Soviet delegates coming into contact with the
Westerners on the platform of the U.N.O.–and that is the only common platform
that they have–that they are being impressed with the superior achievements of
the Western way of life in certain directions and that this makes them think on
right lines. These contacts provide opportunities for lessening to some extent
the friction between the two blocs. Moreover if the West is today more united
and better organised for testing its strength with the Soviet, it is because of
the many lessons it learnt from the discussions in the U.N.O. and its allied agencies.
What is, therefore, needed is not the liquidation of the U.N.O. but the
exploration of devices for making it a really effective instrument for peace
and for the promotion of human welfare. It will be a bad day for humanity if
faith in the only international organisation that it now has is completely
lost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
other question that has come to the forefront is whether the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Conservative
Government of Churchill which was returned to office at </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
October election will result in any re-orientation of British foreign policy.
It does not however look as if there will be any great or violent departure
from the general lines of policy pursued by the Labour Government during the
last six years, the reason being that on all essentials there was a large amount
of agreement between the party in office and the party in opposition. There are
two issues in British foreign policy in regard to which the public are anxious
to know how Mr. Churchill’s Government would react. One is the understanding
with the United States and the other is the British attitude towards what may
be called the West European Federation. It was rumoured that, in respect of the
British rearmament programme, the policy pursued by the Labour Government in
respect of the oil crisis in Iran and the British withdrawal from Egypt, there
were some differences between the two countries. Of Course all these will be
discussed by Mr. Churchill when he meets President Truman in January. It may,
however, be safely asserted that all these differences will h be settled
amicably. It has already been reported that, on the question of Egypt and the
defence of the Middle East, the United States, Britain and France have come to
an agreement, and that whatever policy is adopted it will be a policy based
upon their complete co-operation. On the question of West European Federation
Mr. Churchill’s attitude is not very much different from that of the Labour
Government, although he was the first statesman to suggest the idea of a
Council of Europe. Britain, as the leader of the Commonwealth of Nations with
numerous interests outside Europe, is not prepared to commit herself to
subordinate her policies to the dictates of a European Federal Government. This
was the attitude of Labour and it is also the attitude of Mr. Churchill. The
only point on which he seems to have yielded is in respect of the creation of a
European army of which some of the British forces would be an integrated part.
Mr. Churchill also seems to have agreed in a way to the Schumann plan for coal
and steel. These are important steps in the process of integrating the
democratic countries of Western Europe into a single political unit, so that
when the time comes they may fight Soviet aggression in a really effective
manner. But they are only the first steps. Many more such steps will have to be
taken before Western Europe becomes a single political entity as conceived by
the Federalists in Europe and the United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Korean truce talks have been resumed. There has been a large amount of
agreement between the two parties in regard to the truce line, the Committee to
be appointed to supervise the military forces and to some extent on the
question of prisoners. But all the same there is a great deal of mystery
surrounding the negotiations, and the public have every reason to doubt,
whether the two parties are really anxious to bring about a cease-fire.
Negotiations are being unnecessarily prolonged, new points are being raised and
the final settlement seems to be as far off as ever. A report on December 19 stated
that the United Nations Command hinted renewal of aggressive warfare after
Christmas and accused the Communists of wasting time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

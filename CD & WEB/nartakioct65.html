The picture is more important than the painter. The work of a sculptor is more

more fascinating than the writer himself. Music is sweeter than the <span

the good fortune of the citizens of the town, a famous danseuse was to arrive
in our town. Her proposed visit was widely advertised. Naturally, the lovers of
art looked <span class=GramE>forward</span> to her visit with enthusiasm. The
performance was arranged in a big theatre. Tickets were being sold from even
before the day of the performance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

love art. All my life I have been much attracted to it. But in this unfortunate
<span class=SpellE>Bharat</span>, art has been allowed to deteriorate. Art is
looked down upon. Desire to derive sensuous satisfaction from it has lowered
the position of art. Beauty, instead of providing spiritual satisfaction, has
been made use of to derive sensuous pleasures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

While deploring the degradation of art, one may well declare one's love of the

being the social background, there went on a veritable conflict in my mind as
to whether I should attend the dance performance or not. Dancing is looked upon
as a low profession. Should I venture to go, it would be considered improper by
the so-called patriarchs. Who knows, my own little leadership may be slightly
affected. For entirely selfish motives, I pretended to show indifference
towards art. But at the same time, the fearless self within me kept on asking
“Why be afraid of the world in the enjoyment of life?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

essence of life lies in being true to ourselves. Let the world form its own
opinion. The danseuse does not guide herself by what the world says. She has
identified herself with art; and the whole world is eager to see her. If some
don’t witness the dance, out of fear (of criticism), let them not. I decided to
see the dance. I sent a servant to buy a ticket for me. But the tickets were
already sold out. I was disappointed. But at the same time, I consoled myself
with the thought that my reputation would not now be <span class=SpellE>jeopardised</span>.
In the disappointment of not getting the ticket, I experienced both pleasure
and regret. This duality of the mind is brought about by our own actions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

last, the day of the dance-night arrived. In the evening, friends asked me to
accompany them as they had already purchased a ticket for me. This was like a
meal to the famished. I now decided to join my friends as this meant an
opportunity of fulfilling my real desire without loss of reputation, <span

and I reached the theatre before time. They had reserved seats in the front
row. Our group occupied one whole row. A seat in the first row was sufficient
to wake up a sense of self-importance. A sense of respectability augments one’s
consciousness of life. I looked in front; I looked side-ways and then turned my
head to observe the rear. The theatre was full to its capacity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The moment for the commencement of the dance was
approaching. Those who had watches were repeatedly watching them. Eagerness was
intensifying. There was impatience. Every moment was becoming oppressive. The
clock appeared to move slowly, because in comparison with the speed of mind,
the world moves tardily. All eyes were fixed on the curtain and the ears were
waiting for the third bell. There was commotion amongst the spectators. There
were whistles, cheers and loud shouts. Intense curiosity, variously expressed,
appeared to have reached the climax. I <span class=GramE>glanced</span> all
round and peeped within my own self. In the extreme excitement I experienced
the effects of art. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The third bell rang. The curtain left the earth and
rolled upwards to the sky. The stage was empty. The danseuse was not there.
There was perfect stillness in the theatre. The danseuse entered the stage from
one side very slowly. Our eyes were on her. <span class=GramE>All feelings.</span>
<span class=GramE>and</span> the sense of appreciation of the spectators was
concentrated in their eyes. </p>

danseuse stood in the <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of the stage. She bowed
with a smile. All the spectators observed her in a moment; she also cast a

danseuse was not exceptionally beautiful. The build of her body was also not
very proportionate: round face, short stature; compared with the height, she
was plump. Her dress was ordinary. The spectators did not derive the expected

disappointment was apparent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had not seen the danseuse before, although I had heard about her. I knew of her

mind, <span class=GramE>The</span> dance was so highly praised and yet the

seen. There is a difference between the art and the artist. The beauty of <span

class=SpellE>Ravivarma</span>. Then why should I insist that the danseuse

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In a moment the prevailing tranquility was
disturbed. Sweet, slow music began to play. The danseuse struck the stage with
the left foot. She began to move. The hand moved. Fingers moved. The right,
foot was lifted. The body began to move. Her motion began to increase. Every part
of the danseuse’s body was now in motion. As the speed of the dancing
increased, the nature of the dance was being revealed. In the revelation of the
dance, the danseuse was becoming invisible. </p>

foot or the dress. Everything was unsteady, moving. In her motion, she lost her
tangible form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

delight could not be contained in their hearts. It burst out, <span

the dance of the universe, one would not be able to see the danseuse. If one
wishes to see the danseuse, one would have to forget the dance. Moving danseuse
is the dance and motionless dance id danseuse. In the dance there are both
danseuse and motion. In the dance of the universe, like the danseuse, the original
energy also dances. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am a tiny moving particle of this universal dance.
If the dance ends, I would also end. So I can see only the dance of the
universe. I am unable to see the danseuse; and what would I get by looking at
the danseuse? Possibly the beauty of the dance would not be found in the
danseuse. One enjoys the pleasure of the art and tastes happiness only when the
immovability of the danseuse takes motion. </p>

happiness lies in the observation of the dance of the universe. This is the
essence and the ultimate end of human life. One should observe the danseuse
behind the dance in her every pose and posture and then enjoy to the heart’s
content the joy derived from it. In the dance, the danseuse is ever present,
but, in the danseuse the dance is invisible. <span class=GramE>Visible dance
and the inferential danseuse.</span> This is the real vision of the universe.</span><span

bell rang. The curtain went up. The danseuse came. Thoughts became transformed

the world of realities. I began to enjoy the new dance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

attraction lies the power of inspiration. Inspiration gives to imitation. It
came to my mind, ‘I can also assume motion. Then why should not I dance? Why
should not my life be as attractive and beautiful as this?’ My own thoughts
gave me the reply: “You have motion, no doubt, but, your motion lacks the
quality and the arrangement of the art of dance. Systematic motion possessing
the necessary qualities is creative art. That possesses the power of
attraction. If one wishes to make one’s own life attractive, he must possess
the requisite merit and must learn how to regulate his actions. Then and then
alone, there shall be life’s real dance.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

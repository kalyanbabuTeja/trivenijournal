the galaxy of Indian writers of English–including Toru Dutt, Sarojini Naidu,
Harindranath Chattopadhyaya and Ferdoon Kabraji–Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy
holds a unique place. Tagore opened the soul of India to the West by exposing
the poetry of his own individual soul. Gandhiji revealed India to the then
hostile west through the simple beauty and idealism of his own life. Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, and others, have each interpreted their
sphere of activity in a language rich in splendour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the contrary, Ananda Coomaraswamy created nothing. He wrote a little poetry but
not like Tagore or Sarojini Naidu. He propounded no political theories like
Gandhiji or Rajaji or Nehru. He was no great mathematician or scientific
genius. Ananda Coomaraswamy created nothing, but interpreted almost everything–Oriental
art, religion, philosophy, metaphysics, iconography, Indian literature and
arts, music, the place of art in society. And to be an interpreter of India to
the West, Coomaraswamy was uniquely endowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the son of an Indian father (Ceylon Tamil), Ananda Coomaraswamy had sufficient
emotional identity with India to view it with sympathy and understanding, and
being also the son of an English mother and having had the benefit of years of
Western education, he had the command over language and control over expression
needed to be an effective exponent of his understand­ing to others. As Gai
Eaton in his book <i>The Richest Vein </i>(London: Faber and Faber, 1949, p.
200) declares “Out of place nowhere, at home everywhere, no one could have been
better fitted by birth and training, to bridge in his own person East and West.”

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Throughout
Ananda Coomaraswamy’s long life, Indian art and philosophy were abiding
preoccupations and Ananda Coomaraswamy brought to the interpretation of these
not only an enquiring and perceptive mind, vivid imagination, and encyclopaedic
store of knowledge from his vast study, but also a rare honesty and dedication
to truth. “His method of writing,” to quote Gai Eaton again, “however, is one
that makes considerable demands upon the reader; sometimes the printed page is
a mosaic of quotations, in which Sanskrit and Pali jostle with Greek, Latin,
French, German and Italian. The English language itself is here used with a
precision which, in these days when words are employed so loosely, seems to
belong more to the region of mathematics than to that of prose. Coomaraswamy
splits up certain words which have lost their meanings through long misuse,
with a hyphen between the two parts, to show their true derivation...Further, and
this is a stumbling block not to be underrated in an age when reading is
regarded mainly as a relaxation and an aid to slumber, each of his essays or
articles is followed by several pages of notes, in extremely small print, and
many of his most important reflections are compressed into those notes.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a talk given at the Indian Institute of Culture, Bangalore, some twenty years
ago by Professor N. A. Nikam, M. A. (Cantab), the learned Professor referred to
Ananda Coomaraswamy’s style as terse and allusive; his scholarship in many
languages being unique. His wide references to the literatures of the world –
for example, an essay of sixteen pages requiring twelve pages footnotes and
references – demand not just a review, but an interpretation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

interesting sidelight has been cast upon Coomaraswam contribution to the genre
of reviewing by O. C. Gangooly in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Homage
to Ananda Coomaraswamy </i>(Vol. II. p. 99, edited by S. Durai Raja Singam). He
points out that Coomaraswamy has revealed new methods and manners of reviewing.
Most of his reviews are actually independent articles, supplementing the data
of the original subject under discussion. He readily interjects information unknown
to the author being reviewed. As an example, his Indian architectural terms, a
veritable encyclopaedia of the subject, has grown out of a review of Dr.
Acharya’s books on Indian<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>architecture,
and Coomaraswamy’s supplementary work now stands as an admirable and
indispensable text-book giving a mine of information for all future students of
the subject. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Okakuro Kakuzo’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Book of Tea. </i>It is
also amply evidenced in the particularly remarkable dexterity with which he
quotes from the several Hindu scriptures, the Koran, the Bible, and the Summa

was once a tall, fair woman, not indeed young–no one could have thought that–but
serene to the uttermost and possessed of great patience and grace. In years
past she had been famed for wisdom, and the wise men of the world had sat at
her feet and carried away her teachings to the ends of the earth. But now she
was older, and a little weary, and the light in her eyes served only as a star
for the few who still beheld reality behind appearance. She was, moreover,
wealthy, and many had sought her hand, and of these, one whom she loved least
had possessed her body for many years: and now there came another and stranger
wooer with promises of freedom and peace, and protection for her children: and
she believed in him, and laid her hand in his. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a time it was well, her new lord was contented with the wealth of her
treasure-houses and gave her the peace of neglect. But ere long he took more
interest in his cold bride and her children, and said to himself, “This woman
has strange ways unlike my own and those of my people, and her thoughts are not
my thoughts; but she shall be trained and educated, that she may know what I
know, and that the world may say that I have moulded her mind into the paths of
progress.” For he knew not of her ancient wisdom, and she seemed to him slow of
mind, and lacking in that practical ability on which he prided himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

while these thoughts were passing in his mind, some of her children were roused
against him, by reason of his robbing them of power and interfering with the
rights and laws that regulated their relations to each other; for they feared
that their ancient heritage would pass away forever. But still the mother
dreamed of peace and rest and would not hear the children’s cry, but helped to
subdue their waywardness; and all was quiet again ere long. But the wayward
children loved not their new father and could not understand their mother. And
their new father turned to other ways, and sent the children to schools where
they were taught his language and his thoughts, and how great <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his</i> people were, and self-sacrificing;
and from what unrest and wretchedness he had saved their mother, and with no
thought of gain or profit; and they were taught, too, to forget their ancient
glory and from the height of the new drawing-room finish despise their ancient
manners. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

now another thing happened: the mother bore a child to the foreign lord, and he
was pleased thereat, and deemed that she (for it was a girl) should be a young
woman after his own heart, even as the daughters of his own people, and she should
be fair and wealthy, and a bride for a son of his people. But when this child
was born, the mother was roused from her dream, and lived only for the girl,
and she grew up to remind the mother of her own youth, and favoured the foreign
lord little; yet she had somewhat of his energy and turn for practical affairs.
The mother talked long and deeply with her, and the foreign lord did not take
it aught amiss, for he deemed that all must go even as he, such a great man,
would have it go. And he got teachers, and she was taught the wisdom and
manners of his people. But in secret the mother taught her the ancient wisdom,
and her heart was turned away from her father and his people and his teaching.
And the mother was content, and now she was white- haired and weak with age,
and a time came when she passed hence, for her work was done. And the foreign
lord scarcely missed his bride, for the girl was strangely like her, and some
instinct taught her to show little of her lack of love as yet; and she took the
mother’s place. So life went on for many years, until the foreign lord himself
grew a little weary, for there were troubles in his own land, and some had said
that he was a tyrant in a foreign land; and thereby his heart was pained, for
had he not spent his life for others, and surely the labourer was worthy of his
hire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the girl grew strong, and would brook little of her father’s tyranny, and she
was a mother to the children of the children who came before her, and she was
called the mother by all; and perhaps she and her mother were after all the
same. One day there arose murmurings amongst the children as of old, and they
said that they needed no foreign lord to take their revenues and school their
minds. Still they were subdued with<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>a
high hand and some were cast in prison, or worse, for the father was a patriarch
of the old type and deemed it amiss that he had not the power of life and death
over all his subject people. But now they would not brook his tyranny–for he
himself had taught them that the king-days were over, and made them dream of freedom,
though he was sorry now he had done it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

days is not a long time to spend in Orissa; but it is time enough to see much.
Puri consists of an old town with one broad procession road and many smaller
streets surrounding the great temple; and a new and very English suburb on the
shore. There is a rather amusing contrast between this seaside watering place
with its nursemaids and babies on the sands, and the old religious city of the
Lord of the World (Jagannatha – the “Juggernaut” of Anglo-Indian literature).
Old Puri by all accounts seems to have been a very pestilential and insanitary
place, and pilgrims died in thousands, even if they survived the robbers and
other dangers of a journey through Orissa ... Not the least interesting things
in Puri are the people themselves, the Uriyas. The men are often very beautiful,
sometimes decidedly effeminate; the priests and pandas not very learned or
intelligent. Few of the people speak any language other than Uriya. Bengali is
better known than Hindi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ruined “Black Pagoda,” which stands alone in a great sandy waste, has been
excavated and sufficiently restored to prevent further destruction. The temple
is not only unique as a Sun-temple, but is in itself both architecturally and
in the details of its sculpture, one of the noblest monuments of Indian mediaeval
art. The date of its erection is said to be about A.D. 1250–contemporary with

the least surprising thing at Konarak is the evidence of engineering skill
afforded. How did the builders raise the great stones that crown such buildings
as this? How did they transport the great mass of chlorite on which the forms
of the planets are carved, 80 miles from the nearest hills where this stone is
found, across swamps and rivers, to Konarak? When an attempt was made to transport
this block to Calcutta, it had to be abandoned after moving 200 yards. The
stone is now worshipped and there is an annual mela (a religious festival and
fair) attended by about half a lakh of people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

unimportant, but particularly simple and dignified...Bhuvaneswar itself once
consisted of some 7000 shrines surrounding a sacred lake. There remain now some
500 of these, more or less ruined. Many of the shrines at Bhuvaneswar however
are not to be described as ruined: in particular the great temple built in the
seventh century, “perhaps the finest example of a purely Hindu temple in
India,” is well-preserved...There are in other parts of Bhuvaneswar many
deserted temples well-preserved, nearly all of which have special interest or
beauty of their own...There is much beautiful sculpture well-preserved here,
(again recalling vividly the general character of Gothic) as well as some
excellent modern work where judicious restorations have been made. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pen is an instrument of precision. His closely and tightly woven fabric of
thought is the very model of explicit denotation–a virtue of written expression
that is now-a-days being rediscovered. For this scholar the exegesis of ancient
texts is above all else a scientific pursuit, considered as means to a more abundant
life, he prides himself upon never introducing phrases of his own and never
makes any claims for which he cannot cite chapter and verse. His compact prose
often presents a forbidding mosaic on the printed page, offering nothing in the
way of enticement to slothful contemporary eyes but challenging attention
nonetheless because of his rigorous exactitude, like that of a mathematical demonstration.
Not infrequently matter that would suffice for a whole article is compressed
into a footnote. But even when he is thus writing for scholars, it is certainly
not only for scholars, for he can, as the essays in the present collection

Coomaraswamy is a master of English style and as purely literary productions
alone his writings have a value. None who had not read them can realize their throbbing
beauty of language. A chiselled simplicity, limpid purity, a directness and

Coomaraswamy’s scintillating prose throbs everywhere with a vigour and virility
seldom paralleled even by the masters of English prose. As an art critic of the
first rank, as a cultural ambassador of India’s spiritual heritage, as an
interpreter of the message of the East to the West, as a crusader for art and
Swadeshi (a movement for national autonomy) and as a patriotic son of India
with glowing and intense love for his motherland, he used a scholarly prose
which has rarely been equalled by anyone. He writes a clear and forceful
English with often a psalmic cadence and Oriental love of colour supplemented
by apt allusions and quotations. Ananda Coomaraswamy had a remarkable power of
choosing words with a microscopic examination and arranging them almost as a
jeweller inlays his gold with gems. In fact, his writings baffle our
imagination by the infinite variety of passages quoted from the eternal wisdom
of the past. Who could fully comprehend the essence of his works like <i

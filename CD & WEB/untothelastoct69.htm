<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Saints and savants carry their mission of glory to
their graves’ end. Or would it not be more appropriate to say that their graves
greet them the moment they <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> their missions.
They had all been born for a purpose and lived to work and die for its
achievement. If Gandhi had died six months earlier, he would have been saved
the agony of the vivisection of the country which he intended to resist with
his very life, as indeed he had vowed, and had resisted by a fast unto death
Sir Samuel <span class=SpellE>Hoare’s</span> project of vivisection of the
Hindu community in respect of representation in legislatures. When Ramsay
MacDonald would wrench the <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span> from their faith
and fold and give seventy-one seats, Gandhi gave them twice seventy-one plus
nine or one hundred and fifty-one elected seats altogether, retaining the <span
class=SpellE>Harijans</span> as an integral factor of Hindu society. Even so,
it was anticipated that he would fast unto death to resist the vivisection of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Partition resulted, but Gandhi was not happy. The division was agreed to by the
Congress <span class=GramE>leaders,</span> it was said, with the previous
consent of the leaders in the <st1:place w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place>. The
pogroms of the first week of March 1947 in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Lahore</st1:place></st1:City> must have made such assent possible.
When first the leaders of the <st1:place w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place> assembled
and the Congress leaders supported, Gandhi’s approval determined the issue.
Whether Gandhi revised his own view or submitted to the view of the leaders of
the Congress not, however, through want of <span class=GramE>strength</span> to
resist them, the fact remained and must be remembered that the Partition of
India was not effected without Gandhi’s final concurrence. That he was never
happy over the decision was obvious, nor were the leaders of the Congress happy
over the division which was abhorrent to the whole nation but which was
assented to by it as a <span class=SpellE><i>pis</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>aller</span></i>. Gandhi’s last chapter of history was thus an
exception to the rest of his biography but also furnishes a proof of the regard
and esteem he had for the opinions of his colleagues with the spirit of
co-operation that animated him and his conduct even in mighty crisis. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
in recalling the story of the life of a philosopher and saint, on the occasion
of the anniversary of his cruel death, it <span class=SpellE>behoves</span> the
nation which has been orphaned by his unexpected demise, to survey the salient
chapters of his biography which he himself had appropriately defined as an
Experiment in Truth. Truth was the one aim and object of his life and however
abstract Truth itself may be, in his view it concretized the Godhead to man on
earth. But he never <span class=SpellE>visualised</span> truth or Sat yam
except along with non-violence or Ahimsa, for they represented the obverse and
the reverse of the modal of Divinity. His concept of truth was all-pervading
and all-comprehensive. To him it was not truth or truthful conduct if a person
wrote a harsh letter and called it back, and if the addressee of the letter in
returning it to the writer, kept a copy of it before sending back the original.
That was how there lies in Gandhi’s records no copy of the letter of the
District Magistrate of <span class=SpellE>Champaran</span> to him in 1917 on
the eve of serving him notice under Section 104 and 108, Cr. P. C. For the same
reason the Congress has not in its archives a copy of Home Secretary Emerson’s
letter written in the fourth week of February 1931, breaking the Irwin-Gandhi
negotiations in a spirit of haughtiness and contempt for the Congress. Whenever
he received a complaint about a colleague, he put the matter straight to the
latter and accepted whatever he had to say in explanation. He spoke the truth
and not only took it but acted on the belief that every one of his colleagues
and fellow-workers spoke the truth. With truth as the sword and Ahimsa as the
shield, Gandhi recognized no other weapon than the weapon of love to reclaim
the erring brother or even the vindictive opponent, or to wield authority over
mankind. His goal, in his own words, was friendship with the world and he
proudly declared that he could combine the greatest love with the severest
opposition to wrong. “I refuse to suspect human nature,” he said. “It <span
class=GramE>will</span>, it is bound to, respond to any noble and friendly
action.” “His love does not burn others, but burns itself–suffering joyfully
unto death.” It was the habit of Gandhi’s mind always to call a spade a spade.
That was his upright politics. In his view, to call a spade a crowbar was wild
exaggeration, while to call it a needle was gross underrating. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an attainment. When </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

lives, it makes man no higher than the beast. The tiger has its claws, the lion
its paw, the elephant its tusks, the bull its horns, but man has no offensive
weapon. He has only his tongue which can both offend and defend. “Is this
village good,” asked a <span class=SpellE>traveller</span> of a yokel and got
the reply “If your tongue is good, the village is good.” Where then lies
wisdom? It lies in the Biblical saying “Vengeance is mine” <span class=SpellE>saith</span>
the Lord. The very beasts of the field and the birds of the air, the tiger in
his lair, the lion in his den, the hawk in its nest, the dove in its niche are
happy. Everything is beautiful in the nature. </span><span style='font-size:

world new values, social, economic and political. Accordingly, purity to him is
higher than piety, even as dignity is higher than dress. Nobility is higher
than birth, even as eminence is higher than wealth. Power is more than force,
even as influence is more than authority. Democracy is more than numbers and
justice is more than law. Civilization must transcend tradition, even as
culture outgrows knowledge. Religion is no more of ceremonies than prayers is
of praises. Piety must stand clear of a <span class=SpellE>secticism</span>
even as learning must avoid pedantry. Human nature is not to be spurned or

time we hear it asked Whether Gandhi was not a revivalist. This enquiry is made
with a certain spirit of depreciation though not derision. Gandhi made no
secret of the fact that he built upon <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s past. He did not suggest a
wholesale demolition of tradition and authority on the debris of which to build
his new welfare State. He found that the old mansion built on law and custom,
or to use a single word, Dharma, would still serve his purpose and should
therefore, survive the onslaughts of impact with western civilization. Indeed
he discovered that his father’s house had many such mansions. Only he
rearranged the rooms, the halls and the verandahs of one such mansion. He
believed in the four <span class=SpellE>Varnas</span>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not
indeed to perpetuate them as an ascending order based upon status or a
descending order based upon contract; on the contrary he but sought to evolve a
new synthesis of the four castes, under which service and sacrifice were not to
be imposed upon one set of workers by another set of drones or parasites, but
they were to be regarded as obligations in society voluntarily undertaken and
cheerfully discharged</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

again wealth and prosperity were not to be inherited or accumulated as a
possession but were to be regarded as a trust, in which to sow the seed and
reap the harvest, to spin and weave, to dig and delve, to build and beautify,
were not reckoned as acts of menial service associated with degradation in
society, but as forms of ministration which exalt <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
above authority and want above wealth. The fact was that Gandhi respected the
structure of Hindu society and the constitution of the Hindu home. Thus was it
that he proclaimed himself a farmer and a weaver before his trying Magistrate
in 1922 while all the while, he was the warrior that fought with the British in
a non-violent war and the mentor and monitor of the world preaching truth and
non-violence. Likewise, he combined in himself the four Ashrams of <span
class=SpellE>Sanatan</span> Hindu Dharma. Having studied as a <span
class=SpellE>Brahmachari</span> and then entered life, he presently reverted to
a life of celibacy from his 36th year onwards and devoting himself in the
company of his <span class=SpellE>Dharmapatni</span> to the service of his
motherland, he lived the life of a <span class=SpellE>Sanyasi</span> with no
property or possession over a period of well nigh forty years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was in the ultimate analysis a man, but amongst men he was a superior man and some
would go to the length of describing him as a superman. It<b> </b>is such
supermen whom we term Avatars that descend on earth whenever virtue fails and
sin spreads and Gandhi has been justly termed the tenth of such <span
class=SpellE>Avatan</span>, The Avatars in the past met with a cruel end. Sri
Rama being reputed to have ended his life by drowning himself in the <span
class=SpellE>Sarayu</span> <span class=GramE>river</span>, Sri Krishna believed
to have been shot down by an arrow discharged by a hunter who mistook him in
the jungles of <span class=SpellE>Junagadh</span> for a deer; Christ was <span
class=SpellE>crusified</span> on the cross, while Gandhi fell a prey to an
assassin’s bullet. Thus one Avatar’s life ended in death by suicide, a second’s
ended in death by accident, a third’s through orders of the ruling power and
fourth’s through homicide. In<b> </b>seeking freedom, Gandhi had not been in
search of mere economic security. His was the struggle to construct a new type
of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>society brimming with that emotional and spiritual security
which mere economic security could not give. He had demanded and obtained
liberty for the nation, not that it might secure the right to do what it
chooses, but that it might choose to do what is right. He warned, as Alexander
Hamilton had indeed warned earlier, that “Liberty may be endangered by the
abuses of liberty as well as by the abuses of power” and to one such liberty he
fell a victim, for he gave the liberty to every one to attend his prayers
without being searched or molested and such liberty proved his end. He believed
in the common man, and the common man was the material with which he had made
his experiments in truth. <span class=GramE>To</span> few was it given that
they should witness the world-wide acceptance of their teaching and a
nation-wide allegiance to their philosophy. This was because Gandhi’s appeal
was to the common man. His faith lay in the uncontaminated purity of the
millions of the unsophisticated masses to whom he spoke in the language of
their tradition and custom, their philosophy and religion and whom he uplifted
from the slavery in which they had been wallowing to the freedom which is
theirs today. It is the common man who, through his incessant efforts and
through his sympathetic understanding raises the level of his fellowmen and
works out the greatness and the unity of his nation for the future. That
greatness and that <span class=GramE>unity,</span> had been in the past,
brought about by him who bore the cross as well as by him who faced the cannon.
Thus it is that the race progresses only by the extra achievement of the
individual. It is for <span class=GramE>everyone</span> of us to aspire to be
that individual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an invitation to fresh effort and never becomes infatuated with success.
Humility nurtures the Heaven-aspiring soul and doth not <span class=SpellE>harbour</span>
merely a world-conquering will. Humility forbids <span class=SpellE>wilfulness</span>
which is weakness of will and cultivates the strength that can change one’s own
will. Humility wins where everything fails. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhi’s
ministry of three decades is a standing lesson to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and to the world that pride,
is a passion that obscures vision and obfuscates judgment, for there is no
difference between the intellect whose vision is warped by drink and the
intellect whose judgment is disturbed by anger or pride. When Gandhi began his
public life in <span class=SpellE>Champaran</span>, he in all humility sought
truth and took down six thousand affidavits relating to the sixty-four illegal
taxes collected by European Indigo planters. It is undeniable that exaggeration
is an untruth and, therefore, was abhorrent to Gandhi’s tastes or convictions.
Love of truth creates and keeps alive the consciousness that we are correct to
facts and engenders genuine fear whether we are not overstepping our perception
of it. And this is humility. It was the Duke of Wellington that said “Dear man
and brother it is just possible that you too may be mistaken.” But Gandhi would
always say “It is just possible, dear man and brother, that I too may be
mistaken.” It was this self-restraint in self-appraisement that made Gandhi
verify facts and accept the opponent’s assertion at its face value. The same
balance of view leads to a balance in judgment and makes the <span
class=SpellE>Satyagrahi</span> stretch his hand of co-operation to grasp the
outstretched hand of the enemy in a spirit of adjustment as a step to final
settlement. Gandhi gave the first lessons of such fairness begotten of humility
at <span class=SpellE>Champaran</span> in his struggle with the Indigo planters
(1917) on illegal taxes, at <span class=SpellE>Khaira</span> in his fight with
Government on revenue collections (1918) and at <span class=SpellE>Ahmedabad</span>
in his fast unto death as against the mill-owners on the question of the
increase of wages to <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> (1918). In 1919 he
only wanted a change of heart in Government through an admission of guilt and
an expression of regret over the <span class=SpellE>Jalianwala</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bagh</span> massacre in order to induce in the nation a spirit of
good-will and fellowship towards the rulers. Nor did he demand of Lord Reading
during the visit of the Prince of Wales to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> (1921) a repatriation of the
Prince, but he wanted the right of peaceful </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>picketing of
drink-shops as a point of civil liberty. <span class=SpellE>Swaraj</span> was
there as a demand. The repairing of the <span class=SpellE>Khilafat</span>
wrong was there as a cry for reparation, the apology for <span class=SpellE>Jalianwala</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bagh</span> was there </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as the starting point
of a new era, but all these could be talked over round the table, provided the
right of picketing an evil and a sin could be conceded by Lord Irwin. In this
view again, picketing figured as a primary demand in the Salt Satyagraha
campaign of 1931 and had to be conceded. Humility alone can tell </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
essential from the non-essential. It gives a grip on fundamentals and leaves
loose the hold on accessories. It accordingly fosters a spirit of timely
concession and compromise. Pride also <span class=SpellE>yeilds</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,
but it is surrender due to weakness, not conciliation arising through strength.
Pride is weak, humility is strong. Pride punishes others, humility chastises
oneself. Humility breeds in us that love which burns oneself to serve another,
not burns another to serve oneself. Humility accordingly is the spring of
non-violence which again is a positive and dynamic force. Indeed non-violence
is but the isomer of humility which forbids strife and promotes harmony,

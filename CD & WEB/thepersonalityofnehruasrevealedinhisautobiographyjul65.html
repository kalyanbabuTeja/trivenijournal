has not heard the name of O. Henry, one of the most famous short story writers
in English? But many of us may not know that it was in prison, he began writing
“the brilliant stories that were destined to make his name <span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
and loved where ever the English language is spoken.” It is a very curious
thing that many writers of repute like Sir Walter Raleigh, John Bunyan,
Cervantes, Voltaire, and Oscar Wilde produced books while they were in prison,
books which are still remembered today. We are told that more than a million
copies of Hitler’s autobiography have been sold out and that Hitler wrote part
of the book in <span class=SpellE>gaol</span>. All these men, Dale Carnegie
writes, (in his <i>Little-Known Facts <span class=GramE>About</span> Well-known
People) </i>“went to <span class=SpellE>gaol</span> and it added to their
greatness.” The latest addition to this list of great men is <span class=GramE>Nehru,</span>
for it is from behind the bars of the prison that his widely read Autobiography
comes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
writing of an autobiography is not an easy thing. The toughness of the task is
perhaps best summed up in the words or Abraham Cowley: “It is a hard and nice
subject for a man to write of himself. It grates his own heart to say anything
of disparagement, and the reader’s ears to hear anything of praise </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
many may write their autobiographies, they somehow hesitate to publish them
during their life time. <span class=GramE>But not so with Nehru.</span> He very
frankly reveals to us, his dreams and desires hopes and aspirations, doubts and
conflicts, frustrations and triumphs. But the book does not exclusively trace
the growth and development of the personality of its author. That is because,
the book was not originally intended to be a full-fledged autobiography and its
present title is only the contribution of an English publisher, and not Nehru’s
own. As such there has been, in this book, “a </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fusion of the
personal history of Nehru with our national history and we can watch the
evolution of Nehru’s personality in the context of the drama of our national
struggle.” Nehru’s task was indeed a hard one and as Dr. Srinivasa <span
class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> puts it: “It was a razor’s edge that Jawaharlal
trod upon; to expose one’s innermost feelings, to uncover one’s wounds as it
were to the public, to judge one’s contemporaries, to measure a Mahatma, to
assess one’s own father, to feel the pulse of one’s love to one’s mother. It
was fatally easy to stumble, to slip, <span class=GramE>to</span> fall. But
Jawaharlal kept steady and seldom stumbled and never slipped or fell.” In his
preface to his book, Nehru remarks–“My attempt was to trace as far as I could,
my own mental development and not to write a survey of recent Indian history.”
Though one is not very sure whether Nehru was fully successful in this attempt
of his, one thing is definite. It is the personality of Nehru that grips our
attention throughout this book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The book opens with an account of the descent of the <span
class=SpellE>Nehrus</span> from <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>,
Jawaharlal’s somewhat solitary life during his childhood, his being for
sometime <span class=SpellE>brohght</span> up under the care of English
governesses and his admiration for the English language, the various festivals
like the <span class=SpellE>Holi</span>, <span class=SpellE>Divali</span> and
the <span class=SpellE>Dussehra</span> which always kept him in high spirits.
We are next led to the precincts of Anand <span class=SpellE>Bhavan</span> and
later to the swimming pool there. It is here that we get a sample of Nehru’s
delight in pure fun. Referring to Dr. <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span>, a friend
of his father, he tells us: “He knew no swimming and had no intention of
learning it. He would sit on the first step in fifteen inches of water,
refusing absolutely to go forward even to the second step, and shouting loudly
if anyone tried to move him.” The impression we get of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span>
is that of a baby, nay, a big <span class=GramE>baby, that</span> is scared of
getting into the pool but delights in just splashing the water with its felt,
squatting on the safe steps. But was <span class=SpellE>Motilal</span> in any
way better than <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span>? “My father himself was no
swimmer, but he could just manage to get the length of the pool with set teeth
and violent and exhausting efforts.” There is nothing of malice or bitterness
in these laughable pictures. There is just pure fun. Some of the personalities
that Nehru met on his tour of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> are so
fascinating that they serve as typical examples of Nehru’s delight in poking
fun at others. The picture of <span class=SpellE>Mahendra</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pratap</span>, a robust optimist clad in a curious mixture of all
types of dresses, which might have been suitable in the highlands of Tibet or
in the Siberian plains, but also, completely out of place, in Switzerland, seen
with his high Russian boots and an innumerable number of bulging pockets,
inciting the curiosity of the passers by, is very hard to forget. He reminds
us, as Nehru tells us, of some character out of a <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt'>medieval romance, a Don Quixote who has strayed into the </span>Twentieth
Century. As a fine foil to the portrait of the delightful optimist in <span
class=SpellE>Mahendra</span> <span class=SpellE>Pratap</span>, Nehru presents
before us the picture of that veritable miser–<span class=SpellE>Shyamaji</span>
<st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place> <span class=SpellE>Varma</span>,
claiming a casual kinship “With <span class=SpellE>Pratap</span>, only in so
far as his bulging pockets were concerned. Incidentally it may be of interest
to note that the flat in which <span class=SpellE>Varma</span> lived with his
ailing wife, enveloped in dust and dirt, the whole atmosphere being shrouded by
the shadow of death, reminds us of the chaotic chamber of Miss <span
class=SpellE>Havisham</span>, a skeleton in the faded glory of the rich dress
of a bride, in Dickens’ <i>Great Expectations</i>, the chamber where all signs
of life are stifled and all growth and movement arrested, including the clock
which has stop<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>ped at ten minutes to
nine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Other
instances of Nehru’s sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span> are his
references to Gandhiji’s <span class=SpellE>bania’s</span> instinct for careful
accounting, his being led like a dog with his hand cuffed to that of his friend
<span class=SpellE>Santanum</span>, the British Imperialism in crushing all the
initiative of the Congress when he says, “I am sure that if the Congress
started a nation-wide propaganda for the greater use of soap, it would come in
conflict with the Government in many places.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Nehru is so intimately bound up with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, that her
failures are his failures, her triumphs his own. It is this identification of
his with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that makes him feel in the very bower of his bones, the pain and agony of the
oppressed and the downtrodden. Wherever he finds people in the grip of abject
poverty, whenever he finds people, the innocents, brutally massacred by the
Imperialist Government, his heart bleeds, for he is full of the milk of human
kindness. Here is a typical reflection of Nehru about the Indian masses: “There
they were, these people, looking up with shining eyes, full of affection, with
generations of suffering and poverty behind them and still pouring out their
gratitude and love and asking for little in return except fellow-feeling and
sympathy.” Nehru has in abundance this fellow-feeling and sympathy. It is in
his description of the prisoners who are gradually stifled to <span
class=GramE>death, that</span> this aspect of Nehru is best brought to light.
To Nehru, ‘the soulless regime’ of the prison officers is a torture and anguish
to the mind of the prisoner. Moved by the miserable lot of these prisoners,
Nehru prefers administering the punishment of death to “the killing of the
spirit by degrees, the <span class=GramE>slow ,</span> vivisection of the
soul.” Nehru is essentially an optimist and he has firm faith that these fine
young men, imprisoned in <span class=SpellE>gaols</span>, would turn out to be
valuable assets to the country, with a little training and some diversion of
interest to other objects and jobs. Look at his reaction again at the two angry
young men who threatened and warned him at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>, against his propaganda opposing the
violent activities of the terrorists: “I was long haunted by the excited faces
of these two boys. Full of life and nervous energy they were; what good
material, if only they turned the right way!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fused
with this robust optimism is his reformist zeal. He wants to wipe away the
social evils around him and contribute to the sanity of the social order.
Speaking about the appalling number of persons sent to <span class=SpellE>gaol</span>
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
he suggests a remedy: “A more sensible economic policy, more employment and
more education would soon empty our prisons.” Referring with pain </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
the deliberate discouragement of intellectual development in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian
prisons, he reflects: “From the point of view of reclaiming a prisoner and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nehru
is no cold-blooded intellectual. He has a delicate feeling for nature and his
heart leaps up when he beholds a rainbow in the sky; it begins to swing and
sway in tune with a fresh blossom tossing its head in the gentle breeze.
Mountain tops mantled with snow, clouds floating feathery overhead, and the
rich tints of a red sunset haunt his mind. It is in recording the cyclic change
in nature that Nehru is seen at his best in his book: “The winter had denuded
all the trees of their leaves and they stood naked and bare….Gaunt and
cheerless they (the <span class=SpellE>Peepal</span> trees) stood there till
the spring air warmed them up again and sent a message of life to their
innermost cells. Suddenly there would be a stir in the <span class=SpellE>Peepals</span>
and I would be startled to see little bits of green peeping out all over them.
How wonderful is the sudden </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>change from bud to leaf!” There is nothing
of vagueness in this description, for Nehru particularizes it by reference to
the <span class=SpellE>Peepal</span> trees. We are convinced that the
experience of the poet is a first hand one and so the description appears to be
refreshingly original and not bookish. We are not merely told of the sudden
change from winter to spring but <span class=GramE>We</span> actually feel the
fading out of winter and hear the soft whisper of spring. The description
reminds us of <span class=SpellE>Hopkin’s</span> “Spelt from Sibyl’s Leaves”,
where we not merely read that the evening strains but actually feel the evening
straining. The lines quoted above are a clear proof of Nehru’s keen sense of
observation of the life around him. He has an artist’s eye for <span
class=SpellE>colour</span>, seen in his subtly distinguishing between the
reddish brown russet <span class=SpellE>colour</span> of the fresh mango leaves
and the green <span class=SpellE>colour</span> they acquire later on. Nehru and
Nature never grow tired of each other. Cloud-gazing was his <span class=SpellE>favourite</span>
pastime in prison, and specially so during the monsoon months, when he would be
thrilled at the amazingly beautiful ever-shifting clouds assuming fantastic
shapes and playing in a riot of <span class=SpellE>colour</span>. A sense of <span
class=GramE>relief,</span> and even a feeling of escape from confinement would
soothe him at such moments. “I gasped in surprised delight,” he tells us. He
had watched them almost as if in a trance. “Sometimes the clouds would break
and one saw through an opening in them, that wonderful monsoon phenomenon, a
dark blue of an amazing depth which seemed to be a portion of infinity.” We
feel as though it were some Romantic poet writing in prose. Nehru appears at
his best in his description of the clouds as seen from the <span class=SpellE>Almora</span>
District <span class=SpellE>gaol</span>. Watching the blue sky dotted with
clouds he reflects: “Wonderful shapes, these clouds assumed and I never grew
tired of watching them, I fancied I saw them take the shape of all manner of
animals, and sometimes they would join together and look like a mighty ocean,
or they would be like a beach, and the rustling of the breeze through the <span
class=SpellE>deodhars</span> would sound like the coming in of the tide on a
distant sea-front. Sometimes a cloud would advance boldly on us, seemingly solid
and compact, and then dissolve in mist as it came near and enveloped us.” The
poet in Nehru is seen even in such fragmentary lines as: “Especially beautiful
and fairylike were the <span class=SpellE>deodhar</span> trees….with their
garments of snow”…<span class=GramE>.“</span>there is the whisper of spring in
the air”…..“Tiny shoots are mysteriously bursting out of the ground and gazing
at this strange world.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may not be out of place here, to have a look at Nehru’s Will wherein he speaks
of his sacred bond with the <span class=SpellE>Ganga</span>: “The <span

people, round which are intertwined her racial memories, her hopes and fears,

and graceful stream in winter and a vast roaring thing during the monsoon,
broad bosomed almost as the sea, and with something of the sea’s power to
destroy, the <span class=SpellE>Ganga</span> has been to me a symbol and a
memory of the past of India, running into the present, and flowing on to the
great ocean of the future.” The lyrical texture of the curve of Nehru’s psyche
brilliantly comes to light in these lines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

narration of the manifold political upheavals and incidents. Either the cool
breeze from the plains or the misty mountain wind gently turns our shirt
collars aside leaving us flushed and fresh, as we glance through the pages of

systems of Philosophy in his book, <i>The Discovery of India </i>Nehru speaks
about the <span class=SpellE><i>Nyaya</i></span><i> </i>system in these terms’
“The <span class=SpellE><i>Nyaya</i></span><i> </i>method is analytic and
logical. In fact <span class=SpellE><i>Nyaya</i></span><i> </i>means logic or
the science of right reasoning. It is a necessary mental training for every
educated person.” We find him applying this <span class=SpellE><i>Nyaya</i></span><i>
</i>method of investigation, this science of right reasoning at many points in
his Autobiography. This scientific temper of his mind is perhaps best inferred
from his violent attack of Gandhiji’s explanation of the earthquake that shook <st1:place
w:st="on">North-east India</st1:place>. “I read with a great shock” Nehru tells
us, “Gandhiji’s statement to the effect that the earthquake had been a
punishment for the sin of Untouchability. This was a staggering
remark…..Anything more opposed to the scientific outlook would be difficult to
imagine.” His fine sense of logic becomes clearly apparent, as he vehemently
opposes the censorship imposed upon reading in prisons: “If a court of law
sentences a person to imprisonment, does it follow that not only his body but
his mind should be incarcerated? Why should not the minds of the prisoners be
free, though their bodies are not?” This scientific temper of the mind of Nehru
becomes transparent in places where he makes use of scientific terminology and
imagery. Speaking about the heat and opposition between the Hindus and the
Muslims he writes: “…..So action and reaction went on and in the process the
communal temperature of the country went up,” or again “the centre of gravity
(in the Legislative Assembly) moved more to the right.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

here. He moves on to<i> </i><span class=SpellE>analyse</span> the different
facets of the personality of Gandhiji. In a single sentence he astonishingly
packs up a lot of details: “A man of the keenest intellect, of fine feeling and
good taste, wide vision, very human, and yet essentially the ascetic who has
suppressed his passion and emotions, sublimated them and directed them in
spiritual channels, a tremendous, personality, drawing people to himself like a
magnet and calling out fierce loyalties and attachments–all this so utterly
unlike and beyond a peasant.” There is a lovely lyrical quality about another
fragment of a pen-portrait of Gandhiji that appears elsewhere in the book. “His
calm deep eyes would hold one and gently probe into the depths, his voice clear
and limpid would purr its way to the heart and evoke an emotional response.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Though Nehru admired the magnetic personality of
Gandhi, he was not blind to the weaknesses of even this Mahatma. There were
some fundamental points of difference between these two leaders and on many
occasions Nehru drifted away from the other. The news of Gandhi’s determination
to go on a ‘fast unto death’ on the question of separate electorates was a
terrific shock to Nehru and as he puts it: “I felt angry with him at his
religious and sentimental approach to a political question and his frequent
references to God in connection with it. He even seemed to suggest that God had
indicated the very date of the fast….what a terrible example to set!” wonders
Nehru. <span class=GramE>Again when Gandhiji sends a telegram to the British
Viceroy mentioning something about ‘<span class=SpellE>honourable</span> peace’
Nehru grows intensely indignant and vehemently challenges the validity of
Gandhiji’s stand: “Where was the elusive peace that was being sought when the
Government was triumphantly trying to crush the nation in every way and people
were starving to death in the <span class=SpellE>Andamans</span>?”</span> Nehru
completely disapproves Gandhiji’s idea of Trusteeship. He does not agree even
with Gandhiji’s idea of conversion in preference to coercion, as he questions:
“Can anything be greater than the psychic coercion of Gandhiji which reduces
many of his intimate followers and colleagues to a state of mental pulp?”
Nehru’s main charge against Gandhiji is that he did not encourage others to
think. Nehru questions again and again the efficacy of the way of faith taught
by Gandhiji. “It may pay for a short while, but in the long run?” wonders
Nehru. </p>

critical analysis of the personality of Gandhiji, this bringing even the
Mahatma under his microscope.’ is a clear indication of the desire of Nehru to
portray the complete man, to bring to the surface the good as well as the bad.
In his searching, and at times bitter, analysis of men and matters, Nehru does
not spare even father and his own group, namely the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Congress
Party. “Of course, the Congress movement,” writes Nehru, “like all other mass
movements had and has many undesirables–fools, <span class=SpellE>inefficients</span>
and worse people.” But he is quick to compliment: “I have no doubt whatever
that an average Congress worker is likely to be far more efficient and dynamic
than any other person of similar qualifications.” Again, when he speaks of the <span
class=SpellE>Britishers</span>, it is not the British people as a whole that he
looks down with contempt. It is only the “Tiger of British Imperialism,” the
British administration in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE>,
that</span> he abhors. At the same time he is grateful to the <span

more grateful to the England of Shakespeare and Milton, for as he points out in
his <i>Discovery of India, </i>“English literature which nourished our minds in

Nehru “is not a man of action and a crisis does not suit him.” At some other
point in the book, <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> appears to Nehru as “….an
Imperial envoy, visiting at the instance of the British Government, various
British Dominions, as well as the United States of America, and strongly <span

does not take away from Nehru his respect for <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span>,
and his own words amply prove this: “though we differed from Mr. <span

point it is essential to dwell upon a passage that Nehru has recorded in his
preface to his Autobiography: “I have discussed frankly some of my colleagues

given any undertaking to the authorities before coming out of the prison, not
to indulge in activities of a political nature, his conscience was totally

lines can in turn be said of Nehru himself: “This process of spell-binding was
not brought about by oratory or the hypnotism of silken phrases. The language
was always simple and to the point and seldom was an unnecessary word used. It

will soon be sixteen years since <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> emerged as a free nation; not
only free, but a united nation, like it had not been ever before, though about
a fourth of the country seceded and formed itself into a separate State. The
Indian nation as it emerged nearly sixteen years <span class=GramE>ago,</span>
has for the first time now been called upon to defend its freedom. The <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> we have to put up is also unique in nature; for the
content of what we have to defend is different from what individual kings
sought to defend in various parts of the country and at various periods of her
history. Then indeed we had no unified <span class=SpellE>defence</span> at
all. What some of us tried to defend, others conspired with the enemy to
destroy. Thus it happened during foreign invasions, not the least during the
British. Still even then, of course, there were glorious episodes of attempt at
<span class=SpellE>defence</span>. The <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the
First World War was the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of the British Empire
of India. The Indian people were called upon to defend the empire against
German Imperialism, and they rather thought it worth while to do so. Yet
nationalist opinion, even then, saw through and took advantage of the
incongruity of that <span class=SpellE>defence</span>. Revolutionaries were
actually involved in a plot with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Nationalism derived
strength from the <span class=GramE>professed</span> war aims of the Allies. It
developed into a colossal mass movement until again in the Second World War
India was asked to regard the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> to be
her own. That request lacked reality because at the same time as <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> professed to defend democracy and
freedom from the onslaught of Fascism, she was denying freedom and democracy to
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There was a school of thought, however, which considered it feasible to fall in
line with Britain because by so doing India would save herself from filling
victim to what was, if anything, a greater menace than British Imperialism, and
in the process win freedom and democracy in the course of the inevitable
liquidation of imperialism by political and economic forces issuing out of the
war. This school was led by M. N. Roy, a greater anti-imperialist than whom the
country had probably not produced. The Communist Party of India took a like
stand, not from its own judgment, but because in the mean-time the <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> had been attacked by Hitler and must needs
be supported. Nationalist <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
owned the need to defend freedom and democracy, but needed to have freedom and
democracy before doing so. So it spontaneously launched a movement to make the
British quit this country. Pending that, it did not see what it was that had to
be defended. In the later stages of the war, <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
came to mean <span class=SpellE>defence</span> from invasion by <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>, and when it was known that <span
class=SpellE>Netaji</span> <span class=SpellE>Subhas</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bose’s</span> <span class=SpellE>Azad</span> Hind <span
class=SpellE>Fouz</span> was operating in collaboration with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> lost all meaning for the average Indian. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is now, then, for the first time in history, that we, as a nation, are called
upon to defend ourselves. The call has been the more impelling because we
thought we had no enemy and pledged ourselves to a permanent policy of peace.
That was why some years ago our Prime Minister cold-shouldered a proposal for a
pact of joint <span class=SpellE>defence</span> with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> with the query “<span
class=SpellE>Defence</span> against whom?” Even when <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> stirred up trouble on our
border, he, as well as the nation, hoped it could be peacefully settled. Even
after the northern <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span> had killed a number of
our guards on the border and occupied twelve thousand square miles of our
territory, Pandit Nehru did not believe that we should have to fight a war with
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
He did not believe it and the nation did not like to believe it. If he made a
mistake, so did all of us. Of course, there were a few among us who thought
otherwise. They distrusted <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
because it had gone communist, but both the Government and the people declined
to give their protests and fears face value. Now, of course, they can claim
they have been proved right. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
call for <span class=SpellE>defence</span> has immediately brought us awareness
of what to defend. We know that we have to defend our freedom but know also
what is meant by “We”. We have been made aware of the unity that the British
gave to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the administrative and economic sense but which was forged into a unity of
spirit by our fight to end British rule. Being called upon now to defend
ourselves we know also what we <span class=GramE>are,</span> the Indian nation
that is integrated unto inter-dependence of its units. That awareness caused
suspension by the <span class=SpellE>Dravida</span> <span class=SpellE>Munnetra</span>
<span class=SpellE>Kazagham</span> of its secessionist platform, because, but
for it, that party might have used India’s danger, in the same manner as
England’s danger was at one time Ireland’s, and sometimes looked like also
being India’s, opportunity. If <span class=SpellE>Dravidastan</span> was a
serious proposition, there was little reason for its protagonists to own the
danger caused by foreign invasion to the country by separation from which <span
class=SpellE>Dravidastan</span> was to be formed, as a danger to <span
class=GramE>themselves</span>. We know now also what our fight for freedom
really and totally meant. Even at the beginning of our awakening to the need
for freedom, we looked back to our ancient heritage of the Gita and the
Upanishads and found therein the means to absorb the impact of modern Western
culture, thus freeing ourselves from the complex web of rituals and beliefs
through which Christianity made a bid to cut. Then we traversed the entire
gamut of our history and re-discovered the evolution through ups and downs,
strains and stresses, of our national being. Now as we are threatened, we hear
again the temple bell ringing through the depths of the <span class=GramE>ages,</span>
see the ridge at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
assuring us that our ancient being has survived all invasions, <span
class=SpellE>Mahavallipuram</span> proclaiming the unassailable majesty of our
quest of the Universal Being transcending our existence and <span class=SpellE>Fatehpur</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sikri</span> reminding us of our abiding heritage of synthesis.
So we experience a great upsurge in arts and literature in all our languages.
We are made conscious of the free, synthetic living that constitutes our way of
life whatever vicissitudes it may have been subjected to, at various periods of
our history. If all this is tinged with religion and direct emphasis has been
laid on faith in God as our sheet-anchor as contrasted with the atheistic creed
of our invader, there would be no danger of our relapse into obscurantism,
provided we keep pace with modern thought as, in the very compulsion of our
international contacts, we must. Just as in a personal or family crisis one
looks round to the roots of one’s being and shelters oneself in those very
memories and experiences of one’s past for whose continuity in the future one
fears, so a nation is made alive by danger to all it has lived, learnt and seen
through, having acquired in the process a personality and character of its own.
Our fight for freedom was too much politically orientated to enable us to
remember the total national background. Even when it reached out to quest of
economic fruition, it stopped short of making us conscious of the potentiality
of cultural growth on the background of our past. No wonder the present danger
has acted as a catapult to our total self-perception–so much so that a
prominent communist Professor-member of Parliament who, not so long ago, called
Sir <span class=SpellE>Aurel</span> Stein, who had undertaken an incredibly
hard journey for thousands of miles to reach a mountain repository of the
ancient Chinese civilization and <span class=SpellE>Sarat</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chandra</span> Das, our first cultural ambassador to the
prohibited land that Tibet was, wolves in sheep’s clothing serving Western
imperialism, has in a speech in the <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sabha</span> invoked <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> exhortation
to Mother Earth to make for her a hole where through she might enter the earth,
to ask for a similar hole, could a thing of the age of miracles be now made
possible, so that he could prove his fidelity to his mother country. His plea
might well be given face value, and rather than taunt him for the sacrilege he
had committed in desecrating cultural values of the highest order, or suspect
his motives for current avowal of patriotism, he might be welcomed as a
prodigal returning to the bosom of his motherland. That is the kind of elemental
urge that national danger has evoked. People return to the fundamentals of
national existence embodied through the ages in their literature, music,
sculpture, architecture and art and bequeathed in countrywide tradition. It
seems not only the communists but all of us strayed away from the mother
country. Else, how did we engage ourselves in fratricidal strife between the
States over this bit of territory or that or just to assert one language over
another–perhaps a richer vehicle of the common culture? Why did we make the
problem of national integration loom so large? We were oblivious of our country
and needed the shock of foreign invasion and the consequent danger to our
homeland and all that it means for us, to realize where the roots of our lives
lay. In that perspective International Communism has been shown to impinge on
the freedom of nations, Chinese Communism has revealed itself as a violent
aggressor and Indian Communism with its unconcern for national freedom is an <span
class=SpellE>alienized</span> force and so out of place in the present context
of national <span class=SpellE>defence</span>. We hark back to our national
self. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
we are integrated and it is not surprising that the problem of national
integration is regarded as solved. Rather it is deemed to be non-existent. Yet
the danger of over-optimism is there following the risk of over-simplification.
It is true that much of what seemed to be forces of disintegration <span
class=GramE>was</span> but competition for integration. These were the normal
outbursts of desire for self-expression, of fear of being left in the lurch.
States competing with one another for territorial expansion or linguistic <span
class=GramE>consolidation,</span> were really fighting for places that they
considered their dues, in a developing, emerging <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It was a frightful race for
integration, not anything like disintegration. Linguistic minorities were also
just anxious for proper places for themselves. All these trends and tendencies
have been <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> down by the national danger. Yet,
it may be said, they have been scotched, not killed. For, whatever maladjustment
they signified will yet have to be set right. But communalism was and remains
the chief obstacle to integration. It will not do to forget the dimensions it
attained before the emergency. Under the emergency it has been lying low but
has not been as non-evident as <span class=SpellE>linguism</span> and
provincialism have been. This is explained by a great snag in our national
self-perception. Our nation-state is secular but the content of the nationalism
enshrined in it has been largely feeling of oneness in the majority community
and national <span class=SpellE>defence</span> is prone to partake of the same
quality. The moorings to which we go back are largely Hindu. Communalism
operates today as a psychological barrier to mutual trust, feeling of mutual
oneness and mutual give and take. Our nationalism declined to admit the theory
of Hindus and Muslims being separate nations but the partial success of that
theory in the secession of the Muslim-majority areas to form a separate State,
left its scars on nationalism. Yet the Indian nation grows on secular lines and
faces the task of evolving a synthetic nationhood. The national danger presents
the task of reclaiming national synthesis from the ravages of the decades,
beginning with the last period of the <span class=SpellE>ninteenth</span>
century, both as a challenge and an opportunity. It will not do to brook
communalism any longer. It will no longer do to rot in the rut of
self-righteous communalism that has grown to pathological proportions. The
connotation of national <span class=SpellE>defence</span> must be not only the
jingling of the temple bell but the truth Kabir sought to find and <span
class=SpellE>Akbar</span> to <span class=GramE>establish,</span> and the dream
Emperor <span class=SpellE>Shahjehan</span> dreamt while looking at <span
class=SpellE>Taj</span> <span class=SpellE>Mahal</span> from his captivity at
the Agra Fort. Both the majority and minority communities have duties towards
its realization. If we are to defend our heritage, we must know what it is. Not
only Hindu, Muslim and aboriginal cultures but what of Western contact has
enriched our inner and outer being are our prized possession. This latter has
introduced us to modern modes of thought. Not that scientific thinking was
alien to our nature. Contemporaneously with ancient Greece. <span class=SpellE>Kapila</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Kanada</span> laid in India the foundation of
materialist thought. Indian civilization was just before British conquest at a
level, by no means inferior, to that of contemporary Europe. Foreign rule
retarded our development but dialectically gave us contact with modern thought.
That, like everything else, needs to be defended today lest we tend to retire
within our shells like China, which seems to have adopted a sort of spiritual
and cultural autarchy. It cannot be denied that there is, in our nationalism, a
streak of medievalism and revivalism, represented by certain political and
social trends. These run counter to, and prevent conscious assimilation of, all
the strands of our cultural being. The national emergency is<i> </i>an hour of
trial, but also an hour for us to rise to the full height of our being. We
cannot thus rise without full perception of our national personality. Corrosive
influences like communalism, provincialism, revivalism must be permanently
smothered. That is not yet done and constitutes a gap in our national <span
class=SpellE>defence</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For,
the trial in<i> </i>which we are placed today does not relate only to our
territorial <span class=SpellE>defence</span>. It extends to the whole of our
national character and attitude, and we must, to face it, equip ourselves with
all the moral, material and cultural resources at our command. Non-alignment
which means non-involvement in politico-military blocks, represents not
neutrality, but independence and a desire to be at peace with the world, but
not at the cost of justice to others and our own national <span class=SpellE>honour</span>.
If there was any presumptuousness about it, our humiliation at reverses in <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> against aggression should have well corrected our
perspective. Now however we face the question of permanent orientation of our
attitude. Acharya <span class=SpellE>Vinoba</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhave</span>
has been <span class=SpellE>criticised</span> for advising the nation to
continue to seek peace with the aggressor whose unilateral withdrawal from most
of the areas he (the invader) conquered, he has described as something unique.
He has ascribed the withdrawal as also the Russian withdrawal from Cuba to the
growth of a world conscience; but there are others who consider it to have been
actuated by diplomatic, military and tactical considerations. It should be
noted, however, that he wants our readiness to pursue ways of peace to be
allied to strength of self-confidence, just as Mahatma Gandhi’s way of peace
and non-violence was wedded to mental and moral strength, and urges all
possible moral and even material measures to be taken towards growth of
self-confidence. The support by communists and near-communists to the <span
class=SpellE>Acharya’s</span> angle of vision is considered by many to be in
accord with their political design but that does not detract from the intrinsic
plausibility of the <span class=SpellE>Acharya’s</span> stand. Sri </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nd
not against the Chinese people. But the Chinese people are an active party to
the aggression and unless it be pleaded that they are an unwilling party,
detachment of the kind asked for by the Prime Minister among others, would be
difficult to sustain. No authentic claim, that the Chinese people are not
behind their Government, has been made and communists are not the only people
who would be flabbergasted at any such claim. Indeed China’s border claims have
the avowed support of the Formosa Government though the latter professes to
dislike the mainland Government’s methods for enforcing them. To exclude the
Chinese people from resentment at the treacherous and unprovoked aggression on
us by their Government, would therefore not have the sanction of reason. Yet
resentment might quite conceivably be tempered by respect for ancient Chinese
culture and civilization, which Pandit Nehru has stressed without getting
everybody’s approbation in doing so. Such respect has a background of thousands
of years and is a direct legacy of Tagore and Gandhi. The question is, whether
Communist China’s <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> should be allowed to wipe
out all that, or rather whether China’s adoption of Communism has really not
wiped all that out or, whether a totality of outlook should leave room for a
faith in the ultimate triumph of human values. The latter alternative is not
however practicable without an understanding of the reason for Communism’s
success in changing the whole pattern of China’s <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>,
towards which the known existence of a streak of expansionism in her history
through the ages, should help. Pandit Nehru has said that our war is not
against Communism but Chinese expansionism. But such communists as admit that
China has committed aggression on India, have failed to explain why their pet
theory that a communist or socialist country cannot commit aggression has gone
pitifully wrong in the case of China. If it be not Communism we are fighting
against, this much is true that our fight includes a fight to maintain
democracy and it is not only pertinent but imperative to remember that our
enemy is a communist power and very probably interested in reducing us to the
position of a satellite. So we must take into account the wave of opinion,
among a strong section of the people, in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of
all-out military preparedness and mass psychological conditioning to that end.
This section of opinion holds, that non-alignment has been found very much
wanting, that Afro-Asian solidarity is an unreality, and that concern for these
in our governmental and other quarters is unrelated to reality. It is charged,
by those other quarters, with creating mass hysteria and leading a campaign of
hatred for China. It dismisses both charges as showing inadequate comprehension
of the gravity of the national peril, if indeed not something worse, a
conscious or unconscious inclination to leave the country unprepared. Others
naturally identify it with jingo nationalism or chauvinism and, among these
others are, not only the so-called leftists and middle of the road travellers,
but also self-professed humanists whom the very word nationalism gives the
creeps. They naturally invite the retort that we have been unable to resist
invasion and have been defeated by the invader, there never was and is any
question of our going in for any offensive war and our task consists merely in
retrieving our territory and our <span class=SpellE>honour</span>–so that all
talks of jingoism and chauvinism are out of place and these possibilities do
not for us at all exist. Rather our concern should be about the large veneer of
anti-State feeling and activity that exist in the country. This argument,
plausible so far as it goes, does not really obviate the possibility that the
reaction caused by wounded national self-respect from the former complacent
attitude of peace and military go-easy, might indeed make us go somewhat
berserk. Concern has already been expressed in certain well-meaning foreign
quarters that non-violence should have in the present emergency gone under
total eclipse in India. These warnings had better be heeded because it is
always unsafe to adopt a “It cannot happen here” attitude and it should be
remembered that Nazism rose in Germany as a supposed protest against the wrong
of the Treaty of Versailles and that Fascism in Italy looked to revival of the
glory of ancient Rome–both with disastrous results. It is not surprising,
however, that the tragic futility of moving in what the Prime Minister has
called an artificial dreamland devoid of all reality, should have made us swing
away to a grim determination on complete armed preparedness for all time. That
is however a true nationalist decision derived of a resolve to defend all that
is worth defending in the nation. It is <span class=SpellE>grounnded</span> in
nationalism for, pending the development of world-consciousness, the country is
the base, the nation is the plank, whereon to reach out to the world. As Lewis <span
class=SpellE>Mumford</span> explains: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nationalism
“came as a heightened consciousness of racial affiliations, as a cult of rural
life and a fondness for special regional backgrounds, as a deliberate
appraisal, often invidious, of those differences of face and physique, of
language and customs, of memories and habits, which set one regional group
apart from another. This sense of identity with a small, earth-bound ‘in-group’
is extremely ancient: the sentiment of nationality long anti-dates any
conscious belief in nationalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was assailed by Universalism, received a lift from the American and French
Revolutions and sustenance from the reaction to Napoleon’s conquests. Marx and <span

under proletarian revolution, “but just the opposite happened: from the middle

“The ground, for this national revival, had been prepared by the romantic
poets, painters and philosophers. The headwaters of these romantic streams was
not Rousseau but Shakespeare. In a whole cycle of historical plays Shakespeare
had tied the self-regarding sentiment of a people to a landscape and a way of
life….The discovery of Shakespeare awakened German romanticism with Goethe and
Schiller, and somewhat later, aroused the genius of a Victor Hugo….the historic
novels of Walter Scott…..then came a new cycle of national consciousness….aided
by work of antiquarians…..William Blake’s poetry. Rousseau understood the part
imagination played in building up the national personality.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“nationalism was a religion……It is often treated as a political phenomenon of
the same order as socialism. But the fact is that its roots are
deeper…….nationalism may be defined as the bond of common purpose that unites
those who use the same language, have the same background of nature, and follow
the same rituals of life. One or more of these is necessary, but the patch of
earth is all but indispensable, if only to serve as a common ground in the
imagination and a common speech, a dialect if not a language is part of
it...the individuality of groups of men is as genuine a fact as personality
itself the sense of group identity preserved and fortified through historic
memories, is the very essence of nationality...he who uproots nationality kills
personality.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a lesson for those who fail to distinguish between nationalism that is the
base of human personality and nationalism that impinges upon the personalities
of other nations. Rabindranath is often invoked and rightly too, against the
latter; but he was equally <span class=SpellE>cognisant</span> of the former.
Copious testimony could be adduced from his works in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of this view. In the New Delhi seminar on Tagore in 1961 Sir <span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The duty of <span class=SpellE>defence</span> will,
by common consent, henceforth be always on us. We shall have to be in a
permanent state of moral and material preparedness. So we shall be calm but
firm, resolutely defending what is ours but scrupulously avoiding intrusion
into what are the rights and duties of others. That will also enable us to be
sure of, and remain entrenched in, ourselves, and fully conscious of all that
is ours, having cast off the lackadaisical manner, in which we have taken
everything for granted and let ourselves drift into indecision, slackness and <span
class=SpellE>unpreparedness</span>. We forgot the common adage regarding
eternal vigilance being the price of liberty; but vigilance, to be in
proportion, must not mean militancy for its own sake, but for that transcendent
awareness of life which impels man, both individual and collective, to keep
himself fit, to go forward and even in face of the strongest adversity, not to
yield. A like orientation of our national outlook is the lesson of this our
moment of what is, in more senses than one, an unprecedented peril.</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That You have walked with me without intermission throughout the journey, I have not realised till this moment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether it was because I walked as in a sleep unconscious, or my faculties are dense and could not perceive, or, again, Your step is so gentle that I could not notice, or because Illusion lay between us as a veil obstructing vision, I have not to this moment been aware that You have always walked with me.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Alas,&quot; I thought, &quot;I am companionless upon this desert wild,&quot; and, turning my grief over in mind, dissolved in deep distress. &quot;I know not the way,&quot; I cried, &quot;and there is no one to show it to me.&quot; I knew not that You held me by the hand and were guiding me all the way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn back and what do I see? On the sand, with the mark of every step I have made, is the mark of a step of Yours. Over league on league of inhospitable desert, oh Merciful, You have walked with me step by step and I knew it not till this moment.</P>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Busy
lawyers seldom find time for other activities after the day’s work in the court
except to engage in a game of cards or a friendly chat at the club. Still it
will not be altogether untrue to say that the busiest alone finds time for
anything worth while doing. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>,
formerly, instances were not wanting, of famous advocates who could take keen
interest in public affairs also. No doubt, telling examples there were of
persons who, apart from making a mark in the legal profession, left indelible
impressions on the political life of the country by their inestimable services
as well as sacrifices in the cause of Freedom. Nevertheless very few evinced
anything like a natural zeal to promote good causes with both money and energy
to their fullest capacity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
recent years, at any rate, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
has not had in any single individual a combination of both the capacity to make
money in the profession, and also to give of it and of his valuable time and
personal attention in an equal measure to public affairs. The one man who, for
more than two decades now, was occupying a conspicuous position as a benefactor
of <span class=GramE>educational</span> institutions and industrial
enterprises, started with indigenous capital, was the late Sri M. <span
class=SpellE>Subbaraya</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>, whose
disappearance from the scene of his activities due to death, has been indeed a
major event of incalculable loss sustained by the institutions started by him
and making headway already in their respective spheres of service to the
country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
he was a lawyer of repute and a leader in the profession, his record of work as
one aiding the dispensation of justice was exceeded perhaps in an abundant
measure by his enormous <span class=SpellE>labours</span> in other fields
devoted to the furthering of human welfare. From the start, while he was a
junior working in the chambers of Dr C. P. <span class=SpellE>Ramaswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>, his prodigious turn-out of work in the office, as
well as his competence in the preparation of cases for <span class=GramE>trial<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>on</span> the Original Side of the High Court
of Madras brought him into notice in quite a short interval after his joining
the Bar. Income-Tax law was not, in the days of his entry into the profession a
subject of common application by practitioners in the court. Few delved into
that branch of the law and fewer still could make headway in it. Industry of a
peculiar type, for example, examination of accounts and ledgers, was required
for it, as also a capacity for patient attention to details of business
problems and the financial implications thereof. So, with a special aptitude
for such things, he soon found quite a useful field of legal service to many
who were often in the clutches of tax levies and difficulties arising out of
demands of a heavy nature upon their resources. If he was not vehement or
demonstrative in arguments, he was never indifferent to the best presentation
of his case, or unready to meet the hardest situation for his client. In short,
his reputation became so much established after some time, that even renowned
practitioners in other branches of work in the High Court depended solely on
his services whenever any serious trouble, pertaining to the incidence of tax,
arose for them to tackle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Though he was ever active in his chambers and was
found ever moving from court to court in connection with Tax Appeals as well as
to Tribunals lodged elsewhere in the City, he never neglected his other duties,
once he undertook to associate himself with any work of a public type. If the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Vivekananda</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> came into
existence at a critical time, when the pick of the progeny of the intellectuals
were denied access to colleges due to want of <span class=SpellE>fairplay</span>
on the part of the Government, it was the silent yet steadfast services of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Subbaraya</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>, in <span
class=GramE>1946, that</span> solved problem. In a manner that amazed people by
the measures taken, immediate and satisfactory, for the initiation of an
educational institution, he proceeded towards his object with whatever
financial help he could secure, from those possessing a sense of responsibility
regarding the prospects of the younger generation, destined to play a worthy
part in coming years, provided they were not deprived of the essentials of a
higher education. No hour passed without his mind constantly applying itself to
every bit<i> </i>of detail for establishing the institution on sound
foundations. None with<i> </i>an extra capacity to spare finances for good
causes was allowed to leave his presence without parting with a handsome <span
class=SpellE>cheque</span> for the college<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>.
</span>Despite the odds at the outset against the flourishing of such an
institution, his perseverance and adaptability to unforeseen situations
overcame the early hurdles in a very unnoticeable manner. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Madras Institute of Technology was, no doubt, a
child of the fond dreams and munificence of a single person, the late Sri C. <span
class=SpellE>Rajam</span>. Still without<i> </i>the constant co-operation of a
substantial kind from Sri <span class=SpellE>Subbaraya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>, who then considered no <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
or available time as wasted, if it was <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> for
getting more finances and greater recognition for such an institution, the
first of its kind in the South, it would not have attracted students from all
parts of the country, as it did. </p>

most congested part of the city–owes its phenomenal rise and quick equipment
with buildings and playground to the imagination and unstinting work of Sri <span

gradually declining and inane club premises, was turned into a beehive of
activity, with laughter and merry shouts of children, as if by the swaying of
the magician’s wand. He did not live to see his dreams of a High School
developing out of it, though the consummation may not be long delayed for want
of either the money or the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

cousin, Sri C. <span class=SpellE>Ramanujachariar</span>, derived no little
help in all possible ways from Sri <span class=SpellE>Subbaraya</span> <span

quickest at the mention of <span class=SpellE><i>Ramu’s</i></span> name. To

adjoining the buildings already existing in the names of the great saints of

it was the eighty-first birthday, in 1959, for his master, Dr C. P. <span
class=SpellE>Ramaswami</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar</span>, his own
contribution to the celebrations was no less than a feverish pursuit of a fine
publication of tributes to that invigorating personality, to be presented on
that occasion. If it was a grand banquet, in 1936, in <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
of Dr S. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span>, his own college-mate and
close friend, on the conferment of the Spalding <span class=SpellE>Lecturership</span>

function fell to Sri <span class=SpellE>Subbaraya</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span>
share which he, with cheer and readiness, undertook to a finish and success
achieved within as unbelievably short time after the decision to do it. If Dr <span

public of Madras, in 1943, in a fitting manner, and a <span class=GramE>substantial<span

endowing a university <span class=SpellE>lecturership</span> in his<i> </i>name,
it was Sri <span class=SpellE>Subbaraya</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span>
enthusiasm and co-operation with the Committee set up for it, in all ways known

than his public spirit and edifying role in many of the movements, which, but
for his timely co-operation and help, would have famished for want of men more
than money even, his way of rendering help in an unobtrusive manner will remain
a model for men in public life to follow. Never boastful of anything he had
achieved or done for others, he showed what a perfect blending of competence
and coolness, in a person determined to work for higher aims, would be able to
accomplish. Always methodical in work, whether private or public, he spared no
moment for wasteful talk or woeful complaints. His right royal road to success
was to be never slow but ever to be alert and moving. His was the genuine
melting of a heart for the poor and distressed, and instances in legion are
coming to light, once his fire has been quenched, of the many acts of timely
charity and sympathetic aid that he had rendered, in his fairly long career. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

others, it was when he met with slowness from the very persons coming to him. A
man of action, he never minded inconsiderate language flung at him or weighed
the pros and cons of them in after moments at the expense of his own
equanimity. His friends allowed him his own ways; his coadjutors in work

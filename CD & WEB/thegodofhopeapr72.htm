hoped and ever hoped. Whatever came, whatever happened, whatever he achieved,
gained and got, did not satisfy, did not <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> his
hopes, which stirred up and agitated him more and ever more. He worshipped his
deity and prayed, he went to persons and persons, temples and temples, but his
hopes did not subside. They excited and urged him to do this, try that, and
seek means after means for their satisfaction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

in despair he thought that he must find out the god of hope, who should be able
to give him all that he longed and <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> all his
hopes. If there was a god for every fancy, every desire every craving of man,
there should be a god of hope also to satisfy man’s hope. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
set out in search of the god from place to place asking whomsoever he met about
the god of hope and where he could be found. Then at one out-of-the-way place
he saw a man sitting by a stream and looking beyond over the other bank. He went
and stood behind him, uncertain if he should disturb and ask him. Finally,
after a minute’s pause, he turned round to his front and asked:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
did not stir to answer, but the hopeful man hoped to get the answer, the
correct answer, from this quiet, wise-looking man who turned his glance on him
and collecting his thoughts and attention pointed his finger across the stream
to the other side. Joyously and hopefully the seeker of the god of hope went down
to the stream which some fishermen with nets in their hands were fording. He
went with them and crossed to the other side where he saw a thin foot track
penetrating the wooded bank. With rising hope he proceeded with the <span
class=SpellE>incling</span> evening sun behind him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On
and on he went and then emerged into an open, dry, rocky place. There was no
tree here, no plant, no grass, but dry, lifeless sand and stones and rocks. So
was the air dry and breathless. So was the sky dull and starless. So was
everything around, still, dreary and dead. He felt uneasy, but hoped still to
find and meet the good god of hope who would <span class=SpellE>dispell</span>
his fear, and give him all that he desired, all that he loved to have, all that
he needed, all that he hoped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

steadied his steps and moved on. And then he saw a Figure seated on a boulder–but
what a Figure was this! He shuddered and stopped a few steps away from him. It
was a human skeleton wrapped by a thin skin that was pitchy black. His glowing
sunken eyes sent a cold shiver down his spine. His hairless head, his white
teeth shining between dry lips, his bony hands and long fingers edging in sharp
nails, and the fearful contrast which his frightful figure made on the
surrounding, over which was descending the shadow of the evening, shook him and
he had an instant impulse to turn back and run. But hope revived in him again
and advancing a few steps he timidly asked: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Figure shrugged his shoulder, opened his skinny mouth and grinned. What an
awful grin it was! He shrieked in terror, folded his hand and prayed for
forgiveness. “If you are a ghost, forgive me for having come to your abode. Let
me go.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“No”
the Figure said in dry shrill voice, “No, I am not a ghost. I am in life. I am
the god of hope.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Yes,
I was all that you say, but then as I hoped, and hoped more and pursued hope, I
day by day lost all and became this. The hope that burnt in me burnt my skin to
what it has become; it burnt the flesh of the body leaving the bones <span
class=SpellE>fleshlesss</span> it burnt my inside and all that made life. And
the Monster of hope lured and brought me to this place and left me perched on
this rock. It has lured you also, I see. There is not a drop of water here to
quench the flame that still <span class=SpellE>smoulders</span> within me. But
now I understand. I have seen and known this Monster that comes to man in the
form of hope to land him finally here in this state as it has landed me. I sit
and have been sitting here, but I desire not, hope not any more for anything,
even for a relief, for an escape from this dreadful place. For if I hope the
Monster of hope will pounce on me again. I sit here gazing and looking, but
expecting, desiring anti hoping for nothing to come to brighten the horizon.
Let the night come and then the day and then the night again. I accept what
comes and what goes with indifference, with unconcern. And as I have no
expectation, no hope, I have no fear, no worry, no agitation and I feel calm
and serene. I see the stars appearing, shining and disappearing. I see the sun
and the moon rising and falling. I see life passing through changing weather,
changing incidents and happenings. What can I do? They go their <span
class=GramE>way,</span> I have to go with them. Fear and worry do not help,
they only bring more fear, more worry. From the pursuit of hope and from the
search of means of satisfaction of hope I have turned back to the path of quiet
ease and contentment, and in spite of what I appear to you my inside is now
cooling and calming. I am restful, unexcited, <span class=SpellE>unagitated</span>.
What comes I accept with ease and good <span class=SpellE>humour</span> and do
not eagerly look to see what was behind it. I do not now run after hope, but have
seized, overwhelmed and conquered it. I am now the master of that Monster. Yes,
I am its <span class=GramE>master,</span> I am the god of hope. So you be. Go
back, turn back from the path that the lure of hope has brought you before that
Monster makes you what it made me. Overpower and conquer hope. Accept what
comes, what happens calmly, easily, without excitement, without fear, sorrow, <span
class=GramE>disappointment</span>. And then you feel no want, no need, no
desire, for you become the master of all desires. You then have everything because
you do not look for, wish for, crave for, <span class=GramE>hope</span> for
anything.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

heard and stood silent for a while and then bowed to the god of hope and said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bowed again and turned back. “I shall not hope again. I shall not <span

they are never satisfied” he said to himself as he walked away from the god of
hope. The agitation in his mind subsided as he discarded his desires, hopes and
expectations which had been raging in his mind, giving him no rest, no peace.
He looked up meditatively to the stars in the heaven which shed soothing
blessing on him, and he felt inside him a blissful happiness which he had never
known, never felt before. And that peace, that happiness stayed, never shook,
never faltered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

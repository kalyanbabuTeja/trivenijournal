style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ever
since Plato denounced Poetry as an ‘imitation’ twice removed from reality, and
an unhealthy social influence, numerous philosophers, aestheticians and critics
in every age have deemed it obligatory on themselves to expatiate on the value
and function of this fascinating art. For critics and aestheticians indeed, it
is ostensibly a duty to inquire into these questions. As regards philosophers,
it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that few major representatives of
this ‘curious’ tribe have regarded the edifice of their metaphysical system
complete without a triumphal pillar commemorating their audacious incursions
into the treacherous realms of the ‘Theory of Poetry’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Aristotle, Plato’s own disciple, felt constrained to revert his master’s theme
in the ‘Poetics’ and to defend poetry on the plea<i> </i>that far from
demoralising men, it actually purged or purified their passions of selfishness
and was thus an ennobling influence the social order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the Middle Ages, nevertheless, the Roman Church discouraged poetry, as a
‘wanton’, throughout Europe. But when at Renaissance, there was an unparalleled
outburst of poetic activity, we come across eminent intellectuals venturing out
boldly to defend poetry against its detractors. Sir Philip Sidney, for
instance, gave an eloquent tribute to poetry when he described it as “the first
light-giver to ignorance, and first Nurse, whose milk by and little, and
little, enabled them (i.e. those who inveighed against it) to feed afterwards
of tougher knowledges.” Poetry, he asserted, was not a frivolous pastime but a
delightful teacher and pointed out the ironical truth that Plato who looked
askance at poetry was himself a poet: “Though the inside and strength were
Philosophy, the skin as it were and beauty depended most of Poetry.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sidney’s
conception of poetry as ‘a delightfut teacher’ runs as the principal note in
the entire gamut of English criticism throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.
To this, however, is yoked the Aristotelian notion of ‘mimesis’. The French
critic, Boileau, who reigned as Legislateur du Parnasse throughout the
neo-classical age, advised writers to make Nature their study and never to
deviate from her in their works; and Dryden, the dictator of English literary
taste in the 17th century, averred that “to imitate well is a poet’s work”. To
Dryden, the making of poetry was like the employment of a curious goldsmith or
watch-maker. Like them, the poet is a decorator. His business is to present the
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>raw
material of life in a pleasant and shapely form. Dryden’s view is echoed by his
successor, Alexander Pope, in the middle of the 18th century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
romantic poets, who discredited so many critical canons of their eighteenth
century forbears, ousted also the theory of imitation out of the field,
envisaging Imagination as the distinguishing attribute of the poet. Poetry was
recognised as a creative act and has since been accepted as one of the most
exalted creative functions of man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
even the romantics could not altogether supersede the time-honoured notion that
the primary end of poetry was to teach. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the other hand, a
moral function of a higher order than ever before was attributed to poetry by
the poets and critics of this age. Wordsworth himself, the arch-rebel against
neo-classical, critical dicta, asserted that “poetry was the breath and finer
spirit of all knowledge” and deliberately devoted his poetic genius for the
purpose of instructing men in the moral value of intimate communion with
Nature. To Shelley, again, Poetry was “at once the centre and circumference of
knowledge” and its function was “to strengthen the faculty which was the organ
of the nature of man.” “The great instrument of moral good,” he tells us, is
the imagination; and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon the
cause.” Shelley indeed recognised that the poet cannot be subservient to a
narrow moral purpose. But, he asserted, “poetry awakens and enlarges the mind
itself by rendering it </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended
combinations of thoughts.” “Poetry enlarges the circumference of the imagination
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>by replenishing it with thoughts of ever new delight, which
have the power of attracting and assimilating to their own nature all other
thoughts, and which form new intervals and interstices whose void for ever
craves for food.” The moral influence of poetry was, thus, both profound and
incalculable. Poets were “the unacknowledged legislators or mankind.” They
could, by the magic incantation of their verse, usher in the golden age. <b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not surprising that in the sentimental and didactic Victorian era, the
utilitarian conception of poetry should find ready and almost universal
approbation from its readers as well as its practitioners. Of Tennyson, the
supreme representative of this age, it has been said, and said rightly, that
“he tied the tin-kettle of his morality to the tale of his pegasus”. Arnold
harnessed his poetic muse to the celebration of the virtues of stoical
endurance and calm detachment in the face of a grim, complicated and
fundamentally non-human world, brought into being by the rapid advance of
technology and science; Browning devoted himself to the exaltation of courage
and panegyrizing a strenuous faith and a rather facile optimism. The few poets
of the age who regarded poetry as an art to be cultivated as an end in itself
and not as a vehicle for moralistic propaganda, were isolated from the main
stream of Victorian poetry. Their poetry indeed revealed a strong impress of
foreign influence, and many of them were frowned upon as protagonists of the
‘Fleshly School’ of poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is only in the present age that it has been widely and unreservedly recognised
that the end of poetry is not the dissemination of any doctrine–moral or
otherwise–and that poetry is not to be evaluated principally on the basis of
the logic and cogency of the philosophy that it conveys or is supposed to
convey. Whatever the reason that impels the few present-day readers of poetry
to read it, it is certainly not the desire for ‘self-improvement’. Poetry has,
at last, been accepted as an art to be enjoyed and judged, like painting and
music, by no other standards than those that belong to art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
the primary function of art is the communication of certain thought-and-feeling
patterns intuitively apprehended by or revealed to the artist, through a
material medium. Accordingly, poetry, like painting, music and sculpture should
strictly be judged purely formal standards. Though this is widely recognised in
theory, most readers, even today, expect to find in poetry values other than
formal and are dismayed when they miss them. When read a poem, they look for
its ‘meaning’, by which they mean something that can be put more succinctly,
logically and simply in prose. This is otherwise described as the ‘thought’ or
the ‘substance’ of the poem, and when readers are unable to extract such
‘thought’ or meaning from the poem they read, they regard the poem as ‘obscure’
or treat it as a failure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
if in revolt against this tendency, many present-day poets have tried to
compose verse that baffles all attempts to get at its </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>logical
meaning; and some have even attempted to write as though to demonstrate that
poetry is not only lacking in ‘thought’ but has in fact no recognisable
relation to what is ordinarily described as ‘life’. It has in fact been
seriously asserted that to inquire whether a poem is ‘true’ is as meaningless
as to ask whether a sunset or a symphony is true. Eliot’s declaration that
“poetry can communicate before it is understood” is widely acclaimed as an
unchallengeable dictum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Is
then poetry to be regarded as a function absolutely without a moral or
intellectual value? Is it wholly illegitimate for a poet to make his poetry a
vehicle for doctrines or ideas, and for a reader to expect to find them? Is
Beauty the ostensible end of poetry, as of the other arts, to be deemed,
despite Keats’ dictum, as a value different in kind from ‘Truth’, instead of
being identical with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
works, one critical and the other mainly philosophical, published recently by
Raymond Tschumi and Leon Vivante respectively assist, not a little, in the
formulation of at least tentative answers to these vital questions of
criticism. The two critics, working on these problems independently, arrive at
similar conclusions. Prof. Tschumi points out, at the outset, that while a good
deal of poetry is not a vehicle of ‘thought’ at all, there exists a great
variety of poems which is. But poetical thought is fundamentally different in
quality from philosophical thought. Lucretius’ <i>de rerum natura </i>and
Bridges’ <i>Testament of Beauty </i>are outstanding examples of poems “where
the doctrine clearly stands out and mars the feeling. The vocabulary in these
poems is the same and is used in the same way as philosophical vocabulary. The
author states and prescribes, he does not suggest and convince. His method is
essentially speculative and didactic, and his prosody is but an elegant cover
for a philosophical text.” Such poems, in short, belong rather to the realm of
philosophy than of poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
on the other hand, the thought of Milton and Dante is truly poetical. Both
these poets “introduce ideas in their poems and these ideas are religious myths
which appeal to the feelings, and being emotionally felt, can be introduced in
a poem.” Similarly though T. S. Eliot indentifies his thought with Catholic
doctrine, “the poems which are clearly connected with this doctrine, <i>the
Four Quartets, </i>are related to circumstances of the poet’s life and are
inspired by personal experience. They are true poetry despite the fact that
Eliot gives an impression of complete det ment. “The impersonality of the poet
is necessary in order to communicate with the reader, but the approach to the
ideas of a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>poem must be emotional, then perhaps
intellectual. The substance </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of poetical thought eludes all conscious
effort at reducing it to abstract terms.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Besides
being emotionally felt by the poet, thought must also be capable of stirring
the imagination and feelings of the reader. Otherwise it cannot legitimately
find a place in poetry. When a purely intellectual individual belief is
expressed in a poem, as for instance in Donne’s <i>Holy Sonnets, </i>the
doctrine is an obstacle to the reader, for he does not share the emotion of the
poet. But philosophical ideas concerned with the fundamental and ultimate
problems of life are not dangerous to poetry, for though these ideas may not be
intellectually assented to by the reader, their emotional qualities may be felt
by him. The difference between philosophical and poetical thought lies
precisely in this difference of purpose, viz., “whether ideas are used to
create a poetical state of mind or to expound a philosophy.” If the ideas are
expressed as static and abstract concepts, the result cannot be poetry, however
valuable the ideas are in themselves. But abstract thought is not necessarily
static; it may be a source of emotion and a creative function. When it is thus
a Source of dynamic emotional activity, it may express itself in poetry: for,
as Herbert Read finely puts it, “the words are born or reborn in the act of
thinking,” and this act of thinking implies the blending of emotion and
thought, attributed by Eliot to the Metaphysicals, as well as the “symmetry
between form and content, music and meaning, word and spirit”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poetical
thought is thus not didactic and does not serve to expound a system rationally.
Prof. Tschumi’s study of modern poetry conclusively demonstrates that in the
work of the most significant philosophical poets of our time, viz., Yeats,
Eliot and Read, there is a considerable wealth of original thought, but that
this thought is not explicit and cannot be set out systematically in any
language other than that used by the poet. Only an intuitive reading or close
analysis of the poems can discover and extract it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Leon
Vivante’s examination of seventeen English poets, from Shakespeare to Thompson,
leads to a similar conclusion. The thought of these poets, he finds, is
independent of external data original. “It consists of subjective and eternal
values rather than in philosophical concepts, and expresses the principle of
inward light which, far from being an abstraction, discloses the spiritual
essence of life.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vivante’s observations on the general nature of artistic activity reveal
recognition of the fact that art is neither ‘imitation </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as
the classicists regarded it, not cerebration as some of the moderns seem to
think. Art is the perpetual discovery and embodiment of the spiritual principle
of life. “Modern Schools of art and poetry have eventually understood that
beauty does not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>properly lie in the object which is represented
or contemplated. Hence they have been encouraged to look for the subjective ele</span><span

This critical point of view may be justified. But it is a sheer mistake to
believe that this element can be better discovered by looking for it in the
subconscious life, in dreams, and in magic. A thing is no less an object for
the mere fact of being sought or envisaged in the subconscious…Frantically and
hopelessly and in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fact too much blinded in external (though
sub-conscious) objectivity, many a modern artist or poet seeks the subjective

aridity and arbitrariness of the abstractly objective view. He </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ignores
the real source of depth, which lies in the consciousness, no matter if it be
the ordinary consciousness of the waking state or a less apparent one. The
essential and common characters of consciousness, in a kind of philosophical
barbarism, are forgotten and the name of consciousness is lost. All is traced
to something else. Consciousness–and conscience–either in art or literature,
and in so called ‘realistic’ politics, is considered only a net of illusions,
something to be entirely traced to, or made dependent upon, something else.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
art itself is a standing refutation of aesthetic theories based on modern
psychology. For “what is fundamental in all artistic activity is the
self-discovering and self-realising of an <i>original </i>causal principle in
its manifold aspects and in its integrity.” While any good poetry will bear
this out, Shakespeare’s plays provide perhaps the most unquestionable evidence.
Hence, as Leon Vivante observes, “Shakespeare’s works have the merit of being
the strongest bulwark against modern psychology. So long as Shakespeare
continues to have influence on the English language, it will be difficult for
English speaking people to forget the soul for the complexes, the instincts,
the subconscious, the unconscious or the tropisms. Indeed the same
well-deserving quality or influence can be ascribed to all poetry. But as
regards Shakespeare, it is in a particularly high degree that the non-composite
principle of subjectivity shows, as it were, under our very eyes, its
absolutely inherent richness and depth.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a very real sense, therefore, it may be asserted that far from being divorced from
objective reality, genuine poetry–and indeed all art–springs from its very
deepest levels. There is a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sense in which it is right to maintain
that reality lies in art pre-eminently. This is the sense in which that is
supremely real, which firstly has in itself its cause, and secondly, as
creative thought does, knows self-causality (intimate original causality) at
once as a value of certainty and as a value of universality.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in other words, may be regarded as the very touchstone of truth. But truth is
not conceived by the poet “as if its substance lay in its practical
confirmation or in a kind of correspondence between things and our
representations of them.” It is rather understood as a “value of supreme
identity with our deepest self and with reality, a value of directness and
simplicity, exceeding the particular occasion and interest, which is ultimately
a passion as love is, and grounded in the same principle.” That is why ‘truth’
finds place at all in such lines of Shakespeare as the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

poems show that, like Shakespeare, he also understood that truth cannot be
“labelled or objectively defined with clear-cut compartments and outlines”. He
knew that the poet may not seek knowledge as an extrinsic end but that “as an
intimate motive-value, ‘beauty’ is supreme knowledge, and the two things–beauty
and the knowing of the spirit–are identical.” The following seven lines of the <i>Ode
to the Nightingale </i>testify to this, his life’s conviction and

a poet whose genius and temperament were so different from Keats’, revealed
similar insight into the nature of ultimate spiritual reality, in four
memorable instances: In the <i>Ode to the West Wind, </i>it is discovered and
expressed above all as freedom; in the poem <i>To a Skylark </i>as perpetual
novelty; in the <i>Epipsychidion </i>as Oneness, and in the quietness of the
forest near Pisa as self-enshrined eternity.” His real poetic thought is not to
be found in the political and social views inspiring <i>Prometheus Unbound </i>or
in the Notes to <i>Queen Mab </i>or in the literary history of the philosophy
of love to be found in <i>Epipsyehidion, </i>but in the recurrent insights
enshrined in these and other poems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fact, it may be said not only of Shelley but of poets in general that their
‘poetic thought’ or ‘poetical insight into self-activity, is quite distinct
from their more systematic thought or philosophy of life. While their more
deliberate thought is under the control of the will, poetic thought is
subservient to no external authority. Hence it is that the poet who consciously
sets out to preach fails as a rule to write poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then, lies the moral value of art? If poetry cannot be used as a handmaid of
conventional and utilitarian morality, neither can it be regarded as morally
‘useless’ as the ‘aesthetes’ perversely asserted. It has indeed a supreme moral
function. This function is, “to vindicate that which is human and more than
human, essential and universal, because of its intimate and profoundly original
character,” and further, “to contrast and supersede conventional values and to
overcome all forms of social and political group-solidarity and their blind
spirit of exclusion and egoism, and to rebel against the excess of organisation
which kills the heart of man and life itself.” Milton, whose stern puritanical
ideals of character are so antipathetic to many moderns, knew what he was
talking about when he said that “a poet who would write well hereafter in
laudable things...must himself be a great poem”. For, as Leon Vivante
eloquently observes, “hate, cruelty, presumption, arrogance have never made
good poetry, and that is a test of their being or not being rooted in the very
depth of the spiritual essence. Freedom must perpetually merge in its eternity;
love must be felt as a reality on principio, this is to say, in its intrinsic;
omni-original character; self-realisation must be at one and the </span><span

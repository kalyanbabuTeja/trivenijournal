all the youth of his generation, he became an ardent nationalist even as a
student. He was inspired by the ideal of <span class=SpellE>Swaraj</span> as it
was taught in the days of the <span class=SpellE>Bandemataram</span> movement
which followed the partition of <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> by
Tilak, <span class=SpellE>Lajpat</span> <span class=SpellE>Rai</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Bipin</span> Chandra Pal and Aurobindo. He later became an ardent
disciple of Mahatma Gandhi who brought to his countrymen the message of
non-violent non-co-operation. He took an active part in the freedom struggle,
served as Public Relations Officer of the Congress and suffered imprisonment
like almost all the freedom fighters of his time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

jail going was not to his taste. He was more interested in constructive work
and in the work of national reconstruction. Being a man of literary and
artistic interests he chose journalism as the instrument for the purpose. He
served his apprenticeship in this field in <i>Swarajya, </i>started by the
well-known Andhra leader, <span class=SpellE>Tanguturu</span> Prakasam, in the
company of the late <span class=SpellE>Khasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Subba</span>
Rau and G. V. <span class=SpellE>Krupanidhi</span>. He however felt that <i>Swarajya
</i>did not give full scope for the expression of his ideals and this led to
his starting the <i>Triveni, </i>the quarterly which made him known to
thousands of people throughout the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

</i>was his pet child. He nourished it with literary food brought from scholars
in every part of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The best contributions in Indian languages–Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi,
Bengali, etc.,–were translated into English and found a prominent place in the
pages of the magazine. He knew that there was a renaissance in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a
rebirth of what was best in the nation in the field of literature, art,
religion, philosophy and politics, and that every linguistic group in the
country made a contribution to it. He was impressed by this composite culture
and he felt that it was his mission in life to bring the intelligentsia who
were obsessed by their narrow attachment to English language and literature
into intimate contact with the new culture of their own country. Scholars were
naturally attracted to him and gladly and willingly sent their articles for
publication in <i>Triveni. </i>His hopes of making it the organ of Indian
renaissance were more than fulfilled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

were however many <span class=GramE>difficulties which he had to overcome
before the task which he undertook was</span> successfully accomplished.
Finance was the most acute of them. There were occasions when he had to go
about seeking help from his friends for funds so that he might bring out the
issues of the journal regularly. But he was undaunted by such difficulties. He
had implicit faith in human nature, in the kindliness and generosity of men and
women and his appeals did not fall on deaf years, though it all meant a great
deal of physical trouble and caused him much mental strain. It was in these
moments of ‘<span class=GramE>crisis’</span> that the heroic spirit in him was
revealed and it was this spirit that sustained him throughout his life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rau had a large circle of friends and admirers in very many parts of the
country. In days when he was Editor of <i>Krishna <span class=SpellE>Patrika</span>,
</i>the foremost nationalist Telugu weekly, men of letters and artists gathered
around him and spent hours in cultural discussions of all sorts. In their
company he showed himself to be a good conversationalist and immensely
contributed to the liveliness of those discussions. <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>
from which the weekly was then published had a special attraction for him. It
was the place where the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span> Kalasala, the
one great symbol of <span class=SpellE>Andhra’s</span> role in the history of
freedom struggle, was located, the Kalasala of which he was the Principal for
some time. In the circle of his friends here there were several leading Telugu
poets and artists. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rau was a great humanist. He believed in the dignity of man and he had capacity
to rise to the greatest heights of excellence. His vision was not limited by
the narrow ideas of <span class=SpellE>linguism</span>, regionalism and even
nationalism. He was a cosmopolitan at heart and admired goodness and beauty
wherever they were found. He had a sort of childlike innocence and he could
never<i> </i>think that there was evil in man. He was always cheerful and
smiling and his smile was contagious. He and I have been friends for nearly
half a century and what impressed me most was not his work as a journalist,
great as it is, but his human qualities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

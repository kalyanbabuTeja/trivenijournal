mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Though Swami Vivekananda was not an aesthetician or
a person directly interested in aesthetic theories or in the writing of poetry,
or in expression of the human mind in art, yet as a person who had risen to the
heights of spiritual experience, of God as the Supreme Beauty and the Supreme
Love and the Supreme Bliss, he had a fine intuitive sense of the real nature of
Beauty and of art. He said in London in 1895: “The artist is a witness of the
Beautiful. Art is the least selfish form of pleasure in the world.” He said
further: “If you cannot appreciate harmony in Nature, how can you appreciate
God, who is the sum of all harmony?” He said again: “Of a truth, Art is
Brahman.” He was thus aware of the quintessence of Art and Poesy, though he was
not one who expressed his poetic nature in formal poetry. He said on one
occasion: “Do you not see that I am first and foremost a poet?” In his lecture
on “God in everything,” he said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Who enjoys a picture, the seller of the picture or
the seer? The seller is busy with his accounts, what his gain will be, how much
profit he will realise on the picture. His brain is full of that. He is looking
at the hammer, and watching the bids. He is intent on hearing how fast the bids
are rising. He is enjoying the picture who has gone there without any intention
of buying or selling. He looks at the picture and enjoys it. So this whole
universe is a picture, and when these desires have vanished, men will enjoy the
world, and then this buying and selling, and these foolish ideas of possession
will be ended. The money lender gone, the buyer gone, the seller gone, and this
world the picture, a beautiful painting. I never read of any more beautiful
conception of God than the following: ‘He, the great poet, the ancient poet:
the whole universe is His poem, coming in verses and rhymes and rhythms, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>written in infinite bliss.</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>’</span> When alone, when We have given up
desires, shall we be able to read and enjoy this universe of God. Then
everything will become deified. Nooks and corners, by-ways and shady places,
which we thought so unholy, spots on its surface which appeared so black, will
be all deified. They will all reveal their true nature, and we shall smile at
ourselves, and think that all this weeping and crying hail been child’s play,
and we, the mother, were standing there watching……..They are groping in
darkness who are worshipping<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>this
ignorant world, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>world that is
produced out of ignorance. Those who are worshipping that world, thinking of it
as of that Existence, are groping in darkness, and those who live their whole
lives in this world, and never find anything better or higher, are groping in
still greater darkness. But he who knows the secret of beautiful nature,
thinking of pure nature through the help of nature, he crosses death, and
through the help of that which is pure nature he enjoys Eternal Bliss. ‘Thou
Sun, thou hath covered the truth with thy golden disc. Do thou open that for me
so that I may <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>see </span>the truth
which is inside thee. I have known the truth that is inside thee, I have known
what is the real meaning of thy rays and thy glory, and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>see </span>that which shines in thee, the truth in thee I <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>see, </span>and that which is within thee is
within me also, and I am in thee.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus Swami Vivekananda knew the intimate alliance
between the aesthetic faculty and the religious faculty in man. He said: “The
artistic faculty was highly developed in our lord Sri Ramakrishna, and he used
to say that without this faculty none can be truly spiritual.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Swami Vivekananda's utterances on specific arts
also are very interesting. He said once: “The secret of Greek art is its
imitation of nature even to the minutest details whereas the secret of the
Indian art is ‘to represent the ideal.” He was himself a fine musician gifted
with a splendid and vibrant voice. He made people realise that in Western music
at its highest we find the perfection of harmony whereas in Eastern music at
its highest we find the perfection of melody. In short, he taught India to
realise herself as fully in National Art as in National Religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

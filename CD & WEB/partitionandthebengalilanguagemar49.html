language and literature have had, especially since the days of Tagore, a
recognised place among the literatures of the world. Their development is
naturally regarded as integrated with Bengali life. But then Bengal has been
partitioned. East Bengal has joined the newly founded State of Pakistan on the
basis that Muslims are a nation apart from the Hindus and are in a majority
there. West Bengal where Hindus constitute the majority refused to go the way
of East Bengal and remained in the Indian Union. Muslims opposed partition on
the ground that Bengal was an integral whole and as such, being a Muslim
majority province, should be in Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

if Bengal was a geographical and linguistic entity, undivided India was an even
stronger and more natural entity. If then India was to be divided on the basis
of the two-nation theory or, just to avoid exchange of population, on a
communal majority basis, Bengal had similarly to be divided. The argument that
she was a distinct entity did not prevail in face of the division of India and
was naturally regarded with suspicion as only a move to include the whole
province in Pakistan. Nor had it any apparent plausibility, for cultural
difference had been adduced as the main plank of the two-nation theory and
militated against any assumption of a composite culture in which both Hindus
and Muslims participated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

thus Bengal has been divided, and the two Bengals pursue their divergent ways
of life and certainly now do not feel that they have much common ground with
each other, unity of cultural development would seem to be a melancholy
unreality. Subjective inclination for a unified Bengali culture however
lingers, and even recently a reputed Muslim professor said in his Presidential
address at East Pakistan Cultural Conference that despite partition Bengalees
had not ceased to be Bengalees and the essential Bengali character must remain
intact. Immediately, however, he received a rebuff from East Bengal’s leading
daily paper which asserted that talk like that was out of place in Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The historical background into the making of which
political developments before and after partition have also gone, is indeed the
basis of divergence of cultural development between East and West Bengal. East
Bengal’s point of departure lies in long-standing complaints of inadequate
representation of Muslim life. Such complaints might well be considered
artificial; for representation of Muslim life largely depends on Muslim writers
and will automatically come in the wake of such writers. Yet it stands to
common sense that literature in East Bengal will henceforth largely concentrate
on Muslim life. That will help to enrich and perfect literature and need not
certainly cause a rift in Bengali literary development. Still a rift seems
likely, for use of Arabic and Persian words will impart to literary development
in East Bengal a distinct character which West Bengal is not likely to take
easily. Nor, will such use be unnatural or wrong, for many Arabic and Persian
words are in actual use among Muslims, and others are brought into us to denote
feelings of special Muslim significance. Yet others will very probably be
introduced just to muslimize the language on the argument that it has hitherto
largely shown Hindu character and imagery. Muslim life as such found expression
in the past in what are called Puthis–stories in verse written by half-educated
versifiers, yet eminently reflecting the core of Muslim life. Muslim writers are
frank in their opinion that their work must develop on the background of the
Puthis. Profuse use of words of Muslim significance is therefore to be expected
and will not be easily adaptable to the parent trend of the Bengali language.
The psychological factor counts above all in social and cultural matters and
does not, as it is now, promise co-ordination of literary development between
East and West Bengal. It would be true to say so even admitting that East
Bengal will resist, as she has hitherto resisted, West Pakistan’s pull towards
Urdu and will, while admitting Urdu for certain State purposes, preserve the
mother-tongue in social, personal, and educational spheres and will also find
the official suggestion for writing Bengali in Arabic script unacceptable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here,
then, we frankly face a prospect of bifurcation of the Bengali language.
Strange as it may seem West Bengal is not altogether unprepared for East
Bengal’s departure from the language pattern hitherto pursued, in the sense of
separate Muslim self-expression. In that context indeed Hindu writers from East
Bengal are finding their field of work transferred to West Bengal. The
considerable migration of East Bengal people to West Bengal that has taken
place, should also result in the introduction into West Bengal of some of the
cultural forms peculiar to East Bengal. With their absorption West Bengal may
consider herself free to pursue the cultural pattern that she considers her own
and by which she has here before too sought to distinguish herself from East
Bengal. That pattern is supposed to be related to the classical Hindu trend
which, it is suggested, has not been maintained in East Bengal where
large-scale diffusion due at first to Buddhist, then Islamic influence<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>has taken place. This supposed cultural
difference was even brought in as an argument for partition. But considering
that it was not much heard of before and development of Bengali language and
literature was regarded as the solid concern of Bengal and Bengalees as a
whole, there seems to be little reason to contemplate difference in literary
development except on the basis on which political partition has taken place.
Rather the psychological inability of East Bengal Hindus to adapt themselves to
the new political pattern in their homeland and the actual migration of a large
number among them, particularly of the upper class, to West Bengal and
elsewhere presages concentrated cultural development of Bengalee Hindus in West
Bengal and precludes the possibility of their sharing in any important degree
East Bengal’s literary development.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
outlook before East and West Bengal just now is frankly that literary
development as between them will differ. The prospect seems abrupt and somewhat
unnatural, considering that mere political division is here regarded as
corroding racial and linguistic unity existing for generations. But it is
really not so absurd, considering that unity has not prevailed against the
disunity that has now been discovered and admitted between Hindus and Muslims
as such. Again it may be urged that the past background and tradition of
Bengali language and literature belong to both Hindus and Muslims and must be
the foundation of literary development of both Bengals and will be a natural
lever of unity between them. Such masters as Rabindranath, Sarat Chandra and
Nazrul Islam cannot easily be disclaimed by either Bengal and will prove an
abiding link between East and West. This argument ignores the point of
departure that Muslim literary development expressly wants to take in the
direction of expression of Muslim life through distinctive forms. That would
not make it necessary to disown the past and East Bengal need not certainly
disavow Rabindranath. Literary masters are for all climes, and that Bengali
language and literature, as they are today, are largely the work of Hindus lays
on East Bengal no obligation not to evolve its own literary pattern,
particularly when there is the overriding and pressing consideration that
Muslim life has yet found but little expression in Bengali language and
literature. Prospects are then clearly in favour of a split between the two
Bengals in the matter of cultural development, carrying the political division
to ruthless consummation. And objectively speaking too such a split would seem
very natural. For, in spite of sentimental and wishful thinking of a joint
Hindu-Muslim Bengali culture, the fact remains that Muslim consciousness, once
it has been roused, declines to share in those aspects of Bengali and, for the
matter of that, Indian culture which are derived even remotely from Hindu
ideology. From its point of view, indeed, the common cultural feeling that has
vaguely prevailed so long has been accountable to the Muslims self-forgetful
surrender to the Hindus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
would not therefore be true to say that Bengalee Hindus and Muslims own to a
common culture. They do not. Minority Hindus of East Benga1 may be quite safe
in preserving, conserving and developing, so far as possible, their culture;
but there is yet little prospect of development of a composite culture to which
they can contribute. If this be regrettable, nothing would be more unfair than
to ascribe it solely to the Muslims. The common cultural attitude of Hindus is
prohibitive of easy integration with Muslim feeling. Hindus would admit Muslims
to their culture only on their own terms. But Muslims in East Bengal wait for
their self-expression, not for cultural experimentation in co-operation with
others. The present position therefore is in favour of cultural division of the
Bengalee race on religious-cum-communal lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
additional and immediate proof that the tendency towards cultural, even
linguistic, separation is not merely on one side and is operative in the Hindu
mind equally, though less vocally than among the Muslims, is to be had in the
official adoption of complex Sanskrit words to replace English words that have
so far been in use. This has had the effect of complicating the language and
making it less easily understandable. On the background of democratization of
the Bengali language, such as has been pronounced in Rabindranath and writers
after him, this deliberate movement towards complexity is regarded as
retrograde, and the process of Sanskritization has aroused protest apart from
doubt whether it can at all succeed. No less a man than Pundit Nehru has felt
compelled to publicly condemn this sort of artificial attempt to subordinate a
popular language to the whims of a conservative coterie. It has however sought
reinforcement from the argument of inter-provincial uniformity in the
development of terminological literature. There is no gainsaying that it is
likely to have a devastating effect on what chances there might have been of
symmetrical literary development of East and West Bengal. There is no doubt
that East Bengal will coin its new terminology mainly by Arabic and Persian
words, largely alien to the Hindu mind and unacceptable to West Bengal. But it
would not do to ascribe this sort of single-track mind solely to Muslims. The
Hindus have a similar mind, only if cleverly less vociferous, and with a
superiority complex in the bargain. Between them two Bengali language and
literature are in imminent danger of losing the hitherto maintained unity of
development. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here,
however, there is possibly some counting without the host, Literature, says
Trotsky, does not lead but limps after life. If that appears
over-simplification, it is nevertheless true that literature is the expression
of the objective urge of the people and helps its subjective realisation rather
than create the urge itself. There very probably a link will be found and no
great compartmentalization on purely sectarian lines will prove possible. For
life itself will cease to be sectarian and will be derived of the lives of the
people where sectarianism is already being supplanted by unity of economic
interest and unity in the struggle to safeguard that interest. Language and
literature must of necessity respond to the people’s need and will permit no
putting the clock back. They will have to be simple and popular and will very
probably get loose from the sectarianism that is the mainstay of what is today
the ruling class. There East and West Bengal must find a common ground. After
all even today no West Bengalee, let alone the emigree from East Bengal, can fail
to respond to the tune of East Bengal’s song Bhatial. In that context
literature will cease to be, as it should never be, Hindu or Muslim and it may
be well left for a literary pioneer to present the pattern of future
development untrammelled by considerations of communal distinctiveness. Maybe
when today’s politicians have had their day and the intellectuals have, out of
the separatist tendencies of today, amassed their brief cultural fortune,
Bengal will rediscover herself in the life of her people and the separatism
that increasingly threatens to envelope her politically-divided self will
vanish like morning dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

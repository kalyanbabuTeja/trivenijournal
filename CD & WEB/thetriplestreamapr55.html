style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the hectic weeks when the elections to the Legislative Assembly of Andhra were
being held, public attention all over India and even beyond was directed to the
issues involved in the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fight between the United Congress Front
and the Communist Party. It was not the success or failure at the polls of
individual </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>aspirants to position that seemed to matter. The
Communist Party of India claimed that Telengana and Andhra were<i> </i>their
strong holds and that the capture of power in Andhra was but the prelude to the
eventual establishment of Communist rule in the Republic of India. And then
challenge was met at the all-India level. The coming together of the Congress
Party and parties like the Praja and the Krishikar Lok–which had broken away
from the Congress at the previous General Election–was an event of great
significance. ‘Pandit Nehru, President Dhebar, Sri S. K. Patil and other
top-ranking leaders made it their business to spread the message of the
Congress Front, and to win an over-whelming majority for it. The fight was
rightly envisaged as one between Democracy and the forces arrayed against it.
Those forces had for the time being agreed to experiment with the Parliamentary
programme. But their faith in extra-parliamentary methods, and their adherence
to extra-territorial loyalties continued unabated. Their election speeches were
not calculated to allay the legitimate fears of the ‘middle’ sections of the
Andhra electorate,–that Communist rule would spell the violent uprooting of
civil rights and the planting of an autocratic regime, functioning at the
dictation of a foreign Power. The desire for ordered evolutionary Progress and
for parliamentary institutions asserted itself. The brilliant success of the
Congress Front was welcomed by lovers of Democracy. They heaved a sigh of
relief, even while they recognised that certain sections of the people were
solidly behind the Communists and had managed to poll nearly 30 per cent of the
total number of votes cast at the elections, though the number of the seats won
was only 15 in a House of 196.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>Churchill Retires</h3>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Scholar,
statesman and organiser of victory, Sir Winston Churchill has played a
distinguished role in the history of our time. In office or outside, his was a career
which always won public attention. He was a scion of the great ducal family of
the Marlboroughs, and could himself have become a Duke in his own right. But
like his predecessors in the Prime-Ministership, Pitt and Gladstone, he was
essentially a democrat. The House of Commons was the chosen arena for the
display of his marvelous oratorical gifts; the lively atmosphere of debate was,
to him, as the breath of his nostrils. Party loyalties did not fetter him, and
during critical periods in the nation’s history, he ploughed a lonely furrow.
While everyone in India and England rejoiced at the conclusion of the
Gandhi-Irwin Pact of 1930, Churchill was aghast at the sight of ‘a half-naked
Fakir’ going up the steps of the Viceroy’s House in New Delhi and dictating
terms to the august representatives of the British Empire. When the Government
of India Act of 1935 was on the anvil, Churchill was almost alone in his
opposition to any measure of self-government for India. Even a little prior to
the passing of the Independence Act, he declared that he had not become the
King’s Minister in order to preside over the dismemberment of the Empire. And
yet his rooted conservatism did not prevent his acquiescing in the recognition
of Indian Independence, when it became an accomplished fact. Being a realist he
would accept a situation when it seemed inevitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Churchill
had a feeling that he was a man of destiny. When things seemed to go wrong
during the second World War, he did not hesitate to organise the
anti-Chamberlain movement, and to take over power at the helm in order to win
victory for Britain and her allies. He was following in the footsteps of Lloyd
George who displaced Asquith in the first World War. While Churchill was a
great believer in peace, he would always keep the powder dry. He would never
set himself be taken unawares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

future of Literature and the Fine Arts in India has become a matter of

Academies within </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

passing through a phase of unrest and uncertainty. This is true of all realms

this period of transition, when a people who have won their political freedom
are seeking to express themselves through Art and Letters, there is need for a
co-ordination of effort between the representatives of different schools. Such
co-ordination is being hindered by the importation into the field of culture of
warring ideologies which prevail in the political and economic spheres. It is
not necessary to enter into a detailed discussion of the conflicting claims of
literature and propaganda. But it must be obvious to thinking persons that the
rift between the old and the new is bound to affect adversely the cultural life
of the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Academies could widen the scope of their activity and arrange group
conferences in different parts of the Indian Union, the resulting contacts may
be expected to bridge the gulf. The effort must be to bring together not merely
the representatives of divergent linguistic regions, but also the divergent groups
within each region. The award of prizes, the publication of anthologies, and
the conferment of titles are indeed of great importance. But in addition to
recognising persons of proved merit, it is necessary </span><span

create the conditions in which poets and artists who have yet to achieve
distinction can pursue their activities with the certainty that </span><span

year in the secondary school course to make adequate provision for separate
training for students whose educational career will cease with the secondary

proceed to the University with the academic and linguistic training necessary

decisions have to be taken on the various issues that arise, after full
discussion and consultation with all the parties concerned. There is every
reason to hope for valuable results provided the changes are introduced
gradually so as to avoid undue dislocation or inconvenience. The Central and
State Governments should come forward with liberal financial assistance to the
managements of all educational institutions affected, to enable them to adapt
themselves to the new situation. The first Degree course has to be organised as
a general educational course, avoiding over-specialisation and reserving
specialisation to the post-graduate stage. Adequate arrangements for real and

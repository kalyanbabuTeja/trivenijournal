<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
spiritually-illumined soul radiating a fragrance of purity, an inspired mystic <span
class=SpellE>harmonising</span> in him all that was best and noblest in the
Indian heritage and the Western tradition, an apostle of India’s hoary
spiritual culture, a torch-bearer of an enlightened age of harmony and
understanding and a great servant of the suffering humanity whose love and
compassion overflowed to embrace birds and beasts, Sri T. L. <span
class=SpellE>Vasvani</span> reverentially called ‘<span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span>’,
meaning elder brother, was an illustrious son of Mother India who offered his
all in the <span class=SpellE>Yajna</span> of restoring India once again to its
former greatness–spiritual as well as material. Belonging to the select galaxy
of the seers and sages of this holy land, <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> <span
class=SpellE>Vasvani</span>, constantly inspired by the vision of India’s
revival to <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> her world mission, called upon the
youth of the country to imbibe the message of <span class=SpellE>Shakti</span>
preached by Swami Vivekananda and break the shackles of slavery binding the Mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
god-intoxicated savant, he had unshakable faith in the limit­less power of the
human soul and the ultimate triumph of the humanity <span class=SpellE>centring</span>
round “new knowledge, new power and new capacity”. In a world beset with the
unceasing conflict between the old and new, <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span>
formed a golden link between the ancient and modern. His sweet and all embracing
compassion made him believe in the fellowship with all creation. “The creation
of God,” he said, “is bound by golden chains to the feet of one God, the one divine
father of us all.” Endowed with the myriad qualities of head and heart, his
life was like a rainbow reflecting the varied hues of the earth below and
heaven above.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
a messenger of equality and brotherhood, he strived to clear the fog of
sectarian <span class=SpellE>strifes</span> and quarrels in the name of
religion, and enshrine in the hearts of men the true religion of service,
compassion and spiritual beauty. All scriptures, he asserted, are but the
repository of spiritual wisdom propounding the unity that transcends the
barriers of clime, creed and nationality. Communism too, he felt enshrined a
truth to which it owed its dynamic character. “I belong to no sect,” he said, “I
adore but one God. And my faith is to worship the one Master and to do <span
class=GramE>good</span> to all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=SpellE>Dadaji</span>, for whom the service of the suppressed and
depressed was the highest worship of the supreme, till the last day of his
earthly sojourn gave solace and <span class=SpellE>soccour</span> to the broken
and bereaved ones. Every human being, every creature for that matter, was to
him an image of divine beauty. Out of the abundance of the God <span
class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> received abundantly and he shared his abundant gifts
with the poor and needy. “The noblest temple,” says <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Dadaji</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> “is the heart of a
poor man who gets his food and who blesses the name of God.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Indeed,
his life was a shining saga of service and sacrifice radiating spiritual beauty
and divine fragrance. Everyday sitting under the trees he loved, he gave unto
the downtrodden, the poor and the miserable ones whatever he had – money, food,
clothing and more than anything else, the healing touch of his Godly heart.
About his unassuming humility and utter simplicity J. P. <span class=SpellE>Vasvani</span>
says: “There was a time when he rubbed shoulders with the tallest in the land.
In those days his name was coupled with those of Mahatma Gandhi and
Rabindranath Tagore as one of the three leader of New India. But he chose to
walk the humble way of life. He made his life an offering at the altar of
suffering humanity.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Born
on November 25, 1879, in Hyderabad <span class=SpellE>Sind</span>–the blessed land
of spiritual sublimity associated with the Vedic seers and Muslim mystics and
fakirs, contemplatives and men of renunciation – after a brilliant academic
record he earned his master’s degree in English at the age of 22. After passing
the M. A. examination he joined as Professor in the famous Metropolitan College
of Calcutta. Calcutta, which was then the nerve-centre and throbbing-heart of
the revolutionary activities in India, played a significant role in <span
class=SpellE>channelising</span> his patriotic aspirations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
India’s representative, he thrilled the select audience at the World Congress
of Religions by his inspiring and enlightening speech on India’s ancient
heritage. He was then only 30 years of age. His subsequent lectures and
speeches in different parts of Europe aroused deep interest in Indian thought
and religion and linked many with him in India’s mission of help and healing.
He set on fire the hearts of many with the vision to make the wisdom of India’s
seers and sages world-dynamic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
passing away of his mother when he was 40 years of age severed his only link
with the mundane world and kindled his <span class=SpellE>smouldering</span>
fire of renunciation and service: he resigned his lucrative job and dedicated
himself to the service of the nation and people. He renounced everything to
become “<span class=GramE>an</span> humble servant of India and the <span
class=SpellE>Rishis</span>.” He entered the arena of freedom struggle without
any fanfare or publicity.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>While
most of the leaders guiding the destiny of the people were working with the
whole and sole aim of driving away British from India, <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span>
had his vision <span class=SpellE>rivetted</span> on preparing a cadre of young
men of strong moral <span class=SpellE>fibre</span> and burning patriotism for
nation-building activities. British, he said, should leave India sooner or
later. But that was only a small part of the struggle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was at this time that the charismatic personality of Mahatma Gandhi had
appeared on the Indian scene with the launching of the unique Satyagraha
movement. As one of the supporters of Mahatma Gandhi he was actively associated
with the “Young India” started by Gandhiji to propagate the message of
Satyagraha. The very first article on the front page of the inaugural issue was
an article by <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> was a profound scholar and a writer of eminence
blessed with the abundant gifts of muse. A prolific and spirited writer in
English and Sindhi he wrote a spate of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>books</span>–<i>India:
Arise, Awake, Young India, India’s Adventure, India in Chains, The Secret of Asia,
My Motherland, Builders of Tomorrow, Apostles of Freedom</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>–all<i> </i></span>of which breath an air of
intense patriotism urging the youths to dedicate their lives to the service of
the Motherland. These inspiring books which fired the sensitivity of the youths
to fight the brute force of the imperialist rulers were proscribed by the
British Government. Through his writings he renewed the inner life of India,
and inspired by the truth of renunciation, brotherhood and love, he transformed
the social life of countless people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=SpellE>Realising</span> the importance of the vital field of education in
nation-building, <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> turned his attention to
education and other spheres with an emphasis on character-building. Inspired by
the faith in the youths of India whom <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> felt can
change the destiny of the <span class=GramE>country,</span> he started “youth <span
class=SpellE>centres</span>” all over India. He asserted again and again that
India’s youth were the destined leaders of the nation. His message to young
India was: “Be simple, be manly, be strong and spend your strength for the poor
and broken ones.” As a worshipper of <span class=SpellE>Shakti</span>, he
pleaded for the birth of a “new physical culture, a new spirit of adventure, a
new love of danger and difficulty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
laid stress on orienting the whole set up of education to further India’s
mission of service and sacrifice. “Our schools and colleges” he said, “are
prison cells. They keep out the sunshine of Indian ideals and culture. This
isolation of modern India’s brain from the mighty souls that made <span
class=SpellE>Aryavarta</span> a model nation in the long – this is the tragedy
of our life today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
humanitarian to the core, he moved across the length and breadth of the country
to see and study the miserable conditions under which the peasant masses live.
Pleading for a peasant renaissance, he remarked: “Give land to the poor and
teach them scientific methods of intensive agriculture and co-operative
organisation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1933, <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> founded the “Meera movement in education”
which has today its headquarters in Poona. Its basic objectives were imparting
moral training to the youth and preparing them for nation-building activities.
The movement which was originally started in <span class=SpellE>Sindh</span>
was cruelly uprooted from its native soil in the holocaust of partition setting
at naught the best efforts of the enlightened men of <span class=SpellE>Sind</span>.
It was the unbounded faith of <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> in human
goodness that enabled him to recreate on the Indian soil the network of
institutions that had built-up over many years in <span class=SpellE>Sind</span>.
The Meera movement is aimed at enriching students with the vital truths of
modern life at the same time making them grasp Indian ideals and Indian
culture, at once idealistic and spiritual. In 1962, he started St. Meera’s
College for Women at Poona, the opening ceremony of which was per­formed by Dr.
Radhakrishnan, the then President of India. The college is inspired by the
faith that in the new unfolding of India’s destiny women have to play an
important role. “The women soul” said <span class=SpellE>Dadaji</span> “shall
lead us upwards, on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Under
the ever-living inspiration of <span class=SpellE>Dadaji’s</span> dynamic
spirit was founded a number of institutions which continue to perform the
humanitarian activities. They include two charitable dispensaries where
hundreds of poor patients receive free medical aid; a welfare department which
gives help in cash and kind to the poor and needy; St. Meera’s educational
institutions where education is given free to poor students; ‘<span
class=SpellE>Jiva</span> <span class=SpellE>Daya</span>’ department, dedicated
to the service of birds and beasts; a publication department which publishes
books and journals interpreting the wisdom of East to West – Meera and the
East-West series brought out by the depart­ment continue to disseminate the
message <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>world peace, compas­sion
to all creatures and the harmony of East and West.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
a large number <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>people who
used to flock to him to listen his words <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>compassion and love, his advice was: “Religion is not a creed or dogma:
creeds are but broken reeds. Not decorated temples but in the broken cottages <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the poor is the great God wiping
the tears <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the widow and
orphan and singing his new Gita for the new age.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
was an eloquent speaker and gifted orator. The music of his rich voice was an
inspiration to the listener to tread on the path <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>blessedness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
him, like St. Francis of <span class=SpellE>Assissi</span>, birds and beasts
were brothers and sisters. He greeted them and poured upon them the love <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>his heart. “Kill not animals,” he
said “kill only the animal within thee, thy little ego.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>His
earthly pilgrimage ended on 16th January, 1966. Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first
President <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>Free India, paying
rich tributes to <span class=SpellE>Dadaji’s</span> many-<span class=SpellE>splendoured</span>
life, remarked: “The life of <span class=SpellE>Vasvaniji</span> has been a
saga <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>unassuming service,
spiritual illumination and a source of inspiration to us all.”</p>

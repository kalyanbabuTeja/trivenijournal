style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wordsworth
was primarily a poet. He was neither drawn to nor was interested in literary
criticism in the way and to the degree his friend and collaborator <span
class=SpellE>Coleridge</span> was. Yet Wordsworth meditated deeply on those
problems which relate to the vocation of poetry in general and the kind of
poetry he was then writing in particular. This is quite inevitable because
every creative writer introduces a new possibility in the realm of art which
demands proper evaluation. Constant revaluation of the past in terms of the
present is an important factor which sustains the function of
criticism-explication and elucidation in response to the substantive dictates
of a modified sensibility. It demonstrates the incongruity between new
experience and old expression. Every moment in poetry is <span class=SpellE>characterised</span>
by human self in crisis which urges reaction against the modes both obsolete
and obsolescent. It proves all too clearly that the old modes have lost their
potential for creative experiment having exhausted the native strength of their
idiom. This is the historical dialectics of poetry. The burden of the past is
not jettisoned; its usability is under ceaseless review. What is often regarded
as finally shed, leaves its subtle impact on its consequent.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Romantic <span class=GramE>movement</span> represents a definite stage in this
dialectic and Wordsworth is its spokesman. In his criticism of the limitations
of the past and in his plan for the present and concern for the future, he has
in his mind the undeniable obligation of criticism as part of a literary
revolution. It has to establish the literary values in a world that sets a high
premium on power and scientific <span class=SpellE>methodicity</span>. The
critic must discover the avenues for existence and assert the unique validity
of humanity. This critical principle has prompted Wordsworth to state his
thoughts on poetry and its function clearly and cogently in his famous <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Preface </i>to the second edition of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lyrical Ballads </i>in 1800. When the first
edition of the slender volume of poems was launched forth two years earlier by
Wordsworth in collaboration with <span class=SpellE>Coleridge</span> it did not
meet with immediate success. <span class=SpellE>Hazlitt</span> complained that
the un-accountable mixture of seeming simplicity and real abstruseness in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lyrical Ballads </i>was such that fools
laughed at it and wise men scarcely understood. He went on to compliment
Wordsworth on his remarkable originality <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Ballads </i>which brought him the lonely
eminence in that the vulgar did not read them, the learned did not understand
them and the great despised them.<sup>1</sup> Six years after its publication,
it was thus greeted by a reviewer in Philadelphia: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

know few performances which have assumed the name of poetry and which have
obtained a considerable share of celebrity, <span class=GramE>so</span> truly
worthless as Wordsworth’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lyrical

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact immediate success would have simply surprised Wordsworth himself. He was
conscious that it was an innovation in matter and style which by its very
nature could never find ready and acquiescent audience. The strength and
validity of an innovation are, not infrequently, in direct proportion to the
measure of resistance it provokes and meets effectively. Quiet acceptance is
silent absorption which is worse than flagrant denouncement. In the case of <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, the absence of resistance would have assuredly meant that the 18th
century classicism discovered no appreciable challenge in it to its
continuance. Wordsworth would have felt sad, had he found that his new efforts
were just in consonance with “the present public taste.” This was not to be. He
was glad. Before he wrote the <i>Preface</i>, Wordsworth had read a good many
reviews of his new venture, and he was able to reflect on the sort of
objections his poems were meeting. In spite of his initial reluctance to <span
class=SpellE>theorise</span>, he took great care to defend the principles of
poetic art on which his collection was based. The <i>Preface</i> thus came to
be “a remarkably literate, coherent and rich analysis of what Wordsworth felt
throughout his literary career to be the central topics of criticism”.<sup>3</sup>
He made himself clear on the vital points–the poet, the poetry, its subjects,
aims and style. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Preface </i>can be
regarded as the manifesto of the Romantic poetry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wordsworth
believes that a creative artist is obliged to be articulate about the
principles of art that shape and mould his practice. In agreement with <span
class=SpellE>Coleridge</span> he states that “every great and original writer,
in proportion as he is great and original, must himself create the taste by
which he is to be relished; he must teach the art by which be is to be seen”.<sup>
4</sup> The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Preface </i>as a theoretical
statement is merely a necessary part of the educative programme without which
informed taste could never be consolidated to welcome and establish the new
school in opposition to the old. He persuaded to do it as he had “a deep
impression of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind,
and likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act upon
it, which are equally inherent and indestructible”.<sup>5</sup> For Wordsworth
the first volume of his poems was “an experiment...to ascertain how far, by
fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a
state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that quality of pleasure
may be imparted, which a poem may rationally <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>
to impart”.<sup>6</sup> This experiment, he was sure, would be greeted with
derision and not a few might wonder by “what species of courtesy” this could be
called poetry. Wordsworth was convinced that he shocked the old sensibilities
into new awareness and it was his duty to win them to his school by “a
systematic <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of the theory upon which the poems
were written.” In what follows an attempt is made to study a few concepts of
his <span class=SpellE>defence</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
<span class=SpellE>defence</span> has necessitated a new <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>look</span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>at what perennially constitutes all literary inquiry: the poet,
the poetry, its nature and aims. “The poet,” Wordsworth states, “is a man who
being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility, had also thought long
and deeply.” He is a responsible visionary firmly rooted to the earth with an
uncanny sense of fact. His active participation in the experience shared by all
enables him to see into the heart of things. Wordsworth defines the poet with
disarming simplicity as “a man speaking to men.” This trite and seemingly
commonplace assertion has for its authenticity the whole French <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Revolution </i>behind it. The charismatic
triad of slogans <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>–<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Liberty</st1:place></st1:City>, Equality </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fraternity</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>–have</span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>permeated his
sensibility and consequently for him the poet, the hoary visionary descends
from his high altitudes to mingle with men and make his visions realistic. The
definition of Wordsworth has put quite a few qualifying clauses behind its
simple exterior. It proceeds further to reveal that he is endowed with more
lively sensibility, a more enthusiasm and tenderness, a greater knowledge of
human nature and a more comprehensive soul. He is a man pleased with his own
passions and volitions and he rejoices in the spirit of life that is in him. He
has acquired from practice a greater readiness and power in expressing what he
thinks and feels. The thoughts and feelings arise in him by <span class=GramE>his
own</span> choice, or from the structure of his own mind without external
excitement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
the addition of all these clauses, it appears that the poet who is introduced
as a man speaking to other men ceased to be as simple as that. He has the power
and ability to an extraordinary degree to display thought and feeling. The
external fact and human self act and react, and the process is continuous. He does
not, however, merely adhere to the fact in order to copy or report faithfully.
Although he has “the general passions and thoughts and feelings of men” he
should <span class=SpellE>realise</span> the need to impart “immediate pleasure
to a human being possessed of that information which may be expected from
him...as a <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Man.</st1:place></st1:State>”
The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>thought-feeling </i>concept leads
Wordsworth deep into the nature of the poet in terms of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>relationship </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>love. </i>Poet
regards Nature and Man “as essentially adapted to each other” and the mind of
man for him is “the mirror of the fairest and most interesting properties of
Nature.” Wordsworth believes that the mind has the innate capacity to
co-operate with this “active universe” and to modify it in perceiving it. It is
“working but in alliance with the works/which it beholds”.<sup>7</sup> He
maintains that the discerning intellect of Man is “wedded to this goodly
universe / in love and holy passion”.<sup> 8</sup> He would chant “the spousal
verse / of his great consummation.” His voice would proclaim, “How <span
class=SpellE>exquisitively</span> the individual Mind to the external world/is
fitted, and how <span class=SpellE>exquisitively</span> too...The external
world is fitted to the mind.” This intimate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>relationship
</i>discovered through holy passion would win him <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>love. </i>Poet perceives the ceaseless process of interaction of Man
and Nature to produce “an infinite complexity of pain and pleasure.” His deep
contemplation has brought home the fact that objects everywhere are accompanied
by “an overbalance of enjoyment.” The subjective experience of enjoyment in
perception facilitates the objective <span class=SpellE>realisation</span> of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pleasure. </i>The pleasure principle is no
degradation of the poet’s art. One who looks at the world in the spirit of love
would know that “It is an acknowledgement of the beauty...it is a homage paid
to the native and naked dignity of man”.<sup>9</sup> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Pleasure </i>is born of the happy ‘spousal’ of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Thought and Feeling </i>on the one hand and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>relationship </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>love </i>on
the other. It is an attribute to the consummate artistic achievement. Northrop
Frye comments that, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
any literary work is emotionally ‘depressing,’ there is something wrong with
either the writing or the reader’s response. Art seems to produce a kind of
buoyancy which, though often called pleasure, as it is for instance by
Wordsworth, is something more inclusive than pleasure.<sup> 10</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wordsworth
indicates its inclusive nature in his assertion that by the grand elementary
principle of pleasure man “knows, and feels and loves and moves.” In other
words, Man has his entire being in pleasure. Wordsworth’s emphasis on pleasure
goes much deeper than this. The poet, Wordsworth feels<span class=GramE>,</span>
works under the only restraint of giving pleasure and no other obligation would
ever bind him. His ability to evoke pleasure derives its sustenance from his
abundant enjoyment of self, and it is not divorced from the experience of fact.
Celebration of feeling and pleasure to the neglect of fact would lead the poet
into the workings of fancy, an inferior agency which brings in its train
allegories and exploded mythologies. Devotion to fact in exclusion of feeling
would, on the contrary, make an odious presentation of sensory data in verse.
Prof. Basil Willey has shown convincingly how delicately Wordsworth balances
his statement that poetry should deal boldly with substantial things under the
poetic obligation of imparting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pleasure. </i>The
entire discussion converges into the subtle and pivotal distinction of
“imaginary” from “imaginative.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Being
“the rock of <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of human nature” poet will
follow “an atmosphere of sensation.” Even the scientific knowledge with its
positivistic reductions is welcome to his domain where his <span class=SpellE>humanising</span>
power is at work. Wordsworth makes it boldly clear: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

those general indirect effects, but he will be at his side, carrying sensation
into the midst of the objects of the science itself...if the time should ever
come when these things shall be familiar to us, and the relations under which
they are contemplated...shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying
and suffering beings.<sup> 11</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the pursuit of scientific knowledge, the pleasure obtained by the scientist is
essentially subjective and does not lend itself to expression. The poet on the
other hand feels, communicates and thus enables men to share it. Wordsworth
suggests that while in the vocation of scientist <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

</i>is present as its essence. Poet matters as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the deep <span class=SpellE>realisation</span> of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

becomes an “upholder and preserver” of human nature. He will find the vast
empire of human society “in spite of difference of soil and climate, of
language and manners, of laws and customs: in spite of things silently gone out
of mind, and things violently destroyed.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

inadequate. The injustice done to this important definition in critical analyses
is largely due to the failure to read it in connection with earlier remarks. It
is in fact inseparably connected with the source and purpose of poetry. Almost
all the critics who have taken an anti-Romantic stance have picked up “the
spontaneous overflow” in isolation as their starting point. Wordsworth, it
should be remembered, has never undermined the importance of conscience and
deliberate efforts on the part of the poet. He has pointedly said that poet has
no divine afflatus. He has a purpose and an obligation. When the poet is
conscious of obligations, duties and purposes of his art, he cannot in the same
breath be unconscious of what he is doing while doing it. This compels a new
look at the “spontaneous.” The word does not mean automatic or frenzied
outburst. The poetry has its origin in the sensibility which is found in “a
man...who had also thought long and deeply.” Wordsworth is not simply repeating
the central premises of Romantic criticism–the importance of poet’s mind and
passions and the usual belief that creation is natural, automatic and
effortless. The emotion alone would not become poetry. Neither its sudden
expression. It is contemplated till the <span class=SpellE>tranquillity</span>
disappears and “an emotion kindred to that which was before the subject of
contemplation is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the
mind.” These remarks should be read in the context of the primacy of pleasure
in poetry. Poet should be able “to excite rational sympathy.” His expression is
bodied forth deliberately with common experience for its source “as other men
express themselves.” Poetry, as Wordsworth finds it, cannot be fanciful,
imaginary and fantastic. It alone has the power to lend ‘divine spirit’ to
science and welcome it as “a genuine inmate of the household of man.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

strictures of old themes and dry poetic diction. Wordsworth found that there
was no essential difference between the two modes of language employed in prose
and poetry. He repeatedly asserts with emphasis that the language of a large
portion of every good poem, save with reference to <span class=SpellE>metre</span>,
is no different from that of prose when it is well written. Wordsworth is
echoed subtly when Eliot remarks that poetry should be written <span
class=SpellE>atleast</span> as well as prose. Nevertheless he is undeservedly
mauled for his comments on poetic diction and the importance of <span
class=SpellE>metre</span>. In regard to poetic diction all that Wordsworth
wants to state categorically is that new authentic and realistic experience of
the poet can never find adequate expression in old inauthentic and stale
vocabulary which he may inherit as family property. It is difficult to disagree
with Wordsworth on basic issues. He has however failed to be precise and clear
about <span class=SpellE>metre</span>. His view that a selection of the spoken
language made with true taste and feeling and “if <span class=SpellE>metre</span>
be superadded thereto” would establish its own distinction, has landed him into
endless trouble. <span class=SpellE>Coleridge</span> in his <span class=SpellE><i>Biographia</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Literaria</span> </i>led not a very friendly attack on
Wordsworth for his views. It must be admitted that the <span class=SpellE>Wordsworthian</span>
belief that <span class=SpellE>metre</span> could be Superadded is unfortunate
and indefensible. It very much needed and deserved the <span class=SpellE>Coleridgean</span>
check. The critical battle on poetic diction and <span class=SpellE>metre</span>
has a long history. A large bulk of adverse criticism has however banked on the
supposed description <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Preface </i>of the <span class=SpellE>metre</span>
as “superadded charm.” What amuses one <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is</span><i

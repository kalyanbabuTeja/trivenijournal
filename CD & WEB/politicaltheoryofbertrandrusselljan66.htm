Russell is an acknowledged philosopher and his contributions to mathematical
philosophy are acclaimed as unique. It is, however, doubtful, if the same is
equally true of Bertrand Russell’s role as a political thinker. The political
and social theories of Russell are notable for their immediate concern for the
predicament of mankind in our times. But the intellectual fervour that is
characteristic of Lord Russell’s philosophy is also manifest in his
encyclopaedic writings on the perennial questions of political theory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Politics
is very much in his line. Bertrand Russell’s grandfather, Lord John Russell was
twice Prime Minister of England. In an essay on Lord John Russell, Bertrand
Russell remarks that “His greatest achievement was the carrying of the Reform
Bill in 1832, which started Britain on the course that led to complete
democracy.” <sup>l</sup> Bertrand Russell’s father, Viscount Amberly was an
ardent liberal and came under the influence of that “Saint of Rationalism”,
John Stuart Mill. The Russells have been conspicuous as Whigs for generations.
Their ancestors played an important part in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.
One of their famous heros, William Lord Russell was executed for his resistance
to Charles II<sup>2</sup>. The duty of public service, even if it meant an
unpopular course, is inherited by Bertrand Russell from more than one source. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Russell’s
interest in public life began early in his life when, as a young man of great
intellectual distinction, he was working on his unique work <i>Principia
Mathematica </i>from 1903 to 1910. At this time, questions of Free Trade and
Woman’s Suffrage were being discussed by the Conservatives and Liberals.
Political life in England was in a ferment. Russell had been brought up as a
liberal, and his sympathies were unmistakably on the side of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>liberal
cause. In pursuit of his conviction, he even decided to enter Parliament.
Bertrand Russell has offered candidature three times for the House of Commons.
In 1907, Russell stood for Parliament as a Liberal candidate. Again, in the
General Elections of 1922 and 1923, at Chelsea, he stood for Parliament as
Labour candidates. In all the cases, Russell has been defeated. Though he has
conducted his election campaigns with scrupulous regard to his principles and
views, his failure to go to the Parliament is perhaps not unexpected. As Sir
Charles Trevelyan, a close friend of Bertrand Russell, remarked, “Russell, was far
too uncompromising to be a success as a politician”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is the loss in practical politics turns out to be the gain for political
theory. For a philosopher like Bertrand Russell, there is a more significant
role in the realm of ideas. The service of thought is a more exacting duty
which demands from the thinker exceptional qualities of courage and integrity.
Both of them are exemplified to an eminent degree in the life-work of Lord
Russell. His writings are as voluminous as the causes he champions are
extensive. The contemporary scene is a witness to their profound influence, the
value of which is never in dispute. In the long and varied career of Bertrand
Russell, at least three phases are noticeable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the first phase, Russell continues the liberalism of J. S. Mill when it is
subjected to a crucial test. During the World War I and its aftermath the
freedom of the citizen was threatened by the encroaching demands of the State.
The political and economic crisis that eventually became unavoidable greatly
diminished the initiative of the individual and the group. Bertrand Russell has
an abiding concern for the liberty of the individual. When the increasing power
of the State tends to restrict the autonomy of the individual’s life, Russell
questions the very basis of State-action. The Supreme power of the State is
never more manifest than in the instance of war. The experience of World War I
proved this…..beyond any doubt. Writing in 1915 on the State, Bertrand Russell
remarks: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
fatal tendency, unless it is effectively resisted by groups and persons, soon
results in the total absence of individuality. When increasing numbers of the
citizens disown the impulse to assert their own ideas and judgments on various
problems of human life, the very habit of free thought and discussion may be
severely curtailed. That this can very nearly happen has been recently
demonstrated by the overorganized governments of the totalitarian states. The
purpose of any worthwhile political organization must, therefore, be directed
to preserve and cherish the infinite value of the individual. If society cannot
sustain this for one reason or another, Russell argues, “human beings cease to
be individual and they become machine made”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:

Like John Dewey, who was deeply concerned with the ‘lost’ individual and his
‘recovery’ in his theme on individuality, Bertrand Russell vigorously pleads
for a continuous search for individuality. In a book on political ideals,
written in 1917, Bertrand Russell says: “In a human being, provided he has not
been crushed by the economic or governmental machine, there is...individuality,
a something distinctive without which no man or woman can...retain the full
dignity which is native to human beings….To preserve and strengthen the impulse
that makes for individuality should be the foremost object of all political
institutions”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sovereign importance of the individual is cardinal to Bertrand Russell’s political
philosophy. He repeatedly shows how the great advances of society are very
largely due to the creative initiative of the few exceptionally endowed
individuals. It is their genius for innovation that has greatly enriched the
communities in such significant aspects of life as art, literature, philosophy,
religion and science. It is by the cultivation of the individual that the
principle of growth is ensured. In his book <i>Roads to Freedom, </i>first </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>published
in 1918, Russell maintains: “A good community does not spring from the glory of
the State, but from the unfettered development of the individuals...from
congenial work giving opportunity for whatever constructiveness each man or
woman may possess, from free personal relations embodying love and taking away
the roots of envy….and above all from the joy of life and its expression in the
spontaneous creations of art and science. It is these things that make an age
or a nation worthy of existence, and these things are not to be secured by
bowing down before the State. It is the individual in whom all that is good
must be realized, and the free growth of the individual must be the supreme and
of a political system which is to refashion the world.”<sup> 7</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
problem of the individual’s relationship to the political authority is a
recurring question in the versatile writings of Russell. It has been revived in
more than one <i>source </i>by him. When Earl Russell has been invited to
deliver the first B. B. C. Reith Lecture <sup>8</sup> in 1948, he has devoted
the whole series to a timely discussion of this topic. These lectures, which
have been subsequently published under the title <i>Authority and Individual, </i>revive
the ancient issue in the new context of a Welfare State. The numerous
difficulties of reconciling private initiative with public order are all
analysed by Russell with his characteristic insight into the problem. He does
not minimize the overwhelming need for “social cohesion”. <sup>8</sup> Even
here, Russell is predominantly preoccupied with the defence of the liberty of
the individual against authority. His view of a World Government is necessarily
limited to the essential functions of eliminating war. He recommends that
national governments will do well by delegating as many powers as possible to
regional authorities. The residual powers are vested by Bertrand Russell in the
individual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Russell’s
interest in the individual is not confined to his theoretical work alone. His
deep sympathies with this cause are extended to its defence under trying
circumstances and constant formulation of the means for its implementation. As
a rule, Russell’s choice for championing the individual freedom is limited to
the traditional methods of education and propaganda within the framework or the
law. Bertrand Russell says: “I am a British Whig, with a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>British
love of compromise and moderation.”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
His acceptance of the constitutional means is not unqualified. In a situation
involving a total crisis, the conventional method of constitutional activity
may be completely ineffective. The new challenge may demand a method beyond
constitutional politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

World War I constituted such a confrontation to the conscience of man. The
cherished values of the dignity of human life and freedom of thought were
suddenly disregarded and violated. As a pacifist, for supporting conscientious
objection during the war, Bertrand Russell was “sentenced to six months’
imprisonment” at Brixton Prison in May 1918.</span><sup><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
With courting arrest for the cause of individual liberty in the war-time,
Russell’s approval of a method of direct action to promote the supremely valid
right of conscience under most trying circumstances becomes obvious. A few
others of Russell’s contemporaries are also conspicuous for their love of
liberty and the freedom of the individual. They are, however, rarely known to
justify a technique of direct action for the realization of political and
social objectives. Prof. H. J. Laski shared Bertrand Russell’s passion (at
least at the time of World War I) for individual liberty. But even a
consideration of such a mode of action was hardly in evidence in the prolific
writings of Laski. Though the classical scholar of Cambridge, Sir Ernest Barker
enunciated the arresting theme of <i>the Discredited State </i>(1915), his
pluralistic conclusions had little bearing on the possibility of non-violent
direct action. It is clearly the distinction of Bertrand Russell<i> </i>to have
justified the use of the non-violent means; and to have exemplified in action
what he has justified in theory is a far greater service that Russell has done
to the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

individualism coexists with anarchism. It is a kind of anarchism that is
advocated by Kropotkin rather than Bakunin. Indeed, in the admirable survey of
political theories of Freedom, Russell has undertaken a detailed examination of<i>
</i>the constructive proposals of Kropotkin for organizing society on the
anarchist principles.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

is sympathetic and convincing. Russell sees no reason in force and violence as
methods for bringing about a radical transformation of the State. While he
hopes to explore the usefulness of education and persuasion for this purpose,
he does not rule out the employment of direct action under certain
circumstances. The note of a philosophic anarchism is obvious in the writings
of Bertrand Russell though he has sometimes stated to the contrary.</span><sup><span

the second phase, Russell turns to the social problem. He visited Soviet Russia
in 1920 and met Lenin and Trotsky among other notables in the Bolshevik
hierarchy. His account of communism in Russia is sharply critical. Russell does
not discount the importance of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Its impact on
the political, social and economic questions of the current social order is
inescapable. It can be neither exaggerated nor under-estimated. The communist
experiment has to be assessed judiciously with a view to determining its faults
and achievements. Russell reviews the conditions of U. S. S. R. in the light of
the communistic theory. He concludes the course of his study of the Soviet
system in 1920 thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is more sympathetic to guild socialism. His own choice has been stated as

Russell’s strictures of capitalism are never made in the Marxian vein. If he
advocates democratic socialism, it is because he finds in it an alternative to
the totalitarian communism of Karl Marx. Russell’s objection to communism is
uncompromising. He writes on this question: “My objection is not that
capitalism is less bad than the Bolsheviks believe, but that Socialism is less
good, not its best form, but in the only form which is likely to be brought
about by war….In the course of a desperate struggle, the heritage of
civilization is likely to be lost, while hatred, suspicion, and cruelty become
normal in the relations of human beings….for these reasons chiefly, I cannot
support any movement which aims at world revolution”</span><sup><span

Russell’s <i>The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism </i>has been an influential document
in many ways. It is as much an indictment of the Marxian system as it is a
reminder to the socialist movement in England. Russell had begun a searching
criticism of Marxism when he had visited Berlin in 1895 for the purpose of
studying Marxian communism. His accounts of German socialism to the Fabian
Society and the London School of Economics and Political Science have pointed
out the basic implications of communism. In his book <i>German Social Democracy

Marxism.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

his latest book (1963), <i>Unarmed Victory </i>(Pp. 12-13) Bertrand Russell
writes conducively: “I do not like communism beause it is undemocratic. I wrote
a very hostile criticism of it after a visit to Russia in 1920, and the
expectations which I then expressed were fulfilled in the time of Stalin. Both
before and after this time, in 1896 and 1934, I wrote very hostile criticisms
of Marx and I see no reason to recant what I then said…For my part, I am a
believer in democratic socialism. I dislike communism because it is
undemocratic, and capitalism because it favours exploitation”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

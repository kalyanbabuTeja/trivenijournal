Acharya Bhargava is your Guru, and mine too. What dread anger is it, my friend,
that sits on your brow like Vajra in the hands of Indra? When you pronounce the
word ‘Kshatriya’ your frame trembles in anger: your lips curl up in scorn and
flames, as of fire, leap from your eyes. Perhaps, when he taught you archery,
my Guru, Jaamadagni, taught yon his hatred of the Kshatriyas too! May I know
what troubles you?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

You may. I have been greatly hurt: pained: insulted by a Kshatriya and my mind
is still unhinged as a result of that. You must have heard of Yagnasena, the
son of Prishatha. He was my friend and playmate. Once, in an outburst of
affection he told me, “When my father passes away and I become King, I will be
the lord of immense lands and wealth. Come to me then, and I will share my good
fortune with you.” Days passed by, Years too. I was a poor Brahmin with a wife
and son. My powerful son is called Aswatthama. When he was a child, he one day
came to his mother and said “Mother, all my friends talk about something called
milk. They say it has a beautiful taste. Mother, give me some milk.” She burst
into tears and when I came home, I found my child sleeping on her lap, his hair
drenched with her tears. I was shocked and I asked her the reason. She told me.
I felt unhappy too. But suddenly I remembered the words of Drupada. I cheered
her up saying, “Weep not, Kripi. Our days of poverty are at an end. I heard
that my friend, Yagnasena, is now King of Panchala. Let us go to him. He will
give me cows and wealth and we can be happy”. So I went to the court of The
Panchala King. He refused to recognize me. He said no friendship was possible
between a king and a beggar. Full of pain and anger I have come away from
there. From now on, only one thing matters to me, and that is my revenge. My
end and aim is now to train a young Kshatriya in the art of archery and ask him
to fight my foe, Yagnasena, and win too! I have altered my profession from that
of a. Brahmin to that of a Kshatriya.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heroes. If Arjuna will not fight with one who is not a king, I will, this very

My good friend, you are still a simple Brahmin though you do profess to be a
Kshatriya! It was the old, blind King who sent the young Pandavas to
Varanavata. I know of a certain talk between the father and son. Yudhishtira’s
becoming the heir-apparent made the people love him more. They wanted him as
their king. He had endeared himself to everyone by his sweet and noble nature.
Of course this made Suyodhaua greatly jealous: with Sakuni to startle him from
his lethargy, with Bheema rousing his temper at the slightest cause, with the
ever-increasing strife between Arjuna and his beloved Karna becoming more and
more apparent, is it strange that the mind of that young impressionable child
became poisoned slowly, but very surely? Sakuni incited him to a large extent
no doubt. He went to his father one day when he was alone, and poured out his
grievances to that blind and inefficient Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra, as you
must have noticed, is a very complex character. He is very avaricious: at the
same time, he is also afraid. Afraid in this sense–he wants to avoid, if
possible, being known as the wrong doer. Duryodhana went on with his talk. He
went on to say, “I am greatly afraid of this growing popularity of my hated
cousins. I want you to exile them.” His father would not at first listen. He
said: “My son, you do not know what you are saying. The people and my ministers
are fond of Pandu’s son. They are very proud of him. If anything should happen
to Yudhishtira, we will he destroyed.” Suyodhana said: “Of course I know that.
The loyalty of the people depends on the benefits they reap from their king.
Send away the Pandavas and their mother for some time. While they are absent, I
will woo the people with my good work. I am sure to endear myself to them. The
exile can be effected by some gentle means. You are his uncle, and Yudhishtira
has never disobeyed your commands. Make it appear as though you are his
well-wisher and send them all to Varanavata.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dhritarashtra was still dubious. “The idea is
sinful, but let it be. How will Bheeshma, Drona, Kripa, and Vidura take the
proposal of the exile?” Suyodhana, well-tutored by evil Sakuni, had anticipated
the question. “Bheeshma is impartial: indeed, he is indifferent. Aswatthama is
my friend. Drona cannot team up with the opposite party when his son is on my
side. Kripa naturally, must side with these two. Only Vidura is a confirmed
ally of the Pandavas. But what can one low-born man do? Send away Kunti and her
five sons to Varanavata. The rest is in my hands.” Dhritarashtra guessed the
rest and did not ask. The evil plan succeeded and Yudhishtira obeyed his
commands implicitly. Poor, ill-used princes. I knew of this talk only a few
days back. Or else this would never have happened.</p>

call that house of fire by the name ‘Siva’–it makes me shudder to think of the
fate of the victims on that night when it was burnt down. When the Pandava
princes were leaving our Hastinavati, some people went to Yudhishtira and tried
to tell him that he was foolish in submitting to this sudden exile. The young prince
was firm. His parting words were, “To honour and obey my elders is the one rule
that I have always followed. My father has asked me to go there, to Varanavata.
He shall not he disobeyed. I will go. Please bless us and let us go.” Thinking
of them takes me back so many years. Half-forgotten incidents come back to my
mind and it seems to have happened yesterday. My heart bleeds when I think of
my beloved pupil, Partha. He was the essential man of Action, ‘Kriya.’ You must
have heard of the crocodile which tackled me one day when I was bathing in the
Ganges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

see through and through the actions of men. You suggest that I was partial to

archery as an art in itself. He was such a willing pupil. I will explain to you
what I mean. I once had a bird made. It was quite life-like. I had it placed on
almost the topmost branch of a tree. I then called my pupils one by one and,
showing the bird to them, asked them to shoot its head. Yudhishtira was one of
the first to come. He had the bow and arrow in readiness. He was waiting for my
word of command “Shoot” “What do you see?” I asked him. “Do you see the tree
and the branch and the bird/” He replied “Yes”. I said, “Then you are not going
to hit the bird” and sent him away. The same thing happened in case of all the
boys who were called. Then I called Arjuna, and put the same question. “I see
the bird” he replied. After some time I put the same question. “I see the head
of the bird” said Partha. I then said “Shoot” and the head rolled down. The
other pupils were bewildered. How could they understand what I meant?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It was after all these incidents that Partha paid me my Gurudakshina. You know
he captured Drupada alive and brought him to me. The great Drupada gave a
terrible resistance. But my Arjuna was too much for him. Yudhishtira remained
with me and the other four proceeded towards Drupada’s city. Nakula and Sahdeva
were his ‘Chakra-Rakshakas’: they supported his wings, and as usual, Bheemasena
went in advance. Arjuna fought his way through, jumped into the chariot of King
Drupada. Overpowering him he carried him to his own chariot and returned to me
with the royal booty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

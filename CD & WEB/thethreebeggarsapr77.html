saw them twenty years ago for the first time durIng my train journey. There was
still time for the train to depart. I sat near the window. All the three were
cripples. One of them lost his left hand; the other two their right hands. The
three wore loose shirts. Ordinary beggars get into railway carriages, and
trains for begging. Those three begged only on the railway platform, never
entering a compartment and seldom approaching a train. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
three were tall and sturdy. Their faces did not reveal either solicitude or
beggarly weakness. They approached the compartment and just said: “Sir, your
charity to cripples, please.” They walked away if no passenger responded.
Usually the men who lost their right hands begged while the other cripple kept
quiet. He was too proud to beg. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was quite young then. Having received English education, I thought that the
institution of beggary ruined the country, that all beggars were robbers and
that begging ought to be penalised. So I said, “You are like flint. You’re not
sick. Why can’t you do some job?” I did<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>not
know then that those were hard days when able-bodied men found it hard to get
gainful employment. The left-hand-cripple was very angry with my words. He
looked daggers at me. His face became as red as that of the Kabuliwallah who
slept like a log in the compartment. Pucca rowdy of the genuine demoniac race!
I could have observed discreet silence afterwards. “Why do you look at me?”
inadvertently I inquired. “Show me work. I’ll do. Your Lordship has come to
give us employment.” I could not continue the dialogue further. I was
humbled–that town was notorious for rough-necks. There were displayed in the
station seven or eight signboards flashing the warning: “Beware of thieves.” I
was suspicious by habit. Were there as many thieves as there were policemen?
Furthermore, the fellow did not look like a beggar. So I kept quiet. No more
argument. He too kept quiet. And yet I burned inwardly with impotent rage. I
looked at their backs as they withdrew. The ironic smile and gait of the
right-hand-cripples betrayed their feeling that they took me for a wretched
flea or a mosquito. When they cast their stem eyes upon me, I was breathlessly
frightened. They looked at me in the way a magniloquent hero dismisses
contemptuously a fallen and cringing opponent. The left-hand-cripple marched
like a victorious general. Their gestures, facial expression and bearing
appeared so stately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
saw them several times afterwards. They did not beg of me. Had they approached
me, I would have willingly flung a coin at them. Meanwhile my attitude to
beggars had altered. They did not possess any property. They were not educated.
They were not employed. Nor was there any political party to support them. Why
should not one take it for an occupation? True, it was an innocent occupation,
untainted, perhaps the best. Some say it is undignified. Beggary inseparably
linked with humility is not intolerable. Linked with power, it stinks and ruins
the world. Begging by the weak is a natural occupation which hurts none and
tends to mollify one’s self. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Though
I had changed, they had not. They recognised me even after ten years. They did
not even turn towards me. Their reign continued unabated. Presently I admired
royal indifference. They were undaunted and God seemed to be on their side. Who
were they? What was their history? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
wanted to know. And how could I? They were like Lords! One day I went to them
and gave them an anna. They didn’t show any gratitude. Nor was there any
appreciation of my gesture. They kept quiet, perhaps with the thought, “What
else could he do?” Although it was not my native place, I had to frequent it on
business. Each time I went there in the morning and came back in the evening.
On one occasion I had to stay there for four days to complete my assignment. I
lingered through each day with the thought–tomorrow morning or this evening (my
job would be complete). One evening I was free, and so I decided to know them.
“Boy, where do you live?” I inquired. The beggars looked quizzically and went
their way. It was a moonlit night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
the main road was under repairs, I walked into a deserted bylane while
returning from a movie show. I saw four or five men in the middle of the lane.
They seemed to have reconciled after a bitter quarrel. A policeman stood at the
entrance of the lane. Why didn’t he interfere? He would perhaps, if someone
lodged a complaint. No official would bother without a complaint. I was
slightly frightened as I got into the lane at so late an hour. And I proceeded
straight doggedly. If there was any outrage, I might report to the policeman.
As soon as I reached the middle of the road, two or three men in a courtyard
hastened into their house. A stranger emerged and stood in the courtyard. A
close look revealed that he was one of the three beggars, in fact, one of the
right-hand-cripples whom I knew for the last ten years and whom I tried to draw
into conversation. Though I intended to cross the lane silently, I asked him
suddenly whether he lived there. He replied in the affirmative. That was great
condescension on his part, for, he was in no mood to talk. So I left
discreetly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
following night I was on my feet again deliberately. The lane was completely
lonely. Even the policeman was absent. The house of the beggars was kept ajar.
I wondered whether it would be proper for me to enter it. I walked off to the
end of the lane, but came back to it like one frequenting a house of ill fame.
He must have seen my coming. He came out and asked me what business I had with
him. What should I say in reply? How could he ever understand my purpose?
However, I must explain as best as I could. “You see”, I began, I am a poet. I
write novels, short-stories and plays. I know you for the last twelve years. If
I truly sketch your profiles, my countrymen would think mighty big of me. So I
want to understand your secret lives” I said. Although he seemed to understand
my words, he looked with suspicion. After a moment’s piercing look at me in the
moonlit night, he asked me in a purely business-like manner to see him the
following night. He did not address me with courtesy. But, why should he? Where
are differences among men really? With that sobering thought I returned to my
lodge. While I walked, I heard footsteps behind me. He followed me to my lodge.
As I halted before it, he briskly walked past me as though he were going his own
way. I was nonplussed. Did I ask for trouble? I could not get sleep that night
for many hours. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
had two or three queer experiences the following day. One or two strangers
stared at me. In the library that evening, a beggar seemed to spy on me while I
talked to my friends who applauded my latest short-story. Luckily it was about
beggars! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Should
I or should I not meet him at night? I was troubled with a vague dread mixed
with a certain boldness. He was a beggar after all, and so, why so much fuss? I
finally decided to go. During the last two days the front side of their house
was dirty. It now appeared clean-swept. I stood at the door. There was a lamp
burning inside. A mat was spread on the floor. He invited me politely. “What’s
your name?” “Bunganna.” “Where is your family?” “This is my family.” “What are
your daily earnings?” “Earnings, oh! Affluent persons like you ask me to work
and throw an anna on occasion.” He smiled at the dig. “What was the hubbub two
days back here?” He changed the topic. “You’re really a story-writer, I
discovered.” “I suspected that much. Why did you set your secret agents on me?”
“There are police agents to betray us. I thought you’re one of them.” “Once
upon a time I hated beggars. I thought then I would rise to become the District
Collector. Disillusioned now I don’t hate beggars. On the other hand, I write
stories about them and turn out an honest penny.” He smiled, “You earn by
writing stories of us, but you don’t give us even a part of your royalty.”
“This time I’ll share my fee with you” I said “Don’t worry. You may be poor
too. I’ve only my mouth to feed. Excluding all cuts, I get five or six rupees
per day for my share.” I wanted some precise information of these cuts. He was
not prepared to divulge without obtaining his leader’s permission. His leader
was the left-hand-cripple. I then wanted to know his early life. Even for
talking about it, he wanted his leader’s permission. However, he solemnly
promised to obtain it. I wanted him to swear by putting his hand in mine. “Is
my left hand acceptable (for swearing)?” he smiled. His wit, humour and polish
surprised me. Surely he was not a beggar! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

following day I met the three beggars on the railway platform. The leader among
them fixed his gaze on me. Only a prime minister or a popular leader could gaze
so penetratingly to X-ray the other man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

went again after ten days. They were walking on the railway platform. As they
were farther away from me, I could not inquire if I could interview them that
night. If I went without prior intimation, they might ask me to see them any
other day. That would force me to prolong my visit to the town by one more day.

was not a moonlit night. The land was insecure. Movie-goers only would be my
sole companions. I went at 10 p.m. Again the lone policeman at the head of the
lane and four or five persons before the beggars’ lodge. They seemed to have
noticed my presence. However, they didn’t go inside under cover of darkness.
Nor was I prepared to talk to Bunganna in the company of so many strangers.
Suppose they outraged me in my loneliness! So I decided to play a trick. Going
up to them, I inquired if Bunganna was at home. They looked at me quizzically.
How could I say for certain that they looked at me in the pervading darkness?
How could I say with equal force that they did not look at me? My impression
was intuitive, though it was beyond any physical comprehension to note even the
glare in their eyes in the encircling darkness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

were silent. I went ahead. They allowed me to proceed as if charmed by that
magic name. After I went a long way, someone came up to me and informed me that
Bunganna wanted to have a word with me. I retraced my steps. Now there was none
in the lane. Where did the four persons flee? The policeman was as before at
the end of the lane. When I went into Bunganna’s house, he welcomed me. He lit
a lamp. Spreading for me a mat on the floor, he said, “Sorry, I didn’t
anticipate your visit.” “I saw you from a distance. I was too far away to speak
to you” I said. “You must always give me advance notice. Someone will always be
with me.” I wanted to find out from him who those persons were, but checked
myself for fear of putting an improper question. “Did you ask your leader?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recounted his story: “Singanna and I belong to the same caste. Our ancestors
migrated to a distant land. They amassed great wealth in the immigrant country.
Though I was born in the same caste, my career was a non-starter. I was
prodigal from boyhood. Rolling in wealth, I did not care a damn for my studies.
Moreover, many of my relations, highly educated, occupied high offices. I
committed several crimes for which I ought to have been jailed five or six
times. As I was rich, I escaped imprisonment. All that happened in my teens. It
would have been proper if I settled down in my town. But my mind was restless.
I had wander lust. So I set out to see many places While I was travelling on
one occasion, my train met with an accident in which my right hand was broken.
I was carried to the hospital in an unconscious state. I remained unconscious
for a month. I lost my memory. I forgot my past completely. For an year I
drifted in the company of beggars. Then I regained my memory and went home. By
then my property was almost ruined. Even if the mat is gone, you will have a
neat little square for your seat, as the saying goes. Had I remained at home, I
would have managed somehow. I thought begging would give me happiness.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was nonplussed. I could adduce no further argument. Bunganna continued:
“Happiness doesn’t lie in begging; it comes later. When a householder is annoyed
or when he shouts or abuses, he thinks he is great. The beggar thinks he is
equally great. It suffices for him if a hundred among a thousand give charity.
There are so many beggars in the land. Could you enlist into your service even
one of them by offering them free food and a monthly pay of Rs. 25? Every
beggar would spurn your offer. Each one thinks big of his occupation. None
thinks low of it. Consider these candidates seeking votes in any election
campaign. Does this idea cross the mind of even one of them: ‘Fie. It’s beneath
my dignity to beg votes of these fellows.’ In the roseate dream of imminent
power, he loses sight of meanness. With any high purpose, begging even becomes
respectable.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

my surprise Bunganna agreed that I summed up well the mechanism of the world.
He saw good days and he had robust commonsense. Are all beggars so intelligent?
I said that, while householders are rich, beggars are poor. Bunganna
remonstrated: “Do you mean that we are poor? No. We have money. It is utterly
wrong to affirm that we are poor. There are of course differences. There are as
many differences among beggars as there are among you. There are paupers among
beggars. Don’t you find paupers among you? We have rich men among us. You live

questions arose in my mind afresh. What were cuts? What was their community?
Bunganna wondered whether he would be going too far in answering the first
question. Singanna might be enraged. Every beggar had to pay some tithe or fee
to the community for social security. Sick beggars would be looked after. The
families of imprisoned beggars would be cared for. The usual grafts to
Government officials and policemen would be paid out of these fees. Marriage
expenses of a beggar who wanted to marry would be met from the fees. There were
so many demands to be met. Every beggar was obliged to part with a sixth of his
collections. The balance was left to his own use.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

forgot all about it until a friend goaded me to that town on his errand on the
eve of Siva’s night. I was occupied with his work until 10 p. m. Although the
moon had not risen then, signs of moonrise in the East were visible. As I
walked in the easterly direction, radiant beams of light, cool breeze and soft
music struck me all at once. Suddenly I recollected my tryst. Our mind is the
illumination of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chit shakti. </i>In a
moment a hundred things rise into consciousness. The mind, therefore, at one
stage, is equated with Brahma. Where from did this music flow? It came from the
canal bund. Ranganna might be singing. As I approached him, I found a gathering
of hundred persons around him. A large number stood on the road listening.
Someone remarked, “He is disabled. He lost his right hand. Placing his guitar
under neck and fixing it up with his right foot, he pulls the strings with his
left hand, and plays <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kanjira </i>with the
big toe of his right foot.” He was singing a song in praise of goddess <i

was past 11 p. m. The audience dispersed while I stood there. Where was
Ranganna’s house? After midnight Ranganna set out alone. I followed him
closely. He did not notice my following until he reached his residence. As he
entered the threshold of his house, he saw me and was filled with suspicion.
“It is I” I assured him. When both of us went inside, I complimented him,
“Ranganna! you are not human. You are an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>avatar.
</i>Ah! your music! The sweetness of your voice! Your play of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kanjira. </i>One ought to bow to you to wash
off one’s sins.” “No, sir,” said Ranganna, “This is exaggeration. I learnt
music early in life. I spent my days in Tamil Nadu. As I lost my right hand, I
learnt to play guitar with my left hand. I gather you are great. A poet. If I
am superhuman by singing songs, you too are superhuman by composing poetry.”
Words and thoughts are strangely associated. When he spoke of poetry, I emerged
from the world of music and recollected the purpose of my visit. “You want to
know my history” said Ranganna. “It may be late for you. It’s immaterial for
us. We keep many sleepless nights. Now, of music, there are many kinds.
Beggars’ style is quite different from yours. The sweetness of our songs is
absent in concert music. The latter requires much thought and technique. In our
music, tune and voice predominate. Ordinary people surrender quickly to it. I
don’t really belong to this place. I migrated from the West, having lost my
parents in childhood. I was not born like Bunganna in a rich family. Nor do I
boast like Singanna of having been born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I
still remember how I used to stretch out my hand before people eating sweets
near confectioner’s shop. Some gave me bits to eat; some frowned on me; while a
few others struck me and chased me away. Strange! how did I survive? I wonder.
Some tried in vain to force me to pick pockets. I knew as I grew up that the
world is full of robbers.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seventeenth year. For some days I worked as a casual labor and for some days as
an apprentice to masons. It was all rough going. When I didn’t find work, I
used to beg. For an year I painted red and white marks on my forehead in the
style of a Ramdass and went about singing devotional songs. It is a fruitful
year. My mellifluous voice brought me from every house-holder, instead of a
handful of grain, two handfuls. Those were halcyon days. Our land was
prosperous, replete with grain which went round. Once I went to a village
during the harvesting season and visited ten barns. I got a bagful of rice. For
a copper pie, the grocer used to give as much as I required of salt, pepper and
tamarind. We don’t find such plenty now. Meanwhile I befriended a Tamil beggar.
With him, I toured the entire South. Life is poor without seeing temples in the
South. Magnificent structures built by ancient kings. My Tamilian friend was
good to me. People loved to coax him to talk even when he observed silence.
Such was his sweet disposition! A wandering foot and a wagging tongue seldom
remain still, they say. We beggars can’t be confined to one place. I returned
to Andhra Pradesh, saw many villages in the western region. Drought conditions!
Even a ten-year-old boy there couldn’t say what was rain. Having no taste for
millet gruel, as my staple food was all along been rice in my native place in
the coastal belt, I decided to leave the West. It was not easy to get free
rides in railway trains those days. Ticket examiners were strict and railway
policemen used to strike mercilessly ticket less travellers. I hated policemen
since then, and resolved to teach them a lesson.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

drove back to my district. I spent an year serving in a scholar-king’s house.
He was a famous pundit. I read <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mahabharatam
</i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bhagavatam </i>there. While
notions rule nations, fate tends donkeys, they say. I ought to have continued
in service in the pundit’s house, but I set out to see Benares, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>En route </i>I halted at a village, which
was a sort of pilgrim centre. I heard there would be a large gathering in it
the following day. It was 2 p. m. when I sauntered towards the canal to plant a
stick and spread my beggar’s cloth at a suitable place in the pilgrim centre,
where people spoke a language foreign to me. The bazaar was deserted but for a
solitary walking figure. It was a woman who wore costly jewellery, worth ten
thousand rupees. She walked majestically like a trotting war horse–a luminous
figure in the surrounding darkness. Behind her walked a man with a sword in
hand. I didn’t notice him. I was young then. Instead of going my way, I stopped
on the road and looked at her. She stepped aside like a shying horde harnessed
to a heavy cart. I did not open my mouth. Meanwhile, her escort advanced from
behind and cut down my hand. I didn’t cry. I just collapsed on the ground. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

days later I regained consciousness in hospital from which I was discharged
after a month. My disability became in course of time a blessing in disguise.
No doubt I could earn by singing; I could also earn by reciting poems from our
epics. I hated begging from childhood. I hated begging all the more under cover
of disability. On a certain night I rested in the courtyard of a beggars’
rendezvous. I sang late into the night. A fellow beggar was charmed. He advised
me to join the community, of which he gave a detailed account. I couldn’t
decide for a moment because our collections would not then be entirely ours. On
second thought, I considered it wise to join. Gradually I ceased to be a

forbidden to talk about them in public. Our secrets are indeed more

Bunganna asked. “Perhaps you doubt our kingdom. You have not digested the
essence of education. There are so many religions in the world and so many
crusades. Who constructed these religious systems? Sannyasis or Fakirs, who are
beggars. Potluri Veerabrahmam, Vemana–who were they? Jesus Christ, Shankara–who
were they? Monks, beggars. Lord Buddha became a beggar before he founded his
religion. Sannyasis rule the world through religion. Their word was law in
ancient kingdoms. From every viewpoint, beggars rule the world. There are,
indeed, gradations among beggars. Make no mistake. There are also beggars among
you. They may exercise power. They really belong to our tribe, though you
respect them, out of sheer ignorance, as civil servants. They take bribes,
openly or furtively. While one stretches his hand out, the other manages to
procure his share from a distance. Another secret. Basically men are of two
kinds: householders and beggars. Whoever goes by the name of officer, monk,
bishop, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mulla, </i>guru or political
leader, poet or singer–each belongs to the second kind. All beggars. They avoid
family responsibilities. They exploit others. To keep wife and children is
animal law. Begging is the law of the spirit. The beggar cares for none. He
gathers justly for himself, and what he gathers he consumes. The other man goes
out to uplift the world–householder. Householders form the majority; beggars
are parasites on them. Who would give willingly to a beggar? Householders are
ingenuous. They need really no liberation; but they believe with implicit faith
if beggars tell them that they need to be liberated and that beggars would
ensure that. This is the secret of beggars’ authority over them. Do you know
how we protect a policeman when he loses his job? These householders are
surprisingly simple. They believe all sorts of cock-and-bull stories. From
birth everybody is either a householder or a beggar. How do we initiate a
movement? We spot out beggars fairly early. We lure them by putting before them
the twin attractions of power and social service. They join our band merrily
then.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

strain up to 2 A. M. I put him many questions which he answered in his own way.
All his answers stemmed from his central thesis that beggars were kings. He
adds that it was their plan to offer themselves to the public for charity.
There are four members in his group. It was inevitable for a house holder with
a kindly disposition to escape at least one of them. If a householder rejected
Bunganna, he would favour the bearded beggar. The latter was a new member, who

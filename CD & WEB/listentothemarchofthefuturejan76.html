1575, four hundred years ago, a French scholar, Louis Le Roy, published a book
in which he gave voice to his despair over the changes and dislocations caused
by the social and industrial innovations of his time, a period we now refer to
in the history books as the European Renaissance. “All is pell-mell,
confounded, nothing goes as it should,” he wrote. We, in 1975, are inclined to
echo those words and indeed to believe that the situation is even far worse
than it could have been four hundred years ago. Our inventory of despair grows
longer every day: the earth overpopulated, with its resources depleted; an
environment destroyed by pollution, with its inevitable damage to human health;
the gap in living standard between the rich and the poor continually widened;
the arms race accelerated, etc. The list of our present woes could be continued
almost indefinitely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

which the world is a safe place for life’s full growth and development? A mood

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>About a year ago, Dr Maurice Strong,
Secretary-General of the U. N. Conference on the Human Environment, suggested
that there is a case for hope. He outlined six indicators for the existence of
such a case: “There is hope in the dawning realization of our basic
interdependence. There is hope in the attitudes of young people. There is hope
in the courageous experimentation of some people with new, simpler, more human
life-styles. There is hope in the growing number of positive examples of the
creative uses of technology. There is hope in many parts of the developing
world where traditional values and cultures have been harmonized with modern
technology. There is hope in the nature of man himself.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And Dr Strong
concluded his arguments for a case for hope with these words, “It is possible
to opt for a future of unparalleled promise and opportunity for the human
species.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

latest discipline that has emerged in the world of academia is known as <span
class=SpellE>futuristics</span>, futurism or futurology. This discipline
proposes a new way of thinking about tomorrow, seeking a holistic view of human
evolution. It takes up the case for hope, along lines similar to those
suggested by Dr Strong, and urges that we concern ourselves not so much with
predicting the future as with attempting to design alternative futures. In
this, all of us can become creators, inventors and designers of our collective
futures. We need not wait on events to overtake us, but we can act with a calm
confidence in the full potential of our humanity and with an unswerving
determination that the human spirit will ultimately triumph. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

do not propose that we should engage in what has been termed in some circles,
“future-games,”–that is, games that merely create different models of tomorrow
as one would build fantasies of utopia or dream of impossible achievements.
Rather, I would suggest that we must examine the Theosophical case for hope,
design the future in accordance with a philosophy that comprehends the ageless
verities of existence, and lend our full and undivided weight to the
realization of that ideal of brotherhood, a world community in which all men
and women may live together in harmony and in <span class=SpellE>freedorn</span>.
For in this<i> </i>watershed year of 1975, a year that ushers in the last
quarter of this 20th century, we can either stand in numbed horror before the
awesome fact that the two major powers on earth today possess between them
enough nuclear explosives to represent the equivalent of 50,000 pounds of
destructive force for every human being on the planet, or we can accept the
challenge laid down for this Society 100 years ago<i>–</i>“to form the nucleus
of a universal brotherhood” without any distinction whatsoever. It may not be
without significance that this Society was founded by individuals whose
homelands were those same two countries which today confront each other and the
world with so much destructive force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
“It is time for Theosophy to enter the arena.” We can neither delay nor postpone
the assignment which has come to us, we who are the heirs of those founders and
today’s stewards of that priceless heritage which is the wisdom of the ages,
the Ageless Wisdom. We dare not become merely arm-chair Theosophists,
speculating about <span class=SpellE>Parabrahman</span> and <span class=SpellE>Pralaya</span>,
the nature of Maya and the composition of the <span class=SpellE>Skandhas</span>.
Speculation must give way to knowledge; knowledge must be transmuted into
insight; insight must be transformed into compassion. This is the age-old
alchemical process whereby we move from the personal to the <span class=GramE>trans</span>
personal, merging the little Self into the One Self. The Theosophical case for
hope lies in our willingness to undertake this process in full
self-consciousness. W. Q. Judge. <span class=GramE>writing</span> on “The
Future and The Theosophical Society,” in March 1892, stated: “Our destiny is to
continue the wide work of the past in affecting literature and thought
throughout the world, while our ranks see many changing quantities but always
holding those who remain true to the programme…..” And in her conclusion to <i>The
Key</i> <i>to Theosophy, </i>H. P. <span class=SpellE>Blavatsky</span> spoke of
the work of this Society as it lives into and through the twentieth century:
“It will gradually leaven and permeate the great mass of thinking and
intelligent people with its large-minded and noble ideas of Religion, Duty, and
Philanthropy...it will open the way to the practical realization of the
Brotherhood of all men. Man’s mental and psychic growth will proceed in harmony
with his moral improvement.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
task, then, is clear before us. If we would hear the drum-beat of the future,
taking that sound and shaping it into form, we must accept the task before us
and become, not only </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoBodyText><span class=GramE>for</span> hope culminates in the
knowledge of man’s infinite potential for growth into <span class=SpellE>superhumanhood</span>.
And that case rests ultimately on the irresistible fact that there have been
and are those who have achieved such realization, actualized the potential of
man’s deific powers, attained to the status of perfected men, Masters of the
Wisdom. The fact of the existence of a Brotherhood of such Adepts and the way
to <span class=GramE>Them</span> are among the priceless jewels in the crown of
Theosophical teachings. That there is a Brotherhood of “just men made perfect”,
that there is a path that leads to Them, that there is a way of life which
enables the earnest aspirant to find that way and that enables humanity finally
to tread that path: these concepts give purpose and meaning to man’s future,
for they lend to the fact of biological and social evolution, the ennobling
realization that man will not only endure, he will surpass himself.</p>

lawfulness. So she presented the vision of the future: “The Cycles of Matter

the law of parallel history and races, the majority of the future mankind will
be composed of glorious Adepts. Humanity is the child of Cyclic Destiny and not

then, is the next step? How may we proceed to move from darkness into light?
According to <i>The <span class=SpellE>Secre</span> Doctrine, </i>four major
stages in the development of consciousness, four “races”, lie behind us. We
today are in the fifth stage, with the focus on the battleground of the mind
itself. Wars today are fought less over territorial claims than over
ideologies. <span class=GramE>As the Charter of UNESCO so aptly states the
issue: “Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that
the <span class=SpellE>defences</span> of peace must be built.”</span> Today’s <span
class=SpellE><i>kurukshetra</i></span><i> </i>is man’s psychological nature,
the <span class=SpellE><i>kama-manasic</i></span><i> </i>field of the personal
Self. Here must be waged the good fight; here the victory must and will be
achieved. If we would “listen to the march of the future”, to use the words of
one of the Society’s founders, William Q. Judge, we must understand what it is
to be fully human and then live out our humanity as responsible moral agents in
a universe of law. A clue has been given to us in <i>The Secret Doctrine </i>where,
speaking of the present development, H. P. <span class=SpellE>Blavatsky</span>
has stated: “...the Humanities developed co-<span class=SpellE>ordinately</span>,
and on parallel lines with the Four Elements, every new Race being physiologically
adapted to meet the additional Element. Our Fifth Race is rapidly approaching the
Fifth Element–call it interstellar ether, if you will–which has more to do,
however, with psychology than with physics.” And one of the great Adept
Teachers who helped to inspire this Movement 100 years ago wrote on one
occasion, in a letter to A. P. <span class=SpellE>Sinnett</span>, “We have
offered to exhume the primeval strata of man’s nature, his basic nature, and
lay bare the wonderful complications of his inner Self...” Surely the next and
immediate step, as we look towards that glorious future which is our cyclic
destiny, is to undertake, in full self-consciousness, the transformation of
ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The world is desperately in need of
spiritual alchemists; a new psychology that recognizes man’s true source in the
realm of the Universal must arise to clear away the mental confusion and
emotional fog which obscure that inner reality. Splendid guide-posts exist to
mark the way, to aid us in performing the ancient alchemical work of
transmuting the lead of personal self hood into the pure gold of the
Transcendent Self. “Three halls, O weary pilgrim, lead to the end of toils.” So
says <i>The Voice of the Silence, </i>the great and final gift to the world of
that messenger from the Brotherhood of Adept Teachers to our age and time, H.
P. <span class=SpellE>Blavatsky</span>. These halls mark the stages on the upward
path of unfolding consciousness. “The name of the first hall is Ignorance–<span
class=SpellE>Avidya</span>. It is the hall in which thou <span class=SpellE>saw’st</span>
the light, in which thou <span class=SpellE>livest</span> and <span
class=SpellE>shalt</span> die.” Here, in the phenomenal world of the senses,
the world of terrestrial consciousness, as it has been called, we perceive the
first glimmer of light; here we must begin. Behind and beyond all the transient
display of existence, we must learn to see, however faintly and far off the
light may seems, the rays of that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>one </span>Reality
in which even the transient and changing is rooted. We have no other place to
begin than here; we have no other time in which to begin but now. “Out of the
furnace of man’s life and its black smoke, winged flames arise, flames
purified, that soaring onward, ‘<span class=SpellE>neath</span> the karmic eye,
weave in the end the fabric glorified...” So is the promise given, and we can
move from <span class=SpellE>Avidya</span> towards <span class=SpellE>Vidya</span>,
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>from </span>non-seeing towards the
full vision <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the Light; never
again can we “<span class=SpellE>unsee</span>” the future, never again can we <span

inactive. “<span class=SpellE>Shalt</span> thou abstain from action? Not so
shall gain thy Soul her freedom. To reach Nirvana one must reach
Self-knowledge, and Self-knowledge is of loving deeds the child.” So we must go
“armed with the key of charity, of love and tender mercy.” For, “Thou hast to
be prepared to answer Dharma, the stern law...‘Hast thou attuned thy heart and

powers hidden in the heart of every member of the human family, and to this
joyous <span class=SpellE>labour</span> of self-conscious development we must
devote ourselves wholly and unreservedly. It is only thus that Theosophy can
enter the arena of human thought and <span class=GramE>affairs,</span> impress
its grand and noble ideas on every aspect of human <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>–politics,

What is perceived of man in that “state of faultless vision” which is the
consciousness of the Real? It is, first, quite simply that man is both being
and becoming. In his essential nature, man is of the essence of eternal being;
he is rooted in and participates in the essence of eternity, but in himself he
represents the eternal order of becoming, experiencing the flow of reality as
the time sequences of existence. In that sense, it is man who particularizes
the universal in the transient, and so it is for man to recognize through the
transient that reality which evermore endures. To be human is to become the
burning-glass of the universal: in the human being and through him are <span
class=SpellE>focussed</span> all the energies and forces of the creative
process, the root <span class=GramE>cause</span> is transformed into the
efficient cause. <span class=GramE>As <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>
so magnificently reveals to <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span>, on the <span
class=SpellE>Kurukshetra</span> of daily existence, the primal reality of
being, admonishing him then: “Be thou the outward cause,” so to be human means
to be rooted in the One Reality but also to act in accordance with the Dharma,
the truthfulness, of existence.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The first fact of our being, then,
is that we are both essence and existence, being and becoming. From that
emerges, the second fact of our being, the fact of a grand design fulfilling
itself through the process of becoming a purpose inherent in the universe
because the universe is through and through intelligent, though only in man can
that intelligence become self-consciousness. Therefore, to be human is to be
responsible, responsible for the fulfillment of the grand design of evolution.
We must accept this moral <span class=GramE>responsibility,</span> accept, in
other words, the consequences of our choices. To awaken humanity to the
awareness of this responsibility, this <span class=GramE>obligation,</span> is
to arouse a conscience of concern for the welfare of all life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

principle of rhythmic growth, dynamic intent in the <span class=SpellE>unfoldment</span>
of consciousness and the powers which that <span class=SpellE>unfoldment</span>
confers. So we know the cyclic order of things, and move on our appointed
cyclic pilgrimage in accordance with universal law. From this knowledge is born
the fourth fact of our being, the principle of harmonization, and we learn the lesson
of obedience to nature’s changeless laws. For no act can be </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>without
its reaction; no seeds can be sown without their eventual </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>flowering,
though it is for us to act without reacting, to perform the deeds of mercy
without anticipating the fruits of such action. So our lives can actualize the
great truths of our being, and having trod the ancient way of self-realization,
passed from the Hall of Learning to the Temple of Wisdom, undertaken the great
alchemical work of transmuting the consciousness of Self to the consciousness
of the All-Self, we must share that which we know, infuse into the thought
climate of our times those larger ideas which provide the basis for true
ethics, a true morality, a genuine brotherhood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

final quarter, we may take up the task in all earnestness of purpose, fully
aware of the Theosophical case for hope, active participants in the cyclic
destiny of the human race. For the human self is not the actual self; it is
always and forever the possible self, what the self ought to become and can
become. Alongside the little self with which we greet each day, the petty self
which all too often intrudes its needs and desires and concerns on to our
attention, there is the Self of possibility, the <span class=GramE>Self</span>
which once glimpsed and known reveals itself as the <span class=SpellE>Splendour</span>
of the One. Envisioning the actualization of that possibility, H. P. <span
class=SpellE>Blavatsky</span> could forecast a new <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the conclusion or the volume on “Anthropogenesis” in <i>The Secret Doctrine</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>, </span>she wrote: “Thus is it the mankind
of the New World...whose mission and Karma it is to sow the seeds for a
forthcoming, grander, and far more glorious Race than any of those we know at present.”
(III. p. 443) We can be that mankind of the “New World”, learning to heal the
world because we are healed, learning to serve humanity’s deeper need because
we have awakened the latent powers of love and compassionate understanding,
learning to guide, as we have been told to do, the “<span class=SpellE>crestwave</span>
of intellectual advancement into Spirituality.” Psychology today recognizes
that whole masses of people can be pulled into the vortex of the inner disorder
of a single powerful person. Whatever its origin, it is only in the individual
that conflict and violence can be fought out. So also does psychology recognize
that an ordered person, the fully integrated, psychologically whole individual,
can create a vortex of <span class=GramE>power.</span> History is full of the
records of such individuals, and they constitute finally that grand Brotherhood
of Adepts the path to whom is ever open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

from beyond the snowy ranges of the Himalayas, the spiritual impetus that sets

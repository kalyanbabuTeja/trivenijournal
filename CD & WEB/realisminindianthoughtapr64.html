do not know the beginnings of philosophical speculation in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>; we have
records only from a period in the history of Indian culture when philosophical
speculation has reached a very high stage ill its evolution. The thinkers of
those early days found themselves in a world and they held the view that “what
is experienced is what is real.” If the world is real, then it must have been
always in existence. There is absolutely no trace of a belief in creationism in
the whole range of the early records of the thought of the Indians. What they
experienced was what was always there. That must also be what will ever
continue. There is matter with change and movement. Thus there are three
elements in the world of experience, namely, that there is matter, that there
is change, and movement, and that there is the cognition of that world. The
world is a unity of these three factors, matter, change in matter and knowledge
of matter. This is the fundamental basis of Indian thought. The three factors
are termed <span class=SpellE><i>Sattva</i></span><i> </i>(knowing), <i>Rajas </i>(change
and movement) and <span class=SpellE><i>Tamas</i></span><i> </i>(matter). <span
class=SpellE><i>Sattva</i></span><i> </i>is white, activity is saffron and
matter is dark. Indian thought has never gone out of this groove, though there
had been changes in details. How can we say that a thought pattern in which <span
class=GramE>matter</span>, with change and movement, is known to us, contains
any element of illusionism? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
world of experience during life is a reality. As such it must be a good world.
There is no test for anything being good except that it exists; what exists and
what is good is what must produce happiness. The existent world is known as
what brings about happiness; this is what is called the unity of <i>Sat-<span
class=SpellE>chid-Anand</span>. </i>That is the absolute nature of the world,
and the term still persists in the thought pattern regarding the Absolute in
the world. The world is a good world and the world is a beautiful world and Man
is happy in this good world of beauty. What is true is what is good and what is
good is what is beautiful. <i>Dharma </i>indicates its nature as true, <span
class=SpellE><i>Artha</i></span><i> </i>indicates its nature as good and useful
and <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE><i>Kama</i></span></st1:place><i> </i>indicates
its nature as beautiful, what will bring happiness. Thus the three goals in
life, the three values in life, are equated with the nature of this combination
of the three factors in the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

As a matter of fact, I have not seen a single evidence of heaven being held as
a goal in the early literature of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Heaven is a destination and
the test to know whether Man has taken the right path towards that destination
is to ascertain if that path brings him happiness in life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Heaven can be reached only through proper
work in this world. What brings about happiness during life is what will lead a
man to heaven. There is no heaven without a good life on the earth. Thus there
is frequent prayer in the earliest literature of India that one may not be
deprived of any part of the life allotted to him, that one may be enabled to
live through the entire span of life allotted to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
good work in the world, which first brings about happiness during life and
which culminates in the expansion of Man’s life to heaven also, consists of two
types. One is what brings happiness in life to oneself and the other is what
brings happiness also to others. This second aspect is what is called social
service. For happiness in life, two factors are involved; there must be the
provision for happiness and there must be the avoidance of what will stand in
the way of happiness, and what will bring positive unhappiness. The avoidance
of what is prejudicial to happiness is what is called social service and this
social service is known as <span class=SpellE><i>Purtha</i></span><i> </i>in
Sanskrit. It is not enough if there is provision for happiness and if all
visible obstacles to happiness and the grounds of <span class=SpellE>unhapiness</span>
are strictly avoided. There must also be the preparation of Man for the
happiness, both here and hereafter. It is the same happiness. That is what is
known as the co-operation of Man with the gods. Man is a manifestation of this
three-fold unity of the world, and gods are also such manifestations. There
must be co-operation between the two, and this co-operation on the part of Man
is what is called a ritual (what is called <span class=SpellE><i>Ishta</i></span>)<i>.
</i>Thus what is called a good life consists of two things, co-operation with
the gods <i>(<span class=SpellE>Ishta</span>) </i>and social service (<span
class=SpellE><i>Purtha</i></span>). The combined term for a good life is found
in that early literature as <span class=SpellE><i>Ishta-Purtha</i></span><i>. </i>Gods
are not the agents of an autocratic Supreme, with sanction to reward those who
remain within the Law of that God and to punish those who violate that law.
There is also no power opposed to such a Supreme God who inspires evil in man.
In that way there is no conflict of two powers in this world, the good and the
evil power. There is only a single power, which is the Law of the world. It is
when there is an evil power and when such an evil power inspires man to violate
the God’s Law and when such a violation of the God’s Law brings about suffering
to the good people who remain within the Law, that the element of <i>justice </i>comes,
when there is need for a ‘Just God’. Similarly, when there is such an evil
power there is also the need for social service. But when neither of them is
prominent, there is no need for a ‘Just God’ and for an active social service.
That is why these two elements are not very prominent in Indian ethics. The
world is good and Man can be happy in this good world. It is ignorance of the
happiness resulting from good life that acts as an incentive to violate the Law
of the world. Thus, the ethics of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> lay more emphasis on doing
what is really good than on avoiding what is prejudicial to the happiness of
man. What is good is what is included in the term <span class=SpellE><i>Ishta-Purtha</i></span>.

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> What is truly real is
what will result in perfect happiness and if there is no such happiness in this
world, there is no true reality also in this world. From the philosophical
point of view, there is no system of thought in any country in the world which
contains the element of realism to the extent to which it finds a place in
early Indian philosophical thought. But a change came over in the pattern of
thought in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
itself. Perfection is the removal of restrictions. If there is <span
class=GramE>a perfection</span> in man, possible to be <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
during life in this world or only in another region and in another state, is
that perfection the nature of man, to which Man is restored or is it a new
factor added to Man? What is inherently imperfect cannot by any means become
perfect, and if Man is perfect inherently and if there is only a removal of
restrictions that come over him, the question arises how such restrictions came
over Man </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>who is inherently perfect? This is what Man with
the restrictions cannot know and this is what is called an <span class=SpellE><i>adrishta</i></span><i>,
</i>what is not capable of being <span class=SpellE>realised</span>. It is not
sin, though later it is equated with sin; but that is not genuine Indian
thought. This element of sin in man is a feature in Indian thought that came
into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
later, from some foreign source; it is a deviation from the original current of
thought. When Man is in this world through such a sin then Man free from such a
sin cannot abide in this world. This is a natural consequence of the theory of
sin which made the perfect Man into the man of restricted powers. Since there
is no true happiness possible for Man with such restrictions in this world,
what can bring about only a partial happiness in Man’s life cannot be what can
lead Man to his destination of perfect happiness <span class=GramE>elsewhere.</span>
Thus, the goal of happiness in life and the goal of happiness in heaven became
different, with separate paths leading to them. What brings about happiness in
life, which can be only partial, must even be opposed to what will lead him to
the state of perfect happiness in <span class=GramE>heaven.</span> Thus, heaven
became a direct goal in Man’s activities, different from the activities that
bring Man the partial happiness which alone is possible on the earth. To this
extent, some element of unreality entered the thought pattern of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>; but this
is not Indian. Yet the view that only Man’s activities in life can bring about
happiness in heaven endured in Indian thought. Thus, to be born as a man is not
at all a calamity; it is a door to the attainment of Man’s goal of an ultimate
nature; to this extent, there is the ancient realism continuing in Indian thought.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is absolutely no trace of a view in the earliest Indian literature that this
activity of Man has a terminus later, though there is no such terminus earlier.
Knowledge is only to know the truth of the world and to function in the world
according to the true Law of the world. But along with the view of Man being
incapable of true happiness in this world, there also arose another parallel
view that there is an extinction of the individual, called his <span
class=SpellE>Moksha</span>, his release from all activity and their fruits. The
heaven theory is only a slight modification of an earlier view but this <span
class=SpellE>Moksha</span> view is entirely new to the thought of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In what
are called good activities which bring about happiness in life and also
happiness in heaven, there are two sides; there is the performance of actions
which bring about a positive happiness and there is also the avoidance of what
will be a bar to such happiness and what will even bring about some
unhappiness. The second is mainly in the form of an abstinence from activities.
Later this abstinence from activities became the door to the final <span
class=SpellE>Moksha</span>. But there is really no complete abstinence possible
in Man, since Man is a combination of matter and activity and knowing. The
abstinence is always associated with the activity that brings about happiness.
But in the later thought pattern, there is no such positive activity consequent
on abstinence. This means that complete abandonment of activity is the real
nature of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Man.</st1:place></st1:State>
In that case, what is called activity is unreal. <span class=GramE>Thus the
world and its activities, which, from an integral factor of the world, are unreal
the only reality being a state of complete absence of all activity.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and propagated by people in saffron robes contains such an element of unreality

hear much about spiritual progress and material progress and also spiritual
force and physical force, as distinct facts. What the Christian Priest has <span

the nature of the world. In the Indian thought itself, the world is real. The
reality of the world, evolved in the Indian thought pattern, is a reality which
no other nation has evolved. In all the systems of thought, in all the texts
that teach the nature of the world, in all the literary remnants of yore where
the world is presented as it is with Man being active in that world,
everywhere, we find only an uncompromising realism. We have to move backwards
to go forward. The present path, with the saffron robes as guides cannot lead
us to the true realism of ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

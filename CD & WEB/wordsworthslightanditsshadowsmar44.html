mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To few sons of the Muses is given the privilege of
moving in an ever-resplendent orbit of glory. The bulk of the poetic kind have
to content themselves with shedding light of an intermittent character, though
their title to fame is not the less assured on that account. Wordsworth belongs
to this latter class, though in it he occupies a high position. Like the rest
of his poetic brethren, he exhibits a good many virtues as well as drawbacks.
Speaking of him and of Coleridge, Prof. Saintsbury says, “Both were poets of
the very highest power, the interval and inequality between whose best and
worst poetry is vast and very nearly incomprehensible.” And again, “Wordsworth
will sometimes soar to empyrean heights, and sometimes flounder along the moor
of prose with the most exasperating shamble.” Referring to this “perpetual
series of ups and downs”, “of alterations between small things and great ones”,
to this “inequality”, Matthew Arnold remarks that “in Wordsworth’s case the
accident of inspiration is of peculiar importance”. When the inspiration is
upon him, no poet is so powerful, new and sacred; when it fails him, none is so
weak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Wordsworth’s drawbacks and failings constitute an
interesting study. When carefully examined, his defects will be found to be the
defects of his merits. They are the shadow inevitably accompanying the flame of
his genius. In them, no less than in his merits, is clearly visible a faithful
reflection of the greatness of the poet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Wordsworth is the poet of the age of Revolution,
whose motto is simplicity. He felt himself called upon to proclaim a new
gospel. He was pre-eminently the poet of Nature. He sounded the note of revolt
against the artificialities of the eighteenth century. He discarded the
life-less conventions and customs of the age and laid his finger on the real in
Nature and in Man. Kings and Queens, Gods and Fairies, the mythical heroes of
romance, and all the stage effects of current poetry, vanish from his presence while
he sings with delight the simple ditties of thoughtful men. He brought poetry
down from the lofty regions of aristocratic life to dwell in the humble homes
of peasants and villagers. “He valued most,” says Walter Pater, “the almost
elementary expression of elementary feelings.” But thereby some of the graces
are denied to his muse. Life is many-sided. Human nature is complex. No doubt,
the sweet loves and pieties of country life are an interesting study. But no
less interesting, no less real, are the loves and hates, the passions and
tumults, of civilized life. He failed to note these passions and ambitions, the
love-making and jealousies of the world around him,–topics that are so dear to
the dramatic poet Wordsworth, in short, was utterly wanting in the dramatic
instinct. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Wordsworth was a poet of meditation, and of deep
spiritual vision, He had high ideals of the vocation of the poet. Every great
poet, according to him, is a teacher. If Milton set himself the task of
“justifying the ways of God to man,” Wordsworth likewise sought to turn man’s
mind from earth to heaven, to rouse in men’s bosoms a sense of the Infinite, to
exhort man in the search after peace and virtue. A tone of deep earnestness
pervades everything that he wrote. A man whose word could assuage reconcile and
fortify, whose object was to enlarge the understanding and widen the spiritual
vision, whose message was to lead to a firmer self-control and larger
self-government,–such a one could not but be serious toned throughout. The teacher
who could wean, though temporarily the utilitarian Mill from a soul deadening
Benthamism, and who inspired reverence in the bosom of the positivist George
Eliot, must certainly have possessed, in a large measure, the gift of the
healing power in him. Says Walter Pater, “Wordsworth’s words are themselves
thought and feeling, not eloquent or musical words merely, but that sort of
creative language which carries the reality of what it depicts directly to the
consciousness.” Yes, he was poet, sage and prophet who brought the waters of
life to the threshold alike of the believer and of the septic.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But how pathetic it is that such a teacher
should be felt to be “monotonous beyond endurance”, “too deliberate and direct
in his intention to instruct” and “insupportably dull!” Perhaps England and
Europe have to take their own time for a fuller appreciation of the beauty and
excellence of Wordsworth’s muse. Perhaps, also, Wordsworth, who in this respect
may be spoken of as the poet of the few, may have felt that he could not utter
his profound and solemn truths unless the reader’s mind was rendered
sufficiently receptive by the patient hearing of a lengthy story. But all the
same the fact remains that the seriousness of the sage has overshot its mark
and the saving truths of the gospel, being conveyed in voluminous books of
endless and rhymeless pentameters, do thus fall quite flat on the ear and most
pitiably defeat their own high purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To the same, or a similar, cause may be attributed
another great drawback of Wordsworth’s. He is the master-hand that moved the
sympathies of high and low, saint as well as sinner. His muse made the happy
happier and brought consolation to the afflicted and down-hearted. This was the
result of deep seriousness in him. He felt that, charged as he was with a holy
mission, he should turn neither to the right nor to the left. But, alas, in art
as in matters ethical and spiritual, he who thinks of his soul is certain to
lose it. Self-consciousness in art leads to its own certain death. The morbidly
over-anxious face of the artist is visible even in the best of Wordsworth’s
work. He seems to think that even a little smile on his face mars the good
effect of his work, and detracts from the sacred seriousness of the situation.
And what is the result? The sight of the artist ready with his bait and his
nets is certainly not re-assuring to the reader. Wordsworth may speak of
‘daffodils’, ‘phantoms of delight’ and ‘iris.’ But his muse is not naturally
iris-coloured, and he, with religious studiousness, clips her wings, and paints
a sober grey upon them. He forgets that if he is to be the poet of simple folk,
he must cast is rigidity aside, sing and weep in their company, as did
Shakespeare. He must enter into their manifold feelings and must touch every
chord in their nature. But Wordsworth cannot do this: he has not a trace of
humour in him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is that though he is a poet of Nature, he is lost in the thought of Nature as a
great and beneficent whole, that he is unduly optimistic, and that he is not
energetically alive to that side of a Nature–Nature ‘red in tooth and claw.’

and Wordsworth, being the most reminiscent of all poets, many of the people in
his stories are dead or old, and so<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the
hand of the dead is kind and cool upon the memory as a sort of balsam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The explanation is plausible enough. But it is
important, in this connection, to<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>bear
in mind the central fact of Wordsworth’s poetic and philosophic creed. To him
Nature is all in all. It is not enough to label him a pantheist, as if that
will explain everything. To him nature is not a mere abstraction, a formula, a
hypothesis that offers a cold philosophical explanation. He sees Nature radiant
with life. To him she is<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>a living
presence: here he holds constant communion. She it is that has taught him,
helped him, ever smiled on him. Such a one is nearer and dearer to him than
anything else. If only in part to requite her love, he must sing of her and
celebrate her glory. What matters it to him if his eye<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>may perceive a spot on her cheek or a stain on her hand? His is
the eye<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>of a lover or of a child,
whose vision is not analytic but synthetic, beholding no flaw in the face of
the beloved. Emerson says somewhere that the benefactor of the country cannot
be expected to pay small debts. Likewise, the lover and adorer of Nature sinks
in the act of homage all thought of doubt or dissent. He forgets the particular
and exceptional in the universal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>He would forget the particular and exceptional for
another reason. His mission is to offer peace–the peace that passeth all
understanding. This he can do by rousing man to a communion with Nature and
with Nature’s God. With him religion and worship are direct. The votary in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excursion </i>is face to face with the Most
High on the top of the lone mountain. In that hour of solemn, sublime
meditation, ‘thought was not’ the imperfect offices of prayer and praise are
discarded. Alone to the Alone–that is the ecstatic, beatific vision vouchsafed
to our sight. Now communion with such a God and such a Nature were well-nigh
impossible without an implicit trust in their goodness. A God or Nature in
whose plan there are whole continents of evil and suffering cannot possibly
inspire confidence in the votary. And rather than refer to the flaw and offer
an explanation for it–both of which are uncongenial to the attitude of sweet
trust and to peace of mind,–he coolly and ingeniously ignores the whole vexed
question of evil and suffering in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A number of minor defects are noticeable in his
poetry, such as that he is defective in the historic sense and the sense of
Fate; that his poetry is not sufficiently fluent nor musical; that there is too
much solemnity without grace. If such defects were found in the poetry of Keats
whose life was cut off prematurely, or in the case of one like Coleridge whose
life was dissipated between opium and idleness, there might be some
extenuation. But Wordsworth, who wrote for half a century, and had no cases or
ambitions besides, could have easily corrected himself had he been so minded.
He could have easily spared another the trouble of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>“relieving him of a good deal of the poetic baggage encumbering
him.” Though he might not be able to assimilate virtues quite alien to his
genius, he could have certainly corrected some of his defects. That he never
made the least attempt in this direction is what amazes critics. Saintsbury
says, “His poetic power, though of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>the
intensest and noblest was very narrow in its Possibilities of application”.
Wordsworth was wanting in a sense of proportion. It is by no means a fault that
a poet should find himself the pioneer on a new path. It certainly redounds to
Wordsworth’s credit that he should have taken upon himself the mission of
directing poets to turn to Nature and draw their inspiration from her, of
urging on them the claims of a simple and natural style. But<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>a man with a fine sense of proportion
would easily perceive the limits of his own principles. Wordsworth was deprived
of this good sense by reason of one or two<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>
</i>of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>his fixed beliefs which became
obsessions with him. Says Saintsbury in this connection: “As it was his equally
firm creed that William Wordsworth could not mean otherwise than nobly, so it
was matter of breviary with him likewise that William Wordsworth could not
write otherwise than well.” Here, again, it may be remarked that for poet, to
hold himself as charged by God with a certain mission is noble, but<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>to infer and claim infallibility
thereby for every act and expression proceeding from such a belief is patently
absurd. Wordsworth could not have inaugurated a new era, could not have stamped
his own name on the forehead of an age, had he not acted from start to finish
in his long life on the firm conviction of his own inspiration. At the same time,
how<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>regrettable is the mischief which
such a conviction bred in his bosom, leading to the serious blemishes in his
poetry to which he was utterly blind! Here, again, is another instance of the
huge shadow accompanying a huge flame–a great defect following in the wake of a
great merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>While the Andhras look forward
with eager expectation to the ushering in of the Andhra State early in October,
they are also aware of the various immediate problems the new State would be
confronted with. Indeed, even before the formation of the State, the location
of the temporary capital presented almost insurmountable difficulties. Contrary
to their expectations, Madras was not available as the temporary capital and no
town in Andhra was sufficiently developed for the purpose. Many a problem,
including that of the capital, would have proved less knotty if a full-fledged
Andhra State including the Telangana portion of Hyderabad had been decided
upon; but that was not to be, and there was no option, therefore, except to
find an improvised temporary capital in a hurry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
the coastal area towns, especially Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada, are more
developed and better suited for locating the capital than any in Rayalaseema,
and although Justice Wanchoo recommended Visakhapatnam as the next best to
Madras in view of the availability of buildings and the consequent saving on
capital expenditure besides its other conveniences, yet, the moral obligations
under the Sri Bang Pact were scrupulously respected by the coastal Andhras
generally, in choosing Kurnool in Rayalaseema as the temporary capital.
Whatever might be the justification for a section of the Press and the public
of coastal Andhra to be dissatisfied with the decision, it cannot be denied
that this decision has done more than anything else to remove regional
suspicions and to foster friendly and harmonious relations between the Circars
and Rayalaseema Andhras. Therefore, unless Rayalaseema is amenable to a review
of the decision, it would be hardly wise to carry on the controversy further,
and all those that strove hard to bring about unity and goodwill among the
Andhras on the eve of the ushering in of the new State deserve to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be
congratulated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is, however, the first hurdle, and many more would have to be successfully
negotiated before the new state is firmly established. For instance, selecting
the capital does not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>solve<i> </i>the problem of finding
immediate accommodation, which would have to be met both by rapidly erecting
new buildings in Kurnool and by a suitable and convenient distribution of some
of the departments and offices in places like Guntur, Vijayawada, Dhowleswararn
and Visakhapatnam, not to speak of continuing or locating a few, like Central
Government Offices, in Madras and Hyderabad. This is, no doubt, a disadvantage.
But unless adequate Central aid is forthcoming, this has to be put up with, and
we have to make the best of the available resources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next–and the most important–question that rises in one’s mind is whether the
Andhra legislators would be able to form a stable government. As it is, the
strength of the Congress and Communist members from Andhra is almost equal, but
the reported understanding reached among the Congress Praja Social</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ist
and Krishikar Lok Party leaders, added to the support of several Independents
would, it is almost certain, enable the formation of a government commanding a
comfortable majority as well as popular confidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Andhra legislature would certainly not suffer from any dearth of experience or
talent; it would have the services of well-tried and experienced public figures
like Prakasam, Sanjiva Reddi, Koti Reddi and T. Viswanatham, besides the
Krishikar Lok Party leaders, Independents like Vavilala Gopalakrishnayya, and
the polished Secretary of the Praja Socialist Party–the Raja of Vizianagaram.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Communist Opposition
will be led by the talented T. Nagi Reddi. Since many eyes would be watching
the new State, as a test case of linguistic division, the Andhras are Sure to
act in a healthy spirit of accepting the challenge, if only to demonstrate to
the doubting Thomases that they are no worse, if not better, than their,
compatriots of other states in the business of shaping and running the new
administration in a successful manner. The problem of political stability,
therefore, may not prove as acute as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>once feared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
brings us to the next<i> </i>problem of financial soundness and viability. But
‘financial viability’ is an intriguing term, since the mere balancing of a
budget is no longer<i> </i>considered the<i> </i>sole test of financial
stability. Indeed, even deficit financing with a definite purpose on a well
calculated basis of bringing about increased prosperity is viewed by many as a
sound financial proposition. Further, since almost every State<i> </i>is
depending on increasing Central grants, the infant Andhra State too would have
to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>depend, naturally on adequate Central aid for at least some
time to come. The measure of stability and success, in the ultimate analysis,
depends on sound fiscal and financial policies calculated to develop and
harness the potential resources of the State to the best possible advantage
rather than in the mere producing of surplus budgets. The deficit, if any, for
a short time, may not be more than a crore, because the varying deficit
estimates, ranging from a crore to three or four crores in a budget of over
twenty crores, are largely calculated on the basis of figures for the districts
without a precise allocation of the respective Andhra and Residuary Madras
shares in the revenues under the head of Madras City and also certain Central
allocations. So, as some suggest, financial<i> </i>considerations may not
compel the giving up of Prohibition; but on other realistic grounds the
Prohibition policy may have to be suitably modified without giving it up
altogether. The initial division of assets and liabilities is likely to be the
knottiest problem which may have to be referred to an expert and impartial
high-power tribunal on the lines suggested by T. Viswanatham.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Provided
the new State is able to devise a sound regional development programme,
calculated to pay itself, and raise the requisite funds both by public loan and
Central aid, it need not be a worrying problem if it were to have deficit
budgets for a few years. Thus, if the two major Godavari Valley and Krishna
Valley multi-purpose projects, i.e., Ramapada Sagar and Nandikonda, along with
the complementary projects like Sidheswaram and Gandikota, could be started on
a well-planned basis and executed efficiently, the prosperity and
potentialities of the State would enormously increase. The Andhra area
including Telangana would then comprise the largest block of the most fertile
tract in the whole of South India, if not the country, untroubled by the food
problem; besides, the hydro-electric power that could be generated thereby
would help start many a suitable industry. The Andhra State, it is to be hoped,
would be guided by a due sense of priorities, especially with regard to
development plans, sop as to husband its resources to the best all-round
advantage in the shortest possible period, without wasting energies on needless
controversies and in pursuing doctrinaire reforms based on sentimental fads and
slogans; and, let it be hoped, too, that the vitality and fervour of the
Andhras would be used to better purpose than in mere exuberance of misguided
socio-political activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>The next and last major problem is the one relating
to administrative personnel and efficiency. That of administrative efficiency
and integrity being a general problem in the country, it need not be dealt with
here. There would be, however, a dearth of Andhra personnel especially in
higher cadres, but if the services of suitable personnel–whether Andhra or
non-Andhra-could be got, it ceases to be exactly a problem, since most of the
higher cadres are recruited on an all-India basis and, therefore, it would both
wrong and narrow-minded for any State to expect to have all posts manned
exclusively by persons belonging to a particular tract or language group. It.
should be borne in mind that the principle of linguistic States is based on
that of administrative convenience and redistribution of units on a rational
basis in consonance with the general aspirations of the concerned people, and
not on the recognition of language groups as different races or nationalities.
No doubt, it would be legitimate for any language group or State, to aspire to
achieve a due share in higher cadres in all spheres but it should be the
outcome of merit. So, instead of bemoaning the alleged denial of opportunities
to the Andhras for attaining higher administrative posts in the past in the
composite Madras State, the Andhras would do well to attain by sustained
efforts the requisite standards and accomplishments necessary to compete
successfully in the selection of such posts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Andhra
ambition, it appears, more often finds expression in exciting but unthrifty
political-cum-public activity than in calculated pursuit of lucrative and
comfortable private careers: which trait partly explains the dearth of Andhra
personnel not only in higher government services but even in the upper rank
careers in business or the professions generally. Possibly, that is also partly
responsible for the industrial backwardness of Andhradesh, for without a
sufficiently large well-to-do upper middle class which largely contributes to
business investments, modern industrial and commercial expansion is hardly
possible, at any rate, in a democracy recognising the due place of private
enterprise. Has not someone remarked that every Andhra at heart is a poet or
politician? That is, perhaps, a nice way of saying that the Andhra is either
impractical daydreamer or one who is apt to lose himself in profitless, though
not purposeless, political excitement! Is it not the case that where a
compatriot in neighbouring areas aspires to become a District Magistrate, the
Andhra invariably aspires to become the President of the District Board? And
that, where that compatriot aspires to retire as a Departmental Secretary on a
comfortable pension, the Andhra aspires to become a political leader, if not a
minister, burning all his boats long before the time retirement? To their
excellent and active political inclinations let the Andhras learn to add a
little cool calculation, thrift and smartness required to ensure success in
varied careers, besides a due regard for civic amenities and sense of local
pride, so as to ensure success in all spheres and develop their towns and villages
into neat and attractive places with all requisite amenities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
foster requisite standards of intelligence, ability and smart personality, it
may be necessary for the Andhra Government to either start, or help start, by
such bodies as the Ramakrishna and the Christian Missions some standard
residential public schools and colleges which are at present sadly lacking in
Andhradesh, The alleged high-brow snobbery associated with some of such
institutions should, no doubt, be avoided, but it has to be admitted that it is
usually students of well-run, although fastidious, institutions such as, for
instance, the public schools in Dehra Dun and school and colleges run by the
(Ramakrishna or Christian) Missions in Madras and elsewhere that acquire the
requisite standards in accomplishment, smartness and methodic habits that
ensure success in higher competitive examinations, whether for civil or
military posts, or professional or business careers. If necessary, suitable
institutions may also be started to offer refresher courses to train and
streamline the aspiring young men and young women for successful careers in the
higher rungs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
in the matter of development programme and that of starting suitable standard
institutions, the services of such as S. V. Ramamurty and V. Ramakrishna,
besides the guidance of such as M. Viswesvaraya and G. D. Naidu, is possible,
should be welcomed. The generous public donation and response which enabled the
recent opening of the Satyavati Devi St. Theresa’s Women’s College at Eluru and
the reported move of the Vijayawada public to raise the requisite resources for
a residential college to be started by the Loyola Mission on a hundred-acre
plot, are encouraging signs that the Andhra public is keenly alive to the need
in this direction. It should be noted, however, that while the aspiration to
achieve a due share in higher posts and careers in all spheres is desirable, if
only to remove any inferiority complex, disproportionate glamour for them
should be checked; for the more enlightened and advanced a people, the less
ought to be the significance of, and consequent glamour for, so called prize
jobs and careers. Far more important is the problem of<i> </i>finding
productive and gainful occupation for the large number of unemployed and under-employed
by a well-coordinated development programme of promotion of industries, of
revitalisation of cottage crafts like handlooms, and extension of utility
services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fortunately,
the Andhra State would have practically no communal problems. However, with
regard to language and educational policies; not<i> </i>only should the
linguistic minorities, especially of bordering bi-lingual areas, be assured of
all legitimate facilities, but all citizens irrespective of language or
community should enjoy equal opportunities without any discrimination, such as
evidenced by the mistaken policies pursued in States like Bihar and Orissa.
Further, the new State should be wary and not<i> </i>introduce in haste the
Telugu medium for all governmental purposes or at the University stage, which
would be a distinct disadvantage at present and would only result in
inefficiency and isolation from others. Love of one’s language and solicitude
for cultural values had better be expressed in terms of better emoluments to
teachers, including Telugu and Sanskrit Pandits, authors, scholars, etc., and
not<i> </i>in mere sentimental and unrealistic fads and empty glorification
such as the presentation of ‘Pancharatnams’ (five gems in verse), a long shawl,
a longer title, and a purse of Rs. 116 as the only reward of the life-work of a
scholar, author or publicist! Surely, the presentation of a purse of less than
ten thousand Rupees on any such occasion should come to be viewed as
disgraceful. Andhradesh is not<i> </i>lacking in talented and illustrious
authors, journalists and publicists, but excepting some individual cases that
have thriven largely outside Andhradesh, hardly any have received proper
response or recognition, let alone reward, from Andhradesh. One wonders if
there is a single author or publicist in Andhradesh who is able to<i> </i>earn
even one hundred Rupees<i> </i>a month by his writings! If conditions could be
produced where, say, a hundred authors, a hundred journalists, a hundred
scholars and publicists, and a hundred musicians and artists–barring cinema stars–could
each earn at least five hundred Rupees a month, which is not<i> </i>a large
sum, by his professional services, and if the pay of teachers and lecturers
could be handsomely enhanced, then alone the Andhras can pat themselves for
having done something concrete and substantial towards recognition of cultural
values. No doubt, this requires the co-ordinated efforts of a sympathetic
government, a responsive and appreciative public, and enterprising and
discerning publishers. It is the practical services of persons like the late K.
Nageswara Rao Pantulu through the ‘Andhra Patrika’ and allied journals, and
publishing houses like Vavilla Ramaswami Sastrulu and Sons of Madras, that have
done more for the promotion of Telugu language and literature than all the mere
sentimental claptrap, too often indulged in by Andhras, could achieve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the Andhra University can help produce in Telugu a couple of hundreds of
standard and well-got-up books on literature, science, history, philosophy,
etc., more enduring and distinct service could be rendered thereby for the
promotion of Telugu language and literature than by the hasty introduction of
Telugu medium at higher stages of education or at government level. In this
connection, the services of such as M. Venkatarangaiya, V. Appa Rao, and the
Editor of ‘Triveni’, to mention but a few, may be utilised with advantage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Andhras, who do not lack in energy, vitality, civilised instincts or good
intentions, will only pay a little attention to the above aspects, besides that
of improving public sanitation, health and diet, and attend to first things
first in a business like manner, there is no reason why in a decade or two

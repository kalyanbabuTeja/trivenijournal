an interval between two scenes,”<i> </i>(of a Telugu play that was being staged
at Guntur). “Sri Prakasam stepped onto the stage, dressed in faultless Bond
Street clothes and with a fur cap on his head. He looked very handsome. He had
just returned from England as a full-fledged Barrister. He had been an actor in
his early years, but his ‘entrances and exits’ as Arjuna, Damayanti or
Chandramati were over before I was born.….He spoke in English, beginning in a
low tone, and uttering the words with great deliberation. But he gathered
momentum as he warmed up, and gave his impressions of the theatres in London
and Paris. He ended with an eloquent exhortation to the Andhra public to honour
their actors. I liked the speaker as well as the speech. To my boyish
imagination, he was definitely a ‘great man’.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
was the impression Prakasam made early in the year 1907 on K. Ramakotiswara
Rau, the Editor of <i>Triveni. </i>Today, after more than forty years of a strenuous
and impressive record of public service, Prakasam looks like a battle-scarred
general with almost a rugged mountain-like grandeur about him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prakasam,
who is fondly referred to by the idolising Andhras as <i>Andhrara Kesari, </i>is
essentially cast in a heroic mould both physically and in spirit. As a
nationalist and political leader south of the Vindhyas, the two that can vie
with him are Rajaji and Dr. Pattabhi, however, with this difference: that while
Rajaji is respected for his political sagacity and farsighted statesmanship,
Prakasam is loved for his utter disregard of danger and simple childlike
qualities; while Pattabhi is admired for his intellectual and organisational
gifts and versatile activities, Prakasam is adored for his self-immolating qualities
of burning patriotism and sacrificing zeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prakasam’s
life and career strike one as a big and bold adventure. There is little of
hair-splitting subtlety or shrewd calculation about him. He is a man of unusual
energy and spontaneous action, one who readily responds to the immediate needs
of the present and one who is absolutely fearless of all consequences, once he
is determined to act according to his convictions. Mahatma Gandhi, the great
saint-statesman and redeemer of his country and humanity, be it noted,
possessed also a great spirit of adventure, in the noblest sense of the term.
But, while the illustrious followers of the Mahatma have imbibed several noble
traits of the Master, each according to capacity and in varying degrees, few
can be said to have got the daring spirit which was so marked a characteristic
of the Father of the Nation. Among those few, two names, that of Netaji Subhas
Bose and that of Prakasam, occur to one spontaneously. But, while Netaji,
retaining as he did to the last the highest esteem for the Master, parted
company with the Master on occasions, Prakasam, though he too dared to differ
at times, has ever remained loyal to the Mahatma and the Congress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
his younger boyhood days Prakasam’s associates included all sorts–wrestlers,
touring dramatists and even rowdy elements. From his recently published
Autobiography in Telugu, which, by the way, is a very interesting, informative
and frank narration, we know that he got into tight corners on more than one
occasion, being involved in assault and other charges. Even today, at the age
of nearly eighty, his youthful buoyancy has not left him and, indeed, he seems
to grow young with years. Even before he proceeded to England for further Law
studies, Prakasam had already made a name both as a lawyer and as a public
spirited man; and, while in England, he was an enthusiastic supporter of
Dadabhai Naoroji during the latter’s Parliamentary election campaign. Prakasam
gave an indication of his mettle long before he returned as a Barrister, when,
as a young man of barely thirty, he succeeded in getting elected as the
Chairman of the Rajahmundry Municipality against such formidable forces as
represented by the late N. Subba rau Pantulu and late (Sir) M. Ramachandra Rau
Pantulu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prakasam
mentions in his Autobiography how even muncipal elections used to rouse the
worst passions among otherwise very sober and respectable persons, and how, to
vent their spite against him, some of his opponents did not hesitate to involve
him in a murder case. In this respect our country has, perhaps, progressed
little even after two generations. Prakasam humorously mentions, too, how
greatly his former Principal, Metcalfe of the Government College, Rajahmundry,
was surprised to find him in London, since the good old Professor who knew
Prakasam’s boyhood episodes too well could hardly expect to see him changed
into a polished and promising student of Gray’s Inn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had a brilliant career as a Barrister and commanded a lucrative practice both
in Madras and mofussil courts. He was for some time the President of the Madras
Bar Association and Editor of the <i>Madras Law Times. </i>No wonder, being of
an independent and full-blooded nature, many a time he had hot exchanges with
the Hon’ble members of the Bench. Although he soon came to be known a
‘troublesome man’, nonetheless he was respected for his fearless and dignified
demeanour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prakasam
was among the earliest in the South to come under the magic spell of the
Mahatma, and with his characteristic self-abandon he plunged without second
thoughts into the Non-Cooperation movement. The Daily <i>Swarajya, </i>which he
started, was altogether a new and forceful feature of resurgent nationalist
journalism during the nineteen-twenties. Prakasam staked his all and, it is
said, even the considerable property of his wife in his journalistic venture.
No douubt, <i>Swarajya </i>cost him his last penny literally, but, one doubts
whether he has any regrets at all, for, it is not in Prakasam’s nature to
regret or look behind. Several of his early <i>Swarajya </i>associates as, for
instance, Sardar Panikkar, Khasa Subba Rau, K. Ramakotiswara Rau, Kripanidhi
and Iswara Dutt, have since achieved distinction both as journalists and
publicists, and it speaks volumes for Prakasam’s character and the affectionate
esteem he commands that his erstwhile associates still remember the old
exciting and exacting days of the <i>Swarajya </i>with pride. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prakasam
had always been in the forefront of the nation’s struggle for freedom, and
during the Salt Satyagraha days of the nineteen-thirties, when lathi charges
and firings were frequent, it was the courageous example set by leaders like
Prakasam and Sambamurti that largely helped to keep up the public morale in the
South.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prakasam
is not a fire-eating orator, but is quite an impressive speaker both on the
public platform as well as in parliamentary debates. He shows a most dogged
persistence in mastering the various aspects of any problem he takes up. The
monumental Prakasam Report on the Madras Estates is an excellent instance. Both
as a public leader and administrator, with his vast experience, broad
sympathies and readiness to respond to public duty, he has proved immensely
popular. That the producer-cum-consumer co-operative and Khadi self-sufficiency
schemes, which he sponsored when he was the Chief Minister of Madras, have not
received a fair trial, unfortunately, shows that while one may swear by the
Mahatma it is not always safe to be overzealous in putting into practice the
Gandhian ideas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That the unseating of the Prakasam Ministry, ever
since which public life in Madras has steadily deteriorated, constitutes one of
the major public tragedies in the recent history of Madras seems to be
gradually realised even by those that found fault with Prakasam’s administration
for some reason or other. Except that he tends to be frank to the point of
bluntness at times and, perhaps, a little wanting in that elusive quality,
namely, tactfulness, especially in appeasing certain influential interests,
Prakasam could hardly be charged with any lapse, administrative or otherwise.
So, the one fault of Prakasam, it appears, is his want of diplomacy which, by
the way, seems to be a general fault with the Andhras, for, is it not the case
that they pay dearly quite often by rubbing a right cause the wrong way!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Few
in our country can boast of so courageous and selfless a record of public
service as that of Prakasam and, no wonder, when Prakasam was dislodged from
the Madras Ministry it was certainly not he and his loyal colleagues that fell
from popular esteem. Indeed, the popular reaction was one of deep
disappointment at the turn of events. While Prakasam has paid too dearly for
his ‘obstinate’ convictions, his great qualities seem to have received neither
ample recognition nor have they been properly utilised for the benefit of the
country. It is but natural that the populace should entertain fond expectations
to see Prakasam once again occupy high office. But, whether this happens or
not, Prakasam will ever continue to be the People’s Hero.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

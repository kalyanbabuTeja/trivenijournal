of the major problems facing the many and varied groups of people of this great
sub-continent known as India, has been and still continues to be the caste
system. Over the centuries into modern times, great thinkers, philosophers,
scholars, politicians and men and women in all walks of life, have given us the
benefit of serious thought and consideration of the problem and yet, the
problem continues to exist. That it exists is obvious from the recent uproar
all over the country brought about <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>by<i>
</i></span>the highly controversial remarks of the Sankaracharya of Jagannath
Puri. Rightly or wrongly his views on the caste system have not been welcomed by
a large section of Hindus. Further and more definite proof of the existence of
the caste system is the fact that the Parliament of India has recently amended
the Constitution for the 23rd time, granting certain special privileges in the
form of reservation of seats in State Assemblies and the Lok and Rajya Sabhas
for the so-called untouchable or scheduled castes. This paper hopes to present
a few points on this ancient, all-important question, with the hope that the ideas
herein contained, will assist in bringing about recognition of the fact that
all men are born equal and, that while undoubtedly a hierarch, exists and will
continue to exist, this hierarchy should be based upon individual qualities and
not upon birth, bank balances, social and political position. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

must be understood at this stage that the Vedas were directed towards an attempt
to teach the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oneness</i> and Divinity <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>all creation. A clear
comprehension or the Vedic teachings culminating in the Upanishadic Mahavakyas,
such as, Aham Brahmasmi (God and man are one), Tat Twam Asi (That art Thous)
etc., all <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of<i> </i></span>which were
attempts to establish the divinity of all creation, is necessary when
considering the above verse. The description of the Lord in the Rig Veda is a
suggestive description of man <i>(purusha). </i>From this earliest reference to
the caste system, we see that man finds manifested within himself all the four
castes. The thinker or thinking aspect is the Brahmana. This is symbolised in
the head of man. The administrative or rulership aspect is symbolised in the
arms and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>the Kshatriya. The
productive or creative aspect is symbolised in the seat of fertility the loins
or thighs and is the Vaisya. The unthinking, yet necessarily functioning aspect
is symbolised in the feet, and is the Sudra. It can be inferred from this, that
all men are a curious admixture of all four castes, in a wonderful harmony.
Whenever and wherever man expresses himself as a thinker, he is a Brahmana at
that given moment. When he administers and rules he is the Kshatriya. When he
produces or creates or causes to produce and create, the Vaisya in him is being
manifested. The routine unthinking work that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>all </span>have to do every day <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>their lives, brings out the Sudra in man. Could this <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>not </span>be a reasonable, rational and
logical explanation <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>this the
earliest reference to the caste system? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that large <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>group </span>of humanity
calling themselves Hindus, one <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the
most authoritative of books is the Bhagavad Gita. It’s authority in guiding
Hindu philosophical and religious thought is undisputed. Those ideas contained
in the Gita that are true, are applicable to all men of<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the sun shines and the rain falls for sinner and saint alike, so is truth
applicable to one and all without alteration by time or place. In other words,
whatever is true in the Bhagavad Gita, extends beyond the small group calling <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>themselves </span>Hindus, and covers all <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>humanity throughout </span>all time. The
four <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>castes are to</span> be found not

for colour or sex. Either the Gita ideas relating to caste or for that matter
anything else, are true or untrue. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>If tr</span>ue,

be applicable to anyone, now <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>or </span>at

however vary and it is largely this variation that is responsible for the chaos

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
verse clearly indicates that the qualities and activities of the Individual determine
his caste. Since man, as the Lord Buddha so rightly stressed, is in a constant
state of flux; his qualities and activities are necessarily constantly
undergoing change. Which one of us has not felt the wonderful rapture of love,
the love of one’s mother, father, brother and sisters, of the beloved, sometimes
even of all fellow creatures? Who at sometime or other has not felt tenderness,
kindness, pity, the desire to help and to assist? Who can lift his hand and
truly say that he has never felt even a trace of bitterness, anguish, anger,
discontent, sorrow, jealousy, hatred, the desire for revenge? At the time when
positive qualities are present and are being manifested in action, that man is
certainly different from the same man when manifesting negative qualities. Sri
Krishna could be interpreted to imply that the category of classification of
caste would therefore be in accord with the attitude and way of life of the
individual at every separate given moment of life. This classification of caste
is a varying one, viz., a man is a Brahmana as long as and whenever he thinks
and acts like one. He (the same man) is a Kshatriya when his thinking and
acting are in accord with Kshatriya qualities. The same holds true for the
Vaisya and Sudra castes. This is not at variance with the Rig Veda verse quoted
earlier. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we decide, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>how m</span>uch is ‘most <span

the other qualities of the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra). <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>No, </span>it seems more reasonable <span

second quality of the Brahmana is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Self-restraint</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>. This i</span>mplies constantly abstaining
from thinking and doing anything co<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>nsidered
negative. It m</span>ight be asked who decides, or <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>by </span>what method is a negative action to be determined? Would it
be un-reasonable to say that every man has an innate sense <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>right and wrong, this sense being
known as ‘conscience’? This conscience unfailingly guides him who seriously
seeks. This is what Jesus meant when he said, “Seek and thou shalt find.” Negative
actions are those which after serious and careful thought, the individual himself
decides to be negative. This implies honest objectivity and, is an essential
part of self-restraint. Standards vary from individual to individual and from
the individual at one given moment to another. No greater self-restraint can be
manifested than by honestly refraining from acting in a fashion that one’s
conscience labels negative, Adharmic. How many of us can truly say we are <i>constantly
</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>self-restrained? For example, everyone
of us know that over-eating is wrong. Can any of us say that we never over-eat?
Is it ever possible for a man to be over-weight except by over-eating, yet
would it be right to say that all persons who are over-weight cannot possibly,
be possessing the qualities of a Brahmana? Obviously when a man is disregarding
the dictates of his connscience and is over-eating, he is not thinking and
acting as a Brahmana. Since there are bound to be many occasions when he tries
to exercise self-restraint and be abstemious, on every such occasion, he is
manifesting the quality of a Brahmana. Would it be reasonable to say that </span>X
is a perfectly self-restrained man and Y the opposite? X may undoubtedly
possess and manifest greater self-restraint but, perfection is more a
hypothetical, abstract, notional concept than a fact. Some undoubtedly come
closer to this ideal than others but, none is devoid totally of some form of self-restraint.
Absolute imperfection is equally a hypothetical, abstract, notional concept and
does not exist, except as a theory to assist us in attempting to understand the
varying degrees between these two extremes. A man of self-restraint has a questioning
mind, and, does not do things by rote or custom without giving serious consideration
to determine the soundness or otherwise of the act. Such a man would realise
that foolish, health-destroying habits like alcohol, tobacco, cofee, tea,
aerated drinks, spiced, fried and chilled foods, insufficiency or excess of activity
such as in exercise, excessive venery, lack of mental poise and many other
everyday acts are largely of a negative nature. How many do we know who
exercise <i>constant </i>self-restraint with regard to all of these and more?
How few bother to think of them at all and, fewer still who do think and, then
honestly implement all their beliefs. Truly, it can be said that he who has a
questioning mind and, tries to live in accordance with the answers, is indeed a
Brahmana, at least when so doing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that these qualities are round to a greater or lesser degree in all men, who

at that given time a Brahmana. When not thinking and acting in accordance with

43rd verse of the 18th chapter quoted and translated above, deals with the
qualities of a Kshatriya. The first is prowess. Valour and gallantry are the
hallmarks of a man with prowess. This is often misunderstood to mean,
willingness to fight physically in a righteous cause. It extends much beyond
this. It needs valour and determination to turn away from the many negative
temptations that in life confront man on innumerable occasions. The battles are
within and, while not being observable or recognisable, are all the more real
than any fought outside. Here again does it not appear eminently reasonable to
postulate that he who, regardless of births when he valiantly fights the battle
within and without, whoever he be, is at that moment a Kshatriya; capitulation
without the attempt to fight disqualifies him as long as the effort is lacking.
No one is barred at any time from attempting to qualify. After all, this along
with all the rest of the qualities is nothing but an attitude of mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the result of birth alone, but are developed and lived up to in accordance with
the determination and choice of the individual? No man, regardless of birth, is
a Kshatriya without all these qualities. Equally so, no man possessing these
qualities and manifesting them ceases to be a Kshatriya while so doing. The
same principles must and surely do hold good for the Vaisya and Sudra castes.

unit of inheritance in all forms of plant and animal life is the gene. The
nucleus of each sperm and each egg contains an assortment of threadlike bodies known
as chromosomes, which are composed of genes. Fertilisation invokes the union of
a sperm and an egg nucleus, so that the newly arisen individual possesses two sets
of chromosomes, and therefore a pair of each of the different genes. Half of
the inheritance thus comes from the sire and the other half from the dam, and all
the body cells normally contain within their nuclei, representatives of both
paternal and maternal genes, in paired form. When the individual starts producing
germ cells, a regular process of reduction of chromosome number takes place.
Thus the number of chromosomes entering each germ cell is half of that found in
body cells. The identity of the paternal and maternal set of chromosomes is not
preserved in this process, so that the chromosomes are re-sorted in each
generation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

improvements have been made but, no claim to homozygosity can as yet be made.
Even more complex are the characteristics of temperament and behaviour. With
the most rigid and controlled selection of many generations, the claim to
populations being homozygous for complex characteristics is very unlikely to be
advanced or, substantiated, and even if populations can be made homozygous for
complex characteristics, the moment controlled breeding is abandoned and
haphazard breeding made commonplace, heterozygosity would again rapidly become
the norm. Where selection is largely haphazard and directed by chance, it is
certain that heterozygosity becomes the norm, and <i>the predictability of the

experimentation and, even if they did, the period of time from generation to

significant value would not be forthcoming for at least a large number of
generations which would extend to centuries. Without making the subject
unreasonably lengthy, it will suffice at this stage to assert, that all of the
qualities and characteristics enumerated by Sri Krishna in his description of
the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra castes are, if they are to be considered
solely inheritable characteristics at all highly complex, and the result of
combinations of many different genes. The mathematical odds against any groups
of people possessing homozygous pairs of genes singly or plurally for these
characteristics are, stacked astronomically against such a situation. It could
be safely asserted that, with the largely random selection of mates that is and
has been the norm of human society throughout recorded history, no single
population or group could possibly be homozygous for even one of the
characteristics, let alone the lot put together. In simple language this means that
<i>inheritability of these characteristics by any single group of men existent
today, is totally unpedictable. </i>The science of genetics conclusively establishes
that no single group can claim by birth to be Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas or
Sudras, if they are to match up to the standards set by Sri Krishna in the

totally different from their respective castes. Among the Brahmana community,

communities. Unfortunately history records that society largely guided by the
Brahmana community, has placed the concept of the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya
and Sudra castes in that hierarchical order, though in fact all are equal. The
Brahmana and Kshatriya communities have together exploited the situation,
placating the Vaisyas by throwing them some crumbs. This means that an unholy
alliance of the Brahmana and Kshatriya communities, aided and abetted by the
Vaisya community, have systematically exploited the Sudra community, who form

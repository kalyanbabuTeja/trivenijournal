<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>Aldous Huxley in his introduction
to <i>The Perennial Philosophy </i>effectually defines the phrase <i>Philosophia
Perennis </i>as the “metaphysic that recognises a divine Reality substantial to
the world of things and lives and minds; the psychology that finds in the soul
something similar to, or even identical with divine Reality. The ethic that
places man’s final end in the knowledge of the immanent and transcendental
ground of all being–the thing is immemorial and universal.” A version of this
can be traced Coomaraswamy’s philosophy of art and aesthetics. </p>

reassertions of some of the more important ideas of traditional Indian
aesthetics are particularly convincing in fulfilling the necessary conditions
of spiritual knowledge. On the assumption that ultimate Reality is not
immediately apprehended by non-spiritual minds, the perennial philosophy
teaches that it is all important to understand the spiritual ground of things
as being present not only within the soul but also outside. Coomaraswamy,
upholding the tenets of the perennial philosophy, has, through an aesthetic
approach, established an ontological status to this philosophy as inevitably
immanent in all culture. No wonder his contribution to the world of art and
thought “flickers” at every step he takes with the “light” of tradition
recalling the universal doctrine of the philosophia perennis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

understand Coomaraswamy’s aestheticism the entailment of certain
presuppositions in the philosophia perennis has to be known; thereafter we can
discover his aesthetic facts and attitudes in apposition and in a relational
logic to the traditional Indian aestheties. In A. L. Herman’s article on “A. K.
C. and the Pertinence of Philosophy,” the author has worked out Coomaraswamy’s
admission of four assumptions entailed in the Perennial Philosophy. In them one
can apprehend the main features of Coomaraswamy’s insights into traditional
Indian aesthetics. They are: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Basically the aesthetic urge can be traced to this immanent Reality.) Naturally
the logical relation between the transcendence in man and the immanence of
Reality in him is found veritable. It can be argued then, that man as man is
ultimately real and hence invaluable; besides his transcendence is con-natural
to his being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to recognize the identity between the Universal powers (<i>Brahman</i>) within
him and “That” which is outside him (<i>Tat tvam asi</i>). Coomaraswamy cannot
avoid the admission of a rationalistic mental mode, which he seems to have
introduced, for the purpose of analysing the immanent Reality in man–perhaps
towards a reconciliation between science and metaphysics. However, he is
definite in saying that it is through “some” intellect or “grace” the Principle
of Identity is recognized. This is a contributory assumption especially for
idealists who seek meaning for art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Undoubtedly Coomaraswamy’s passion for Indian and
Oriental tradition and culture, besides his praise for mediaeval Christian art
has shown visible signs of a “retreat” to the depths of Indian aesthetic
“moods”, “attitudes” and doctrines. This is revealed in his interpretation of
Indian and Buddhist iconography. Speaking on the traditional concept of
portraiture, he distinctively admits that art as a part of tradition reveals a
“transparent” fact, viz., its spirituality. No wonder Coomaraswamy is a
ruthless critic of modernistic art beginning with the Renaissance as “moving
away from spirituality and meaning.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Coomaraswamy’s
“return to Reality” is evident in his interpretation of Hindu, Buddhist and
Jaina art. This fact is very explicitly stated in his article on “Aesthetics
and Relationships of Jaina Paintings.” Coomaraswamy is rather critical in his
assessment of Jaina paintings insofar as they are aesthetically not valuable.
Too much accomplishments in art in Dr. Coomaraswamy’s aesthetic judgment
converts art more towards a “workshop character” rather than in a production of
an aesthetic significance that can be “deeply felt.” Too much of details he
seems to think transforms a work of art to a “statement of fact” instead of an
expression of emotion. He contrasts “factual types of art” with the “Great
Renunciation of Buddha”, “Arjuna’s Penance”, etc., wherein “we are made to feel
that the going forth of the hero saint is an event of cosmic and more than
temporal significance.” Coomaraswamy is quite consistent in his aesthetic
interpretation of artistic facts. In the chapter on “Elements of Sinhalese
Design and Ornament” (<i>Mediaeval Sinhalese Art</i>) the Sun and Moon for
instance are made symbolic of (i) the Cosmic Energy or “the great beings that
control the physical world” and (ii) significant as symbols of eternity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>More
significant is the symbolic use of <i>hamsa</i>, the sacred swan, significantly
standing for discrimination (this bird has the sense to discriminate and drink
only the milk from a vessel of milk mixed with water) and aesthetically for
grace and gait, auspiciousness and beauty. It is obvious that Coomaraswamy is
in search of a “deeper reality” than the phenomenal appearance of art. Even in
a “climbing vine tree” this great exponent of the perennial philosophy is face
to face with the Cosmic Energy–the growth of energy, rhythm and discipline in
nature he explains in terms of an “eternal striving” towards an end not yet
attained. Or in his interpretation of the “Dance of Shiva”–a masterly
revelation of aesthetic magnificence of beauty, this “rupa state” of the Cosmic
Principle, has made him a perfect aesthete of the traditional type. Very much
like a traditional aesthetic master he is all praise for “rishi-artists” who in
“affording an image of Reality” he says have provided a “key to the complex
tissue of life, a theory of nature” not merely satisfactory to a single clique
or race, nor acceptable to the thinkers of one century only, but universal in
its appeal to the philosopher, lover and the artist of all ages and all
countries.” (<i>Dance of Shiva</i>, p. 94) This trend towards traditional
Indian aestheticism is amply visible when he speaks spontaneously out of the
abundance of his heart full of passion for the traditional, of the “power” and
“grace” of the dancing image as an expression of the intuition of life. The
traditional aesthetic formula for art-creation being in a combination of
certain constituents like Unity, Vitality, Infinity and Repose, Coomaraswamy
perceives them as immanent in the masterly execution of the Image of the Cosmic
Dancer symbolical of the <i>panca krityas</i>, it embodies. Here Coomaraswamy
emerges not merely as an interpreter of art but rather as an upholder of the
traditional aesthetic philosophers of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
his determination to go back to traditions of culture, Coomaraswamy seems to
have stumbled on to the threshold of a Consciousness and recognized certain
“virtuous and moving”, indeed an “essential quality” often spoken of as the
“aesthetic moment” essentially characteristic of qualities like freedom, power,
life, infinity, love, beauty and unity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
all aestheticians Coomaraswamy too accepts the senses as the vehicles through
which objects around and beyond form the structure of artistic experience.
Through audition and intuition or vision, the artist creates and expresses
artistic forms–their arrangements, composition, lines, sound and pattern. But
the question arises: “Is there no other meaning to art apart from its visual
and auditory arrangements? What is then the meaning of art? What does it convey
and what is its significant form? Coomaraswamy finds his answers in a
metaphysics that recognizes a single Reality. Starting here Coomaraswamy argues
on various aspects of art which takes him to the depths or traditional Indian
aesthetics, and to a recognition of a divine Reality functioning as the Single
Principle underlying the manifold world of objects, lives and minds. This
Single Reality is veritably declared as “That” which cannot be “seen” or
“known” by <i>pratyaksha</i> means of knowledge but only by <i>paroksha</i>
means. Arguing in retrogression this Reality cannot be apprehended through an
immediacy of the perception of only the sense-organs though admitting that this
level is the “first step” towards the understanding of the aesthetic meaning of
art. But the actual meaning is revealed through the transformations of the
internal organs like intellect, intuition, etc., in a realisation of
“something” resembling or identical with the Reality. Coomaraswamy argues if as
a matter of fact we ask for a reason for our everyday experience in supposing
that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, yet when water is subject to
certain drastic tests, we find the constituent elements of water are manifest;
if this is so, why ask the question: why. True meaning of aesthetics is found
in the traditions of Indian culture and philosophy? Coomaraswamy argues, if in
the case of a scientific instance, there is no reason for supposing that water
constitutes of two elements, there is no reason for supposing that the same
human mind has as its constituents “something resembling or identical with the
Reality, substantial to the manifold world.” This same mind when similarly (as
in the case of water) subjected to a drastic discipline its potentiality
manifests the divine. Here, Coomaraswamy does not merely establish the basis
for building up his own aesthetic theory; he vindicates the entire system of
Indian aesthetics from Bharata down to Jagannatha Pandita. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
here Coomaraswamy proceeds to say that in the <i>Srutis</i> and <i>Smritis</i>
of Indian scriptures is present the fundamental unity of experience. In his own
recognition of this Unity, Coomaraswamy has emerged as the greatest
contemporary exponent of the truths of traditional Indian aesthetics and in the
recognition of the truths of traditional culture: that the forms and experience
of finite life are ‘revelations of the Infinite.” (Vide <i>Introduction</i> <i>to
Indian Art</i>) He speaks of the finite in art in terms of the six limbs of
painting, viz., <i>Rupa-bheda </i>(distinction of forms), <i>Pramanam</i>
(proportion), <i>Bhava</i> (mood), <i>Lavanya-yajanan</i> (infusion of
saltness, i.e. beauty as the “essence”–salt being essential to food).
Coomaraswamy’s usage of this term can be equated with <i>Soundarya</i> or <i>ramanya</i>.
Madbusudana Saraswati is supposed to have described Sri Krishna’s Universal
Form thus: <i>Soundarya Sara Sarvasva</i>. (Supreme treasure of quint essential
beauty) and <i>Varnika-bhanga </i>(distribution of pigments–knowledge of
colours to each subject). It is indeed indicative, that Coomaraswamy’s
aesthetics has its beginning and end in traditional thoughts and hence in
traditional aesthetics too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the pioneer Indian aesthetician, has given an apt definition to aesthetics in
its triple involvements–as <i>Rasa Brahma Vada, Nada Brahma Vada </i>and <i>Vastu
Brahma Vada, </i>corresponding respectively to the fine arts of painting, music

consciousness of the transcendence of man. With extra-ordinary profundity of
thought and persuasiveness of language he has brought out traditional aesthetic
significance through metaphysics and iconography. One can grasp a kind of a

is remarkably noticeable in the comparison Coomaraswamy draws between Rajput
and Moghul paintings, that his leanings are towards traditional aesthetics. He
enhances the themes of the Rajput paintings with contrast-study of the themes
of Moghul paintings. The latter he points out centre around persons and events
and he designates them as, “art of portraiture and chronicle,” very academic,
and objective and eclectic; the former he evaluates as aristocratic folk-art
which “appeals to all class, static and lyrical (<i>History of Indian and
Indonesian Art</i>. Vide, Part IV). Critically reflecting on the Moghul
paintings to the extent of their inconceivability apart from the life they
reflect, he regrets that they are devoid of poetical background and the “old
songs” seem to weary his heart….” the love story of Farhad and Shiria......old
and “savour” less. It can be obviously concluded here that what Coomaraswamy is
looking for in art is not singularity or novelty; nor sophistication or
details; rather he is in search of the simplicity of ancient themes which have
their sources in Indian scriptures, the <i>Srutis</i> and <i>Smritis</i> the
epics and the Puranas. The <i>Ragamala</i> series, the <i>Gitagovinda</i>, <i>Hour
of the Cowdust</i>, <i>Ras-Lila </i>paintings have their aesthetic value for
Coomaraswamy purely because of their themes found originating from traditional
culture. He is conscious here of an evocation, con-natural with aesthetic
taste. The traditional constituent factors necessary for aesthetic realisations
or experiences in the form of the traditional concept of <i>Rasa</i> is
entailed in Coomaraswamy’s aesthetics approximating to an intelligent
understanding of human lives and feelings, explicitly presented in the Rajput
paintings and the iconography of the Hindu and Buddhist art. Their involvement
of the themes of the innate daily life, or prayers and states of meditation as
of the movements of the <i>Ragas</i> and <i>Raginis</i>, their “slender and
moving grace of irresistible beauty” intentionally accentuated by their long,
flowing lines of drapery.” (<i>History of Indian and Indonesian Art</i>. Vide,
fig. 271) His traditional aesthetic taste is further evidenced in the
evaluation he ascribes to Rajput paintings, being a kind of “pure melody” in
contrast to late Persian and late Rajasthan art, these being calligraphic and
“boldly allusive.” Traditional aesthetics of Abhinavagupta and the rest of the
commentators on Bharata’s dictum: <i>vibhaavaanubhaa vyabhichaarisam
yogathirasannipatih</i> is reflected in a subtle form in Coomaraswamy’s theory
of beauty as a kind of “tasting” of the essence (<i>Rasa</i>) of art. The
Indian aesthetician’s concept of pleasure as a kind of a joy referred to as <i>paranirvritti</i>–or
“higher pleasure”–can also be inferred from the ‘absolute” qualities,
Coomaraswamy speaks of. Sri Aurobindo describes it as a kind of delight of the
“Soul of existence and beauty”, an intense impression of the concentrated form
of joy. This thought can be traced to the sons in the Sama Veda <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“brought to light the ancient wisdom” which is of a “ profound spiritual
nature,” and a “step” towards the realisation of the “oneness” of Reality
latent in the multiplicity of world-objects and events. In agreement with the
early Indian aestheticians, Coomaraswamy speaks of a consciousness–elevation of
the mind; Abhinavagupta analyses the imaginative level (<i>alaukika</i>) of
Valmiki’s poetic outburst of the Balakaanda section of Ramayana, in terms of a
transportation of the mind-the same “conscious elevation” wherein is revealed
to the artist and the aesthete the inner principle through the <i>paroksha</i>
vision of art. Coomaraswamy says this is recognizable in a state of
consummation “thought and feelings” through a temporary Daivam <i>Mithunam</i>

non-differentiating” experience of the oneness of Reality–“a stage” he says

“illuminating” the objects and evoking at the same time the innermost states (<i>bhavas</i>)
towards new directions and realisations. At this level of aesthetic
consciousness one distinguishes the kind of perception involved as that of
“things known” rather than that of “things perceived”. No doubt Abhinavagupta
used the mental mode–intuition or <i>Prathibha</i>–which according to the
Indian aesthetician’s point of view is definable as the power of visualisation
of the aesthetic image in all its fulness. In relation to the functional aspect
of the icons and the symbolicism, <i>Pratibha</i> can also be understood as
“the power of the mind to know the subtle.” Coomaraswamy’s functional aspect
which necessitates the presence of intelligibility in art-experience can be
further analysed in relation to Bhatta Nayaka’s theory of <i>Rasa</i>, which
involves a new cognizing activity called <i>Bhoga</i>. However, this, new
distinct function, ascribed to Bhatta Nayaka’s importation of this special
power, can be reckoned as a principle devised to free aesthetic pleasure from
all relativities, besides its use as an auxiliary in the process of <i>Rasa</i>
realisation; furthermore, eliminating all dualities in the final state of
aesthetic enjoyment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Coomaraswamy’s functional aspects involving the intelligibility of art objects
suggests of a “flash” into the “Implied Meaning” (<i>Dhvani</i>) which again
seems very similar to intuition which visions reality. In Coomaraswamy’s

the theory of beauty implied in Coomaraswamy’s philosophy of art, one sees an
obvious link with India’s past culture and philosophy, Foremost in his mind is
the metaphysical significance he gives to the concept of beauty. In tone with
traditionalism he elevates this absolute quality to the “highest height of
being” (Ramaswamy Sastri, <i>Concept of the Beautiful</i>, p. 4) Coomaraswamy’s
traditional leanings are also evident in his views on the disciplines that go
with worthy art. <i>Saadhana</i>, <i>Mantram</i> and <i>Dhyanam</i> he argues
are the disciplinary steps for artistic creations and their experiences. It is
also mentioned in the <i>Agnipurana</i> that the Indian architects pray to the
deities to teach them in dreams how to execute the work which he has in mind.
In the <i>Rama Tapanya Upanishad</i> this idea is prevalent specially referred
to in the <i>Dhyanasloka</i>. It is evident that this kind of disciplinary
involvement which has the potentiality to produce the kind of “slow relish” of
art experience distinguishes it from a momentary mood of enjoyment. In
aesthetic language it is the “flavour” that is tasted (<i>aasvaadyate</i>) as
“sweet juice.” If Coomaraswamy speaks of the “vibrant inner life”, it is no
doubt significantly symbolised in the images. The expressions of calmness,
infinite repose and vibrant energy of the icons, even the infinite suffering,
for instance, in the crucification of Christ and the compassion on Buddha’s
face, are all symbolic representation of the ideals latent in artist’s mind–an
expression of the “vibrant inner life” capable of generating the aesthetic joy
of <i>Rasanubhava</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

revealed in the form of a beautitude according the aesthete an unfathomable

evidenced in the interpretation Coomaraswamy gives to the Hindu and Buddhist
iconography. Both Coomaraswamy and the author of <i>Rasagangadhara</i> seem to
have gone into the depth of aesthetic consciousness and there discovered that <i>Rasa</i>
is the inner-reality, its non-remoteness to the essential bliss nature of self
(Atman) giving it the “flavour” which is the enjoyment of the beauty of the
Divine. Jagannatha brings the <i>Sahridaya</i> (aesthete) on a par with the <i>Vedanta</i>

vision.” Coomaraswamy seems to have accepted this conclusion on the basis of

on “The Traditional Conception of Ideal Portraiture” (<i>Christian and Oriental
Philosophy of Art</i>) Coomaraswamy sounds both traditional and Indian,
interpreting Indian and Buddhist iconography with praise for the “makers of
divine images” who followed the Indian <i>Sukranitisara</i> (IV, 4. 76)
according to the canonical prescription; on the other hand he condemns the
portrayal of human likenesses as, “not heavenward leading.” Evidently
Coomaraswamy distinguishes in Indian art and iconography two different kinds of
portraiture–” the appearance of the man on the one hand and on the other the
interior image of the very man invisible to the physical eye, but accessible to
the age of contemplation”–an analogy to the “Looking glass image” and the
veritable spiritual essence; a distinction drawn in the <i>Chandogya Upanishad </i>(VIII
8.5) which Coomaraswamy relates to that “spiritual essence” of the very Self (<i>Atman</i>).
He also cites reference from the <i>Uttaratantra</i> of Maitreya (88-91)
illustrating the significance of the realisation of the “whole transcendence
person of the Buddha by means of a transformative constitution of all its
parts.” What Coomaraswamy is interested here is to clarify the sharp
distinction (similar to that of the <i>Chandogya</i> <i>Upanishad</i>) between
the spiritually essential person and the empirical ego. From a logical point of
view, this distinction, Coomaraswamy hopes, would help the artist and the lover
of art to visualise the content of art and the significance of the spiritual
principle underlying all art. From a philosophical sense and as an aesthetic
valuation, this principle is bound to “conquer” as he says “the figure of art.”
One is inclined to conclude here that aesthetics is linked with a technique of
pursuit in the sense it assures the personal participation in that particular
type of pursuit. As implied in the traditional Indian aesthetics a moral
standard is involved in Coomaraswamy’s aesthetics as well. Aesthetics becomes a
human value–not as mere <i>kama</i> (pleasure) or <i>artha</i> (wealth) but
more akin to <i>dharma</i> (moral value) and perhaps a directing towards <i>moksha</i>
(spiritual value). Herman Goetz and Jacques De Marquette have rightly said that
Coomaraswamy’s aesthetics is “enhancing” in many ways; he has no doubt broken
“the new ground” and has given a new impulse and a “rebirth” to aesthetics.
Bound up with traditional thought Coomaraswamy would argue that to relegate
aesthetics to an inferior status is “sub-human.” He would say it is an
“exclusion of the pursuit of pleasure,” thought of as a “diversion” and “apart
from life.” It is rather “life itself” in “proper operation”; and an
“attractive power of perfection.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
traditional trend is visible in very many aspects of Coomaraswamy’s
aesthestics. Speaking of the “attracting power of perfection,” it is no doubt
attainable in a state of contemplation. The traditionalist spoke of it in terms
of a state of immersion or rest (<i>visranti</i>). In fact Coomaraswamy remarks
that a man “incapable of contemplation cannot be an artist.” What he means by
contemplation is “to raise our level of reference from the empirical to the
ideal, from the observation to vision, from an auditory sensation to audition.”
This is the state where the aesthete is “immersed” says Coomaraswamy, to create
and enjoy the “inner realities” (<i>Koiseit pramatrubhih</i>) exhaltation of
pure consciousness (<i>Satvodrat</i>), self-luminous (Svaprakaasa): in a mode
at once of ecstasy and intellect...” (<i>anandachinmaya</i>). (<i>Transformation
of Nature in Art</i>, p. 48; the author also quotes Pandita Viswanadha’s <i>Sahitya
Darpana</i>, III. 2-3.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>More prominently evident is Coomaraswamy’s emphasis
of the intelligibility of the ideal in art, which according to his theory is
recognizable as the vital principle. This reminds us of the “cognizing
activity” called <i>bhoga</i> which Bhattanayaka had introduced into his aesthetic
theory to overcome the defect in his predecessor, Sri Sankara’s Inference
Theory. A non-dualistic nature of aesthetic experience is maintained here to do
away with the diverse extraneous factors that go to make up art. The
applicability of the principle of vital force is appropriately illustrated in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Dance</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>of Shiva</i>–a synthesis in form and content of all constituent factors
that go to convey the “Beautiful” in art. Beauty is significant insofar as it
serves the purpose of the communicability of its experience, besides
stimulating the aesthetic sensibility. In a remote way one might argue in
favour of intelligibility as the basis for creating aesthetic states, and their
enjoyment; beauty then becomes an aesthetic quality. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Dance of Shiva</i> contains innumerable questions for which answers
are traceable to traditional aesthetics. “What is it” for instance, “that
entitles us to speak of diverse works as beautiful or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>rasavant</i>?” (“That Beauty is a state”) or, “What is this sole
quality which the most dissimilar works of art possess in common?” Take, for
instance, the technique of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rasa</i>
realisation of our traditional aestheticians. Coomaraswamy recalls that, </p>

paintings to evoke “appropriate inevitable reactions....” creating “pure

Indian view of the “indefinable flavour in which the inner Self, rather than

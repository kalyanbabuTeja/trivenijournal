reducing the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. It is based on
a misunderstanding of the constitutional position and powers of Parliament, and

Constitution, according to the <span class=SpellE>Encyclopaedia</span>
Britannica in the wider sense, is the whole scheme regulating a country’s
government. Jennings describes a constitution as “The document in which are set
out the rules governing the composition, powers and methods of <span
class=GramE>operation</span> of the main institutions of government and the
general principles applicable to their relations with the citizens, it merely
sets out the rules determining the operation of governmental institutions.” If
there is more than one institution of government it arranges the relations
between them–between the legislature and the judiciary and the executive. “It
assigns” in Chief Justice Marshall’s words, “to different departments their
respective powers.” In the judgment on <span class=SpellE>Marbury</span> <i>vs.
</i><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madison</st1:place></st1:City>
(1803) he acknowledged that “The people have an original right to establish for
their future government such principles as in their opinion will not conduce to
their own happiness, the exercise of this right is a very great exertion nor
can it nor ought it to be frequently repeated.” He went on to say, “The principles
so established are deemed fundamental and as the authority from which they
proce</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>permanent.”
Now, the principles so established for the Government of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> after
independence by the people through their representatives in the Constituent
Assembly are contained in Part IV, the chapter on Fundamental Rights. They are
the principles on which the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

only with the mechanics of government, and the machinery of government. They
are apart from and above the Constitution which directs the machinery of
government, the working of its several parts and their relation with one
another. Fundamental Rights are not part of the Constitution–not that part
which can be changed by amendment according </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
doctrine has begun to wear thin. In a recent history of English Law <i>(Social
History of English law </i>by Harding 1966) the author speaks of a fundamental
law in England. <span class=SpellE>Fortescue</span> referred to a formulation
of fundamental law under which both king and subject had rights. The modern
historic traces reference to it from Stuart times when lawyers turned to
history to justify<i> </i>their view of the Constitution (that the king was not
above the law) because antiquity was the only attribute of the fundamental law
they all invoked. The great lawyer, Coke, who resisted King James I and was
removed from office, believed that there were some fundamental principles
behind English law which it was inadvisable for Parliament to alter. In Dec.,
1641 in the Grand Remonstrance the Commons denounced the king “for a malignant
and pernicious design of subverting the fundamental laws and principles of
government.” In medieval times and in recent years <span class=SpellE>Dicey’s</span>
theory of the sovereignty of Parliament has been called in question. There are
many things Parliament cannot do. “No parliament,” says Professor <span
class=SpellE>Laski</span>, “would dare to disfranchise </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
Roman Catholics or to prohibit the existence of trade unions.” Dicey was drawn
by this inability to distinguish between legal sovereignty and political
sovereignty. But then as Professor Jennings points out, legal sovereignty,
which is a lawyer’s concept, is not sovereignty at all, it is not supreme
power. And by legal sovereignty the lawyers express the relations between
Parliament and the courts, the courts recognize any law passed by Parliament as
valid. The political <span class=SpellE>soveriegn</span> is the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Modern
English political thought also has given currency to the idea of certain
fundamental laws binding Parliament. Locke argued that although the legislative
power is supreme, even absolute is not arbitrary, unlimited. Legislative
supremacy for Locke was not the right of a legislature to do anything that it
wished or in any way it wishes. <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span> in his
Constitutional Code (1870-80) rejected parliamentary supremacy emphatically and
adopted the principle of the French Constitution of 1791, which had been
advocated by <span class=SpellE>Sieyes</span> of a constitutional authority, to
which the other authorities of the State including the Legislature was to be
subordinated. According to <span class=SpellE>Bentham</span> the legislative
power is subordinate to “supreme constitutive power.” According to <span
class=SpellE>Bayehot</span>, to attribute sovereignty to the Commons is to
misunderstand the power the Ministers exercise on the one-hand and the role of
the electorate on the other. He also like <span class=SpellE>Behtham</span>
held the sovereignty or supremacy of the legislature as being qualified by the
power of a constitutional authority. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is so far a unitary government like that of England, without a formal

Black writing on the Bill of Rights in <i>New York University Law Review </i>April
1960, wrote: “It is my belief that there are ‘absolutes’ in the Bill of Rights
and they were put there on purpose by men who knew what words meant and meant
these prohibitions to be absolute as to the ground that a supreme public
interest justifies the abridgement (of these rights). I think the Bill of
Rights makes its <span class=SpellE>safgaurds</span> superior.” Mr. Justice
Jackson in West Virginia State Board of Education <i>vs. </i><span
class=SpellE>Banette</span> said, “One’s right to life, liberty and property,

itself in support of this stand. At the very commencement of the chapter on

any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any
law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the
contravention be void. And what is meant by the State includes the Government
and Parliament of India and the Government and the legislature of each of the
States and all local authorities or other authorities within the territory of
India or under the control of the Government India. As if to make this denial
to Parliament of the power to amend the fundamental rights this chapter
provides for certain of these rights being subject to legislation by
Parliament. </p>

from certain provisos of certain articles providing for the State to safeguard

to legislate towards ensuring the exercise of certain rights, e.g., Act 22 (7).

These provisions for Parliamentary intervention which are meant to implement
and facilitate the exercise of certain rights guaranteed to certain backward
classes and not to deny or reduce the rights as the Bill in Parliament seems to
do, are exemptions, that prove the rule that fundamental rights are
unassailable by Parliament even when acting on its constitution-amending

the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

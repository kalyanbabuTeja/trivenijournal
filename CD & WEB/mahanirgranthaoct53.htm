Shrenika, the ruler of Magadha, one day went for recreation to a garden called
Mandikukshi. Studded with various trees, plants and creepers, bedecked with diverse
sweet-smelling flowers and resounding with the warble of many kinds of birds,
the garden shone like Nandanavana, the garden of Paradise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

strolling about in the garden, King Shrenika came upon a shramana (Jaina
ascetic), seated in a yogic posture at the foot of a tree, his body enfolded in
a blaze of light and his mind plunged in deep meditation. King Shrenika was
charmed by the bright complexion, the beaming, graceful face and the attractive
beauty of the shramana, who appeared to him to be a living image of
forgiveness, desirelessness and detachment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

went to the sannyasin, thrice walked round and, bowed to him, and, taking his
seat neither very near him nor very far, asked him with folded hands: “Arya,
you are now in the prime of youth, why do you lead this austere life of a
shramana, instead of enjoying the pleasures of life? I am feeling rather
curious to know the reason of it; be kind enough to tell me.” The sannyasin
replied: “O king, I was helpless, I had neither master nor protector nor
friend, and that was why I had to take recourse to this path.” On hearing the
shramana’s words, Shrenika said with a flicker of a smile on his lips, “O
high-souled one, can it be true that there is no protector and master of such a
man as you who are endowed with an exquisite beauty, grace and courage? O
self-controlled sage, I will be myself your protector and patron. Please live
in my kingdom and enjoy yourself to your heart’s content with your near and
dear ones. I will protect you in all ways.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sage answered, “King, how can you, who are yourself helpless, be my protector?”
When Shrenika heard these words of the shramana, which he had never heard
before, he was struck with amazement and said, “Sage, I have many elephants,
horses, armies, attendants, wives, and a considerable number of subjects; and I
am their lord and master. They are always at my beck and call. How then am I
helpless? What is the significance of your words? Why do you delude me with
words that are false?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sage answered: “King, you do not know who is a helpless person. I am going to
tell you how a man becomes helpless and otherwise; listen with quiet attention.
King, in the famous city of Kaushambi my father was a very rich merchant. I had
my mother, my brothers and sisters, both elder and younger, and my wife. Once
in my youth I was attacked with a very </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>acute rheumatic pain,
which caused high fever attended with </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>burning sensation all
over the body. There was an excruciating pain, fiercely burning like Indra’s
thunder-bolt, in my waist, heart and head,–a pain which was beyond all power of
endurance. My father called in many medical men, surgeons and physicians and
also healers by incantation, and announced his resolve to give all his wealth
and property to the one who could cure me. But none of them could relieve me of
even one jot or title of my enormous pain. King, this was my state of utter
helplessness. In order to remove my suffering, my mother, brothers and sisters
nursed me as best as they could and promised votive offerings to various gods
and goddesses; my devoted and faithful wife flooded her breast with bitter
tears of grief day and night; she gave up all comfort and luxury and engaged
herself exclusively in my nursing. But all went in vain. O king, such was my helplessness!
When I was thus suffering from that intolerable pain, I thought within myself,
‘How many times, it may be, have I not suffered from such an acute pain in my
numberless past lives; but I have not yet thought of any means of stopping it,
and so, again and again, I have to undergo it! If my pain leaves me during this
night, then at the very break of day tomorrow I shall renounce the world, take
the shramana initiation and exert myself to the utmost of my capacity, so that
I may not have to suffer from such a racking pain again in future.’ O king,
with this thought in my mind, as soon as I went to bed, I fell asleep, and when
the day dawned, all my pain had disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day in the morning I left my home with the permission of my parents and relatives,
and by an initiation into the discipline of the shramanas, acquired detachment,
self-control and freedom from all kinds of violence. Now I have become master
of myself and master of all creatures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

helplessness of man. You have realised the object of your human birth. You have
justified your possession of such uncommon beauty and grace. O Mahanirgrantha,
you alone are master of yourself and protected and befriended by all; for, you
are following with firmness the dharma taught by the Tirthankaras. O great

of others.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is unfortunate that India’s leading political organisation has to face an
internal crisis when the General Elections are drawing near. A great
institution like the Congress, which owed its success mainly to the efforts of
Gandhiji and his followers, ought not to fritter its energies in domestic
quarrels, while problems of first-rate national importance await solution. The
winning of freedom is but the first step in our march towards the achievement
of the noble objectives laid down in our Constitution. Between now and the end
of the year is the testing time. The vast millions of our countrymen admitted
to universal franchise must decide between rival policies and programmes, and
thereby indicate the shape of things to come in the political as well as the
economic and cultural spheres. And well-organised political parties are needed
to guide the electorate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Congress has no prescriptive right to the governance of the country. But at the
crucial moment in our history when Britain resolved to ‘divide and quit’, the
Congress was running the Governments in most of the Provinces and was the
senior partner at the centre. It could not, despite Gandhiji’s suggestion,
divest itself of the responsibility of governing the country till the first
General Elections under the new Republican Constitution. Even in the framing of
that constitution, the Congress had to play a prominent role with the
co-operation of eminent individuals outside its ranks. To argue that on the
15th of August 1947 the Congress should have dissolved itself, is to miss the
significance of the events that led to the change-over of power from British to
Indian hands. The Constituent Assembly was already<i> </i>in session and that
Assembly was to act as a provisional Parliament to which the new Cabinet was
responsible. If the provi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sional arrangements had to subsist longer
than was originally intended, it was because firstly of the upheaval following
on partition, and secondly of the difficulty of creating the huge electoral
machinery of the new Democracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Central Cabinet, with Nehru as Prime Minister, worked under difficult
conditions. Its lapses were many, but none can deny that behind it all was an
earnest desire to serve the country and its people. There is always an inherent
contradiction in a fighting organization</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> becoming a Government.
The qualities needed are different, and even the best of leaders wobble. But
with the experience of the past few years, the Congress ought to go forward and
provide a sta</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ble, yet progressive, Government for a term of
five years. Thus only can the gains of freedom be consolidated and the
foundations laid for the future. Other parties can educate the electorate, win
support for their programmes, and function in healthy opposition to the
Congress in the various Legislatures. But there does not seem to be any chance
of an alternative government during the next term. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the best friends of the Congress do not, however, wish its continuance in power
without an immediate and radical change in it outlook. Power has corrupted it
and the secession of some of its choice spirits has robbed it of a portion of
its prestige. It is the presence of Nehru which, in the view of millions, makes
the Congress dependable Party. To go to the polls and to seek power without the
dynamic personality of Nehru, would be to court disaster. He is today the one
man in the Congress who can be trusted to re-vitalize it. His resignation from
the Executive has not come as a surprise, for events since the last session of
the Congress at Nasik have marked a decline in the morale of Congressmen. The
politics of the U.P. have intruded into the all-India sphere, and today the
Congress has to make a choice between Tandon and Nehru. The President of the
Congress is technically right when he claims sole responsibility for the
formation of the Working Committee. He may even command a majority at the next
meeting of the A.I.C.C. But that would be a victory worse than defeat. Nehru
has all along made it clear that he does not want Tandon to retire from the
Presidentship. But, in view of recent developments, he is keen on a complete
overhauling of the Executive. Tandon did not agree at Bangalore, nor is he
likely to do so at Delhi. And he has complicated matters by insisting that
Governments formed under Congress auspices must be guided by the Congress Executive.
That attitude was perhaps correct with reference to the days before
Independence, when the Governments </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in the Provinces were
subordinated to an autocratic Central Government at Delhi, and the final stages
of the freedom fight had yet to be gone through. It is the Congress Legislature
Parties rather than the Congress organisation that should now guide the
Cabinets, Central or States’. This is in accordance with democratic practice in
recent times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

country is awaiting with trepidation the outcome of the split between the
Tandonites and the Nehruites. Senior leaders are striving to bring about an
understanding, but so far all attempts in that direction have failed. To the
common citizens of the country who look forward to a rejuvenated Congress wielding
power for another term, the solution is clear. The A.I.C.C. should request the
present members of the Working Committee and the Election Committee to resign
voluntarily, and then authorise Tandon and Nehru to reconstitute the Committees
so as to win the confidence of the country. The policy of drift must cease, and
the titular Head of the Congress learn to respect the wishes of the real leader
of the Congress and the nation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Persistent
talk of a ‘Jehad’ has led to further estrangement between India and Pakistan.
The Prime Minister of Pakistan objects to the stationing of Indian troops near
the frontier, though he is well aware that this move was necessitated by the
growing war-mindedness of Pakistan. The so-called peace-move on his part is a
crude attempt to put India in the wrong and to score a debating point for
purposes of international propaganda. The invitation to Nehru to visit Karachi
for a personal discussion was coupled with conditions which India could not
possibly accept without stultifying itself. The prolonged correspondence
between the Prime Ministers has ceased, but not the unbridled insolence of the
Pakistan press and leader. India, however, has definitely stated that she has
no aggressive designs against Pakistan, while she is ready to resist any
violation of Indian territory, including in that term the State of Kashmir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is well to bear in mind that Sir Owen Dixon was positive that Pakistan was the
aggressor in Kashmir according to all accepted canons of international law. It
is still a mystery why the Security Council did not proceed on that basis but,
instead, sought to put Pakistan and India on the same level. It urged a
simultaneous withdrawal of Indian and Pakistan forces from Kashmir and the
virtual suspension of the validly constituted Government of Kashmir. India
declared her willingness to implement the resolutions of the Security Council
to which she was a party, subject to the assurances given by the U. N.
Commission on Kashmir at the time when the resolutions were accepted by India.
It is highly improper to ignore the assurances,–which related to the presence
in Kashmir of Indian and State troops during the period of the Plebiscite,–or
to suggest that their interpretation should be left to an arbitrator like
Admiral Nimitz. The entire issue was clouded by the desire of the
Anglo-American bloc to confer an unfair tactical advantage on Pakistan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
India, there is no panic. All political parties and all communities, including
the Muslims of India, are resolved to resist aggression. Anxious for a peaceful
settlement India, conceded point after point before the Security Council, till
a position was reached when this spirit of accommodation was actually mistaken
for weakness. Further yielding would have meant a betrayal of Kashmir. The
people of Kashmir, under Sheikh Abdullah’s heroic leadership, claim the right
to decide their own future. They are not misled by the two-nation theory; they
perceive that their interests are linked with India. According to them, no
outside power can be permitted to interfere in the affairs of Kashmir, and
Pakistan which sought to enslave them by abetting the raiders cannot claim the
allegiance of Kashmir on the ground that there is a Muslim majority in the
State. Kashmir and the Kashmiris will ring the death-knell of the obnoxious two
nation theory. A vigorous blow has already been given to it by the leading
Muslim statesmen of India in their recent memorandum to Dr. Graham. This is a
revealing document, which thoroughly exposes the pretensions of Pakistan as the
champion of Islamic interests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all over India, there are gifted individuals who have given two or three
decades of devoted service to the cause of journalism. The call came to them
early in life, and they found their way into the offices of leading newspapers
published in English or Indian languages. But except in a few cases, their lot
has not been happy. Overworked and underpaid, and often discharged at short
notice, they had to migrate from one paper to another, starting each time at
the bottom rung. With the growth of what are called ‘chain’ newspapers run by
powerful individuals in the various cities of India, it has become increasingly
difficult for these displaced journalists to find fresh employment. By aptitude
and training, they are fit for high-class work in a specialised field, and they
cannot in their late forties or middle fifties change into a new profession.
The careers C. V. H. Rao and K. Rama Rao, who have been turned adrift time
after time, illustrate this position. A few have adventured ‘on their own’ and
started weeklies and monthlies which are usually choked off after a few years
of precarious existence, unless they belong to the cheap, sensational type.
C.P. Rao who sustained heavy losses on his <i>Premier </i>and <i>Citizen </i>at
Vijayawada has had to go back to daily journalism in Bombay. The journalists
without personal means are at a disadvantage compared with friends of the same
intellectual calibre in professions like law, teaching, and the administrative
services. And yet, there is something in journalism, as there is in art or
literature, which attracts the best minds attuned to idealism. The pity is that
this very idealism places them at the mercy of the Press Barons who have of
late, turned Indian journalism from a mission to a mere business proposition.
We seem to have travelled a long way from the <i>A.B. Patrika </i>of Motilal

saddest instance of a career of prolonged strugg1e is that of poor Nyapati
Narayana Murty, who passed away recently while working as Editor of a new
Telugu weekly, which was wound up immediately after his demise. Prior to that
he was on a short-lived daily. Sometimes, he had his own personal ventures,
beginning with the brilliant <i>Andhra Vani </i>in his home-town of Berhampore.
He came of a family of distinguished lawyers, and was marked out for the
ancestral profession, But in the B.A. class in one of the Madras Colleges,
Non-co-operation claimed him. Then followed the usual round of Congress work,
imprisonment at intervals, sporadic employment in newspaper offices, a brief
term in the Central Legislature, unemploymennt and poverty. Narayana Murty was
dear to me, and the story of his life of adventure and aspiration moved me
deeply. Like many in South India, I shall miss his sweet presence and the

</i>for the first time, and lovers of literature have always been delighted to
read them. From 1942 to 1948 <i>Triveni </i>was published in Bangalore under
Sri Masti’s protecting care. To me, personally, he has been an elder brother,
guiding me through life’s intricate paths. He has taught me to love the Lord
and to submit without hesitation to His will. Late in life, I learnt Kannada in
order to read Masti in the original and to follow his conversation. And this
has brought me joy in abundance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Masti shares with Sri D. V. Gundappa and the late Prof. B. M. Srikantia the
honour of heralding the literary renaissance in Karnataka. This group of
friends made writing in Kannada fashionable in an era in which the most
brilliant products of Indian Universities paid scant attention to literature in
the Indian languages. They were among the stalwarts of the Kannada Sahitya
Parishat, acting one after another as its Vice-Presidents. They set up high
standards of literary taste and achievement and exerted a beneficent influence
on the younger intellectuals like Prof. V. Sitaramiah and Prof, T. N.
Srikantaiya. Between Sri Masti and the writers in Kannada belonging to all
parts of Karnataka, there is a bond of intense affection. In this way a
literary tradition has been fostered, of which modern Karnatak is proud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

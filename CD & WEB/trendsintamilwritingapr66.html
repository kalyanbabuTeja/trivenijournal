seeking to survey the trends in Tamil writing today, one’s task appears to be
easy on the surface. For the period involved in this kind of survey seems to be
just a generation. But the growth during this short period has been so
accelerated that the volume of material one will have to wade through even for
a general assessment is breathtakingly huge. Any cursory attempt to discern the
trends in this context will necessarily appear superficial. If in the process
the result is akin to the attempt of the six blind men who sought to describe
the eleJfi1ant, one need not even be apologetic about it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
enormity of the task can be imagined when one remembers the hundreds of names
which are familiar in the field of Tamil writing. In a world where social
status and political power intrude upon the cultural field, it is not easy, for
the mere writer whether professional or amateur, to make headway in claiming
public attention. Such intrusion, even when it results in patronage serves to
provide unjustified weightage to unassessed merit, In a way this circumstance
seems to have given the urge necessary for the creative writer to rise in
intellectual revolt, thereby ushering in the renaissance in Tamil letters.
This, to all purposes, seems to have happened about a quarter century ago in
the wake of post-Bharati revival, based mainly on nationalistic upsurge.
Political discontent and a helpless awareness of social stagnation had taken
hold of the people all over the country and thinking men in Tamil Nad were
trying to shake off their intellectual somnolence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Tamil reading public at that time was being entertained to longwinded but
readable melodramatic stories often adapted from nineteenth century English
fiction of ordinary merit. There was not much activity and the average reader
was himself being discovered by journals like <i>Ananda Vikatan. </i>Writers of
critical and academic bent like Swaminatha Ayyar, Tiru Vi Ka and a few others
had set things to do, in that their subject-matter was restricted to the
editing of the classics or expounding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>traditional modes of living. Lone giants like Rajam Iyer and Madhaviah
had blazed trails which waited in vain for followers. Journalism, which is
always the feeder for a more permanent kind of writing, had not made much
headway. The literary fire kindled by Bharati and V. V. S. Iyer Jay smouldering
for want of fuel of the proper variety. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Into
this atmosphere of brooding uncertainty <i>Manikkodi </i>came as a cloudburst
and the lightning streaks of Va Ra’s writings roused readers to a sense of
extraordinary perception. Left alone for a moment as a high-brow organ of
exclusive writing, <i>Manikkodi </i>could not be ignored though. Its voice was
beginning to be heard above the din of other distracting sounds, not merely
because it was outspoken in its views, but mainly because it had a new way
expressing itself, which even the average reader could easily understand. Its
main contribution to serious reading lay in the fact that it disturbed the
mental stagnation of the reader and created ripples of creative thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
of this work was done by Va Ra who imported into his writings a style which was
direct, forceful and abiding. He could rouse indignation and disgust in dealing
with social evils. In <i>Sundari, </i>a novel which was an early work of his,
he made a crusade against the tyranny of social custom masquerading as
religious belief in a community overridden with superstition. The soil in which
Va Ra sought to sow the seeds of literary awakening was rich and the
fertilising influence of <i>Manikkodi </i>soon bore good results. Literary
lions hibernating in lairs of their own in mental discomfort scented the new
atmosphere and came out in all their majesty. The eternal flame of Bharati’s
poetry burnt steadily in the verses of Bharatidarsan who used his poems much as
Va Ra used his prose. Stalwarts in the field of the short story today, like B.
S. Ramiah, whose gift for narration is surpassed by few, the late C.
Vriddhachalam (Pudumaipithan), with his passion for realism, joined the ranks
of this <i>avant garde. </i>Pichamurthi K.P. Rajagopalan who were building
their literary nests on the banks of the Kaveri at Kumbhakonam, responded to
the invitation that was inherent in the pages of the journal. The magic
intials, Va Ra, induced many people to write for it and many more<b> </b>to
read and preserve it for friends and posterity. The telling<i> </i>style of Va
Ra, reflecting all the nuances of the language, found for him a successor in T.
J. Ranganathan, who today handles Tamil as deftly in the short story as in the
essay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had become evident within the short period of <i>Manikkodi’s </i>existence<i> </i>as
a magazine that here was the beginning of a literary revival. The diffidence of
newcomers to the practice of literary writing was soon dispelled by Va Ra’s
encouragement. He was generous to a fault in his acclamation of talent. He knew
that appreciation was the staple food on which the literary artist throve; and
he saw to it that the beginner got it in good measure. When it came from Va Ra,
whose status and authority had been so widely recognised in the literary field,
the newcomer was not only heartened but strove to better himself. Writers with
conviction and confidence were drawn to this forum until <i>Manikkodi </i>became
strong enough to stand by itself. The literary tradition of <i>Manikkodi </i>was
carried forward by a band of writers whom it had nurtured and the spearhead of
this new front was Ramiah, who made it the premier vehicle of the modern short
story. Other writers of individual merit, who had not been directly influenced
by Va Ra, were also enriching literature with their output. S. D. S Yogi was
growing beautiful blossoms with the magic wand of his poesy. K. V. Jagannathan
was attempting the herculean task of co-ordinating scholarship with creative
writing. <i>Kalaimagal, </i>under his editorship, sought to cater to a variety
of tastes maintaining, at the same time, the air of classic propriety its
founders had vested it with. <i>Kalki </i>was going strong with Krishnamurthi’s
seemingly endless and delectable tales of historical grandeur and patriotic
adventure, and kept the mass of readers under the spell of his special brand of
humour. Leaders of thought like C. Rajagopalachari embellished mere
journalistic writing with their experience and wisdom. T. K. C. was unfolding
the beauties of Kamban’s poetry, incessantly worked on the job or detecting and
removing what he felt interpolations in the immortal epic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Literary
journalism in Tamilnad had come to be recognised as a factor by this time.
Though purely literary journals found it difficult to maintain their level and
last long, the dailies began to devote a section of their letterpress to things
literary. The weekly supplement to the Tamil daily took on this task in part,
and the short story, the sketch and a critical study of some literary
masterpiece formed the pattern of this trend. The book review as such was, as
it still continues to be, a non-committal description of the binding and the
contents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Parallel
with the growth of <i>Manikkodi </i>as a short story magazine other vehicles
also ventured to sport the story as one of their<i> </i>ingredients. Most of
the writers<i> </i>who mattered were either writing in Manikkodi or sought its
pages later for their expression. The galaxy of names, which today conjures up
the image of a golden era for the Tamil short story during these days, forms
the index of modern Tamil writing by any standard. Pichamurthi, with his stress
on the fundamental human qualities which ultimately triumph in spite of
distracting deviations, endowed his stories with the quality of fables and
continues to do so even today. Rajagopalan and Pudumaipithan, whom the Gods
loved, have left a rich legacy which forms the model for many a young writer
now. Rajagopalan’s approach to his themes was that of an artist who sets out to
carve images out of ivory. The delicacy with which he chiselled them displayed
a rare devotion to the material itself. Pudumaipithan dealt with human
situations with detachment approaching cynicism. Yet his picture of characters
and situations was as human and real as we would like to find them. There were
others too like Chidambara Subramaniam, C. S. Chellappa, Ka. Naa. Subramaniam
and a score more, who are still practising their craft with individual vigour
and outlook. L. S. Ramamritham among them has evolved a technique whereby he
achieves the incredible feat of focusing reality through an approach bordering
on fantasy. A rare kind of style which seems to forestall the effect he seeks
to create marks out his writings as something unusual. The progress of the
short story in Tamil has been almost perennial and it has found votaries in
successive phases. T. Janakiraman, whose claim to the hall of fame in the
literary field began with his short stories, has contributed a sizable portion
in this respect. Among other writers today, Choodamani has developed a manner
of writing in which she is able to import the experience of agony in painful
retrospect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Tamil novel has not had the lush growth the short story was able to attain
within a space of two decades. A variety of form and a wide range of technique
marked the development of the latter. A growing readership, nurtured by the
sprouting of numerous periodicals lent an avid patronage to the short story,
and discerning writers striving for expression sought to rear a flower-garden
among weeds and shrubs. Bright and colourful, these patches border a literary
highway which should be lined with<i> </i>giant trees of vernal foliage. Not
that the vista is entirely barren; but the sparse nature of such growth has
made the novel a rarity in Tamil. The fact that the longer narrative of a
complex pattern, as evidenced in folklore and legend, should be more native to
the language only heightens the oddity. Barring a few, very few, exceptions,
the Tamil novel after the stalwarts, Rajam Iyer, Madhaviah and Vedanayakam
Pillai, has not had the unlimited fresh air and sunlight conducive to the
growth of a big tree. The greenhouse-care provided by the growing journals
helped only the short story, while the novel has had to be grown in pots in
instalments. This resulted in the freak, the serial story, which has for some
time passed for the novel. Thriving on the whetted appetite of a reading public
whose interest had to be left alive with artificial stimulants of sensational
developments in the chapters to be, this monstrosity grew with the space
available in the pages of the periodicals. As realism was a poor substitute to
the dope of a thrill-providing narrative, would-be followers of this popular
brand of writing soon took refuge in pseudo-historical fiction. The dual
advantage, this kind of disguise provided, lay in the fact that one can evade
the embarrassing necessity of conforming to a dialect which may classify, and
thereby even condemn, the story as sectarian, and that the chronological
authenticity of incidents in South Indian history is still a matter for
research and debate. The pattern of language which has, of necessity, to be
conventionally literary, endowed the narrative with universality of appeal, to
achieve which in a realistic creation of contemporary life, the author has to
be a writer of rare merit. Such attempts too there have been in recent years,
and it is evident that the fact that they had to appear in installments was due
more to the absence of an organised venture for publication of novels in book
form. The names of those who have spun longer pieces of conventional texture
are legion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few writers who have succeeded in writing novels at whole pieces, independent
of the demands of literary journalism, have achieved a measure of success which
is not very evident in the dull and glare of popular writing. The themes they
have handled are different and the mastery they have attained in narration owes
much to their skill as distinguished craftsmen in the art of the short story.
While a sense of idealism informs their treatment, a hesitancy to grapple with
problems of real import is apparent in their composition. To say this is not to
detract from the quality of their creation though. Even the boldest Tamil
writer is weighed down with inhibitions peculiar to the environment he finds
himself in. Attempts at rebellion are imperceptibly modified by a sense of
misplaced sincerity in dealing with the foibles of human character. Where a
breakthrough is really possible, the immaturity of outlook and an ambition to
imitate western masters result in literary bravado and verbal exhibitionism.
Confusing vulgarity with realism and sex with feminine anatomy, some of the
writers who stimulate revolt have to an extent messed up the content of the
short story and the novel in recent years. Fortunately, their number is low and
they are sure to be ignored by a discerning public which can reach out to
creations of real purpose across the hurdles of the publishing business. An
overdose of merely titillating entertainment, one may hope, is bound to result
in a reaction which will ultimately be favourable to the growth of purposeful
writing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
a consummation seems to be nearer than one could imagine, for there are
isolated attempts, even among those with identity of purpose though with
differing approaches, to record for posterity something abiding by way of
creative writing. Among novelists of such stature, Ka. Naa. Subramaniam,
Chidambara Subramaniam, Shankar Ram, B. S. Ramiah and T. Janakiraman have been
responsible for a kind of output rich in quality as <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
novels of Ka. Naa. Subramaniam constitute a deliberate venture into the varied
pattern of western technique of narration herein he seems to achieve a certain
amount of success in keeping the identity of the themes he sets out to handle.
A conscious attempt to import thought-provoking passages intervene into some
his writings. His <i>Poithevu, </i>which has pot been surpassed by any of his
later writings, is an instance of this planned adventure. An imagery shorn of
literary embellishments lends adequacy to style without leaving any permanent
impression on the mind. Almost in contrast, Chidambara Subramaniam shows a
remarkable capacity for enriching his language with a harmony that fits into
theme of his story. The style of writing he employs in his novel <i>Idhayanadham
</i>is as musical as the theme he has chosen. That the novel is more a
dissertation on the ideals of a devout Hindu brought up under the best of
traditions leaves something to be desired in the matter of artistic expression,
to achieve which a writer must needs use the scalpel of the intellect more than
the incense of emotion, which is likely to shroud the angularities natural to a
human being. It is purposeful and sincere writing which may serve as an index
of our cultural heritage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
casual approach of T. Janakiraman to the compulsion of circumstances
fortunately stops short of studied cynicism. Both in style and content, he
follows a path of easy elegance which makes his writings eminently readable and
enduring at the same time. His delineation of characters is less conscious and
more in tune with the growth of the incidents he pictures. A close knowledge of
atmosphere, almost as inherent as in B. S. Ramiah’s, lends an air of delightful
verisimilitude to the imagery of Janakiraman. His <i>magnum opus, Mohamul, </i>which
deals with the problem of an idealist trying to escape facts in a world of his
own creation, did not concede anything to the demands of periodical journalism
which had to be its vehicle. He might perhaps have been more outspoken about
some of the incidents in the story if he were not writing for a public which
was overwhelmingly burdened down with tradition. The curbs resulting from such
a situation do not seem to have influenced his expression to any appreciable
extent. One might wish that other writers of immature equipment but unlimited
enthusiasm are given the benefit of such journalistic taboos. But the dichotomy
in Tamil journalism is so complete that writing without any inhibition is
possible of achievement. There is enough variety of media, through which
writers can express themselves. In the pursuit of trends which would point to
processes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>of enduring value, one may
not be very much disturbed by such distractions; but one has to take note of
the fact that impacts from sources of doubtful authenticity lie at the root of
such phenomena. If the writer of quality in Tamil persists in focussing his
approach to life when contributing to the pages of periodical which have
notoriously become family journals, he would have to toe the line in the matter
of observing taboos to the extent of truncated expression. Nor can we envisage
a situation where the editor of the journal would be ingenious enough to save
the situation as in the instance of the <i>Saturday Evening Post. </i>The
legend is, one particular installment of a serial ended with the secretary of
an executive having supper with her boss in his residence. When the next
installment opened with a scene which found them both at breakfast, the
following morning, angry letters were received finding fault with the journal
for the implied impropriety of letting the secretary stay overnight. The
journal, being too conscious of its circulation to bother about the course of
the story as the author conceived it, found a way out by this explanation: The
editors of the <i>Post, </i>the journal declared, were not responsible for the
activities of the characters between installments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ramaiah’s
achievement was marked with such a remarkable power of narration that one is
usually carried away by the fascination inherent in the easy flow of his style.
Alike in his short stories, as in his novels, Ramiah reveals deep insight into
the nature of his characters that easily competes with his powerful story
telling. He shares with Janakiraman the love for the soil with which they are
familiar and is able to create pictures of authentic realism. Akhilan deals
with human ideals whose impact on emotions results in situations of intense
drama. His experiments with problems of sociological significance point to a
generally noticeable trend in the writer trying to rebel against environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

richness of literature in the form of the novel or the longer narrative is due,
in a large measure, in recent years, to viable contributions by women writers.
Among the score of such writers Gowri Ammal seems to have achieved notable
success in her story <i>Kadivalam </i>which portrays the helplessness of a
family whose guiding hand in the person of the mother is no longer available a
result of death. Every action and interaction of the members points to the
hypothetical possibility of what would have happened if the mother were alive.
A complicated pattern of events is narrated with ease and clarity. Krithika,
whose novel <i>Puhai</i> <i>Naduvil </i>went almost unnoticed some years back,
indulges in technique of literary psychotherapy whereby she lays bare the
deep-rooted causes for the actions of her characters, who have developed
attitudes based on childhood complexes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in other fields soon saw the immense possibilities of poetry as a vehicle of
emotional recollection. Their experience in other modes of writing gave them
the courage to experiment with the accepted rules of prosody. Rajagopalan, to a
little extent, and Pichamurthi, in a very large measure, took to this medium
obviously because they found the short story inadequate for their expression.
Pichamurthi’s infatuation for free verse, however, was not the result of any
allergy to prosody itself, though he once described metre in poetry as a fetter
to expression: Some of his pieces in this respect are the outpourings of a
observant mind which looks at life and discovers patterns not visible to the
ordinary writer. Poetry, both rigid and free, has now come to stay and grow in
contemporary Tamil letters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

such a wide range of output, it would be pertinent to enquire about the nature
of literary criticism in Tamil. This is generally of two kinds. One is just
criticism, the other only literary. The approach in the case of the former is
to compare achievement with age-old standards and more often discard it as </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not
conforming to grammar, prosody etc. The other kind is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>intoxicated
with its own knowledge of the literary scene. Between the two, the writer is
usually at a loss to know anything about his own work as others see it. Quite often,
the talented writer, disgusted with the treatment meted out to his own work,
tends to ignore any opinion as such. Importing foreign standards for the
assessment of work which should be judged by norms native to the language,
often confuses the issue, and the critic, however well-informed he may be about
other languages, often goes off at a tangent. There is thus little chance of
the work being assessed on its merits. It is usually argued that since most of
the forms of writing were borrowed from English, western standards must needs
be applied in any attempt at assessment. The fallacy will be evident, when it
is realised that attempts at creative writing cease </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
be so when they are accepted as borrowed. When they are so branded, the
accusation ceases to be criticism and turns out to be literary slander. In this
process, the genius of the language and the nuances inherent in the style
naturally escape notice and the writer is put in the dock for sins of omission.
The tendency which has now developed in criticism of Tamil writing is thus
preoccupied in building an ivory tower. The ridicule of the insincere critic is
worse than the intolerance of the highbrow and the tyranny of the cynic. The
writer is to be pardoned, therefore, if in despair he likens the severity of
outlook on the part of such a critic to the antics of a crank. Tamil writing,
especially, is facing this change currently and the danger lies in the fact
that writers of real worth, who have taken to literary criticism are indulging
in this pastime. It is to be hoped that the attitudes resulting from such a
tendency will serve, in the long run, to promote healthy and constructive
criticism directed to the assessment of achievement rather than in showing off
knowledge of standards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

would be surprising if one were to point out that the worst obstacle for the
Tamil writer is the language itself. For some of the writers of quality in
Tamil, it is not even their mother-tongue. They have to take note of the
countless dialectal shades. To achieve a uniformity of appeal wou1d be a task
which would sidetrack the purpose of writing itself. The writer in Tamil is
constantly aware of the possibility of his being charged with using foreign
expressions–which, in his case, would largely be of Sanskrit origin. He has
also to take note of the movement around him to eschew words, say of Sanskrit
derivation. This affects his outlook and attempt in the matter of creating a
style of his own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
movement is inspired both by the scholar and the writer. The reasons are,
however, quite different. The scholar in Tamil believes he has rediscovered the
genius of the language which was until recently influenced by the Sanskrit
style. He sees greater potentialities for exposition and makes attempts to
retain the basic character of the language by consciously avoiding Sanskrit
vocabulary. He takes pains to discover viable equivalents for terms which Tamil
has been borrowing from Sanskrit. He is motivated by an attitude of purism
which prompts him to streamline the language to its original pattern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

creative writer in Tamil, who is concerned with the clarity of expression, also
discards the Sanskrit style, but does not deliberately avoid Sanskrit
vocabulary as such. He is preoccupied with the communication of his experience
to his readers and employs the most readily available modes of expression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

tendency towards discarding the Sanskrit style is thus active not only on the
surface, but goes much deeper and affects the fundamental structure of the
language whose design has been a composite one until now. The attempt to
eliminate forms of expression which do not conduce to clarity thus takes on a
new turn. This sometimes results in creating a style which does not appear to
be any more concise than the one discarded. Naturally there is a conflict
between the two, the scholar and the creative writer, though their attempts
seem to be directed towards a common goals namely the purity of the language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

present Government of South Africa under Prime Minister Dr. D. F. Malan and his
Nationalist Party is facing a highly complex problem on several fronts; it has
created many conflicts by its policies. It provoked a most bitter controversy
with the opposition Party, the Unionist Party, leading to threats of violence;
it has provoked an equally bitter controversy with all the non-White Parties,
leading to a movement of non-violent resistance to its policies and laws; it
has provoked a controversy with the United Nations by ignoring its
recommendations, leading to a situation which may well break up the United
Nations; and finally, it has provoked a somewhat unexpected and unprecedented
controversy with the judiciary in South Africa, leading to a most intriguing
constitutional deadlock. The conflict between the two White Parties, the
Nationalist and the Unionist, is largely political, that between the Whites and
the non-Whites is largely racial, that with the United Nations is
jurisdictional, and that between the legislature and the judiciary
constitutional. The conflicts criss-cross as it were, to some extent. The
Government and the opposition are more or less at one in their conflict with
the non-Whites; the non-Whites and the Opposition are more<i> </i>or less on
common ground with regard to the political and constitutional issues against
the Government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the most unusual and unexpected conflict, since resolved, was the
constitutional one, which centred on the status of Sec. 152 of the South Africa
Act of 1909 concerning the amendment of the Act since the passing of the
Statute of Westminster in 1931. The relevant portion of the Section runs as

Part (II), but Sec. 152, already quoted, prescribed it for both the Parts of
Sec. 35. Part I of the Section was amended by Act No. 12 of 1936, the
Representation of Natives Act, to disqualify the Native for the common roll
reason of his race and colour, by the adoption of the special procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is significant that the <i>special </i>procedure was adopted by the Nationalist
Party under Prime Minister Gen. J. B. M. Hertzog in 1936 <i>after </i>the
enactment of the Statute of Westminster. The present Malan Government of the
same Party secured the passage of Act. 46 of 1951, namely, the Separate
Representation of Voters Act, by the <i>ordinary </i>procedure, namely, by
simple majorities in each of the two Houses of Parliament sitting separately.
The purpose of the Act was to substitute two separate electoral rolls for the
Whites and for the Coloureds; or people of mixed race, in the Cape Province in
the place of the common roll.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question was raised whether the Separate Representation of Voters Act of 1951
amended Sec. 35 of the South Africa Act of 1909, and if so, whether the special
procedure prescribed by Sec. 152 was necessary in view of the Statute of
Westminster of 1931. The Government’s case was that the Statute of Westminster,
coupled with the Status of the Union Act, Act 69 of 1934, in effect abrogated
the special procedure of Sec. 152 of the South Africa Act and that the
substitution of two electoral rolls for the Whites and the Coloureds in the
Cape Province in the place of the common roll did not infringe Sec. 35 of the
South Africa Act. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, the highest
court in South Africa, in a unanimous judgment dated the 20th March, 1952, held
that the Separate Representation of Voters Act amended Sec. 35 of the South
Africa Act, and, as it was enacted without adopting the special procedure, it
was <i>null </i>and <i>void.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
created a political crisis for the Government, which sought to get over it by
creating a constitutional crisis! It enacted by the ordinary procedure the High
Court of Parliament Act in June 1952, constituting Parliament as the highest
court of law to review the judgments of the Supreme Court. The High Court of
Parliament decided on the 27th August 1952 that the Separate Representation Act
was valid and lawful. About the same time, in fact on the 29th August, the Cape
Division of the Supreme Court declared High Court of Parliament Act <i>null </i>and
<i>void </i>on the ground that in enacting it Parliament had altered Sec. 152
of the South Africa Act without the special procedure prescribed therein. The
Act said the Cape Court, deprived individuals of the right to invoke the Courts
whenever they thought that their rights had been infringed, for the decision of
the High Court of Parliament would be final and binding on both Courts and
individuals, and aggrieved individuals would have no redress in any Court and no
access to High Court of Parliament. Whereupon the Government of South Africa
preferred an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, which
dismissed it on 13th Nov. 1952.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
has been said and more will perhaps be said by constitutional experts on both
sides. Without attempting an exhaustive review, however inviting, it may be
observed that by appearing and pleading before the Cape Division of the Supreme
Court on the validity of the Separate Representation of Voters Act <i>after </i>the
High Court of Parliament had validated it, the Government had already given up
their stand that the High Court of Parliament was the final and supreme court,
and in appealing against the judgment, it only confirmed its surrender. If, as
the Government contended, the High Court of Parliament were the final court of
appeal and was duly constituted, it was not open to the Cape Division of the
Supreme Court to entertain the case questioning it, much less to declare it
invalid. In presuming to sit in judgment over a superior court, the High Court
of Parliament, the Cape Court, the inferior court, would be guilty of “contempt
of court”, and the judges would render themselves liable to impeachment at the
bar of the High Court of Parliament!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a separate but concurring judgment; Justice Newton-Thompson of the Appellate
Division of the Cape Supreme Court said that the founders of the South African
Constitution had followed the American example in “entrenching” Sections 35 and
I52 of the South Africa Act. He wished that they had not done so, but had
rather followed the British precedent where the Mother of Parliaments, as
ordinarily constituted, could do as it liked. He added that until Sec. 152 was
amended in accordance with the special procedure laid down in that very section,
he had to declare the High Court of Parliament Act as invalid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
cannot be said that the Malan Government had no strong case. It had taken the
view that the Statute of Westminster had given the South African Parliament the
same and equal status with the British Parliament and that, like the latter, it
could amend the South Africa Act by the ordinary process even as the British
Parliament could amend any of its Acts, including the South Africa Act, which
is an Act of the British Parliament; and that, therefore, the limitations in
Sec. 152 of the South Africa Act had dropped out with the passing of the
Statute of Westminster.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
view was shared by several competent constitutional authorities, as stated in
the <i>Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law </i>(Vol. 33,
p. 90). Not the least competent among them was the late Rt. Hon. J. C. Smuts.
He shared the view that Section 2 of the Statute of Westminster would destroy
the special procedure provided in Sec. 152 of the South Africa Act, and had desired
that some limitation against such destruction should be provided in the Statute
itself. In fact, when the South African Parliament debated the resolution in
1931 to request the British </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Parliament to pass the Statute of
Westminster, General Smuts, as leader of the opposition, suggested that the
“entrenched clauses” </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>should continue to be entrenched
statutorily. But the Government of Gen. J. B. M. Hertzog was unwilling to
accept the suggestion on the ground that it would take away from the
independence of South Africa and her equality with Great Britain. Gen. Smuts,
thereupon, moved an amendment that the resolution be passed “on the
understanding that the proposed legislation will in no way derogate from the
entrenched provisions of the South Africa Act.” And this was agreed to<i>. </i>But
it was a moral understanding and had no legal force.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Malan Government received legal sanction for its view in the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Nolwana v. Hofmeyr (1937 A. D. 229) which held that the
Representation of Natives Act (Act 12 of 1936) was valid on the ground that, in
view of the Statute of Westminster and the Status of the Union Act (Act 69 of
1934) defining the status of the Union as a “sovereign independent state”, it
was not competent for the South African Courts to question the legality and
validity of any Act of the South African Parliament. It said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the Parliamentary Debates and in the law courts the question of the
sovereignty of South Africa and its Parliament was raised and evoked a great
deal of both forensic and emotional expression. And India was quoted in this
connection. The Malan Government held that adherence to Sec. 152 of the
Constitution derogated from the sovereignty of South Africa, because the South
Africa Act was an Act of the British Parliament. The Supreme Court disagreed
and suggested that the United States of America was not less sovereign, simply
because its own Constitution limited the powers of the American Congress. It
must, however, be remembered that the American Constitution, unlike the South
African Constitution, was not an Act of the British Parliament, even <i>pro
forma. </i>South Africa has today as much of <i>political freedom </i>as
America and England, but not the same <i>Constitutional sovereignty, </i>notwithstanding
the Statute of Westminster and the Status of the Union Act. The latter was
enacted by the South African Parliament, which was itself created under the
South Africa Act, which is an Act of the British Parliament and which it can
repeal. The Statute of Westminster is also an Act of the British Parliament, by
which Britain, by a self-denying ordinance, chose to refrain from exercising
her constitutional sovereignty and conceded fullest political freedom to the
Dominions. The relation between constitutional sovereignty and political
freedom since the passing of the Statute of Westminster was thus expounded by
Lord Chancellor Sankey:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

great literary works are immortal, in the sense, that they are of eternal
interest and applicability. Human nature is always fascinating and,
surprisingly enough, it has remained almost un-changed. The desires that prod,
the passions that move and the emotions that rouse man, have remained the same
from times immemorial. Great classics, being studies of human nature at
different times, from different angles and under different stresses and
circumstances, always hold our interest. Time never withers them and custom
does not stale their infinite variety. Every generation that studied them, saw
itself and its problems in them. In the same way, the more we, the moderns,
read them, the more interesting we find them and the greater seems to be their
applicability to modern times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
rereading Shakespeare’s Macbeth sometime ago I was surprised at the striking
similarity in many aspects, between Macbeth and the more recent manifestations
of totalitarianism. In his rise and fall there is an uncanny resemblance
between him and modern dictators like Hitler, though there are some differences
in character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
a casual reader of the drama cannot but feel the tremendous psychological
impact the prophecies of the witches make on Macbeth and his wife. By making
him feel that his becoming the king is inevitable, something that is fated or
pre-destined, the witches thoroughly weaken his power to resist temptation to
murder Duncan and usurp the throne. Not being the king’s son, he can come to
power only by murder, by treason. He himself clearly recognises that to covet
the throne is to be ready to commit treason. The witches predictions make his
wife’s resolution to make him king by hook or crook doubly strong and she
scolds and nags him into killing Duncan. Thus, the feeling that he is fated to
be the king of Scotland makes him mentally prepared to commit all the crimes
necessary for being so. That is why he yields so early to his wife’s
persuasion. Strangely enough, this belief in the inevitability of their success
is the most important part of the psychological make up of modern
totalitarians. The Nazis believed in the inevitable victory of the Herrenvolk,
the German Master Race, over the rest of humanity and hoped to establish the
Thousand Years Reich. To communists also, their success is something that is
inevitable, an inescapable process of history opposed only by the ignorant or
the selfish. The fanatic devotion to party and the iron discipline of the
totalitarians, which make them extremely efficient and successful, at least in
the short run, are the direct results of their belief in the inevitability of
their success. The actual crime in Macbeth, the murder of an unsuspecting old
man by<i> </i>the very man he trusts and admires most, has all the horrible
unscrupulousness of a modern political assassination like, for example, that of
Trotsky by the Soviet agent who won his affection and trust. But to me, the
most modern aspect of the crime is the intense anxiety on the part of the
criminal to escape the odium or his action. With anxious sensitiveness to
public opinion a quality he shares with modern dictators, Macbeth tries to
shift the guilt of his crime to the unfortunate chamberlains and through them
to the sons of Duncan themselves. But success in that is as little as that or
Hitler’s attempt to convince people that his opponents were responsible for the
Reichstag fire. Later on he is very particular that Banques should be murdered
at a distance from his palace, so that people might think that he was killed by
some robbers and do not associate him with the crime. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

change that comes in the character of Macbeth is the perfect illustration of
the saying that “All power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt
absolutely.” His own treachery makes him suspect the only person who shares his
secret and the only person, who, barring Lady Macbeth, can rightly be called
his accomplice, an accomplice after the event, an indirect, passive accomplice
who is ready to pocket his loyalty, sense of justice and pride and serve him.
Macbeth suspects him of the desire to supplant or succeed him. To a tyrant
suspicion is guilt and so he gets Banquo assassinated. Not only Macbeth, but Hitler,
and Stalin also felt that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

success of every totalitarian revolution or coup of modern times has invariably
been followed by struggle among the revolutionaries either for power or for the
retention of power. The struggle between Stalin and Trotsky belongs to the
first category while the various bloody purges of<i> </i>Hitler and Stalin
belong to the second. Macbeth who has to be almost forced by Lady Macbeth to
kill Duncan kills the chamberlains without any prodding from her. Afterwards he
himself plots and gets executed the murder of Banquo, deliberately keeping her
in complete ignorance of the whole affair. After Banquo’s death, he grows so
blood-thirsty that he massacres even innocent women and children like Lady
Macduff and her children, much to the horror of Lady Macbeth. Thus at first he
is an unwilling murderer, then a murderer on the Spur of the moment, then a
crafty, deep-plotting murderer and finally a raging homicidal maniac. We find
similar development in the lives of modern dictators also. As they grow older
and older they suffer from more and more severe forms of homicidal mania. Their
purges grow wider and wider in scope and they order massacres for trivial
reasons. The millions of Jews burnt to death simply because they were Jews and
the thousands of Germans shot dead under Hitler’s orders simply because they
were not enthusiastic enough in their war effort were victims of such mania.
Stalin too, in his time, was guilty of mass-massacres like the massacre of the
Volga Germans. Only his death stopped him from conducting a gigantic purge
which he started with accusation against the Kremlin doctors in particular and
against the Jews in general. Malcolm says of Macbeth <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The general atmosphere of terror and consequent demoralisation
and dehumanisation of the people we inevitably find under despotism cannot be
described better. The people are so utterly defenceless and terror-stricken
that shaking with fear, they cow down before the soldiers of the usurper. They
are so afraid of the despot that like frightened hares, all they want is to lie
low, to be as inconspicuous as possible. They are afraid to know themselves.
Their country is not their mother, but their grave. The line “where nothing,
but who knows nothing, is once seen to smile” is particularly significant. It
means that under Macbeth only those who are poor, mean, uneducated and
ignorant, that is, the lowest strata of society, the poor peasants and the
manual workers only, are ever seen to be happy. It also means that the upper
classes are so ruthlessly oppressed by Macbeth that they are always woe-begone.
It is the upper and the upper middle classes of a country that provide it with
political and social leadership. That is why they are always the first victims
of the tyrant, native or foreign. Reducing them to abject submission is the
first thing he does to prevent the possibility of powerful opponents rising
against him. Stalin’s treatment of the professional classes in Baltic countries
and the East European countries after their conquest, China’s treatment of the
Tibetan lamas and Hitler’s treatment or the intelligentsia of the Occupied
Europe are eloquent testimonies to the modernity of Macbeth’s tyranny. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The most sickening thing about despotism is the
dehumanisation of people under it. Man is a social animal, and sharing the joys
and sorrows of his neighbour is his most natural quality. But, according to
Ross, in Scotland under Macbeth, “sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the
air made, not marked.” That Macbeth also, like the modern despots, had a number
of sadistic followers who, like Eichman, were only too willing and enthusiastic
to torture and murder people under his orders, is clear from the words of
Malcolm at the end of the battle. He says that “producing forth”, that is
dragging out of hiding, the cruel officers of Macbeth is one of his immediate
tasks. When the henchmen of Macbeth come unexpectedly and torture men suspected
to be the opponents of the tyrant, their shrieks and the cries of their families
are heard by their neighbours. But nobody dares to come to them lest the wrath
of the Despot should fall on him also. Let us study for example, the behaviour
of Ross in Scene II, Act IV. The Thane of Ross, a nobleman brought up in
traditions of chivalry and honour, knows fully well that the wife and children
of Macduff are marked persons. He has heard rumours about their impending
destruction under Macbeth’s orders. He is a relation of Lady Macduff and a
friend of Macduff. Yet he merely utters a few words of empty consolation to
Lady Macduff and her children and goes away leaving them to their fate, in
order to save his own skin. He never offers protection to them. People develop
a kind of inhuman detachment from the sufferings of their friends and neighbours
in their anxiety to save themselves. Death becomes so common that it cannot
rouse anybody’s curiosity. People hear the knell, but are too terrified and
apathetic to question for whom it tolls. In the words of Ross, they are
terrified by wild rumours and “float upon a wild and violent sea, each way and
move.” Not knowing when their turn is going to come, they float in an ocean of
vague fear and chilling doubt and are agitated by waves of terror. Being denied
the truth, and not knowing facts, they give undue credence to wild rumours. The
prophetic vision of Shakespeare! How startlingly similar are Macbeth’s
Scotland, Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia! When we read the words of Ross,
are not we reminded of people’s apathy in modern totalitarian states, their
pathetic belief in rumours and their refusal on account of their terror to
react in the face of sudden arrests and torture in secret chambers, of their
friends and relations? In these countries also men die suddenly and
unexpectedly as described by Ross. In them also “good men’s lives expire before
the flowers in their caps.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Shakespeare
makes Macbeth maintain an efficient spy organisation. Macbeth boasts to his
wife that in the houses of all the lords of Scotland he has spies. He says,
“There is not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d.” Thus,
Shakespeare had anticipated even the Gestapo and the N. K. V. D. of the modern
dictators. Like them Macbeth puts spies on his subordinates. He sends a
specially trustworthy spy to see that the murderers carry out the assassination
of Banquo as instructed. The means adopted by Macbeth to silence his opponents
in exile are startlingly modern. First of all he discredits them, as when he
accuses Malcolm and Donalbain of killing their own father. Finding that not
much useful, he tries to decoy them into coming to Scotland and falling into
his hands. Malcolm tells Macduff that “Devilish Macbeth” has sought to win him
into his power by sending a number of his own agents disguised as Malcolm’s
supporters. This practice is quite common in modern times when every batch of
refugees from any dictatorship is bound to contain some false refugees sent out
by the country’s government to spy on the real ones. It is said that a number
of Chinese epics entered India pretending to be Tibetan refugees. Thus the more
we study Macbeth, the more we are struck with wonder at Shakespeare’s
imaginative genius in prognosticating the character and practices of the modern
dictators in the Tyrant of Scotland. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
peculiar trait Hitler shared with Macbeth. It is belief in supernatural
revelation. Belief in his destiny, as declared by the witches, sets Macbeth on
his career of crime, by making him kill Duncan. Their predictions concerning
Banquo aDd Macduff make him murder Banquo and massacre Macduff’s family. Belief
in their predictions assuring him invincibility and invulnerability, makes him
feel secure enough to let loose his tyranny on the people of Scotland. That
alienates his subordinates and the thanes and leads to his downfall. In the
same way, it is his belief in his special destiny that gave Hitler his
megalomaniacal self-confidence. He considered himself to be the greatest
architect, statesman and military strategist the world ever saw. That
self-confidence led him to his amazing victories as well as his astonishing
blunders. His belief in astrology and necromancy are too well-known to require
any detailed description. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

last days of Hitler and Macbeth are surprisingly similar. What a lot of
similarity is there in situation, temper, thoughts and fears between the
Scottish usurper in the Castle at Dunsinane and the German Fuehrer in his
underground bunker in Berlin! Both are at the end of their tether. Both see the
ruin of their unbridled power and both fear the approaching end. Macbeth spits
contempt at his servants and flares up in anger at their timidity. At a white-
faced servant who brings news of the approaching enemy, he exclaims, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Hitler also fought to the very end of his resources. To
the very last he was expecting some miracle to happen and extricate him from
his unenviable position. He went on issuing orders to already destroyed
divisions to hold fast and defend Berlin. He also, like Macbeth, ordered his
subordinates to “hang those that talk of rear.” Under his orders hundreds of
Germans were shot dead after summary trials by Nazi fanatics during the last
few days of the Second World War on charges of defeatism and lack of will to resist
the enemy. During the last days of his life, as disgraceful defeat stared at
him, Hitler too, for all his bluff and bluster, at least in some moments of
sanity must have thought like Macbeth that </p>

threatens to put him in a cage and exhibit him to the public as unnatural
animals are exhibited. At once Macbeth decides that death is preferable to such
shameful public exhibition and challenges Macduff to fight on and dies while
fighting. In his book “The Last days of Hitler,” Professor Trevor Roper tells
us that the greatest fear of Hitler in those days was that he would fall alive
into the hands of the Russians. He used to say often and often that they would
put him in a cage and exhibit him as a monster. To avoid such shameful public
exposure to the scorn and contempt of his enemies, he committed suicide. He
ordered his personal servants that they should, after his death, drench his
body in petrol and burn it. The Russians when they entered Berlin, found only
the charred remnants of his body. Thus, when we read certain passages in
Shakespeare’s Macbeth, especially those which describe Macbeth’s tyranny, they
appear so modern that we have to remind ourselves constantly that we are
reading a sixteenth century dramatist’s account of an eleventh century Scottish
tyrant. The inspiration to Macbeth’s coup, the manner of<i> </i>his getting rid
of his rivals, his despotic rule, spy system, his final pessimism and the
motive for his ultimate death are so strikingly similar to what we find in the
lives of modern dictators that we are aghast at the uncanny resemblance and
wonder whether it can be merely accidental. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, the resemblance is not accidental. A great dramatist’s imagination is
bound to be, not only vivid, but logical and based on reality also. The career
and character of Macbeth are the natural and logical, almost inevitable,
evolution of his qualities, acting and reacting on the political conditions of
his time. A man of intense ambition, efficiency and popularity, if he has the
necessary confidence in himself, and is indifferent to the other worldly
consequences of his actions, when the political conditions are favourable, that
is when the governmental authority is weak, is bound to make an attempt to
seize power, especially when he believes himself to be the man of destiny fated
to rule the country. The attempt, which is unconstitutional in the case of
Macbeth by necessity, for he lived in a monarchy, is so by choice in the case
of the modern dictators. The attempt, if successful, will cause a peculiar
psychological change in the ruler. Having come to power by force and guile he
feels that the first thing he should do is to prevent others from doing the
same and supplanting him. He tries to make his position secure by removing, by
killing or exiling all those that are capable of offering alternative
leadership. There are bound to be among them, not only his political opponents,
but his erstwhile friends possessing varying degrees of popularity. Killing or
exiling them produces unpopularity which the ruler tries to control by the use
of brute force and an efficient system of spying. That again makes him more
unpopular. The process goes on until be loses his previous popularity
completely and remains in authority only on account of his grip over the army
and the internal security forces. Then, if he is defeated in a war, the
collapse of his power will be total and sudden. Such a person who has once
enjoyed great power and prestige once, is more likely to commit suicide rather
than fall alive into the hands of his enemies, risking exposure to shame and
humiliation. Thus, almost all the incidents in the drama are the logical
development of Macbeth’s character and situation. When Shakespeare chose the
story of an ambitious Scottish general who murdered his king under certain
political conditions, the character and career of Macbeth, proceeded inexorably
from it. Now, the modern dictators like Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin possessed
the qualities possessed by Macbeth–ambition, sense of destiny or historical
mission, utter contempt for religious or ethical considerations, efficiency,
ruthlessness and popularity. The political conditions of modern society like
those in the days of Macbeth permitted the free play of their qualities and
talents. So their characters and careers developed closely resembling the
characters and career of Macbeth. The great similarity between Macbeth and the
modern dictators is an eloquent proof that Shakespeare thoroughly understood
the basic human instincts and qualities and the laws of human nature which
never change. They have their own logic and continue their inexorable operation
at all times. It is this deep knowledge of humanity that makes Shakespeare’s
characters, in spite of their striking individuality, eternal types, as easy to
be round in the twentieth century as in his own days. While writing for his
age, he wrote for all ages and every age can see itself in his works. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<st1:City w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City> eagerly looks forward to the prospect
of unfreezing its relations with <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>, as
yet there has been no firm indication of a thaw. So far the only change in <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>’s attitude is restricted to civility in diplomatic
<span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>, which in itself is a definite improvement
over the crudity and rudeness of Chinese past actions. Two other indications
are also there. There has been a spurt in Chinese diplomatic activity
disclosing a flexibility of approach in relation to many countries, especially
towards the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region>, creating
the hope that Peking may decide to make up with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> too. These hopes are whetted
to a great extent by the meeting between the Indian President, Mr. V. V. <span
class=SpellE>Giri</span> and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kuo</span> Mo-Jo,
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of
China, at <span class=SpellE>Khatmandu</span>. This meeting of two top leaders
from <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is the
first of its kind since 1965, though it was nothing more than a chance meeting
at the wedding of the Nepalese Crown Prince. This meeting caused quite a
flutter in the foreign chancelleries in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>. But this aspect of the matter can be written
off for the simple reason that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kuo</span> Mo-<span
class=SpellE>jo’s</span> exchange of pleasantries with the Indian President was
more than compensated by his visit to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> immediately after the <span
class=SpellE>Khatmandu</span> visit. In <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
he was busy promising support for the ‘liberation’ of Kashmir (which not even
the Muslim Shah of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iran</st1:country-region> did)
and was profusely thanked by <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span> for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s support
in the 65 war. So much for the <span class=SpellE>Giri-Kuo</span> Mo-<span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>jo</span></span> meeting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are, of course, many reasons why the Chinese should want to see a thaw in
relations with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
First, with the acquisition of their own deterrent and within sight of
manufacturing long range delivery vehicles the Chinese are loath to remain as a
power in the intermediate power range. In addition to acquiring these trappings
of great power status, she is managing to converse directly and independently
with both the superpowers. Yet she failed to make much headway in Asia and <st1:place
w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> and her cultural revolution of 1966-68 further cut
her off from Afro-Asian contracts. Thus the Chinese may be anxious to make a
gesture to the ‘<st1:place w:st="on">Third World</st1:place>’. And cultivating
better relations with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
might make such a gesture more credible. More important is the factor relating
to the Sino-Soviet relations. <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> is
obviously looking forward to the prospect of cutting into Indo-Soviet
relations. The last three months witnessed Chinese fears of a Russian preemptive
strike increasing. Failure of the Sino-Soviet Talks begun in last autumn only
partly underlines this development. Western analysts are convinced that the
Chinese did regard a Russian nuclear strike as clear and immediate. The <st1:City
w:st="on">London</st1:City> ‘Times’ ran a series of five articles in March on
this problem and the contributors are unanimous about the way <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
perceives the Russian threat. For example, Neville Maxwell wrote: “To say that <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> is preparing for war is true, but not
precise: <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>
is preparing to resist a Russian attack. The Soviet Union denies any such
intention, but Russian troop movements and Russian threats gave reality to
Chinese fears, and are reflected in intensified <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
preparations throughout <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>.”
(Neville Maxwell in “The Times,” <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>)
Again, the Institute for Strategic Studies, London, in its to “Strategic Survey
1969” said that there was a “spectacular and unequivocal” increase last year in
Soviet military activity along the 4150 mile Chinese border, where 62 Soviet
divisions (658,000 men) are now deployed. The Chinese, the report says, enjoy a
manpower advantage over the Russian (814,000 to 658,000) but in every category
of weapons the Russian advantage is overwhelming. Evidence from within the <st1:place
w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> also conforms to the state of the Soviet
mind. It is by now well known that Brezhnev had last year made a devastating
report to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party on the desperate
state of the economy. Acute observers like K. S. Karol of the “New Statesman”
infer from this report that the reduction in Russian civil investment during
1969 was mainly due to diversion of investment to <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
expenditure. Further, the recent visit of Brezhnev to <span class=SpellE>Dvina</span>
in <span class=SpellE>Byelo</span> <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>,
where top Russian <span class=SpellE>Marshalls</span> are engaged in military
exercises is being interpreted as intended to “convey a message of caution from
the bureaucracy he represents to those soldiers on whom he relies to settle the
great <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> question as they
settled <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.”
Of course, in the event, 1969 passed without a war, and this was mainly due to
the various pressures prevailing both on Peking and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> to restrain themselves and rethink.
Yet the fact that Sino-Soviet relations reached the nadir of hostility and
brought the two within sight of a nuclear holocaust should be <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Viewed
in this context it is easy to see that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> may <span class=GramE>be
fearing</span> a joint Indo-Soviet military action against herself, much the
same way we were fearing a simultaneous Sino-Pakistani attack. Now, this in
itself is enough to warrant Peking’s overtures to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City></st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Incidentally,
it is interesting to note that the very same prospect of a Sino-Soviet war,
which might make <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
soften towards <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, seems
to have made the Soviet Union less warm towards <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This is because of the need
to wean <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span> away from <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>’s
side. Thus, to isolate <st1:City w:st="on">Peking</st1:City>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> may be more than anxious to appease <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> and in the process moderate its
enthusiasm for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
susceptibilities. In fact, sometime back <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
did write to <st1:City w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City> hinting at <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>’s intention to establish closer contacts with <span
class=SpellE>Pindi</span> and telling <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> not to misunderstand. In other words, the
so-called “special relations” between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
have ended. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While
Moscow thus gives notice to India to settle with Pakistan because of her
(Moscow’s) desire to cultivate <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span>, Washington
seems to be eager that India and China end their dispute, because of its
anxiety to work for a ‘<span class=SpellE>rapproachement</span>’ with Peking.
This could be inferred from recent <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
attitudes. Vice-President Agnew’s utterances during his <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> visit last March afford
interesting insights. He conceded that <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
had a special interest in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region>;
he asked <st1:country-region w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region> to mediate
between <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>; and, to top it all, he seems to have
suggested that <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> should
come to terms or negotiate across the table with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But the question will be
asked whether these represent the <span class=SpellE>Administratio’s</span> views.
For, President Nixon only recently announced that his administration would work
for closer cooperation between <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This is being interpreted to mean that the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region>
would encourage the emergence of a confederation between <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
as a bulwark against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
If this be true then the inference of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
telling <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> to make it up
with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
seems to De all wrong. Yet there is no inherent contradiction in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> seeking an
early settlement of both Sino-Indian and Indo-Pakistani problems as these will
clear the decks for a Sino-American ‘détente’. Further, that Vice-President
Agnew made the point about <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
negotiating with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>–a
point which cannot but be considered rather unpalatable to New Delhi–makes it
all the more credible. For, President Nixon has always been using the
Vice-President to do the unpleasant talk on his behalf! Hence, it need not be
doubted that the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region> is
keeping in its policy calculations the option of <span class=GramE>effecting</span>
a shift in its <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>
policy. In this event, the Americans would certainly not care very much for
Indian sentiments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
come back to the main theme of Indo-Chinese relations, the foregoing survey
discloses that there are some grounds to expect friendly signals from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
equally valid grounds to think of our future stand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yet,
at the moment nothing is heard form <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. In
fact from other indications, one finds <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>’s
intransigence and hostility remaining as they were. Its open support to the <span
class=SpellE>Naxalite</span> activities in the country not only illustrates its
hostile posture but makes one wonder whether any future softening on her part
may not be designed to establish firmer and deeper contacts with the <span
class=SpellE>Naxalites</span>, for obvious reasons. Further, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> never let’s go a chance to malign <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. She depicts
<st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> as eager to swallow
the <span class=SpellE>defenceless</span> countries of South East Asia and that
this calumny is not being wasted can be seen from <span class=SpellE>vascillations</span>
and hesitations shown by <st1:country-region w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region>
for the last few years in her contacts with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>. Nor is Chinese activity confined
to propaganda alone: There was the recent expansion of an important air base at
<span class=SpellE>Phari</span> <span class=SpellE>Dzong</span> in the <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Chumbi</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType> that cuts <st1:country-region w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Sikkim</span></st1:country-region> from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bhutan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Situated north <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of<i> </i></span>the
Indo- Tibet border this base is now expanded to receive Jumbo Jets. This
expansion is strategically important in that communications and logistics can
be better served now for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It brings sensitive <st1:place w:st="on">North-East India</st1:place> targets
within vulnerable reach of the Chinese aircraft. A few other important roads
are also built by the Chinese. Even more ominous is the shift of certain
missile installations from <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span> province into <st1:country-region

certainly demand great caution on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City></st1:place> should also try
to remain responsive to positive indications of change. After all, the
probability of a Chinese assumption of an initial Indian attack cannot be
brushed aside and that might explain the strengthening of <span class=SpellE>defence</span>

has taken in its <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
policy. The Government has made some moves, two of which exhibit toughness.
Another move cannot but be regarded as uncalled for backing out from an earlier
stand. It is instructive to understand these moves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
raised the Tibetan issue in the United Nations for the first time. We at last
picked up courage to indict <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>
of “systematic destruction of the Tibetan race, language, history and culture,
including their social and religious institutions.” It will be recalled that
when in 1959 and 1961 the issue cropped up in the world body, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place> chose to abstain from voting.
In 1965 <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
supported a resolution sponsored by others. This is the first time when <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> took the
initiative itself. In this one can find our <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>’s part a willingness to be tough. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
decision in this area is the announcement that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is no longer prepared to
treat the Colombo Proposals as a formula for any future negotiations. This
declaration is indiscreet. Of course, it is true that <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> from the start gave these proposals an
unintended meaning and insisted that under these <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> should negotiate with it
unconditionally. <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> had
always maintained that talks with the Chinese can only follow the vacation of
aggression over <st1:place w:st="on">Indian <span class=GramE>territory</span></st1:place>.
The divergence of attitudes has not altered over the years and one might say
that it is just as well <st1:City w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City> takes a bold
stand in declaring “outdated” a set of proposals for which <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> never
showed any <span class=SpellE>bonafide</span> respect. Yet, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s rejection of the formula, in a sense,
would give the impression of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
herself backing out of a commitment entered into implicitly with non-aligned
powers. Further, it is widely held that on balance the Colombo Proposals are <span
class=SpellE>favourable</span> to India and to throw away these at this moment,
when a formula to negotiate with China may be needed in the near future, seems
to be extremely shortsighted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
the above development, at least, appears to be an expression of our hard side,
the second policy change underscores an almost shameful show of <span
class=SpellE>pussilanimity</span>. Last March, the Minister for External
Affairs publicly stated that <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
had no intention of wresting back <st1:place w:st="on">Indian <span
 class=GramE>territory</span></st1:place> now under Chinese occupation. It will
be remembered that Jawaharlal Nehru himself took a pledge to recover these
areas. Of course, nobody would seriously suggest that the lost lands be
recovered even by risking war. And yet to say that we are no longer determined
to secure their recovery is indeed most irresponsible and unfortunate. Viewed
in this light, one begins to doubt whether <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>’s rejection of the Colombo
Proposals is not really a case of softening of its stand before meeting the
Chinese at a table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stated earlier, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
could seize every opportunity to improve matters. A stalemate already 8 years
old should be ended. A negotiated settlement over a dispute pertaining to a
long border cannot but mean concessions on both the sides. In fact it is a safe
bet that the Chinese have advanced claims over the NEFA area in addition to
their claims over <span class=SpellE>Ladakh</span> area in order to have
bargaining points. A realisation of this on the part of the various political
parties in Indian Parliament is essential because the Government will have to
feel free in the conduct of future negotiations with the Chinese. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>defence</span> against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> cannot be slackened. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s objections to military alliances make
her rely mostly on building goodwill for her and even at this <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City></st1:place> till very lately had been
singularly unsuccessful. To an extent the Prime Minister’s visits to East and
South East Asian countries last year helped to project <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s claims
for consideration as a major power of the region. To a considerable extent,
still <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
<span class=SpellE>defence</span> consists of commanding diplomatic support
from other nations which may act as a deterrent to aggression over our borders.
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
position among the non-aligned powers is of significance from this point of
view also and her efforts in this area are of special relevance. The early 60’s
witnessed the rise of a new species among the powers of the neutralist genre
which was prone to be pro-Peking in its leanings. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Ghana</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Algeria</st1:place></st1:country-region> were
prominent among these. This resulted in splitting the non-aligned group.
However, by the end of the decade with Sukarno and <span class=SpellE>NKrumah</span>
out of power and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Algeria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
more mellowed, the Chinese influence waned. This is an opportunity for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
reassert her position in the non-aligned world. Obviously this should not be
overdone. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
should exhibit a sense of realism and not act as a leader rubbing others on the
wrong side or appearing to b<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>e<i> </i></span>imposing
her views and prejudices on others. This brings us to the Preparatory Meeting
of the Non-aligned Conference at Dar-<span class=SpellE>es</span>-Salaam in <st1:country-region

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colombo</st1:place></st1:City> and the Dar-<span
class=SpellE>es</span>-Salaam meeting in April is wider in composition in that
a representative section of the non-aligned world as a whole participated in
it. The relation of both the <st1:City w:st="on">Colombo</st1:City> meeting and
that of Dar-<span class=SpellE>es</span>-Salaam to Indian foreign policy
changes consists in that at both these meets <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> sought to restrict the definition
of non-alignment. The real reason for this stand on non-alignment was the
intention to exclude <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the proposed non-aligned conference. Partly to settle scores for what <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> had done at <st1:City w:st="on">Rabat</st1:City>,
<st1:City w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:City> has made it a foreign policy objective
to exclude <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Towards this purpose it has even informed the other co-sponsors, like
Yugoslavia that if the Preparatory Conference were to include Pakistan in the
list of invitees, India will be constrained to stay out of the Conference
itself. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
now holds to the view that the criteria evolved in 1961 at the time of the

In fact, observers conclude that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
has lost its image by the way she went about canvassing in Afro-Asian capitals.
The Pakistani presence may mean an active anti-India lobby at the Conference.
But surely she should not be frightened of a meeting simply because it may mean
having to face bitter criticism. (2) The <i>mores </i>of non-alignment have, in
fact, changed and the mere presence of a power in a military pact does not
necessarily make it a crusading partisan in the cold war. For one thing, the
concerned military alliance (or alliances) might have lost its relevance, for
another such a power may have developed friendlier relations with a power
against whom a particular military pact may have been originally intended.
CEATO and SENTO have both become museum pieces. Even the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> does not put much store by them
and <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span> seems to be closer to Peking and <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> than to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>.
These are the existential realities of non-alignment. The point is that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> herself
seems to have <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> this challenge and is
reported to be ready to adopt a pragmatic approach to the issue of the criteria
for non-alignment. Yet suddenly it has reverted to the old concept. It would
seem that we are still smarting under the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rabat</st1:place></st1:City>
humiliation. (3) The stand <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
has now taken has a bearing on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s

Brezhnev Plan for Asian security was mooted last summer. For a long time
details of it were not forthcoming from the Kremlin and for that matter
officially no details of the plan have come out even so far. Yet the outside

would have military teeth with all member-countries going to the assistance of
anyone of them against whom aggression is committed by another state. Once the
Asian collective security organisation is set up, all existing regional
security arrangements, both Communist and anti-Communist, would be done away

birthday of Gokhale, the 9th of May, gives us occasion, year after year, to

the one side and, on the other, a frequent review of the changes in the
conditions in which he has to live his life. There is need for a re-evaluation
and re-adaptation both ways from time to time. The essential merit of Gokhale’s
faith was in this recognition of the need for review and re-adjustment. The
dynamism of the world and its call for the seasonable reform of man’s
relationships with it are among the axioms of Liberalism. Liberalism is the
name given in Gokhale’s day to the faith and principles held by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘Liberal’ here is the name of an attitude of mind towards the problems of life.
It denotes a point of view rather than a body of set views. That point is the
belief that life, in order to be good, should for every one be both free in
itself and helpful, and not hurtful, to other lives. From this standpoint,
which is definite and permanent, the readings of situations by the Liberal may
vary from occasion to occasion, and the purposes to be pursued may vary
accordingly. The inner principle is one; and its outward manifestations may be
in a variety of forms as indicated by differences in the circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as possible,–for each individual man as against attempts to subtract from it
made by the State or society or any other external authority. Secondly, to be
Liberal is to be generous, large, adjustable, tolerant and not rigid in one’s
relations with others. The word ‘free’ has also this two-fold meaning (‘<span

the press, and we speak also of a man being free of his money. Thus, being on
guard against the claims of authority and cultivating sympathy with </span><span

concerned, the ideas are implicit in the Hindu concept of Dharma. Let us for a
moment turn to this word which is the key-word to the Hindu way of life. It has
many meanings in current usage. But let us look at the main basic senses.
‘Dharma’ comes </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of a verbal root <span class=SpellE><i>Dhri</i></span><i>

support’. That which supports life is Dharma. This process of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>supporting
life consists of three disciplines:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(1)
Dharma is individual self-sustenance or one’s being oneself – that is, true to
one’s nature. Every created thing has its Dharma or distinctive virtue or
characteristic quality or its peculiar value or power to affect others. Burning
is the Dharma of fire. Cooling is the Dharma of water. Sight is the Dharma of
the eye; hearing of the ear; walking of the legs. Each organ has its prescribed
Dharma. None can perform the Dharma of another. The eye cannot hear; the leg
cannot taste. Thus the inherent property or capacity of a thing is its Dharma.
In short, a thing’s Dharma or virtue is that which makes it itself and keeps it
itself–its individuality, its <span class=SpellE><i>Tattva</i></span><i> </i>(That-ness).
<span class=SpellE><i>Sva</i></span><i>-dharma </i>inculcated in the
Bhagavad-Gita is the rule of self-fulfillment. One has to exercise whatever is
of value or power in one in relation to the occasion or the situation in which
one finds oneself. It is <span class=SpellE><i>Sva</i></span><i>-dharma </i>for
a <span class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> (member of the military caste) to fight
when the cause of justice calls for it. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Liberty</st1:place></st1:City>
is opportunity for such self-<span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>. <span
class=SpellE><i>Sva-tantra</i></span><i> </i>or liberty is a condition
indispensable to <span class=SpellE><i>Sva</i></span><i>-dharma. </i>It should
be noted that, while the word liberty, denoting absence of restraint, is
negative in its import, the word <span class=SpellE>Sva</span>-dharma (one’s
own duty prescribed by the principle of the general good) is positive. The
notion of duty is implied and not explicit in liberty, while the notion of <span
class=SpellE>Svatantra</span> (liberty) is implied and not explicit in<i> </i><span
class=SpellE>Sva</span>-dharma (duty). The relative emphasis in the two phrases
is<i> </i>characteristic of the two<i> </i>scales of value. That liberty is
Incidental<i> </i>and ancillary to Dharma is<i> </i>the Hindu view<i>.</i></span><span

Dharma is justice or the regulation of the movements of <span class=GramE>an
individuality</span> when in association with other individualities.
Self-fulfillment is not in solitude, but in and through society. This means
occasions for clash of personalities and conflict of interests. Harm <span
class=GramE>to one individuality</span> or another is then likely. To minimize
this harm is the purpose of Law. Law or <span class=SpellE><i>Nyaya</i></span>
is the working of Dharma. The seat of the King, who is the fountain of justice,
is Dharma-Asana. Not only should there be freedom for the individual’s
self-fulfillment, but that self-fulfillment should take place in such a way for
each that the similar self-expression of another is not harmed or hindered.
Justice is the avoidance of harm. Law is the regulation of the course of
freedom by the principle of justice. It is justice that supports life in
society. Hence justice is Dharma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(3)
Dharma is fellow-feeling, or recognition of the inter-dependence of<i> </i>life
among all that <span class=GramE>live</span>. Each human being is incomplete by
<span class=GramE>himself</span> or herself and must have some one or another
to bring his or her life to completion, making it bearable and worth while.
Dharma </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is this sense or one’s partnership with others
in the business of living; and the larger the area of this partnership, the
better for the soul. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hence the soul-educative value of the
home and the tribe and the State. Hence the importance of the practice of
loving-kindness to all that lives. Dharma is thus charity or philanthropy,
citizenship, or public spirit. It is an exercise in the cultivation of one’s
spiritual self-expansion–of the habit of identifying yourself with all around.
When that habit is formed, one begins to transcend one’s customary self. One
learns to shed the ego and merge oneself in cosmic living. The progress of the
soul is from self-expression under the law of justice to self-dissolution in
life universal–from Dharma to <span class=SpellE>Moksha</span>, from
individualism to universalism, from life limited to life limitless. Sympathy
and fellow-feeling, which are stepping stones in the ascent, are Dharma, as
seen in familiar phrases like Dharma-<span class=SpellE>Shala</span>, Dharma-<span
class=SpellE>karya</span>, etc. Dharma, active as kindness and compassion,
sustains life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ground underneath with its foot before planting the feet thereon, when a baby

to make sure that there is no tiger anywhere near, it is Rita that works. There
is within every living being an instinct that makes for a search of the nature
of the things coming under its notice; that natural curiosity or craving for
knowledge is Rita. Rita leads on to Satya or Truth; and Satya expresses itself

concerns itself with the self-development of the individual, it is <span

individual’s self-fulfillment must be in and through the lives of his fellow
beings, it is collectivism. Dharma is thus the harmonizing and blending of two
categories of the good: the individual’s and the community’s. It holds that
neither kind of good is fully and truly achieved without the other’s being in
that very process realized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hindu derives his notion of value from what he believes to be the highest and
largest Truth. <i>Brahman </i>or the Great One is that Truth. It is God. It is
larger than, and inclusive of, all the truths of the world. Brahman is at once
the source, the home and the final destination of all that there is. All that a
man desires, or is attracted by, is to be valued according to its effect on his
progress towards the realization of Brahman. Man may not be able to know for
certain what the purpose of creation is, or why he has been placed in it where
he is. But he has it in his power to free life on earth of its burdensomeness
and find in it a serene joy that no worldly factor can mar. This
all-transcending joy comes from the realization of Brahman. This joy is the
highest Good, the <span class=SpellE><i>summum</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>bonum</span> </i>of life, and all other good-seeming things of the
world are to be judged and evaluated with reference to that highest of the
Good. It is the joy of experiencing oneself as one with all that is. It is to
lose all vestiges of ego and be merged in Eternal and Infinite Being. The sense
of being separated from Brahman is our master-error and the mother of all
miseries. Re-union is peace, and felicity. This re-union is to be sought in a
life of Dharma, the triune stream of liberty, justice and universal fellowship.
It should now be clear how the basic concepts of Liberalism are an integral
part of Dharma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of its essential content to British or European thought-movements of that name,
it should be acknowledged that the early Liberals of our country owed their

their minds had been put by the superiority they saw in Europe’s political
institutions, in Europe’s science and in Europe’s industrial and commercial

was Gokhale’s distinction to have realized that conditions had become ripe in
his day for the application of Liberalist principles in the field of the
country’s politics and administration. This unfoldment of the contents of
Liberalism was a gradual, long-continued process, not a sudden upheaval of
vision or impulsion. It was a process of response to the call of circumstance.
It is important to note that Indian Liberalism was not the <i>a-priori </i>importing
of a foreign doctrine or the uncritical imitation of a foreign cry, but the
natural evolution of a native instinct impelled by new experience and new
thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is special need today for a re-statement and re-emphasizing of the principles

realistic approach to ideals, of the study of the fundamental facts of human
nature, of the individual’s need of autonomy, of the recognition of the
limitations to the State’s capacity as well as to the people’s, and of the need
of public education for the achievement of lasting results. The current
policies of the Government in our country are, in many important respects, not
merely a departure from the old principles, but also a contradiction of them in
some respects. And the results of that departure have not proved to be of a
happy kind. Mr. Nehru’s recent mood of discontent, fortunately not allowed to
prevail, may, however, be noted as the reflex of a dissatisfaction felt
throughout the country with the policies and the techniques which have come
superseding the faith of the earlier nation-builders to whose ideas the public
had become educated for three quarters of a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

people use the words ‘idealism’ and ‘realism’ as though they were necessarily
antithetical terms. That is a mistake. An ideal is nothing but the summation
and maximizing of all the good implicit in the actual. An ideal is formed not
in a vacuum and not in the solitude of a cloister, but with the closest
possible reference to the solid things and the significant facts on which it
will have to work, for their betterment. The soundness of the ideal is
necessarily proportionate to the soundness of one’s understanding of the real.
The ideal is the imaginative perfecting of the fragments of the good seen in
the reality, around. The ideal is thus rooted in the real. The practical
idealist is one who constantly checks and corrects his mental pictures of the
good in the light furnished by an analysis and evaluation of the existing. What
there is <span class=SpellE>is</span> the raw material for what there should
be. The study of existing facts and their tendencies is realism; and the
appreciation of the possibilities of the good in them is idealism. In this
sense Gokhale was a practical idealist, and Gandhi was another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

present policies in our country, to the extent of their being a departure from
the principles of Gokhale, are as well a departure from the line of Gandhi, for
on most matters of the duty of the State and the rights of the citizen, Gokhale
and Gandhi thought and felt very much alike. Both alike took their stand on the
psychology of the people–the attitudes they had inherited, their common beliefs
and sentiments, the experiences they had gone through, the education they had
received not only in schools, but also in life’s struggles, their scales of
value and their mental make-up and outlook. It is out of these, they both
recognized, that the India of the future is to be evolved. And they took a
careful measure of the forces ranged on the opposite side. How large an area
was common ground., for Gokhale and Gandhi will become evident when we examine
the elements of the faith that was Gokhale’s. But before we proceed to it, a
word seems necessary as regards the one or two points of difference of view
between Gokhale and Gandhi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

plan of work for winning independence was not one referable to any idea of
Gokhale’s or any other predecessor’s. Gokhale could not have been aware of that
plan at all, because Gandhi’s ideas in this matter reached fullness and cogency
of expression only some years after Gokhale’s death. It is an open question
whether, if Gokhale had lived on for some five or ten years longer, he would
have approved of the course adopted by Gandhi. One may as well speculate,
relying on the evidence we have of Gokhale’s great respect and affection for
Gandhi and Gokhale’s habitual openness of mind and receptivity to new ideas,
that Gokhale would have heartily joined Gandhi as collaborator in the <span
class=SpellE>Satyagrahic</span> fight. But taking facts as they stood at the
time one has to admit that the ideology of Satyagraha is not one that can be
organically related to the known views of Gokhale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

problem beyond Gokhale’s ken which Gandhi had to face was that of the mutual

universal compulsory education of the people up to an effective standard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

must at this stage remind ourselves of the all-important and epochal changes
that have taken place since Gokhale’s time in the political constitution and
status of India. In Gokhale’s day, India was a Dependency, not even a Dominion,
of Great Britain, ruled by a bureaucracy under the barely theoretical control
of Britain’s democracy. Today, India is an independent sovereign State, a
democracy and a Secular State. These, we may be sure, are changes that would
have rejoiced Gokhale as the grand fulfillment of his own dreams. The supremacy
of the people in their own country, their right to the free management of their
own affairs, the sharing of power; by the entire body<i> </i>of citizens, and
the complete dissociation of the State from religion without any<i> </i>antagonism
to religion as such, are all conditions fundamental to<i> </i>liberalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The vote is to the Liberal the symbol of a unit of rational intelligence, not a
packet of mechanical man-power. The Liberal would count heads and not hands.
Parliament and procedure are of importance to him as venues for browning into
active service all the moral and intellectual faculties of the community and
setting them in concentrated action for the good of all. The Liberal’s constant
care therefore is that society’s intelligence and conscience get their fullest
chance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Liberal also recognizes that man’s life is a mixture of two distinct and dissimilar
ingredients: the material and the spiritual–the objective and the
subjective–that which can be brought to analysis and proof and that which
consists of inward faith and experience not accessible to outward measurement.
The Liberal would never forget or belittle the distinction between these two
provinces of life. And he accepts the teaching of Jesus: “Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s” <i>(Matt.
</i>22-21). A Secular State is not anti-religious. But it does not single out,
as its own, any one among the many religions and creeds professed by its
subjects. To be this is, however, not to be anti-religious. On the other hand,
the Secular State protects all religions equally and refrains from interference
with any equally. It protects the non-religious and even the irreligious as
well so long as they do not attempt to meddle with the religious. Such were the
Hindu kingdoms of old. The Raja of Vijayanagara may have been personally a <span
class=SpellE>Vaishnava</span> or a <span class=SpellE>Shaiva</span>, but his
protection as Ruler was available as readily to <span class=SpellE>Jains</span>
and even Mussalmans as to Hindus. Equally to care for all is in effect not
different from being equally neutral towards all. The modern State concerns
itself directly only with the temporal and non-religious aspects of man’s life.
So does Liberalism. Not that the Liberal is not alive to the contribution which
religion and philosophy have it in their power to make to the strength of the
State by the good influence which they can exercise upon the character and
outlook of the people. But he appreciates these advantages as he appreciates
the <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> features of geography and climate–as
things beyond his powers and his reckoning. He does not refuse the good offices
of religion in building up the moral side of citizenship; but he takes care
that the private side of life has its fullest possible autonomy. His care
directly is with the public side of life only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as to liberty. The contents of this general concept will perhaps be better
appreciated if stated under some specific heads. Let me mention some: (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) Civil liberty or the right of citizenship. Franchise or
the right to vote is its practical form. A share in making laws, and equality
in the eye of law, are the main principles. Law must be an expression, and the
authoritative expression, of the general will of those whom it is meant to
govern. This is the heart of the philosophy of democracy. The sacredness of the
vote and the freedom of the vote are derived from this. (ii) Political liberty
or a share in the control of government or the instruments of the legislature.
‘No power without </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>responsibility,” and “Redress before supplies”
are the maxims here. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the-impossibility of arbitrary </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>acts to restrain a man’s freedom of
movement and action and self-enjoyment. Remedies are in the form of <i>habeas
corpus </i>and other judicial writs. (v) Social liberty, relating to the
freedom of intercourse between groups and classes and their equal right to the
use of roads, parks and such other public amenities. (vi) Economic liberty which
relates to the choosing of a profession or trade and entering into contracts of
service and to move from place to place in search of opportunity. (vii)
Domestic liberty which relates to marriage, adoption and the status of members </span><span

a family. (viii) Religious liberty and liberty of conscience. (ix) Liberty of
speech and discussion, of which the freedom of the press is </span><span

integral part, and (x) Liberty of meeting and association for not unlawful

Liberal sees the house of life for each man or Woman as made up of two
chambers, one reserved for his (or her) living all by himself, alone and
undisturbed, and the other chamber meant for his sharing life with others.
Every human being, in his (or her) very nature, is both individualistic and
gregarious. He would sometimes be left alone; all with himself and to himself.
At other times he craves for company and is not happy in solitude. And when in
company, he has both preferences and aversions, thus behaving pro-socially
sometimes and anti-socially other times. Has not Browning described man as a
midway creature between God and beast? The Liberal recognizes the naturalness
and the inescapability of the duality and marks off the field of private life
from the public. He would, not extend the public field unless there is
undoubted and urgent need for extension; and even in the limited public field,
he would further limit the operation of State-authority to the unavoidable
minimum. In short, in all cases of likely collision between the individual and
the State, his general tendency would be to stand by the individual who is
almost always the weaker party in a contest against the massed forces of the
State. The Liberal would first try to avoid all possibility of conflict between
authority and liberty; and then, when conflict is found to be inevitable, he
would throw his weight on the side of liberty. For liberty is the indispensable
condition of the blossoming of ‘Personality; and this blossoming of personality
should be the supreme purpose of all governments and all laws. In the final
analysis, self-development is the highest good for everyone, man or woman; and
society and the State and all other forms of organized existence are only means
to that end. It is a grievous confusion of ends and means to talk of a general
welfare which ignores individual welfare. The first element of well-being for
any one is the sense of liberty: “Good or bad, my life is mine; well or ill, my
lot is my choice; high or low, my destiny is my handiwork”–this feeling of
self-dependence and self-respect is the fruit of liberty; and when that
felicity is secured to a man, he could blame no one and will learn to reconcile
himself to what time and the world bring to him. That is peace and welfare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

capacity for self-control. Next to doing away with the State, Gandhi would have
it restrict its activity to the inevitable minimum. He would have all
relationships among individuals be regulated by goodwill and free contract
rather than by the force of law and the machinery of the State. There are seeds
of the good embedded in every human heart. Let us call them into life rather
than employ the police to achieve our social ends. Communism is coercive. It
discourages and even atrophies the people’s private impulse for the good and
thus deprives them of the opportunity of moral self-education by voluntary
exertion for the general good. This is really emaciating to the soul of man. As
for Socialism, standing midway between Communism and Liberalism, it lacks the
thoroughness and ruthless efficiency of the first and the genial and
fertilizing influence of the second. Gandhiji used to claim that he, in
contrast to those who put on the label, was the true Socialist, his brand of
Socialism consisting in accepting the ethics of trusteeship as the basis of
relations between the ‘Haves’ and the ‘Have-nots’ in society. In other words,
the State should not aim at the abolition of the capitalist and the employer,
in the illusory hope of creating a classless society, but should make itself
responsible for ensuring that the ‘Haves’ conduct themselves as though they
were persons appointed to be trustees for the ‘Have-nots.’ Those who possess
properties or faculties of value to the community should by all means be
enabled to cultivate and develop those possessions; and they should at the same
time be required to share the fruit reaped equitably with those who <span
class=SpellE>laboured</span> in the garden even though they were not the legal
owners. Equity rather than equality is the principle here. The Trusteeship
Doctrine recognizes that the Capitalist or the Proprietor has a place in the
economy of the nation–an indispensable place though not an uncontrolled place.
He is as vital as is the technician and the machine-minder or any other worker.
It is therefore, not for the State to take sides with any among them. On the
contrary, it is for the State to insist on <span class=SpellE>fairplay</span>
and equity in their relations with one another. Viewed logically from this
position, there should be no antagonism and no unfriendly rivalry between what
are nowadays called the public sector and the private sector in fields of
economic enterprise and social amelioration. It is clear that some
State-enterprises connected with the Five-Year Plans go against this freedom of
private initiative. The so-called nationalizing of life insurance, bus
transport, etc., is an instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

now come<i> </i>to Realism, the second rule of Liberalism. This is the habit of
seeking to find out things in their true nature and their working. Public
policies and measures should be based upon an analytical understanding of
relevant facts in their fullness and a measured appreciation of the directions
and velocities of the forces in or arising out of those facts. Good intentions
are not enough. If the promoter of a benevolent scheme is sincere, that
sincerity must induce him to search and ascertain whether the conditions exist
to make that scheme worth while. This rules out <i>a-priori </i>or presumptive
legislation and fancy-drawn planning: Every new movement of the State must mean
some disturbance to the old established order of society in some part of it,
and it is therefore bound to meet with some resistance. Habits formed through
generations and material interests built up for long cannot be melted away by
sentiment; and sentiment may itself be the child of error in understanding. It
is not just to attribute anybody’s opposition to a scheme or an idea to
self-interest on his part. And after all, is not self-interest the raw material
of politics and the factor that makes the State necessary? The good citizen’s
business is not to decry personal interest, but to find how best its operations
may be regulated so as to avoid or at least to minimize harm by one interest to
another. This is justice. Facts are its raw material. To measure the relative
validities of the several claims and interests in conflict and to accommodate
them in accordance with their respective merits is the office of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

measure of their magnitude and strength. To get our facts wrong and build our
hopes of betterment thereupon is to work our way into a fool’s paradise. And among

excludes bias and partisanship of all kinds. A special word however seems not
uncalled for to emphasize the importance of letting light fall upon a public
question from as many sides as possible, particularly because of the <span
class=SpellE>multitudinousness</span> of communal, linguistic, sectarian,
provincial and other ramifications of the body politic in our day in addition
to organized political parties. For national solidarity and peace as well as
for the fairness and workability of public policy, it is necessary not only
that all possible parties and groups should be heard and heard with sympathy,
but also that they should be so dealt with as to leave them no ground for
honestly complaining that they have been ignored. If policy should satisfy the
demands of justice, it follows that no available fact or fraction of a fact
relevant to the matter should be shut out and no means of sifting or checking
dispensed with. There is thus a place for every minority view in the perfecting
of public policy. A majority is no god, and a minority no victim, in a justly
constituted democracy. Parliament works by conventions accepted by majority and
minority alike; and one such convention is that when all efforts at mutual
conversion fail and when there appears no more hope of successful bargaining
between majority and minority, the issue may be decided by the relative
strength of votes. The minority gets every reasonable opportunity to persuade
the majority; and when all its argument and eloquence fail, it bows to the
majority, not in sullenness but in the spirit of sportsmanship. The minority is
loyal enough to the country to realize that there must be an end to discussion
at some stage, and a guidance for action must issue. It defers to that majority
as a working device and not as an admission of any injustice in its<i> </i>own
cause. That deference is tentative and temporary. The minority remains free to
re-open the matter again subject to accepted rules. Such being the spirit and
attitude of <span class=SpellE>parliamentarianism</span>, the Liberal would not
be proud of mere numerical superiority. There can be no greater enemy to
democracy than dogma; and there is no dogma more dangerous than that of a
mechanically secured majority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

British method of democratic decision is not the despotism of brute number.
That method is described as a majority-minority pact. The vote is preceded by
months of inquiry and discussion, in hundreds of newspapers and public meetings
and expert committees. It is from these that the ultimate vote derives its
moral significance. When discourse and debate have proceeded long enough in the
general opinions of all parties, and all have come to feel that the hour for
decision has struck, there being no other way available to resolve differences,
the division bell is invoked as the last resort. It is only such a vote that
can claim moral authority for itself. In other words, there are occasions when
the vote is in place and there are occasions when it is not. And there are
proper methods of voting and there are improper methods as well. The Liberal
keeps the distinction clearly in view. The legislation in our country to amend
the Constitution, so as to eliminate the jurisdiction of the courts over
compensation disputes about properties taken over by the State from private
persons, is a glaring example of party dogma and majority high-handedness. The
way in which a ministerial crisis was solved in Mysore recently is also an

the state of work in Government offices, and the sufficiency or excess of
staffs in them. Audit of efficiency and retrenchment of expenditure on
establishments are the twin mottos of the Liberal. His first concern always is
about the State’s solvency. The guarantee for the Stare’s independence is the
independence of its exchequer. The Liberal would therefore hesitate to ask any
foreign Government for a gift of aid or even a loan. Even when no strings are attached,
foreign aid affects the recipient’s stature and self-respect. Expectations
would naturally exist in the giver’s mind even though he protests to the
contrary; and when they are not satisfied, misunderstandings are bound to show
themselves. Such psychological complications drive out harmony and vitiate the
international atmosphere. When external help is necessary, it is best sought
from an international institution like the World Bank, where the obligation
cannot be towards any single or particular country. A bank is a business
organization, and a loan from it cannot compromise the borrower’s independence

emphasize the importance of agriculture is not to belittle the importance of
industry. The industrial development of the country has always been one of the
principal planks of the Liberal platform. But the Liberal, as suggested at the
beginning in this paper, would lay the first emphasis on encouraging private
enterprise. The Prime Minister of India has sometimes spoken of ‘mixed economy’
as the way. The phrase is attractive to the Liberal; but its precise meaning
remains still to be stated. If the idea is that part of the capital for an enterprise
should come from private investors and the rest from the State and that
management should be in the hands of an agency representative of both, it may
by pointed out that Mysore has tried it on a large enough scale and in more
than two or three instances, and found it successfully workable. If a way be
devised of associating workers also with the industry so that they could see
that their interests are duly protected, the way will have been found to
peaceful prosperity. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

other topics of equal urgency. A word on our foreign policy cannot be avoided,
even though it does not belong to the politics of Gokhale’s time. It is only an
independent nation that has to face problems of war and peace. And here our
teacher is Mahatma Gandhi who was truly an internationalist. In the field of
external affairs, India has on the whole kept true to the Gandhian ideals of

interest in international affairs is incidental to her general interest in the
welfare of humanity. She has for her own sake no material interest to promote
outside her borders. She has no place on the military map of the world and has
never sought one. She has no ambition for territory. She holds no colony. She
claims no sphere of influence. She has known what it is to be dominated by a
foreigner; and she does not wish to dominate over anyone. She wants to be left
alone, but in an atmosphere of friendliness and peace. She is concerned with
building up her own strength by her own hands and by her own resources, and
with filling worthily her part in the comity of nations. War in any part of the
world is to her like hot and pungent smoke in a neighbourhood, affecting her
comfort in breathing. Hence her desire to work for peace and harmony even among
people remote from her shores like the Koreans and having no manner of material
connection with her. It is, therefore, unnecessary for her to range herself on
any one side in a conflict. Her taking sides would indeed be fatal to her
possible office of friend and peace-maker. Non-involvement is the attitude
proper to the judge,–one who is friend to both parties without being so
friendly to either as to be regarded as unfriendly by the other. It is the
attitude of such a true-hearted friend, whose goodwill towards both is
regulated by his loyalty to justice and the sense of the general welfare of
all, that is summed up in the creed of <span class=SpellE><i>Pancha</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Sheela</span> </i>or the Five-pointed Ethic: (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) Mutual respect for territorial integrity and
sovereignty, (ii) Non-aggression, (iii) Non-interference in internal affairs,
(iv) Equality and mutual help, and (v) Peaceful co-existence. The Liberal stands
for these principles. And he would submit all differences for settlement to
arbitration. War can never settle a dispute. A forced settlement is no
settlement, for it will drive the anger of the defeated inwards, to <span
class=SpellE>smoulder</span> there and burst into flames later on. Only an
agreed settlement can bring peace, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and the way to it is
through negotiation and arbitration. And even then, the Hindu Liberal would
plead that man may not arrogate to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>himself the power to
see and administer justice in its divine perfection. Man can but make an
approach towards it, and if with his best effort there is still some sense of
shortcoming felt by a party, it is far better that that party accepts even that
imperfect-seeming settlement, trusting to the goodness of the Great Judge of
all, than that it </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

resort to violence. The supreme need of nations today is for self-introspection

Conference (1892–93): “The history of this great country is but a fairy tale if
it has not illustrated how each invasion from abroad has tended to serve as a
discipline of the chosen race and led to the gradual development of the nation
to a higher ideal–if not of actual facts, at least of potential capabilities.
The nation has never been depressed beyond hope of recovery, but after a
temporary submerging under the floods of foreign influences, has reared up its
head, absorbing all that is best in the alien civilization and polity and
religions….” “Above all countries, we inherit a civilization and a social and
religious polity which have been allowed to work their own free development on
the big theatre of Time. There has been no revolution, and yet the old
condition of things has been tending to reform itself by the slow process of
assimilation……Change for the better by slow absorption–not by sudden conversion
or revolution–this has been the characteristic feature of our past history.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

inherent to a bureaucracy and how civil servants go on multiplying, regardless
of the volume of work that really needs to be done. This natural tendency of
officialdom towards self-aggrandizement is called ‘Parkinson’s Law.’ Its axioms
are (1) “An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals. (2) “Officials
make work for each other.” Applying Parkinson’s Law to India, ‘Odysseus’ points
out in <i>The Eastern Economist </i>of May 30, 1958: “In 1937, the personnel of

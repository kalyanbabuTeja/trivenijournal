view of the fact that Gokhale exhorted his countrymen to spiritualire public
life, and that this exhortation evoked a deep, reverent and abiding response in
the heart of Gandhi, whom later generations have cherished as the Father of the
Nation, the concept of “spirituality in public life” may merit close attention.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Going
through the several speeches of Gokhale, where a reference to an appropriate
attitude towards politics and public life occurs, and keeping in view some of
the controversies on a high moral and political plane which went on when Gandhi
made his first speech about Gokhale, his remarks have a special significance.
If political life, that is, those activities of one’s life which have their
origin in one’s position as a member of the polity, the state, is treated by
citizens as an optional and additional activity, their interest in public
affairs is at best casual. With the mass of the people having no more than an
indifferent or only occasional interest in politics, a democratic or liberal
form of government, built on the assumption of active participation of
citizens, is ruled out. For both Gandhi and Gokhale the objective of political
struggle was not only to gain freedom from Britain, but to get it in such
manner that the Indian State, which will emerge at the end, will be a
democratic, progressive and equalitarian society. For, an integrated goal of
political activity such as this the distinction between ends and means was most
crucial. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were not a few among the well-known contemporaries of Gokhale, and later of
Gandhi, who felt that achievement of political freedom from foreign rule was
itself such a supremely moral end that any controversy about the ethical merits
of the means to be adopted to attain that end was irrelevant. Gokhale and
Gandhi very emphatically held a different view on the subject. According to them
political or civic conduct is, or ought to be, part and parcel of the normal
life of a member of a civilized community. Not only must he give to civic and
political interests the same attention which he normally gives to his personal
or family interests, he must also be held accountable in both spheres to the
same standards of good behaviour. Political life, said Gandhi, must be an echo
of private life, there cannot be any divorce between the two. In fact, Gandhi
expressed his views about the crucial importance of the quality of means in a
social transformation more firmly on another occasion when he observed: “It is
true we cannot rise till our political condition is reformed. But it is not
true that we shall be able to progress if our political condition undergoes a
change by any means and in any manner.” ** <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
Gokhale was among the very first of his countrymen to appreciate fully the high
moral plane on which Gandhi moved–the first meeting between the two is
described by Gandhi as “love at first sight”–he continued throughout his later
life to pay unstinted public tribute to Gandhi, to his work in South Africa and
to his teachings. In one of his innumerable references to Gandhi, Gokhale said
that in him Indian humanity has reached its high-water mark. While
appreciating, and following, the high principles of fairness and morality in
public life which the two shared, Gokhale was prepared to devote himself in a
workmanlike manner to the essential task of building India’s public life.
Throughout his career Gokhale worked as a Congressman, and he filled several
positions in that organization. In 1903 when he was only 37 years of age, he
was elected Joint Secretary of the Congress. In that capacity he toured the
country to create the necessary interest in, and to guide the progress of
public life. The speech that he delivered in Madras in July 1904 was an
occasion for him to make an important statement of his views on public life in
India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
first dealt with those who had by then grown weary and pessimistic about the
results of political activity conducted by the Congress. Gokhale felt that
considering the strength of those who were entrenched in power, and the
weakness of the people seeking their rightful position, the achievements in
respect of creating and organizing public opinion were by no means meagre or
discouraging. The struggle, in his opinion, was bound to be a long and arduous
one in which success will depend on the development of the people’s capacity
and character, and on the quality of their efforts individual as well as
institutional. To those who felt that it would be more fruitful to turn the
organised activities of people into industrial channels, Gokhale answered: “It
is with me a firm conviction that unless you have a more effective and more
potent voice in the government of your own country, in the administration of
your affairs, in the expenditure of your own revenues, it is not possible for
you to effect much in the way of industrial development.” The spurt in planned
economic development which has occurred in independent India during the last
fifteen years, in contrast with the systematic stunting of India’s economic
life under foreign rule for over a hundred and fifty years, fully bears out the
validity of Gokhale’s analysis and his emphasis on priority of politic</span><span

work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
circumstances of the times, he thought, justified, better hopes and called for
more intensive and disciplined action. He declared that “Our public life is
really feeble and ineffective because it is so faint-hearted and so soulless.
Very few of us have really faith in the work we are doing.” He went on to add
that if we desire to emulate the example of Japan–which was then emerging as a
strong Asian power–we must have a more concentrated and more disciplined public
life. Elaborating the same thought further he observed: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
day has gone by when politics could afford to be amateurish in this land. It
has been ameteurish in the past but the struggle is growing keener and keener,
and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

responsibilities of public life in the same manner as they choose their
profession and devote their energies to it...</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Surely in every
province, the country has the right to expect at least one or two men to come
forward and give more of their time and energy to the building up of the public
life, whose weakness we all so much deplore. These men could then be centres
round whom our young men could group and band themselves together, and it would
then be possible to build up a much higher type of public life than now. There
is a great deal of quiet work to be done for which we want young men, who will
be willing to go among the public without noise or fuss, not anxious to address
meetings but willing and content to do quiet work. If we all recognise our
respective duties in this spirit, we shall be able to turn our present efforts
into a great, rousing movement for the political emancipation of this land.”</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
next year, that is, on June 12, 1905, the Servants of India Society was established
with headquarters in Poona with Gokhale as its First Member, who at sunrise on
that administered the oath of membership to his three fellow-members. In a
preamble to the constitution of the Society Gokhale brings out more fully the
implications of his views on public life in India. In an important part of this
statement he observes: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“A
creditable beginning has already been made in matters of education and of local
self-government; and all classes of the people are slowly but steadily coming
under the influence of liberal ideas. The claims of public life are every day
receiving wider recognition, and attachment to the land of our birth is growing
into a strong and deeply cherished passion of the heart...One essential
condition of success in this work is that a sufficient number of our
country-men must now come forward to devote themselves to the cause in the
spirit in which religious work is undertaken. Public life must be
spiritualised.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will thus be seen that Gokhale’s exhortation to his countrymen to spiritualize
politics had several implications. That they </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>should follow
in their public or political life the same standard of good conduct as they
naturally do in their private life was an important, but only one of the
important, implications of his teaching. That all civilised and patriotic
persons have a public aspect of their life for which they must have a programme
of daily devotion, as they reserve for their private life, is a principle of
behaviour on which alone the life of a great nation is based. Gokhale had Japan
very much in his mind as one of the outstanding examples of an Asian country
rising as one man, and working like a dedicated family for the freedom and
progress of the nation. Not in one field, but in all, unless people devoted themselves
to their social, civic and political duties with the same idealism and
dedication which are considered appropriate virtues in private life, political
freedom, democracy and progress would be impossible of attainment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was Gokhale’s and Gandhi’s teaching for all their countrymen. For the select
few who would muster strength and enough idealism and dedication to devote
themselves entirely to national service a higher standard of sacrifice and
selflessness was demanded. As an example may be quoted the following vows which
each member of the Servants of India Society has to take before his admission
into the Society: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the quality of the means as in the extent of the achievement. In fact for
several reasons they attached more importance to means than to ends. As a rule
disregard of just means leads to an eventual deterioration which would rob the
achievement of all substance, at least of all moral substance, of the ideals in
support of which the struggle is undertaken. Here again, Gokhale expresses the
relatively greater importance of legitimate means when he says: “The real moral
interest of a struggle, such as we are engaged in, lies not so much in the
particular readjustment of present institutions which we may succeed in
securing, as in the strength that the conflict brings us to be a permanent part
of ourselves.” (Presidential Address at the Banaras Congress Session, 1905) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

freedom to be real, it has to be experienced by the common man in his daily
life. This alone evokes interest and participation by the citizen in public
affairs. A pattern of social organization in which the affairs which directly
affect the people of each locality or region are left substantially to their
own mangement is to be welcomed as a foundational feature of stable democracy.
Gokhale was an ardent advocate of decentralised administration. That
considerable progress has been made in setting up these local organs of
self-government at all levels of our national community is in one sense a
fulfilment of the promise of a truly democratic regime. That the new set-up has
its own problems, especially on the human or personnel side, only poses a fresh
challenge and an opportunity for the organization of public life in the spirit
in which Gokhale preached its extension in the nation’s political life. The
smooth functioning of democratic institutions nearer one’s own place of
interest and their utilization for promoting public welfare, constitute a
permanent addition to the opportunities and obligations of public life which

been faultless. That is a different issue by itself. But as with a broadbased
structure of political life, so with a commitment to planned economic
development of all classes and regions in the country; the two together

must be admitted, however, that in one or two prominent respects, and in a
somewhat unexpected fashion, a few of the most cherished values in public life,
on which Gokhale and Gandhi laid great stress, appear to have faded out of
sight. Public life must be spiritualized, said Gokhale. Gandhi understood that
to be the principal teaching of his Guru, which in his life he tried to follow.
Look upon your public life as a part of your personal life: follow the same
high standard in both: do your public work as you do your private work, in a
religious spirit. This was their teaching, their precept and their example.
After nineteen years of independence a generation has appeared to whom the
exhortation would appear to be pointless, if not meaningless. That version of
secularism, which in practice has meant virtual eclipse of religion for the
great mass of the people, in which new generations are being brought up without
any assured introduction to religious philosophy and faith, would fail to
constitute, in the Gokhale–Gandhi tradition, a worthy preparation for public,
or for that matter for private, life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

equally disquieting development is the absorption, into the political vortex of
governmental power, of all the traditions of disinterested service of the
nation and of humanity for which the generation of Gokhale and Gandhi worked,
Gandhi’s withdrawal from the Congress on the eve of the latter’s assumption of
governmental power in Delhi was an event of great symbolic significance. The
Congress, such as it was in the middle of 1947, was an institution devoted to
the attainment of freedom by Indians of all classes, to the making of which
persons, with different ideologies and back-grounds, but having a common
dedication to national independence, had contributed their mite. The prestige,
goodwill and historical appeal, which had gathered round the name of the
Congress, was not the creation of any particular group, each one of whom would
been legitimately free to form an electioneering organ of its own in the new
democracy which was born. The Congress would they have continued as a truly
non-partisan national body giving unity and inspiration to all those who had a
disinterested, dedicated, spiritualized interest in public life–such as people
had before the setting up of governmental institutions of our own for which
electioneering postures and arrangements were thought to be necessary. It was
reported at that time, that Gandhi desired that after independence the Congress
should cease to be a political body in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

public life, the entire tradition of disinterested national service having been
pressed into the normal functioning of a party government, several basic
spheres of social amelioration in which non-political motivations are alone
effective have come to be neglected to a point of danger. To take only a couple
of examples: prohibition and tribal welfare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

official machinery in those days was hostile to such an effort, partly because
the rulers did not look upon drink in the same unfavourable light as we did,
and partly because excise revenue was an important feeder of the public purse.
One had every right to expect that in both these respects conditions would
materially change when we had our own governments. Temperance workers, with the
assistance of a suitable public policy and of better example from the new

need for educative propaganda. But I have yet to see leading lights of the
ruling party going into drink-infested localities, and carrying on an
anti-drink campaign as their own predecessors were doing. Now they would more
easily send a police party. If public work is no more than public coercion,

more disturbing are the developments, or the lack of development, in the tribal
areas. The rehabilitation, and the social, cultural and economic betterment of

fellow-men is called for, it is here that the need is greatest. Whatever the </span><span

motive of the foreign rulers may have been, it cannot be doubted that the
foreign missionaries in the tribal areas played a significant role in bringing
the tribal people into the fold of the more advanced peoples of the world. Both
Gokhale and Gandhi placed the greatest emphasis on this sphere of public
service. Thakkar Baba, a colleague of Gokhale and Gandhi, played almost a
historical role in reclaiming for the national cause the allegiance of some
tribal communities, who, left to themselves, might otherwise have posed
problems almost as big as those which are now posed by some other tribal
groups. The overnight transformation of the Congress into a political party and
its being enthroned in Viceregal, and Governor’s, palaces as the ruling power,
has meant an end, at least an eclipse, of genuine public service, such as the
one which Gokhale and Gandhi lived for and died for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is too late in the day to undo what has been done in this respect. The
remedy in the political field will now have to be a political one. But in the
sphere of non-partisan social, human and civic activity it has now become
necessary, in view of the many major frustrations of the people’s hopes and
ideals, to reconstruct public life more or less along the same principles which
were advocated by Gokhale and Gandhi over fifty years ago. With a democratic
constitution, with widespread knowledge, and with growing abundance of
resources, it should now be easier to build local and national units of public
service. What is needed is the spirit of non-partisan and devoted regard for
the relief of misery, for the spread of knowledge, and for the vindication of
justice. There is an urgent call for public service in all these respects, and
with a government committed to the principles of social justice as outlined in
the preamble and in Part IV of our Constitution, the prospects of fulfilment
even in material terms, as distinguished from the moral satisfaction of the
worker, are definitely more assured. The attainment of independence, and the
transformation of the Congress into an electioneering party, have not lessened

philosophical thought and religious wisdom, <span class=SpellE>harmonised</span>
with the best in modern science and thought, Mahatma Gandhi’s name occupies a
unique place. His name will ever remain high, because he was, above all, a
practical idealist who preached and <span class=SpellE>practised</span> without
swerving from truth at every moment during his long career as a social
reformer, a political leader, a saint, a true lover of humanity, and an apostle

does not formulate any theoretical philosophy of life, but his life and
activities embody a living sermon. He sets out to solve the problems of life as
they confront him in the course of his rich and varied career. “I have not the
qualifications for teaching my philosophy of life. I have barely qualifications
for <span class=SpellE>practising</span> the philosophy I believe.” <i>(<span
class=SpellE>Harijan</span>, </i>12th July, 1942) He conveys his message and
teachings through actions and utterances that have a bearing on concrete
situations. He does not merely proclaim ideals of conduct, but follows them up
in his own personal life to their logical conclusion and thus puts them to test
through experimental verification. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is essentially a man of religion, and morality according to him is synonymous
with religion. “Morality is the basis of things and truth is the substance of
all morality.” <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<i>My Experiments with
Truth</i>)<i> </i></span>The fundamentals of religion are focused in his
personality and he expresses them in his manifold activities in diverse spheres
of life. His life is a ceaseless <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> to solve
problems by methods derived from his innermost convictions regarding the nature
of God and man. All claims and interests, both individual and corporate,
receive devoted attention and service at his hands and he deals with them in accordance
with a basic religious insight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

does not consist merely in a set of beliefs or a code of rituals, it grips one’s
whole personality and expresses itself in the way in which one lives. “The
whole gamut of man’s activities today constitutes an indivisible whole. You
cannot divide social, economic, political and purely religious work into
watertight compartments. I do not know religion apart from human activity. It
provides a moral basis to all activities which they would otherwise lack,
reducing life to a maze of sound and fury signifying nothing.” <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<span class=SpellE><i>Harijan</i></span><i>,
</i></span>24th December, 1938) He reconciles the spiritual and temporal
interests of life into a harmonious system on the basis of religion. “The soul
of religion is one, but it is encased in a multitude of forms.” <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<i>Young India </i></span>25th September,
1925) One’s religion grows and develops in the course of one’s life, and
contact with those who follow other religions should deepen and enrich one’s own
rather than supplant it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

approach to every problem is from the standpoint of the human spirit. His
unremitting efforts to promote Hindu-Muslim unity and the eradication of
untouchability which he characterizes as “a hideous untruth” are not prompted
by motives of political expediency, but are matters of religious significance: “Service
of <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span> is for me, as it must be for you, a
question of repentance and reparation for the wrong we have done to our
fellow-men.” <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<i>Young India, </i></span>13th

judges customs, habits, laws and institutions in the light of ethical values.
Nothing that has any retarding effect upon the development of the divine spirit
in man should be permitted. His advocacy of cottage industries, <span

his exaltation of the dignity of manual <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and
his dread of totalitarianism–all these become intelligible when we grasp the
basis on which his whole philosophy of life rests–sanctity of human personality
and the integrity of the individual will. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

passion for simplicity and opposition to the use of machinery have been
misunderstood and he has been charged as seeking to put back the clock of human
progress. But when viewed in the context of the present circumstances and the
operating motives behind the industrial life of today, it will be clear that it
is not opposition to machinery as such, but his love of the common man that has
determined his attitude. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

set them right. <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>He<b> </b>e</span>numerated
seven evils and strove hard to set them right with some success though not with
complete success. The seven evils according to him are: (1) Politics without
principles; (2) Wealth without work; (3) Pleasure without conscience; (4)
Knowledge without character; (5) Commerce without morality; (6) Science without
humanity; and (7) Worship without sacrifice. The evils, when <span

exploitation and use of violence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

places before the world to-day an alternative for capitalism and communism
based on enlightened individualism which is psychologically individualistic but
ethically universalistic. He pleads for a democratic way <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>life in economic, social and
political spheres. His opposition to the Russian economic order is on account <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>compulsion and restraint on the
individual that it involves. “If it were not based on force I would dote on it.
But to-day since it is based on <span class=GramE>force,</span> I do not know
how far and where it will take us.” He hates privilege and monopoly <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>every kind. Whatever cannot be
shared by all is taboo to him. His loin cloth and abstemious life are more due
to his desire to identify himself with the starving and naked masses than to
any spirit <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>self-immolation
for its own sake. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stands for integrated life, both for the individual and society in consonance
with Truth, i.e., God. He lives his principles and his life in his message to
humanity. There may be differences of opinion on some of the views expressed by
him and difficulties in the practical application of his principles. He is
himself aware <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>these. He asks
every one to think for <span class=GramE>himself</span> and follow the inner
light. One may be incapable <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>attaining
the ideal, but on that account we should not lower the ideal. “We may never be
strong enough to be entirely non-violent in thought, word and deed. But we must
keep non-violence as our goal and make steady progress towards it. The
attainment <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of freedom, whether for a
man, nation or the world must be in exact proportion to the attainment of </span>non-violence
by <span class=GramE>each.</span>” <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<i>Young
India</i>, 20th May, 1926) <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

is more concerned with effort than achievement. Means must be as pure as the
end itself and ultimately the means and the end are identical. This identity
gives the clue to appraise life. The real aim is not the attainment of any
concrete result, but the preservation of the spirit underlying the effort. The goal
may not be reached, but that does not mean the method has failed. For the
adoption of the method in its purity is itself a triumph of the spirit. He
seeks to draw out the best in human nature and true heroism is not in the
success achieved but in the noble <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>. In the
very failure lies the seed of future success for only Truth will ultimately
prevail. His influence on others is in the words of the late Rabindranath
Tagore, “ineffable like beauty, like music,” and its claim upon others is “great
because of its revelation of a spontaneous self-giving.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he is himself an incarnation of God, typifying the common man to teach every one

himself with the humblest and who every one may not merely worship and adore,

was a humanist with a passionate devotion to the cause of human welfare,
through freedom from oppression and exploitation, for every individual and
nation, and the progress of the human race. Early in his life, he came under
the influence of Mahatma Gandhi. Fascinated by the inspiring character and
personality, as well as the original ideas and unique principles and technique
of political action of the great man, he plunged into politics, joined the
Congress, and played a prominent part in the national movement for the
political freedom of the country. He remained to the very end an ardent
admirer, a devoted disciple, and a loyal lieutenant of the great leader. But he
was not a blind follower. He had ideas and ideals of his own. He was an
intellectual to whom every powerful movement and great ideal of ancient and
modern times, designed to promote the welfare and happiness of the individual,
justice and harmony in society and, civilisation and progress of the human
race, appealed, at one time or other in his life. He never hesitated to express
and advocate his own opinions whenever he differed from his master, and though
he endeavoured to reconcile himself to the guidance and decision of the leader,
he remained equally loyal and devoted to his own ideas and ideals. He came to
play, in course of time, an increasingly important part in the movement, shared
in the leadership, and in the end snatched the leadership from the willing
hands of a loving master who had declared him his political heir and successor.
When the struggle for Independence came to a close, and the time arrived for
the transfer of power from the foreign ruler, it was Nehru that took over the
Government of the country and carried on the administration for 17 years, for
as long as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Providence spared him to the Nation. Thus it was
his ideas and ideals that have shaped the Constitution and the policies and
plans of development of Independent India. It may be claimed that if Gandhi is
the Father of the Modern Indian Nation, Nehru is the maker of Modern India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was essentially a man of action, though interested in ideas, and interested in
ideas only in so far as they influence action, explain the course of events in
the past, point the way to the proper course of action in the present and
inspire our vision of the future shape of things. He was never original but an
eclectic in his ideas. He did not start with any unique principles of action or
definite philosophy of life but developed gradually, under the stress of events
and the action necessary to meet the situations arising from time to time, a
spiritual outlook and philosophy of life and a scientific attitude and approach
to the problems of life. He evolved for himself a new idealism and cultivated
deliberately an attitude and temper characterised at once by the spiritual
outlook of the traditional culture of the land to which he belonged and the
objective attitude of the scientific age to which he belonged. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

systematic study of the ideas of Nehru, a critical interpretation of them and
an explanation of their bearing upon the character and achievement of the great
man, should be therefore very useful, interesting and instructive. The author
makes a sincere and intelligent attempt in this direction in these pages. We
find in this volume, a fairly clear profile of the character and personality of
Nehru, a fairly just assessment on his achievement and a fairly. convincing
exposition of the guiding principles of his philosophy of life for which we
should feel thankful. The chapters devoted to the ideas of Nehru on ‘The
Machine and Life of man’, ‘The Individuality of Man’ and the ‘Problem of Ends
and Means’ are specially significant as they offer an explanation for the
individual shape and colour of Nehru’s views on socialism and non-alignment and
co-existence.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;

author endeavours to present an objective account of the character and
achievement of Nehru but his obvious admiration for the hero carries him off
his feet, on occasions, and prevents him from pursuing his argument to its
logical conclusion. For instance, he quotes profusely, and apparently with
approval, from the speeches and writings of Sri C. Rajagopalachari, criticising
the views and policies of Nehru, but refrains from expressing any opinion of
his own, or preference, or conclusion whatever. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

many western writers who find impropriety and sensuality in the episodes of <i>Gopika

teach the value and efficacy of total surrender to God and he rightly questions
those western writers in the following lines: “Remember, not only the age of
the child at this time, six or seven years, but that He is the very inner self
of each one of the Gopis, and this not in any solely mystical sense but in
actuality. Where then any impropriety in His actions? Is the deepest secret of
our own heart, then, to be veiled from our own sight?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

spite of the Indian instinct for hero worship, we can hardly claim with any
degree of confidence that justice had been done to the memory of the great
political leaders and social reformers who had spent the best part of their
lives in building the Indian nation on modern foundations. A few good
biographies are no doubt available like R. P. Masani’s <i>Dadabai Naoroji, </i>H.
P. Modi’s <i>Pherozeshah Mehta </i>and P. C. Roy’s C. <i>R. Das. </i>But there
are wide gaps in this line, which have to be filled for the benefit of the
general reader, especially of the younger generation. This task is undertaken
by the Publications Division (of the Government of India), who have so far
brought out a number of handy volumes in the ‘Builders of Modern India’ series,
at a reasonable price, which should prove popular. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
of the recent volumes in this series are devoted to two great men who were
second to none in their intellectual stature or patriotic endeavour. Though
Gokhale was five years younger than Motilal Nehru, he seems more distant now to
us than the latter, partly because he died 15 years earlier, and more so
because he represented an era in Indian politics soon to be superseded by the
age of Gandhi with his revolutionary approach to the struggle for freedom. But
it is worth remembering that Gandhi himself acknowledged Gokhale as his
political guru who was mainly responsible for germinating in him the idea of
‘spiritualising politics’. To both of them political honesty and personal
integrity were not two different things and ends could not be separated from
means. Quite a few parallels could be found in their lives illustrating the
accent on the personal ethics of political conduct. With this difference that
Gokhale, the confirmed liberal that he was, believed in the beneficence of
British political institutions, while for Gandhi the destiny of man was a
problem of greater magnitude than the political link with, Great Britain. Mr.
Deogirikar has done a conscientious job of work and his account is
well-documented and reliable, though it would have been an asset to the book,
if he had given his own integrated assessment of the character and personality
of Gokhale, in addition to a record of the reminiscences of his contemporaries.

in his turn, influenced a host of giants in the political arena, some of whom
seemed to tower above him. His influence on Motilal Nehru was indirect though
powerful enough. It was to C. R. Das that Motilal felt drawn earlier than to
Gandhi and the first two worked close in the Swaraj Party days. The younger
Nehru it was who brought Gandhi into their lives and there was no looking back
after that. B. R. Nanda’s study has a special quality of deep perception and
clear analysis, which have their full play on the portrayal of human character
and the tracing of political current. The present volume is actually an
abridged version of the author’s celebrated work, ‘The Nehrus’. The
father-son-relation is best summed up in the words of the Mahatma who described
Motilal’s greatest quality as ‘Love of his son’. “Was it not love of India?”
the Mahatma was asked. “No”, he replied, “Motilal’s love for India was derived
from his love for Jawaharlal.” But who can say that he loved his country any
the less, because he loved his son the more? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

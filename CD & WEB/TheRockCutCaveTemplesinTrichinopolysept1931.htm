<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trichinopoly is one of the historical centres in Southern India, not only famous for its temples, but also for its rare interest to the student of Archeology.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two cave temples in the Rock-Fort which contain inscriptions of an ancient order. The upper cave temple is situated in the middle of the rock, and the lower one at its foot. People say that these carvings have a Buddhistic air dating back to not later than the 5th or 6th Century A. D. Pallava kings, Simha-Vishnu, Mahendra Varma, and Narasimha claim to have conquered the Cholas by the 7th Century, and it was only during their time that these inscriptions were engraved in these cave temples. During the siege by the British, this chamber was used as a magazine. Mahendra Varma was reigning over Kanchi at the beginning of the 7th Century A.D., and it was he who realised that cave temples would be more enduring and permanent than Pagodas and won the reputation for carving out cave temples. The workmen of Mahendra Varma excavated the sides of hills, leaving portions standing as pillars, carving on the wall statues in bas-relief, or high relief or in the round, and the image for worship.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cave temple (the upper one) is a low hall of unpretentious dimensions and contains some sculpture notable for its excellence. This hall is supported by pillars of special shape which are about 7 feet high and 2 feet square. Further the length of the hall is about 20 cubits, and the width 10 cubits: the hall is 6 cubits in height, which contains shrines in a square room to the east of it facing west. There must have been a phallic emblem inside it. In a niche on each side of the entrance into the shrine, a Dwarapalaka or Door-keeper is carved. There is a fine group of statues at the west of the hall. The central figure is Siva with his four arms having four <I>Rishis </I>knooling about him and two <I>Gandharvas </I>raised about him. The right upper arm holds Ganga issuing from his hair, and the left a rosary. The right lower arm holds a serpent while the left rests on his hips. His right foot having been bent is placed on the head and the left hand of a dwarf, and his left foot stands straight. The two sides of his crown have a deer and a little human figure.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inscriptions carved on the northern wall savour much of literary merit and eulogise the beauties of the Cauvery, of the temple, and of his own glories, the apprehensions of Parvati that Siva might fall in love with the Cauvery, and also state the reason of Parvati's coming over here from her father's house.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lower cave temple, which is at the foot of the rock, is also of the same form as above with various statues and pillars cut out of the rock. Here the hall possesses two side chapels, one in the east with a Vishnu image and supported by 8 pillars. The group statuary have figures of Brahma, Surya, Indra, Siva and Ganesa. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For serenity of pose and expression, it is hard to find a parallel, but it is true that this panel cannot stand comparison with the caves of Elephanta dealing with the same theme though on different conception. The tourist and the student, after having visited these temples, get back with pride and pleasure that the have seen something useful and interesting, particularly a treasure of ancient art which is rare to be met with anywhere in Southern India.</P>

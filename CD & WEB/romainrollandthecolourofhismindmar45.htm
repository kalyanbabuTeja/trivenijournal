style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Romain Rolland was incomparable. Ranging up and
down the ague and vast territory of ideas he encountered cerebral
adventures–the most dangerous of all. The latch was always lifted on the front
door of his ivory tower. As personal as Maurice Barres, with out his egoism, as
subtle as Anatole France, Rolland saw life steadier and broader than all his
contemporaries. He was one who said “vast things simply”. He was profounder
than Shaw, and never exhibited a trace of the dilettante as in Gide or Proust.
He never missed the consoling function of Religion, the poetry of the poor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Rolland art is cerebral comedy par excellence.
He played his intellectual instrument to perfection. He was a portraitist
doubled by a psychologist. His soul was not a solitary pool, but an unruffled
lake–sun-smitten, whose depths have a moving mass of exquisite living things.
His pages reverberate with the under hum of humanity. His swans are not “swans
of the cesspool”, to quote Landor. There is never an odour of leaking gas in
his premises, as Henry James remarked of the D’Annunzio fiction. He had the
cosmopolitan soul. There is no slouch in his spiritual gait. He does not always
dot the “i’s” of his irony, a subrisive irony. But the spiritual antennae which
he puts forth, so tentatively always touch real things, not conjectural. He
peeps into the glowing core of emotion, but seldom describes it. His ears were
for overtones, not the brassy harmonies of the obvious, of truths, flat and
flexible. Better than Turgenev and Huysmans, he rendered surfaces into such
impeccable truth with such implacable ferocity. Fustian and thunder form no
part of his novels as in Flaubert. His women are women, neither neurasthenic,
nor did they out-golf all creation. His handling of love-episodes has not the
blaring brass quality of old-fashioned Italian opera. He never twanged the
strings of sloppy sentiment–like Zola, Balzac and Gautier, which evoke not
music, but mush and moonshine. He was never obscure, never recondite–but he
sent a veritable multiplex of ideas along a single wire. As a psychologist he
stands midway between Stendhal and Turgenev. He interpreted feeling, and also
fact. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>He was not all frosty intellect. But he held in
horror the facile expression of the sentiments. In the large, generous curve of
his temperament there was room for all life, but not for a lean or lush
statement of life. The artist in Rolland banished confusion. De Gourmont has
told us that, because of the diversity of his aptitudes, man is distinguished
from his fellow animals, and the variety in Rolland’s labours is a proof
positive of his superiority to such French critics as the mentally constipated
Brunetiere, the impressionistic Anatole France, the agile Lamaitre, and the
pedantic philistine, Faguet. He wrote of such widely diverging talents as
Gandhi, Goethe, and Michrel Angelo–here his swans remained swans and did not
degenerate into tame geese.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His best fiction is <i>Jean Christophe</i>. It
deals with the adventures of a masculine brain. Ideas are the hero. He could
never have said that woman is the desolation of the just; for his woman was
often an obsession, yet, captain of his instincts, he saw her justly; he was
not subdued by sex. In <i>Summer, Annette and Silvi,</i> and <i>Above the
Battle </i>we touch earth, fleshly and spiritually. Rolland dissociated such
conventional grouping of ideas as Glory, Justice, Decadence. The shining ribs
of disillusion shine through his psychology: a psychology of nuance and
finesse. Not to be put in any philosophical pigeon-hole, he was far more
removed from the verbal jugglery and metaphysical murmuring of Henri Bergson.
The world was his dream; but it was a tangible dream, charged with meaning,
order logic. He pictured the future domain of art as a fair and shining
landscape, no longer a series of little gardens with high walls. The portraits
of certain artists in <i>Musicians of To-day </i>and <i>Musicians of Former
Days </i>recite the history of the critic’s acuteness and clairvoyance. He was
a string that vibrated and sang in response to music–we get in his essays a
distinctly original and very valuable contribution to the world’s tiny musical
literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Rolland’s prose is like the complicated score of
some modern composer, and his art, like music, is a solvent. The sharp savour
of character is omnipresent. His very pauses are eloquent. He evokes. His
harmonic tissue melts into remoter harmonic perspectives. He composed in every
tonality. With few exceptions most modern fiction is thin, papery, artificial,
compared with Rolland’s rich-red-blooded genius.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The loss of R. Rolland was passably chronicled.
Time rights such critical wrongs. Consider the case of Stendhal, Joyce, Proust.
The fiction of R. Rolland is for the future. He was a subtle breath on the
waters of creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This spiritual cosmopolitan, an ardent patriot, a
moral hero–has been viewed askance by the plodding crowd of college professors.
But his erudition could not be challenged. And I have only skimmed the surface
of his accomplishments. R. Rolland is the Admirable Crichton of French letters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Marasimha. Marasimha lost his wife while still young and had developed
indifference to personal happiness. But being a king he had to perform his
duty; he had, therefore, remained as protector of his realm. In order that the
line might not end with him, he decided to take a child of his sister Jabavve
in adoption. Jabavve was then in child and bore this girl some time later. The
king adopted the girl as his child and brought her up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the hands of this ascetic and heroic uncle, Savi
had received a boy’s training. As a young girl, she lived with the foster-father
in his camps and grew up breathing the air of fights and skirmishes. As a girl
of twelve, she went out with young men of the royal clan and proved the equal
and superior of boys of her age, in riding horses, in shooting an arrow, in
slaying a wild beast. Marasimha would fill with pride to think, once that this
niece of his was a later incarnation of Chitrangada of Manipur, again that she
was Durga, slayer of the demon Mahisha, accepting birth in the lineage of the
Gangas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to see her married. There were several suitable young men in the king’s own

she would fight them in single combat and marry the one whom she liked best. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

day, and told them that a young knight had come from a neighbouring province
and wished to joust with them, and asked them to be prepared for the fight.

enemy clans from the north had joined to prosecute their feud with him and had
started to move against his territory. Immediately on receipt of the news, the
king sent messages of warning to the camps guarding the boundary and appointed
commanders to lead the defence units. Loka had come forward to lead the unit
which moved to Bagiyur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Marasimha was the hero of a hundred battles.
Fighting was to him like the breath of his nostril. As one who knew no fear
himself, he knew not what it was to fear for others. A fight brought its
chances and, whatever the issue, the good fighter won. So he had sent many a
youth to battle and never hesitated. He had before this sent even Loka to a
fight or two. But this time, unknown to himself, his heart sank from sending
him to Bagiyur. Marasimha knew at once the reason for this reluctance. Loka was
Savi’s beloved. But it would not be consistent with kingly duty to keep a
soldier back from the front because he was the king’s son-in-law. It certainly
was not the way of the Gangas; and even more definitely not the way of
Marasimha, famed for unshakable courage as the adamantine king. What then was
to be done? Loka having offered to go to the fight, the king could only agree.
By the time that Marasimha came to this conclusion, Savi came up to her father
and begged for permission to accompany her husband when he started for Bagiyur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Like Loka’s going to a fight, Savi’s going with an
army was also no new affair. Yet the king hesitated before acceding to her
request. She would now be going with her husband, and that too when he had to
lead the fight. Might it not affect his conduct? If occasion arose to risk
death in the fight, might not the thought of the beloved wife in the camp
weaken the commander’s resolution? Supposing it did, what should happen to his
troop?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to stay in the camp. I propose to go with him to the fight. You brought me up
as a son; send me out to the fight as you would a son. If we win, we both win.
If we do not, even that to us is, victory. Please send us both, and send us

to Him. If it was open to save her in the fight, and send her back, well and
happy, He would even do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

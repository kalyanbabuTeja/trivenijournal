mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Under the Draft Constitution, India is to be a
(federal) Union of States, and the States which constitute the Units of the
Union are divided into four categories. In the first are included the territories
now known as the Governors’ Provinces–Madras, Bombay, West Bengal, The United
Provinces, Bihar, East Punjab, The Central Provinces and Berar, Assam and
Orissa. In the second are the Chief Commissioners’ Provinces of Delhi,
Ajmer-Merwara and Coorg. In the third are the Indian States like Mysore,
Gwalior, Baroda etc., which have acceded to the Union, and in the fourth are
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. From a constitutional point of view, there is
not much to be said regarding the second and the fourth categories. They form
only a small part of the Union. The Draft Constitution has recognised a
distinction between the States included in the first category and those in the
third. To the latter the principle of self-determination has been conceded and
each State in the category is free to determine for itself what kind of
Constitution it should have in future. And it is because of this principle
that, in States like Travancore and Mysore, Constituent Assemblies are already
at work, framing their Constitutions. States like Madras and Bombay included in
the first category have Constitutions framed for them by the Indian Constituent
Assembly. This distinction is based purely on historical grounds–on the ground
that Indian States like Mysore enjoyed sovereignty in the past and that they
should consequently have the right to frame their future Constitutions, while
the Governors’ Provinces, out of which the States in the first category have
now been formed, possessed no such sovereignty. Though there is some validity
in this historical view, it would have been far better if the Indian
Constituent Assembly had framed Constitutions for the States in the third
category also on some uniform basis. No one has taken objection to
representatives from Indian States on the Indian Constituent Assembly
participating in the discussions for determining the Constitution of the States
in the first category, and there ought to be no objection whatever to members
from Governors’ Provinces taking part in deciding what the Constitution of the
States in the third category should be. But this course was not taken, and the
result is that while the Draft Constitution gives details of the way in which
the States in the first category are to be governed in future, no such details
are forthcoming regarding those in the third category.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Each one of the States in the first
category–Madras, Bombay, etc., will have a Governor at its head. Two
alternative methods are suggested in the Draft Constitution for choosing the
Governor. According to the first method he is to be elected directly by all the
qualified voters in the State. According to the second he is to be appointed by
the President of the Union out of a panel of four candidates to be elected by
the State Legislature. The first method was already recommended by one of the
committees of the Constituent Assembly and agreed to by the Assembly itself.
But it is felt that the co-existence of a Governor elected by the people and a
Prime Minister responsible to the Legislature–and therefore deriving his
authority ultimately from the people themselves–might lead to friction and
consequent weakness in administration; and the Drafting Committee of experts
therefore recommended the alternative method. It is true that in the States of
the United States of America the Governor is elected by the people, but he is
the real Head of the Executive there. Not so is the case in the States here.
Real power will be in the hands of the Council of Ministers presided over by
the Chief Minister. Under these circumstances that alternative method is
certainly preferable. It secures two or three additional advantages. It will be
strictly in harmony with the spirit of federalism as envisaged in the Draft
Constitution–federalism which attempts to maintain an intimate connection
between the Centre and the Units. Moreover, under a parliamentary system, it is
best to have as the nominal Head of the Executive a non-party man. He will be a
better symbol of the unity of the State than an elected person who is bound to
belong to some political party or other. And the appointment of a State
Governor by the Union President is not something that is novel. This is the
method followed in the Dominion of Canada, and it has been working there quite
satisfactorily. For these reasons it is better that the alternative method is
agreed to by the Constituent Assembly with one modification. There is no need
to have a panel of four candidates elected by the State Legislature. The
President may be given a free hand in selecting the person to be appointed
Governor. Any election will introduce a party element into the whole affair.
The objection that the President will thrust on a State a Governor disliked by
the people does not hold good. He will sound the State Cabinet before making
his choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>There is one ambiguity in the Draft Constitution
which has to be cleared. Whether he is elected by the people or appointed by
the President, the Draft lays down that he should be a person not disqualified
for being chosen as a member of the Legislative Assembly of the State, and it
also says that it shall not be necessary for any such person to be a resident
of the State. The object seems to be that even one who does not belong to the
State should be given a chance to become its Governor. But how can this be secured
if he is also to be qualified for being chosen as a member of the State
Assembly? For, we cannot conceive of non-residents becoming qualified for
choice as members. Every State insists on residential qualification for this
purpose. This ambiguity has to be removed and the position clarified. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

removed from office by impeachment, if it is proved that he violated the
Constitution. There is no other charge on which he may be impeached. When he is
to be impeached for a violation of the Constitution, the charge should be
preferred by the Legislative Assembly of the State and disposed of by the
Council of States which is the Second Chamber in the Union Legislature. This is
another example of the attempt made in the Draft Constitution to keep up a connection
between the Centre and the Units. It may be incidentally noted that the same
feature is found in another provision of the Constitution, under which all
doubts and disputes relating to the election of a Governor (if the process of
election is finally agreed to) are to be enquired into and decided, not by the
State High Court but by the Supreme Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

There are the powers, which he should exercise only on the advice of his
Council of Ministers. There are other powers and functions, which he is to
exercise in his discretion, This is a distinction for which there is analogy in
the Dominions of the British Commonwealth, but it seems to be more correct to
infer that it is based much more on the provisions of the Government of India
Act of 1935. It will not be far from the truth if one were to say that the
framers of our Draft Constitution have, over a large part of it, slavishly
copied the provisions of this Act. They not only borrowed the ideas but also adopted
the very wording of the Act. In no other Constitution is found so much of this
slavish imitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

powers to be exercised by the Governor in his discretion. Among these are
included the powers of appointing and dismissing Ministers, the summoning of
the Legislature, the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly, and the powers to
be exercised in cases of grave emergencies. Except the last the others are
powers in the exercise of which every constitutional Head of a parliamentary
State should have some discretion, and there is no reason why in the Draft
Constitution they should have been specially referred to. There is no such
reference to the powers of the Union President, although even in his case the
exercise of discretion is necessary in the appointment and dismissal of
Ministers, etc. These omissions and inclusions require to be further considered
by the Constituent Assembly during the discussions of the Draft Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Except in times of grave emergency the Governor is
expected to be a Constitutional Head of the State like the Crown in England.
During the last ten years debates have been going on in our country as to
whether we should have a parliamentary or non-parliamentary form of Executive or
even prefer the Swiss type of executive government. The Draft Constitution has
finally set at rest all these controversies and has provided for a
parliamentary form of government, under which the Governor will be a nominal
Head of the Executive while the real authority will be in the hands of a
Cabinet with joint responsibility and presided over by the Chief Minister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>There are however two features of the Draft
Constitution which require further consideration in this connection. One is
that some of the provisions for parliamentary government in the States are not
included in the text itself but are relegated to the Instrument of Instructions
forming part of the Fourth Schedule. It is not clear why this course has been
adopted. This has not been done in the case of the Union President in relation
to his Council of Ministers. The Union also is to have a parliamentary form of
Executive. But the next of the Constitution itself defines in Article 62 the
conditions to be observed by the President in appointing the Prime Minister and
the other Ministers. An Instrument of Instructions is not binding on the
Governor in the same way as the Articles of the Constitution, and the
Instrument is also liable to be altered from time to time, although the Draft
Constitution does not say who has the power to alter it. The Instrument of
Instructions calls on the Governor to include in his Council of Ministers
members of important minority communities, while there is no such demand made
of the Union President in his selection of Ministers. Reference to minority
communities is out of place in a Constitution which wants to create a
non-communal, secular State. And insistence on representation of important
communities in the State Cabinets will adversely affect the working of a system
of joint responsibility. All these had a place in the Government of India Act
of 1935, whose purpose was to strengthen the hands of the Governor through a
policy of Divide and Rule. They should disappear in the secular State we are
now bent on establishing. Without considering these matters, the Drafting
Committee has incorporated into the Draft the whole of the Instrument of
Instructions forming part of the Act of 1935. They should have exercised
greater discrimination in determining what to borrow from the Act and what to
avoid. Anyhow there is no reason why the guidance to be given to the State
Governor in choosing his Ministers and in his relations with them, should be
set out in the Instrument of Instructions and not included in the provisions of
the Constitution itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>The other feature which requires
further consideration and clarification is the part that the State Governor has
to play in the conduct of Government business and in legislation. The Chief
Minister is called upon to communicate to the Governor all decisions of the
Council of Minister relating to the administration of affairs and all proposals
for legislation. It is not known why this is necessary when the responsibility
for the good government of the State rests on the Cabinet. It should be left to
the discretion of the Chief Minister what to communicate or not. Another
Article (147-c) lays down that “it shall be the duty of the Chief Minister, if
the Governor so requires, to submit for the consideration of the Council of
Ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by a Minister but which
has not been considered by the Council.” This is possible only on the
assumption that the Governor is informed of every decision taken by individual
Ministers. He should, therefore keep himself in intimate touch with the
administration. It will surely create friction between him, the Chief Minister,
and the Council as a whole. The Council should have perfect discretion to
decide its own rules of business, so long as it is responsible to the
Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Governor of the State is empowered to either
give assent to a Bill passed by the State Legislature, or withhold his assent,
or reserve the Bill for the consideration of the Union President. It is to be
presumed that the power to give or withhold assent is only of a formal
character, as is the case in every State where there is a parliamentary form of
government, and that only such Bills will be reserved for the consideration of
the President as come under Article 231(2)–bills relating to items included in
the Concurrent List. There is however a proviso which says that the Governor of
a State with only one House of Legislature may return the Bill together with a
message requesting the House to reconsider the Bill, or any specific provisions
in it, and recommending to it the consideration of any amendments proposed by
him. Under a parliamentary form of government almost all the Bills passed by
the Legislature will have the support of the Council of Ministers behind it.
And for the State Governor to call on the Legislature to reconsider the Bill is
to ask it to do something in opposition to the views of the Cabinet. Such a
provision will also create unnecessary friction and it is best to delete it.
Article 154 (2), which provides for the Governor sending messages to the State
Legislature is of the same character. All this is consistent with a system of
government like that in the United States (or in India under the Government of
India Act of 1935) where the Executive has no direct contact with the
Legislature, or opportunities of otherwise influencing its policies and
programmes. But it is out of harmony under a parliamentary system of
government. How is the State Legislature to decide if there is a conflict
between the Governor’s messages and views and the policy of the Cabinet of the
day? This complication is mostly due to a desire on the part of the Drafting
Committee that India should have a Constitution which is not either purely
parliamentary or non-parliamentary but which is midway between the two. The
Committee, however, has not explained why such a middle course is necessary or
what faults in the parliamentary system it is expected to correct. These
provisions in the Constitution are sure, however, to create applications and
bring friction in the relations between the Governor and his Cabinet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is Article 188 included in the Constitution for
meeting grave emergencies that has come up for the strongest criticism from
many quarters. If at any time the Governor is satisfied that a grave emergency
has arisen which threatens the peace and tranquillity of the State, and that it
is not possible to carry on government in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution, he may under this Article declare by proclamation that his
functions shall be exercised by him in his discretion and not with the advice
of his Council of Ministers, and he is farther empowered to suspend, in whole
or in part, the operation of any provisions of the Constitution except those
relating to the High Court. All this results in making the Governor the
despotic head of the State as long as his Proclamation is in force. The whole
Article is a word for word repetition of Section 93 of the Government of India
Act of 1935, under which, as is well known, the so-called advisory regimes were
established during the period of the Second World War after the Congress
Ministries resigned office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Before considering the nature of the objections
raised to the inclusion of Article 188, it should be noted that there are
certain conditions attached to the assumption of dictatorial powers by the
Governor. One is that the Proclamation under this Article shall cease to
operate at the expiration of two weeks–which is therefore the maximum period
for the exercise of these dictatorial powers. The second is that the Governor
should forthwith communicate the Proclamation to the President of the Union,
who may thereupon either revoke the Proclamation or take any other appropriate
action in exercise of the emergency powers vested in him under Article 278. The
result therefore is that the Governor ceases to be a dictator, and whatever
extraordinary powers are exercised by him during the period of emergency are
exercised subject to the control of the President, just as under Section 93 of
the Government of India Act the Governor became subject to the Secretary of
State for India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The effect of Article 278 is that in times of
emergency the President of the Union becomes practically the Executive Head of
the State concerned, and the Parliament of the Union becomes the Legislature
for the State. The State thus loses its autonomy for the time being and comes
to be administered directly by the Union Government. The maximum period during
which this centralisation would be in operation is three years. From this it is
clear that the ultimate effect of Article 188 is not the assumption of
dictatorial powers by the Governor, but the assumption by the Centre of
complete control over the State. The Centre, however, that exercises this
control is not an autocratic one. The President of the Union discharges the
executive functions with the advice of the Central Council of Ministers, while
the Parliament which exercises the legislative functions is a body
representative of the people of the Union and of the Units constituting it. The
real objection to article 188 should therefore be, not that it confers
dictatorial powers on the State Governor but that it kills State autonomy and
substitutes Central control for it. Of course it may be argued that the
initiative in the whole matter is taken by the Governor in the exercise of his
discretionary authority, and not by the Council of Ministers who are the real
representatives of the people but this argument ignores the possibility of a
grave emergency arising within a State by ministerial incompetence or
corruption, or Cabinet instability. In such a case the initiative cannot be
left in the hands of the Council of Ministers. It should be in the hands of
someone outside the Council. The President of the Union cannot be empowered to
take the initiative directly and intervene in State affairs, as he will have no
data on which to base his action. Leaving the initiative to the Governor appear
to be the only proper course left. In his communication to the President, he
will give full details of the conditions prevailing in the State necessitating
the proclamation of a state of emergency, and it will then be for the President
to agree or disagree with the Governor. If it is recognised–and every-body has
to recognize it–that grave emergencies are bound to arise, especially because
of the revolutionary times through which the country will have to pass during
the coming decade or two, and that some extra-ordinary steps will have to be
taken to face such emergencies, Article 188 taken along with Article 278
appears to be the most effective way of meeting emergencies consistent with a
democratic system of government. The Centre which will under these Articles
take over the control of the State is a democratic Centre. The so-called
emergency powers of the Governor are not really his powers. They belong to the
Centre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

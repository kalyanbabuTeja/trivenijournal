Communism preached by Lenin in the early twenties caught the imagination of a
section of intellectuals in almost every country in Asia. Communist parties
were formed in Iran, China, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

movements were </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>noticed in Burma, Siam, Malay, Annam and other
parts of Indo-­China, where communism was the vanguard of the national struggle
for freedom against colonial imperialism. It was not, however, till after the
end of the Second World War, that communism became a great force in Asia. The
great victory of the Allies and its aftermath gave Moscow<i> </i>a splendid
opportunity to carry into effect the Communist policy of world domination.
Japan, Russia’s most powerful enemy in Asia, lay prostrate. The Chiang
Kai-sliek regime in China, hopelessly weak and corrupt, was at deadly enmity
with a well-organised Communist Party, already entrenched in power in the
country. In the West Russia’s control was thoroughly established over some
regions in Eastern Europe, “liberated” from the Axis powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this eminently favourable situation was added another very important factor.
The democracies in war-weary Britain and U. S. A. forced their Governments to
disband their army and navy, whereas the dictator in Moscow maintained the Red
Army on a wartime basis. Stalin took full advantage of the situation. The U. S.
A. monopoly in nuclear bomb, which was urged as a powerful argument in favour
of dissolution of the armed forces, also acted as a deterrent to the ardour of
Stalin, at the beginning; but the fear was removed in 1949 when Russia also
found the process of making nuclear bombs. Hencefoth Russia shared with U. S.
A. the unique honour and dread of the rest of the world as the greatest
political power championing, respectively, the Communist and Democratic ideals
in politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Communist East Germany under the control of Moscow) </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
even during this period of failure in the West, Communism began its triumphant
march in the East when it established its complete authority over the whole of
the mainland of China in 1949, aided by Stalin during his wartime negotiations
with U. S. A. and Britain. During the Yalta Conference, early in 1945, Stalin </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>succeeded
in wringing from Roosevelt two valuable concessions, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>namely
restoration of Port Arthur and Southern Sakhalin to Russia, and grant of
certain concessions in Manchuria. In return, Stalin agreed to sign a treaty of
friendship with the Nationalist Government of China and guaranteed the
independence of Korea. All the time Stalin really thought of using his position
in Manchuria to help the cause of Communism in China, and had been planning a
Communist coup to seize authority in Korea. It was settled at the end of the
War that Russia and U. S. A. would accept the surrender of Japanese troops,
respectively, in two areas lying to the north and south of the 38th Parallel of
Latitude which crossed Korea in the middle. But, even before this purely
temporary measure was approved by the President of the U. S. A., a force of
100,000 Russian soldiers arrived in North Korea and an interim government was
set up by 36 Soviet Koreans trained at Moscow in Marxist ideology and Communist
take-over techniques. Then Russia sealed the border between North and South
Korea, divided by the 38th Parallel of Latitude. Electric power was cut off and
the railway communication was cut off between the two parts. The industrial
North and the agricultural South stood face to face, backed up respectively by
the Russian and American troops. In the meantime </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet troops
overran Manchuria and seized its Industrial Plants, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>while
the arms and equipment left behind in Manchuria by the Japanese were allowed by
Russia to fall into the hands of the Communists of China. As Communist China
henceforth became the spearhead of the advance of communism in Asia the course
of events leading to the establishment of Communist regime in China </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>may

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Nationalist Party in China, known as Kuomintang, was founded by Stin Vat Sen on
the basis of the three principles of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nationalism,
democracy, and the people’s livelihood or economic </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>equality.
The party came into power in the wake of the great revolution of 1911. During
his struggle Sun had received considerable </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>help from Russia.
Borodin was sent by Stalin as the adviser of Sun </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and exercised
considerable influence in the organization of the new Government of Kuomintang,
and its military department was orga­nized by a Russian General. Military
stores of all kinds and in great quantity were supplied by Russia, mostly as
free gifts. No wonder the Communists were admitted to the Kuomintang and
gradually dominated its Central Executive Committee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
things began to change after the death of Sun Yat Sen in 1925, when his mantle
fell upon Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-­in-Chief of the Nationalist forces.
He did not like the Communist control but had to<i> </i>put up with it till he
could consolidate the authority of Kuomintang over China with the help of
Russian arms. But as soon as this was practically accomplished, he set up his
Government at Nanking and denounced the Communist leaders, including Borodin,
who were ousted from power. Kuomintang severed diplomatic relations with Russia
(December, 1927) and ordered the closing of Russian consulates and the
expulsion of their staffs. But, in spite of repeated military campaigns, Chiang
could not liquidate the Communist Party by destroying their armed forces. They
had three great leaders, namely, Mao Tse-tung, a Library Assistant in the
National University at Peking, Chou-En-Lei the leadeer of the Paris Group of
Chinese Communists, and Chu The, who belonged to the landlord class and had had
a military career before he was converted to communism in Germany. In 1934
Chiang forced the Communist army to leave Kiangsi and Fukien, the two
provincial strongholds which they maintained for six years against great odds.
But under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung and Chu Teh the army after a long
march of more than a year found a safe retreat in the north-western provinces
of Shansi and Shensi (1934-35). There they set up a parallel government of
their own, became popular by land reforms and other measures benefitting the
peasants which were neglected by Kuomintang dominated by<i> </i>the feudal
aristocrats and capitalists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Civil War between the Kuomintang and the Communists continued, but a temporary
truce was brought about by the Japanese invasion which was resisted,
separately, by both parties. The truce continued from 1937 till the surrender
of the Japanese in 1945. The Communists had been carrying on guerilla warfare
against the Japanese in the north, and at the end of the war were in a position
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

out with renewed fury, and continued till the end of 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek
fled to Formosa or Taiwan (Island) which had an area of 14,000 sq. miles and a
population of over eight million. Chiang was accompanied by what remained of
his party cadre and an army of 6,00,000 troops. On first October, 1949, the

Communists had complete control over the entire mainland of China and were at
first, perhaps not without some justice, regarded as the ‘liberators’ as they
claimed to be. But it was not long before the virus of communism showed its
ugly face. They adopted the threefold domestic programme of consolidating
control, destruction of the old social order, and establishing a new pattern of
thought and life, on the Marxian model, for the vast population of China, which
had evolved a characteristic type of culture and civilization, through a
continuous process for more than three thousand years. The more important items
in the practical application of the programme were–mass propaganda, incitement
of hatred against landlords and businessmen, forcible redistribution of land
with collectivization as the ultimate goal, nationalization of finance and
industry, heavy taxation and punitive levies, building of roads and railways by
forced labour, Five-Year plans with Soviet aid, training of youths and
indoctrination of adults in orthodox Marxist doctrines, etc. Indeed, it will be
no exaggeration to say that there was no sphere of life, private or public,
into which the Communist Govern­ment in China did not intrude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the same time the Chinese Communist Government, as could be expected, formally
declared its definite alignment with Russia. Mao Tse-tung wrote in an article
in July, 1949: “The Chinese people must either incline towards the side of
imperialism or towards that of socialism. It is impossible to sit on the fence.
There is no third road….Internationally we belong to the side of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
anti-imperialist front, headed by the Soviet Union.” It was </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not
long before the Chinese Communists were intoxicated with the ideal of world
dominion, by means of ruthless military campaigns of aggressive character,
which not only conformed to the Soviet ideals but was in complete harmony with
the aggressive imperialism which characterised Chinese foreign policy from very
ancient times, at least as far back as the 3rd century B. C. The Communist
leaders in China had fully imbibed the twofold ideas of aggression and
imperialism long before they seized power in China. On 6th November, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1938,
Mao Tse-tung, Head of the Communist Party in China, in a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>speech
before the Central Committee, said: “Every Communist must grasp the truth.

power, for war settles everything.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Korea, as envisaged in the Yalta Conference in 1945, was not, however,
altogether given up. All negotiations for this purpose having failed on account
of the intrigues and intransigence of Russia, the question was taken up by the
United Nations Organisation (U. N. O.) whose General Assembly resolved to hold
elections throughout Korea in 1948, and appointed a Commission for the purpose.
But Russia refused to allow the Commission to visit the Northern Zone. So
elections were held only in the South resulting in the setting up of the
Republic of Korea with its capital at Seoul and Syngman Rhee, an ultra-right
Nationalist as President. The Communists thereupon set up the People’s

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was not long before North Korea invaded the
South. On 25th June, 1950, 60,000 soldiers of North Korea, protected by 100
Russian-built tanks crossed the border and easily drove away the troops of the
South, who fought “pretty much with their bare hands”. The U. S. A. submitted
the matter before an emergency meeting of the Security Council of the U. N. O.
The upshot was that an army consisting of contingents from different countries
was authorised by the U. N. to help South Korea against the North. General
MacArthur was the Commander of the force fighting under the United Nations
Flag. Only fourteen member-countries of the U. N. contributed contingents or
promised to do so, and so the main brunt of the fight against the Communist
North fell upon U. S. A. She contributed nearly 86 per cent of the naval forces
and more than 93 per cent of the air forces, which sustained casualities,
estimated at about 140,000, including 35,000 dead.</p>

advance of the North Korean troops was checked and they were driven back to the
28th Parallel. The U. N. army, however, advanced beyond the boundary, against
the advice of some members of U. N., including India, captured Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, and reached the Manchurian border. The Communist
Government of China, which had been systematically supporting North Korea’s
aggressive campaign by sending thousands of regular army men in the guise of
Chinese People’s Volunteers” now made loud complaints and communicated through
K. M. Panikkar, the Indian Ambassador to China, that if the U. N. armies
continued to advance towards the Chinese frontier, China would enter the war.

boundary between Korea and Manchuria, and not only forced the 150,000 U. N.
troops and 91,000 Korean civilians to evacuate North Korea, but also advanced
70 miles beyond the 38th Parallel into South Korea. In February, 1951, the
General Assembly of the U. N. condemned Red China as an aggressor and soon
thereafter called for an embargo on­ shipments of strategic materials to the
Communist Government in China. But Russia continued to give aid to China.
General Mac­Arthur was in favour of driving the Chinese and persuading them
across the Yalu to their air-depots in Manchuria, but a number of nations,
including India, were against any such aggressive policy against China. In
April MacArthur was recalled and the war front was stabilized on or about the
38th Parallel. For over two years, from 10th July 1951 negotiations for
armistice were carried on. Negotiations started, were broken off, were resumed
again, and again broken off, and after 575 meetings truce terms were signed on
27th July, 1953. A military demarcation line was established along the final
battle line, a little to the north of the 38th Patallel, and troops and
equipment of each army were to be withdrawn about two kilometers from this
line, leaving a demilitarized zone about two and half miles wide. The war thus
ended in a stalemate, and the Korean position remained where it was before. If
U. S. A. and U. N. powers felt satisfied that China and Communism were
restrained, there is no mistaking the fact that China also had good reason to
feel proud for having scored a victory against world powers, and secured a
Communist buffer on the Korean side of their Manchurian territory. The happiest
was Russia as it played a big role without any cost and made Peking feel the
value of her assistance. The worst sufferers were the Koreans, three of whose
thirty million people were killed. The net result was that the Peking-Moscow
axis was strengthened and Northern Korea became a permanent communist satellite
of China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

very important factor in the Communist China’s expansionist programme was the
permanent residence of four million Chinese in Siam and three million in Malaya
and Singapore. The land-link between them and China lay through Indo-China
which was thus of great strategic importance to China. So China turned her
attention to this region and, thanks to the peculiar political situation
created by the Second World War, has already achieved great success in painting
the banner of Communism almost all over the region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had overrun Indo-China during the Second World War, and after she surrendered
in 1945 it was decided by the Allies, in spite of the opposition of U. S. A. to
hand over to France, the country now called Viet Nam (former Annam), which was
part of the colonial possessions of France in Indo-China. But France did not
find it easy to re-establish her authority after the war. As far back as 1930 a
Communist-cum-Nationalist Party was established in Indo-China which worked
underground for the freedom of the country from the French yoke. During the
Second World War it </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Independence of Vietnam”, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>known as Vietminh (abbreviation of the
indigenous name). Its leader Dr. Ho Chi-minh, who worked from China, was
trained in Moscow, but, though imbibing Communist doctrines, was a great
nationalist, and enjoyed great prestige among the people. Before the arrival of
the French troops to re-occupy Annam, Ho Chi-minh gained control over the whole
of the country, now called Vietnam, and there was a prolonged war between him
and the French troops which lasted for more than seven years and the French
loss amounted to 92,000 dead or missing, 114,000 wounded and 28,000 prisoners.
The surrender of the French forces at Dien Bien Phu on 7th May, 1954,
practically ended the war, and the future of Vietnam was settled at the
Conference of Geneva, in May, 1954, which was attended not only by the Western
Powers but also by the Foreign Minister of Communist China which was the real
power behind Ho Chi-minh. The settlement followed the line adopted in the case
of Korea. The country was partitioned along the 17th Parallel of Latitude. The
northern part became an independent State under Ho Chi-Minh, while the southern
part was virtually ruled by the French in the name of a local puppet Emperor,
Bao Dai, whom the Japanese had set up as such during their rule. It was
provided that the future of the country should be decided by a free election to
be held within two years. This was never done and the French also lost interest
in the country. The U. S. A., however, anxious at the growing influence of
communism in Indo-China, took South Vietnam under its protection. There has
been really no peace between North Vietnam, supported by China, and South
Vietnam dominated by the U. S. A. The tension has been growing and at this very
moment the old cold war has been followed by an undeclared war between North
and South Vietnam which is really a test of strength between China and U. S. A.
Bombing operations from the air on both sides are still going on and earnest
attempts by the world powers to bring about a cease-fire have not yet produced
any result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the tussle between communism in Indo-China represented by China-cum-North
Vietnam on the one side, and Democracy represented by U. S. A. as protector of
South Vietnam on the other, is not confined to Vietnam. It has extended to the
two other old colonial dominions of France, namely Laos and Cambodia. Like
Bao-Dai in Vietnam, the Japanese had set up, during their short rule in
Indo-China, King Sisavong Vong in Laos and King Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia.
When the French returned to Indo-China after the war, these two kings accepted
their authority, as before, but some members of the Government in each country
dis­agreed and carried on guerilla activities for the freedom of their country.
Thus came into existence the Pathet Bao and Khmer Governments, respectively, in
Laos and Cambodia. These were supported by the Vietminh from its base in North
Vietnam as well as China. Here, again, U.S.A. intervened to prevent communism
from getting a hold in this region. The result has been a triangular fight in
Laos between the Left supported by the Communists, the right supported by<i> </i>the
French (and sometimes by U. S. A.) and the Neutral or Centre Party supported by
the U.S.A. The situation has been a very fluid one so far at least as the Right
and Centre parties are concerned, and there have been prolonged negotiations
and fights between the three contending factions. The plan of a coalition
Government has failed, and though the political situation is somewhat obscure,
the Communist influence seems to be growing more and more powerful. The same
reaction seems to have taken place in Cambodia which is now practically a
satellite of China. Both Burma and Thailand had been striving successfully
against the Communists, but though the Thailand Government is now definitely
aligned with the Western Democracies, the attitude of Burma is not so clear,
and signs are not wanting that she is gradually inclining more and more to
Communist China. Thus, with the exception of South Vietnam in the east and
Thailand on the west, Indo-China may be regarded as within the sphere of
influence of Red China. It should be noted that due to the growing differences
between U. S. S. R. and China, Russia has ceased to interfere in the politics
of South-East Asia which is now a preserve of Communist China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the last great outpost of communism in South-East Asia. The Communist Party
in Indonesia is regarded by some as the “strongest Communist Party outside the
Soviet-Chinese orbit”. As far back as 1926 the party tried to seize political
power by force, but the Dutch Government succeeded in suppressing it. A similar
attempt was made in 1948, but was crushed by the Republican Govern­ment under
the leadership of Sukarno and Hatta. Sukarno’s position vis-a-vis the Communist
Party has always been somewhat intriguing. He acknowledged its services during
the struggle for freedom against the Dutch and rewarded it for the same, but
his political manifesto goes definitely against some of the fundamental
principles of commu­nism. In 1945 Sukarno laid down five principles (panchasila)
as the guidelines of the State, and these included belief in God and
nationalism. The Communist Party of Indonesia, however, accepted this
programme, though it is in conflict with orthodox communism, and it is probably
for this reason that the Communist Party was associated with the Government and
regarded by Sukarno as the third pillar to the State, the other two being
nationalism and religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sukarno took good care not to allow the Commu­nists to have effective control
over the Government, and allowed Aidit’s Communist Party, only a negligible
number of secondary departments in his 70 men Cabinet. But since 1963 the
growing tension with Malayasia, backed by U. K., has led Sukarno to incline
more and more towards China with corresponding increase in the strength of the
Communist Party. But the sense of nationalism has proved too strong, and when,
in Oct. last, the Communists for the third time tried to seize power by force,
there was a national reaction represented by the army, and the coup of the
Communists planned with the full knowledge and support of Communist China, has
completely failed and a vigorous campaign against communism is still going on.
Sukarno seems to be sitting on the fence, trying to hold the balance between
irritated China and the anti-Communist National Army. But his position has
proved to be very shaky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

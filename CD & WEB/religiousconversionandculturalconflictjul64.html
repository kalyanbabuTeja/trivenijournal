is a land of various cultures and its fundamental strength lies in the unity
amidst the diversity of her regional cultures. Since independence our attempt
has been to bring about a political and socio-cultural integration of all the
cultural areas into the main stream of the Indian society retaining, at the
same time, the distinctive features of each culture. Accordingly we have
abolished the British policy of ‘exclusion’ of the tribal areas </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>from<i>
</i>the main land and we have been <span class=SpellE>endeavouring</span> to
help the tribals to improve their levels of living and also develop their </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cultures
in accordance with their own genius. While we appear to have been succeeding in
the first <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>, we seem to have largely failed
in the latter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
a long time the tribal cultures have been undergoing considerable change under
the impact of the Hindu culture of the main land. Anthropologists have pointed
out various problems and handicaps which the tribals have been facing as a
consequence of undirected and uncontrolled cultural contacts. Such contacts
were reported to have resulted in some sort <span class=GramE>of</span> a
cultural drift among the tribals and that drift was said to be, more often than
not, against the continuity and ethos of the culture of the tribes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is important to point out that the religion and culture of the tribes are not
much different from<i> </i>the religion and culture of the Hindus as <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> in the villages. At least this is true in the case
of the religion of the tribes in Andhra Pradesh. In fact it is a matter for
further investigation to discover how much of the religion of the villagers in
the plains, who are Dravidians, is derived from the pre-Dravidian–or perhaps
also Dravidian–tribals inhabiting the hilly areas. According to the linguists
the <span class=SpellE>Khonds</span>, the <span class=SpellE>Konda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Doras</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Gadabas</span> of Andhra
Pradesh belong to Proto-<span class=SpellE>Kui</span> division of the central
Dravidian linguistic group. The point, therefore, is that when we apprehend
that the impact of even the plains Hindus is likely to bring about a major
drift and conflict in the cultural ethos and integration of the tribes, is it
desirable to allow the Christian missionaries to propagate their religion which
is fundamentally opposed to the pagan religion? It is true that in a secular
state the government is neutral in its attitude towards the religious practices
and beliefs of its citizens. But purely from the point of view of culture and
its continuity, religious conversion, which is a sort of a directed change,
with a specific motive of bringing about a major deviation in the cultural
values of a society, appears to be far from desirable. It is true that
Christianity has brought about certain desirable changes among the converts,
but it has also brought about a sort of cultural conflict and disintegration in
the social systems of the tribes as a whole. How these processes are at work is
briefly explained below with special reference to the <span class=SpellE>Samanta</span>
tribe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Samanta</span> tribe, popularly known as the <span
class=SpellE>Khonds</span>, is partly agricultural and partly food-gathering.
It inhabits the agency areas of <st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Visakhapatnam</span></st1:City>
and <span class=SpellE>Srikakulam</span> districts of Andhra Pradesh and the
adjacent districts of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Orissa</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
In Andhra, the tribe speaks <span class=SpellE>Kuvi</span> language which
belongs to the Proto-<span class=SpellE>Kui</span> division of the central
Dravidian linguistic group. The <span class=SpellE>Samantas</span> believe in
spirits and re-birth, besides entertaining various superstitions. The <span
class=SpellE>Samanta</span> pantheon consists of various gods and goddesses.
This tribe observes a number of rites of passage. The core of all the rituals
is essentially one and the same. Almost at every rite and ritual a fowl or a
goat or a cow is sacrificed and the blood is spilled on the offerings made to
the spirits with the belief that the spilling of the blood would ensure the
blessings of the spirits. The institution of shamanism or priesthood is also
developed by this tribe. Thus essentially the religion of this tribe is in
conflict with the monotheistic Christian religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Canadian Baptist Mission has been carrying on its <span class=SpellE>proselytising</span>
activities since 1930 among the tribals of the agency areas in the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Visakhapatnam</span></st1:place></st1:City>
and <span class=SpellE>Srikakulam</span> districts. It has also built a church
in <span class=SpellE>Sunkarametta</span>, a road-side village in the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Araku</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. In <span
class=SpellE>Ganguddi</span>, <span class=GramE>a <span class=SpellE>Samanta</span>
village one mile from <span class=SpellE>Sunkarametta</span>, all the families
but two have</span> been converted to Christianity. It is said that the present
<span class=SpellE>Havnta</span> (Village headman) and his brothers were the
first to convert to Christianity, and later others followed them. To any
observer this village gives the impression that the villagers are better off
economically, educationally, and also socially, than the un-converted <span
class=SpellE>Samantas</span> living in other villages. Obviously the credit for
this goes to the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mission</st1:place></st1:City>
which has been constantly educating these people. According to the officials of
the <span class=SpellE>Araku</span> Multi-purpose Block, this is a model
village, which has responded to the developmental activities in all spheres
very <span class=SpellE>favourably</span>. With the influence of the mission
and its activities the influence of the traditional pagan religion has come
down very much. These converts do not <span class=SpellE>practise</span> most
of have the old customs and do not sacrifice any animal to the spirits. These
changes naturally helped the converts to <span class=SpellE>minimise</span>
unproductive expenditure and improve their economic conditions in every
possible manner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

class=GramE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>So far so good.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> But as the converts
are still in a minority and they have to come into contact with the
non-converts for various purposes, some cultural clashes do take place. When a
convert brings a girl in marriage from the non-converts, the former is bound to
pay bride-price, and also observe all the other traditional practices whether
he likes them or not. On the other hand, when it is a problem of giving the
daughter of the convert to a non-convert, the former presses the latter to get
converted to Christianity. A few years ago it so <span class=GramE>happened</span>
that one non-convert <span class=SpellE>Besu</span> was forced to give divorce
to his Christian wife who eloped with him. The divorce actually took place at
the instance of the Pastor on the plea that <span class=SpellE>Besu</span> had
already three wives and it was contrary to Christian principle to marry a man
with more than one wife. <span class=GramE>One more case of cultural conflict.</span>
A few years ago, the daughter of one Joseph, a convert, eloped with a man of a
lower caste. Since Christianity does not object to inter-tribal or inter-caste
marriages, Joseph and other Christians did not oppose the marriage. But the
non-converts belonging to the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> villages
threatened Joseph and his villagers that should they refuse to go through a purification
ceremony and arrange a feast to the tribe as per the traditional customs, the
converts would not thereafter be allowed to maintain marital relations with the
non-converts. For fear of severing relations, Joseph had to agree to outcaste
his daughter, undergo a purification ceremony and treat the tribals to a feast.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from the above said conflicting trends, there is one very important point to
note regarding the mental outlook of the converts. When these were put a few
questions with regard to their past culture, they repeatedly said that the <span
class=SpellE>Samantas</span> in the olden days and the non-converts of today
were barbarous and that the traditional customs of the tribe were a matter of
utter shame for them. By adopting this attitude these converts now disown their
past culture and treat the non-converts as <span class=SpellE>uncivilised</span>.
Therefore the real problem is that, even though it is desirable to abandon
undesirable and harmful practices, is it any way desirable and healthy to
develop among the converts such an attitude as germinates hatred towards one’s
own past culture and one’s own brethren? Because of such an attitude, the
folk-lore, folk-arts and crafts of the tribe, are likely to become extinct in
course of time. Is it not then against our avowed principle of maintaining the
individuality of each culture and developing each group according to its own
genius? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Commenting
on this unfortunate trend, Rev. Dr. A. C. Bouquet, an authority on Comparative
Study of Religions, writes: “Religion of even the crudest kind is an attempt on
man’s part to integrate his life around the Sacred, as he himself conceives it.
It should therefore be treated with respect. Even if he progresses, in course
of time, from a crude to a more spiritual belief or practice, care should be taken
to see that he does not come to feel ashamed of his past...Whatever changes may
inevitably come, these should not be allowed to impoverish his life, or destroy
its art, its music, or any folk-crafts it may possess.” ** <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a recent article on the <span class=SpellE>Todas</span> one writer voiced the
same concern. He writes: “The missionaries have done yeoman’s service as far as
the converts are concerned, in terms of health, education and economic
prosperity<span class=GramE>...(</span>but) the greatest damage that the
missionaries have done from the cultural point of view is that they have split
up that one name ‘The <span class=SpellE>Todas</span>’….Now the converts and
the <span class=SpellE>Todas</span> are two different entities with different
social and economic problems”.*** <o:p></o:p></span></p>

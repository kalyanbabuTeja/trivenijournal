style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
interesting aspect of the modern Indian enlightenment has been the creative
release of the feminine sensibility. Women in modern India have not only shared
the exciting and dangerous burdens of the struggle for independence but also
articulated the national impulse and the consciousness of cultural change in
the realm of letters. In the personality of an individual like Sarojini Naidu,
the temper of Indian womanhood achieved its comprehensive synthesis; she was
not only the lark of the Indian political awakening but also the nightingale of
the Indian imagination. If a plunge of the Indian womanhood into politics had
been almost a common occurrence in the days of the freedom struggle, the
literary enterprise too, held out its fascinating, if not always rewarding,
attractions; in the development of the Indo-Anglian novel, the feminine
sensibility has achieved an imaginative self-sufficiency which merits
recognition in spite of its relatively later manifestation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of the women writers do indeed belong to the “Westernized upper-class” which
naturally limits their social experience to a single stratum. Nayantara Sehgal
is a representative of this kind of writers. Iqbalunnisa Hussain, Mrs. F. Das,
Padmini Sengupta, Santha Rama Rau, and Venu Chitale are some notable women
writers whose novels are as vividly representative as they are variegated. In
this context, however, Kamala Markandaya’s novels, in comparison with those of
her contemporaries among women, seem to be more fully reflective of the
awakened feminine sensibility in modern India, as she attempts to project the
image of the changing traditional society. As such, Markandaya merits a special
notice both by virtue of the variety and complexity of her achievement, and as
representative of a major trend in the history of the Indo-Anglian novel. In
her novels, she not only displays a flair for virtuosity that orders and
patterns her feelings and ideas, resulting in the production of a truly
enjoyable work of art but </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>also more important, she projects the
national image on many levels of aesthetic awareness. Indeed, her novels seem
to be uniquely reflective of the national consciousness in its multiple forms
with the characteristic sensibility of the modern educated Indian woman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

five novels, <i>Nectar in a Sieve, Some Inner Fury, A Silence of Desire,
possession </i>and <i>A Handful of Rice </i>represent <i>in toto </i>the
contemporary ‘zeitgeist’ and the traditional ‘elan vital’ of India. The
purposive direction of her creative sensibility endows her novels with a
certain representative character that marks them out as a significant entity in
Indo-Anglian fiction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
<i>Nectar in a Sieve, </i>Markandaya dramatizes the tragedy of a traditional
Indian village, and a peasant family, assaulted by industrialization. Rukmani
and Nathan, the peasant couple in a south Indian village, are the victims of
the two evils: the zamindari system and the industrial economy. The happy
arcadian atmosphere, and the hearty contentment, that Rukmani feels and enjoys,
soon disappear after the construction of the tannery. All this seems to have
happened in the “twinkling of an eye”. The tannery, symbolic of mechanical
power, destroys the traditional village. Inflation, vice and disease, quickly
disturb the peaceful flow of life in the village. Labour problems and the
drought condition further upset the peasants’ life. Misfortunes are heaped on
the head of Rukmani: one of her sons is killed at the tannery; the crops fail;
another son dies of starvation; and her own daughter, Ira, “prostitutes” in
order to live; but, the final blow is from the zamindar who orders them to
evacuate because they cannot pay the revenue. Rukmani and Nathan go to the town
to seek the help of their son. Unable to find him there, they turn back when
Rukmani’s husband dies of privation and disease. Buffetted both by man and
nature, Rukmani comes back alone to her village to live with her son Selvam,
and her daughter, Ira. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
her impeccable representational realism, and evocative descriptions of the
Indian arcadia, Markandaya achieves a perfect poise between the rural reality
and the disciplined urbanity of art. The real truth of the novel is the
spiritual stamina of Rukmani against such formidable enemies to her culture as
the draconian landlord, and the soulless industry. And, this mother of rural
India lives in her children, Selvam and Ira, who belong to a different age but
who are of the same self. In this superior sentiment of love for the Earth and
Nature <i>Nectar in a Sieve </i>recalls, Pearl S. Buck’s <i>The Good Earth, </i>and
Dennis Gray Stoll’s <i>The Dove found no Rest. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markandaya’s
second novel, <i>Some Inner Fury </i>is thematically more astringent than the
earlier one. The divergence is total: the unsophisticated, uneducated and
uncivilized peasants, with their problems of inldustrialization and
landlordism, give place to the more civilized and anglicized upper-class ladies
and gentlemen, with their issues of political violence and racial feud. The
scene is shifted from rural India to a cosmopolitan city of gaiety and luxury,
hollowness and hypocrisy. In this fictional drama of militant nationalism, the
heroine, Mira, is finally redeemed by the national movement. It results, not in
her tragic end, but in the termination of her attachment to Richard. Political
violence and incendiarism, doubtless, determine the course of events of her
personal life and national history. In her extended recollection of the past,
Mira, the narrator-heroine, suggests the motif of the novel: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
atmosphere of the novel is thus surcharged with national politics wholesomely
subsumed in its artistic framework. The “never-to-be-forgotten year of nineteen
forty-two,” as the impersonal image of militant nationalism, seals the fate of

xenophobia marks the national upsurge which sweeps and swamps everything that

nonchalance and apathy towards the mounting tension in the country. Quite
naturally, the bureaucratic bachanalian propensities could not but lead to a
popular revolutionary reaction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the contemporary consciousness in her third novel, <i>A Silence of Desire, </i>shows
up a new dimension of sensibility in that the fictional focus is on the
psychological adjustment of an urban middle-class family. It is essentially a
“spiritual crisis” for Sarojini, the serene and traditional housewife of the
newly emergent middle-class in the country, when she is asked by her
modernistic husband to give up her faith in what she simply believes to be the
traditional values of life. But, after all, she accepts the scientific spirit
of the age, which is not in conflict with the basic human values, as it merely
attempts to make the humans more happy here and now. Sarojini’s fundamental
spiritual urgency and her moral scrupulosity need not be either sacrificed or
subordinated; but, only her attitude towards the scientific civilization needs
reorientation. Sarojini’s belief in the Swamy’s super-human powers and
spiritual superiority impels her to go to him for the cure of her physical
ailment–a tumour in the womb. After much misunderstanding and an unhappy
silence, Dandekar succeeds in his efforts to shift away the Swamy, as the only
possible solution to make his obdurate wife see reason and regain her health in
a modern hospital. “Faith-healing” is neither an essential part of the national
tradition nor is it efficacious in all cases. Sarojini’s ignorance of the truth
of the matter causes her much psychological tension and even domestic
disharmony. Shorn of this flaw, Sarojini truly represents the traditional
Indian wife, in her concern for the family as well as her religious devotion.
Ultimately Sarojini’s desire to resort to faith-healing is silenced by her
acceptance of the surgical treatment, thanks to the Swamy’s characteristic
detachment, and his helpful departure from the town. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

next novel, <i>possession, </i>is as much a study of the malevolent influence
of a civilized barbarian over the native genius of an artist, as a probe into
an alien onslaught on the autochthonic cultural matrix. It reveals the tragic
consequence, of an unrefined English woman, Lady Caroline, trying to transpose
an unsophisticated Indian artist, Valmiki, a South Indian boy of exceptional
sensitivity into an English atmosphere. Anasuya, the narrator, is the witness of
this drama of the destructive intrusion of a ‘patron’ into the sanctum of the
human heart. The world of Caroline is a “wasteland of spirit” that
depersonalizes the individualistic Valmiki. Her arty eccentricities and her
irrepressible sensuality warp his intellect so seriously that he soon
degenerates into a Bohemian of continental dimensions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as Caroline calls him, is accidentally discovered by her with the help of her
Indian friend, Anasuya. She perceives, with an uncanny insight, the rich
potentialities of Valmiki as an artist. Paying a costly compensation to his
parents, she whisks him off to England, but not before Val takes the blessings
of his guru, the cave-dwelling Swamy outside the village. The Swamy,
representing the venerable ascetic order of traditional India, is quite
confident of Val’s spiritual allegiance to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the beginning, Lady Caroline is aware of the Swamy’s invisible influence on
Valmiki; and, in her eagerness to possess the boy outright, she oversteps the
bounds of matriarchal patronage, by seducing him into an almost incestuous
carnal alignment, despite the disparity in their ages and the difference of
race. Motivated by the sheerest self-interest, she grooms him into a <i>smarmy
smartaleck; </i>doubtless, she can justly claim to have “civilized” a village
idiot, a mere goatherd, but her civilization is fundamentally apocryphal. Her
sagging sense of values dehumanises the personality of Valmiki, no less than
her “terrible, over-powering craving for possession”, which finally kills the
artist in him. The commercial vulgarization of his art under the tutelage of
this “white narcissus” cannot possibly be called an aesthetic achievement. The
maniac exultation of Caroline, over Val’s success in America and Europe, merely
betrays her neurotic possessiveness and Val’s self-delusion. Val’s sybaritic
existence is observed by Anasuya: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

glitter-dust seemed to fall agreeably on Valmiki. Assiduously attended by slim

Anasuya, the confidential friend of both Caroline and Val, attributes his<i> </i>success
to his general handsomeness and the prevailing fashion for things Indian. As
part of Caroline’s curious bric-a-brac Val quickly fades into a pleasure-loving
idler. Val’s sensitivity is ruptured when Caroline forces his separation from
Ellie, whom he loves truly, and whose heart-rending sufferings he shares with
an uncommon empathy. She reminds him of her own mother: for, both meekly accept
the Karmic finality of the pain and sorrow of the world as the inevitable
nature of existence. But Caroline’s possessive officiousness, and cauterized
sensibility, debar him from visiting even his mother. After Ellie’s departure,
Annabel is the new rival to Caroline, menacing her possessive control over Val.
Disgusted with the meddlesome frump that Caroline is, with all her “alabastine
beauty”, Val is easily attracted towards Annabel. But soon Caroline succeeds in
forcing him back, only to lose him forever. The cloudy conscience of Caroline
suspects the worst, and finally realizes the end of her possessive charm over
him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and potential of an artist but ends up as “an unexpected failure” when he
becomes a slave to passion. His patron Rowland is intellectually refined,
without the conscience of an artist. With his vicarious pleasure in the success
of Roderick, he is a pathetic meddler; and his condemnation of Roderick has a
heartless egoist results in the artist’s suicide. But unlike the Jamesian hero,
Valmiki is redeemed by the moral and spiritual consciousness of the traditional
cultural <i>pater familias, </i>the Swamy, who welcomes Valmiki into “the
service of God.” The Indian tradition regards all the possessions of man as
divine gift, or <i>prasad, </i>which can be conscientiously used, and even
rededicated to the Lord. And Swamy himself is not a misfit, edged out by
society, but a holy man in quest of the Ultimate Reality, the <i>Satchidananda </i>(Truth-Consciousness-Bliss).
He is indubitably, as Caroline instinctively feared, the most formidable rival
to her, not in possessing the mind and heart of Valmiki, but in releasing and
uplifting him into a unique state of spiritual ecstasy. The wide Indian
wilderness, where the Swamy dwells, is the natural atelier of a natural artist
like Valmiki, who at last attains the maturity and strength to reject Caroline,
the lady without conscience. The Swamy affirms that Valmiki works for a “divine
spirit.” The dispossession of Valmiki is now total. The clash of wills, and the
cleavage of the continental cultures, result not in human destruction, but in a
recognition of the necessity of cultural co-existence and spiritual liberty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

must not be taken as a representative Western woman. It<b> </b>is interesting
to note that the English Caroline in <i>possession </i>is so unlike the French
Madeline in Raja Rao’s <i>The Serpent and the Rope. </i>Madeline is so advanced
and refined in her cultural make-up that she never tries to possess Rama, but
helps him in his spiritual quest, even as he guides her to the Buddhistic
“Eight-fold Path.” Caroline and Madeline thus offer a study in contrast of the
same European cultural consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

latest novel, <i>A Handful of Rice, </i>is fundamentally a novel of moral
refinement. It is a convincing artistic affirmation of the well-known dictum:
“Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.” The protagonist of the
novel is Ravi, a juvenile delinquent, thrown out by the unequal and indifferent
social system into a gang of social miscreants. He tries to rob a family, but
is generously given a chance, by the family, to improve himself; for, the head
of the family realizes that reformation is more profound and permanent, not by
incrimination but by tolerance and kind treatment. Ravi hangs about the house;
the father of the family, initially wronged by Ravi, recognizes finally that he
is nlot-irredeemable, and sympathetically accepts and admits him into the
family-fold. Ravi marries the younger daughter of the family by virtue of his
own moral re-armament and resultant strength. It is, in fact, this self-same
quality–the moral consciousness–that sustains him when he falls on evil days,
reeking with squalor, misery, wretchedness and drabness. Conscientious as he
is, he refrains from violence even when he is desperate; and an unyielding
optimist that he is, he lives on hope. With characteristic candour, Markandaya
sets the tone of the novel as “the constant nibbling desire to have a second
helping of food, a cup of coffee every morning, a shirt without holes and a
shawl to keep oneself warm.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
Markandaya’s literary sensibility projects itself in her novels as an acute, if
unresolved, perception of the different and distinct forms of national
consciousness, which propel the individual’s progress in the modern world. It
is possible to trace out in her novels an intelligible pattern of ideas, that
reveals her aesthetic assimilation of a long-established tradition under the
disturbing impact of modernity. The five predominant and cardinal ideas that
pervade her fictional translation of the national tradition are, broadly
speaking, “social” as evident in <i>Nectar in a Sieve, </i>“political” as can
be seen in <i>Some Inner Fury, </i>“spiritual, or more strictly, religious” as
embodied in <i>A Silence of Desire, </i>“cultural” as presented in <i>possession
</i>and finally, “moral or ethical” as embedded in <i>A Handful of Rice. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

fine, Kamala Markandaya’s fictional achievement lies in her being a steady
traditionalist, while transmuting the different phases of national experience
into significant works of art. Her intellectuality and sophistication do not
wean her away from the national tradition. Understandably, therefore,
traditional life forms the substructure or all her novels, so far. The national
image that is projected in her work is neither effete nor effeminate, but is
quick with life and is full of life’s resilience. The fact that none of the
protagonists in her novels runs away from the hard realities of life, by
choosing death as the final solution, is a vindication of the traditional
values of Indian culture, namely, acceptance, tolerance </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Poetry
has been as much primitive to man, as belief has been instinctive. In the
absence of revealed religion, men invented their own rituals to satisfy their
instinctive urge to sing and worship. Those were the days when poetry was
identified with ritualistic songs sung on the altars. But as time rolled on,
men became slaves to one another; they soon discovered that their human gods
were far more powerful than their wooden gods and naturally they dedicated
poems to them. How much their personal belief was behind those works of art, it
is difficult to <span class=GramE>say.</span> Nevertheless, Shah <span
class=SpellE>Namah</span> remains to be one of the masterpieces of world
literature, in spite of the fact that <span class=SpellE>Firdausi</span> wrote
it under the above circumstances. Dryden, who is revalued and regarded as one
of the greatest poets by some of the greatest critics of our age, was so
volatile with regard to his belief that it is difficult to ascertain whether
religious belief had any importance for him at all. That happens when poets become
professional time-servers. But ‘yes-men’ like Dryden are rare in the world of
fine arts. That is never the character of any artist. Poverty had been ever
their lot, but seldom <span class=GramE>they had</span> left off their ideals
in which they believed for the sake of worldly comforts. But as in our own days
painters are employed for small sums to do petty works in the absence of works
leading them to their ideals satisfying to their souls, so also poets were
employed in the past and were told precisely what to tell. Yea the greatest of
such artists were such that they kept their own in spite of the odds, and even
to some extent made their own religion out of the religion they were born with.
Such poets had a prophetic vision. Perhaps, each one of us believes in a
religion from <span class=GramE>his own</span> individual standpoint. But in
spite of our individualism about us, we are much the same as our other
co-religionists, partly because we never bother and partly because we are
afraid of some trouble. But a poet like <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City>
who believes in a religion and keeps that belief over and above everything
else, is at once prophetic. He begins to scratch the bundle open with his
scrutinizing vision. And so he rose very much above his milieu by dint of sheer
hard-won greatness. His faiths and beliefs have long been discussed with a view
to <span class=SpellE>categorising</span> him into one or the other sect. Till
about forty years ago, he was regarded generally as a rather narrow and
thorough-going Protestant with a leaning towards the Old Testament interpreted
“fundamentally”. Then the Americans showed how much he had in common with the
Classical and Stoical doctrines of the Renaissance, while Prof. <span
class=SpellE>Liljegren</span> carried the notion to an extreme by painting him
a second Machiavelli. But Denis <span class=SpellE>Saurat</span> came out with
his fascinating plea for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City>
as a daring and orthodox thinker. As regards his Puritanism, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Raleigh</st1:place></st1:City> says: “His guiding star was not
Christianity, but that severe self-<span class=SpellE>centred</span> ideal of
life and character which is called Puritanism.” But it was again <span
class=SpellE>Grierson</span> who pointed out that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> main doctrines expressed in the Paradise Lost are those
of Evangelical Protestantism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
short, one is almost bewildered and is at a loss to find a clear path into his
theology, and one cannot go further than say: “It is <span class=SpellE>Milton’s</span>
Paradise Lost, lost by <span class=SpellE>Milton’s</span> Adam and Eve, who are
tempted by <span class=SpellE>Milton’s</span> Satan and punished by <span
class=SpellE>Milton’s</span> God”; or in the words of Coleridge, “John Milton
is himself in every line of Paradise Lost.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
the question <span class=GramE>is,</span> what is John Milton? John Milton is
certainly not John Dryden, who would change his faith to suit the times. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City> in that case was a
rock, whereas Dryden was a straw in the current. But the rock inevitably
suffers for being a rock than the straws. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Milton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span class=SpellE>’s</span>
sufferings in his own time were of a different kind. At least his own people
were sporting enough to allow him the greatness which he well-deserved, though
they allowed it with a vengeance. He enjoyed his partial greatness till very
late. Even Hopkins who called him a ‘Bad man’ admitted that “His achievements
are quite beyond any other English poets, perhaps any other modern poets.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
the wor1d of critics did not remain the same. The so-called civilisation of
ours brings more and more hypocrisy. <st1:City w:st="on">Hopkins</st1:City> was
frank enough to call Milton a bad man because <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Milton</st1:City></st1:place> was not a Catholic, but acknowledged
his greatness as a poet. But now there are critics who regard poetry first and
foremost, <span class=GramE>a poetry</span> of belief. But when they would not
tolerate <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> belief, they would discreetly find fault with his art.
That, <span class=SpellE>Milton’s</span> sensuousness was withered by
book-learning, his language is artificial and conventional, in fact he writes
English like a dead language; that, all in him is sacrificed to a musical
effect, with the occasional debasement of poetry into a solemn game–are a few
of the charges that have been <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> against
Milton. When the London Bridge was falling down, it was necessary that not only
the crowds flowing over it should fall, but that the old graves should be dug
out and the significant corpses brought out and depreciated so as to suit the
modern stature, which has been significantly small due to the increase of
population with a stunted mentality. We get such a glimpse in the statement of
Prof. Hutchinson: “The main obstacle to the full appreciation of Paradise <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Lost<i> </i></span>by the reader today is
the absolute and unattractive nature of much of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> theology. The <span class=SpellE>Aenied</span> does not
suffer seriously from our not accepting Virgil’s traditional Mythology. It is a
little more difficult when <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Milton</st1:place></st1:City>
presents his own strongly Puritan and individual interpretation of a Christian
tradition which still maintains a hold upon many of his readers.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
there lies the fault–not in the work of art itself but in the belief of the
writer, as though we were great believers ourselves! It is not faith that is at
the bottom of the modern criticism of Paradise Lost; it is the lack of faith.
For a man of faith <span class=SpellE>recognises</span> another man of faith
wherever he is and however contrary his views be. It is only a faithless man
that does not appreciate any man of faith. The traditional mythology of the <span
class=SpellE>Aenied</span> does not disturb us because we go to the <span
class=SpellE>Aenied</span> as though we go to the zoo, for going to the zoo is
part of our fashionable context. But going to <st1:City w:st="on">Milton</st1:City>
is like going to the Church, and those who never go to their own Churches would
hardly like the idea of going to any other Church–much less <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> Church. The ultra-modern method would be to find fault
with his art. In short, it means that all the readers of poetry today are now
guided by the world of fashions; and the world of fashions is the world of
depraved morality. “Belief in such an age of <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>
is a matter of self-conscious operations.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
poetry which once started with <span class=GramE>rituals,</span> has now to
face the problems of supply and demand. “The contemporary poet, who is not
merely a composer of graceful verses, is forced to ask himself such question as
‘what is poetry for?’ not merely “What am I to say? <span class=GramE>but</span>
rather how and whom to say?” And since these questions are raised by the greatest
poet-critic of our age, they carry the maximum seriousness. But nevertheless, this
is a new problem that once upon a time was only placed before the political
orator. The poets never had to pose and act to put on appearances like the
public speaker. Even the <span class=SpellE>Metaphysi­cals</span> whose <span
class=GramE>belief to them were</span> an ordering of experience, never faced
such a problem. The Romantics were so individualistic that they hardly were
conscious of this problem. It was as though, with the decline of the
traditional belief, men were making a religion from the spirituality of their own
experience under the protection of Nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
Romanticism was not merely a revolution against the old set of beliefs. It was
the revolution of each against all. Each poet valued his own experiences to a
degree, which it is difficult to parallel in the earlier poets. Like the Pre-<span
class=SpellE>Raphalites</span> they were also unequally uniform. Undoubtedly
the “Renaissance of wonder” like the “Revival of the Past”, had its naive and
spontaneous as well as its conscious and speculative interpreters; it had its
Blake and its Byron besides its Coleridge, as the other had its Scott and its <span
class=SpellE>Landor</span> besides its <span class=SpellE>Schelling</span>. But
in the poetry of all of them life had been seen through a new perspective and
was a unique vision. Such a diversified glamour could never care a bit, who
they were writing for or whether their poetry had any use at all. Mathew Arnold
who was the dying product of this age, pointed out that poetry is not religion,
but a capital substitute for religion. And Mr. T. S. Eliot, in his usual manner
observes: “Not invalid port, which may lend itself to hypocrisy, but coffee
without caffeine and tea without <span class=SpellE>tanin</span>.” That<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>is how he came across the formation of
poetic faith in the criticism of Coleridge, and that is why he could afford to
define ‘belief’ negatively as the ‘willing suspension of disbelief.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=GramE>Wordsworth</span> whose mysticism was similar to that of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vaughan</st1:place></st1:City>, was
pre-eminently a Nature-mystic. He was at one with Plato when he said that “All
knowledge is recollection,” and too, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vaughan</st1:place></st1:City>’s
“Retreat” can be seen containing the more or less similar ideas, that we get in
the Immortality Ode. But while Plato discarded the senses, because they deceive
us, Wordsworth clings to them as being the only source of experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
mysticism which is the most salient feature of <span class=SpellE>Wordsworthian</span>
<span class=GramE>poetry,</span> is primarily based on sensuousness. He was
tragic, but he was not pessimistic. And this was because he had his faith that every
flower “enjoys the air it breathes”. He has been appreciated from different
points of views. From the first, he is regarded as the poet of a peculiar
mystic ideal who disclosed in the “rapt communion with Nature and undreamed of
access into the life of things” (<span class=SpellE>Myres</span>). To the
second and larger group represented by <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arnold</st1:place></st1:City>,
Wordsworth’s interest <span class=GramE>lies</span> not in his mystic idealism,
but in his subtle fidelity the ‘bare sheet penetrating power’ of his
description of Nature. The third one too exclusively values those elements in
poetry which are least allied to realism–the imaginative dreams of old times: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–lines laden with the spirit of romance, stand
out for them like isolated points of fire. Both Mr. <span class=SpellE>Swinburn</span>
and Mr. Watts have given unmeasured praise for such passages. Yet, over and
above everything, Lord <span class=SpellE>Russel</span> writes of Wordsworth: “In
his youth he <span class=SpellE>sympathised</span> with the French Revolution,
went to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
wrote good poetry, and had a natural daughter. At this period he was ‘bad man’.
Then he became ‘good’, abandoned his daughter, adopted correct principles, and
wrote bad poetry. “But this kind of analysis will lead us nowhere. Some of the
greatest of poets had rather ugly private lives (though there are quite a few
exceptions). Man could seldom act up to his beliefs and ideals. Nevertheless,
he could write about them. The poet is not necessarily a moral being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <span class=GramE>most strange</span> blend of the republican and the
artist. They turned their eyes to ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
and medieval <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

class=GramE>Shelley</span> who was always on the extremes, was altogether on
the side of existence. He believed that every cloud and sheaf of grass shared
his strict republican orthodoxy. He represented in short, a revolt of the
normal against the abnormal; he found himself, so to say, in the heart of a
wholly <span class=SpellE>topsy-turvied</span> and blasphemous world in which <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>God<i> </i></span>revolted against Satan.
This was the belief; worked up the extent of hallucinations, that was at the
root of <span class=GramE>his such</span> intense loves and hates. To him again
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was also the first historic land of freedom, “the motherland of the free, <span
class=GramE>the</span> fatherland of the exiles.” “I will teach <span
class=SpellE>thine</span> infant tongue,” wrote Shelley in 1817 to call upon
those heroes <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of<i> </i></span>old in their
language.” And Shelley to whom all medieval mythology presented itself only as
a “superstition” found in the myths of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> a world in which his
imagination could range and his profound religious instincts body itself,
secure from the <span class=SpellE>paralysing</span> virus of theological
strife. In Shelley and in Byron Hellenism was thus sharply opposed to the
medievalism of the earlier Romantics of Coleridge, of Scotts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

where was the need for religious beliefs? All the intensity of their personal
belief was transferred from religions to their art and experience, quite
irrespective of the fact whether they had a public demand or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

down to the Victorian era, we find that men have a tendency to recapitulate the
values. The laxity of morals of George IV and his courtiers had its reactions
over the puritan public, and under the reign of the sober Queen they meant to
settle down with quietude. So Carlyle set up the conventional moral standards.
Science, on the other hand, which proved <span class=GramE>rival</span> since
the 16th century of religion and art, now provided the very type of morality
that was essentially Counter-Romantic. <span class=GramE>Tennyson</span> who is
the most representative poet of this age, is caught in the tangle of this
conflict between science and religion and science and arts. On the one hand his
Lotus-eaters preach for a life of ease and comfort in the Lotus land and mean
to escape this world; on the other Ulysses forever sings, “To follow knowledge like
a sinking star.” Yet, both this attitudes are important and true so far as they
give us the truth about the age. The philosophy of the Lotus-eaters is as true
as the philosophy of the life of Ulysses. The Lotus-eaters have <span
class=SpellE>realised</span> that toil as they would, strive as they will,
there was still the chance of going down and be destroyed. So, what was the use
of rushing at things? Let them lead an easy-going life similar to that of the
flowers–and be dead at last. Moreover, the gods in heaven are not a bit kind
towards the earthlings. They mock at their failures and laugh at their
sufferings. And death often enough puts an abrupt end to the busy stir of life;
to the high hopes and mighty dreams. <span class=GramE>And if ever those dreams
were fulfilled, how long could they exist?</span> There is nothing which is
lasting. The evils of life are innumerable. They cannot be purged away all at
once. So, there is confusion in full tide and there is no help. They have long
been tossed and toyed about, and now perhaps put aside and forgotten. They have
lived so long in the heat and toil that their senses have grown <span
class=GramE>numb,</span> their souls have grown quite dull. And so, now they
choose to remain here, in the land of beauty and of dreams, forever and beyond
recall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this is hopeless philosophy–a philosophy of escapism, a negative philosophy of
life. And yet, now and then, even the most matter-of-fact person could not help
thinking of the unprofitable stir, the fret of the world as appalling and
craves in his dream of dreams for a world, far away from the hurry, worry and
frequent flurry of the world. And the more the man is sensitive, the more the
weight hangs heavy upon him. And so it was in case of Tennyson. He was “The”
Victorian poet, or else he was coupled with Browning in this had eminence. And
that age, in spite of its good qualities, had also had its daring sins; and
Tennyson was fated to be the most formidable exponent of his age. The balance
between science and religion was ever rapidly moving. Every belief was in a
fluid state. And so, poor Tennyson could not be one man. He was to be many in
one, because “he was one of the most sensitive points of his age.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it was not an age of belief; it was not an age of disbelief; it was an age of
doubt and despair and timidity, which resulted in the dwindling of the artist’s
personality. For confidence is ‘the alpha and omega’ of fine arts. The novelist
of this age, however, reflects the pessimistic atheism of the times, while <st1:City

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Coming
back to the modern times, we find that this problem of the relation between
literature and belief has obsessed critics and creative artists. Mr. D. J. <span
class=SpellE>Enright</span> observes: “In 1920 the first concern with such
problems showed itself. <span class=GramE>First writer’s belief and his
sincerity, between the man who believed something old and the mind which
created something new.</span> That is how the “modern poets” tried to
dissociate themselves from the self-conscious <span class=SpellE>moralis­ing</span>
of certain Victorians and from the romantic conception of the poets as an
inspired bard delivering himself of divine truths, orthodox or otherwise. “There
are a handful of poets who try to reassert the necessity of belief, by writing
poems which affect “a complete <span class=SpellE>severence</span> between
poetry and all beliefs.” This is a kind of negative capability that Mr. Eliot
has, and in this age of publicity and propa­ganda, this method has its original
points. But, there again it is art and not belief which attracts readers. And
it is the very slow and imperceptible conversion of the reader that is
remarkable. This was necessary in an age of complication and complexity. Fr.
Martin <span class=SpellE>Jarret</span> Kerr says: “The loss of single
religious tradition has meant that the metaphysical and religious implications of
literature became more marked (in this age) than in the age when the metaphysic
or religion could be taken for granted and so leave the writer to get on with
his job.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
modern man is never driven unless by necessity. That is what George Santayana
seemed to believe. “If any similar adequacy (to Dante) is attained again by any
poet, it will not be presumably, but a poet of the Supernatural. For when man’s
attention is forcibly directed to competition between skepticism and belief, then
the recovery, or in most cases even the retention of a belief, becomes a
self-conscious operation.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
the question is, how much of art can be created by self-­consciousness. It is
true that we may not be able to overlook Dante’s theological beliefs while
appreciating his great poetry, as much as we would not be able to overlook <span
class=SpellE>Keat’s</span> poetic beliefs while <span class=SpellE>analysing</span>
his poems, but will it be reasonable to bring along our own theological beliefs
while appreciating a work of art. But Mr. T. S. Eliot candidly remarks that, “I
cannot, in practice, wholly separate my poetic appreciation from my personal
beliefs...” But Fr. Jarrett Kerr is pretty clear and concise in his views: “Actually
one probably has more pleasure in the poetry when one shares the belief of the
poet. On the other hand there is a distinct pleasure in enjoying poetry when
one does not share the beliefs.” Trying to save Mr. Eliot to some extent, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Enright</span> says, Mr. Eliot cannot say the same things with
conviction now; he has been occupied with “belief” not to the point of admiring
bad writers simply because they express opinions with which he agrees but at
least to the extent of tolerating bad writers, who throw dirt on opinions with
which he does not agree. And possibly to the extent of doing injustice to
writers whose views must inevitably strike him as heretical. He has come to
regard Christian belief more important than literature.” Not Christian belief
as such, but Christian belief was depicted by Roman Catholicism. But if
appreciation of poetry is made dependent on individual beliefs, it would become
sectarian and communal, and literature which has enjoyed <span class=GramE>a
universality</span> would be lost. The world of poetry starting from Omar <span
class=SpellE>Khayam</span> to Whitman including Tagore and Goethe and <span
class=SpellE>Iqbal</span> would be lost to divergent groups engaged in
theological strife, if personal beliefs were to <span class=SpellE>colour</span>
poetic appreciation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yet,
much of modern criticism is based on the writer’s views rather than his poetic
abilities. While Shelley was brought down by Mr. Eliot for his views, the
Communists raised him up because of his republicanism. <span class=GramE>So
that, poetry becomes the centre of politics.</span> Dr. <span class=SpellE>Leavis</span>,
the protagonist of a purist literary criticism, also describes himself as a
moralist; and much of his adverse criticism of writers past and present
includes an ethical judgment upon their response to life as a whole. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
coming back to the point, how the dissociation of the writers and readers have
occurred in the modern age due to the faith of the one and the faithlessness of
the other, we are bound to consider the method of the former to convert the
latter. Earlier I have regarded it as a unique method of publicity–“This
complete severance of poetry and all beliefs”–acts as the <span class=SpellE><i>Similia</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>similibus</span> <span class=SpellE>curantur</span>. </i>But
it had also its disadvantages. The new poets have imposed themselves by accident,
mixed with cleverness, on a small and gullible public. The modern poem does
appear cold and deliberate and self-conscious. For a long time the English
public that reads poetry had been small; but it has lately become gullible. And
the poets have been moving farther and farther from the ordinary readers. At
the end of the war the gulf was widened by the theory and practice of Mr. T. S.
Eliot. The poets no longer tried to be comprehensible, and the readers no
longer expected to understand. Thus the public for English poetry became
gullible. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Enright</span> points out this in his
Apothecary’s Shop, “And today, among the new poets, this notion that poems can
be skillfully constructed around an intellectual whimsy is still responsible
for a good deal of clever meaninglessness.” Consequently, the reader now
approaches the poem in a spirit of extraordinary meekness. He is prepared for
anything, he will swallow anything; he will not complain, he will not ask
questions. He is content to suppose that the queerer it sounds, the better it
is. The public has been bamboozled into accepting his maunderings. This is an
attitude which does seem <span class=GramE>to</span> many as highly
objectionable, arrogant, immature and <span class=SpellE>uncivillised</span>.
The poets seemed to be really refusing from arrogance or melancholy or sloth to
act in a civilized way. This is deplorable and unprecedented. Hitherto, when
the reader did not understand, he blamed the poet. But this present attitude is
worse; he admires or affects to admire what he does not understand. Under the
circumstances, the belief of the poet hardly comes to light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
as I have said before, this is the manner the poets have imposed upon
themselves in order to work up the conversion. Now, one can only tell ones
commodities not by saying that what it is, but by saying what it is not. In T.
S. Eliot there is not a single reference to church or temple or anything
religious, but to gardens and clubs and cheep toilets and yet invariably they
ultimately lead <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>you<i> </i></span>to
the Church. Yet, in a manner you can not have time to find fault with the poet’s
views–to <span class=SpellE>criticise</span> him in the usual manner of
criticism, for you do not get <span class=GramE>a prescience</span> as you got
hitherto. This is the punishment of the age-old critics for annihilating Keats
before his time. The wonderful achievement of modern poetry is the creation of
the excitement among the unbelievers <i>en masse </i>in spite of its own
belief. Then the readers exert themselves to find out the references–they go to
the Bible, the Gita, <span class=GramE>the</span> Upanishads to <span
class=SpellE>Bandol</span> as well as to Dante.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is rather a slow process of conversion, but it is nevertheless, a very sure
process. Naturally in this period of transition the poets have allowed
themselves to be estranged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

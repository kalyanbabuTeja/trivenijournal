mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Every living nation has a national system of
education based on a philosophy which it has accepted. There is perhaps no
domain of national activity so dependent on a clear-cut philosophy as the
education of the young. Is the mind of the child a clean slate on which
impressions have to be made in future, or is it already full of impressions
which determine its future activity and education? Is religion to be taught in
schools? Are children to be assumed to be scientific materialists for the
future of India? These are some of the questions that have to be answered
before anything like planned national effort in educational reconstruction
could be thought of. Schools which consider themselves ‘national’ have to come
to some sort of understanding in these matters. Then alone could we expect
concerted action to develop. At present the energy of national enthusiasts
seems to spend itself in the wearing of national dress and the shouting of
slogans. At best, it might reach out to the admiration of national heroes or go
one step further to accepting in a lukewarm way such items of the national
programme as the abolition of untouchability. It is deplorable, however, that no
serious or patient and painstaking effort is in evidence which would help us to
have a theory of education suited to our national genius.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is true that there are some who have devoted
some attention to this matter. It was Sister Nivedita, under the inspiration of
Swami Vivekananda, who attempted early to formulate the aims of national
education. Then came that patriot, Lala Lajpat Rai. Since the time of these
early writers and thinkers literature on the subject, it is true, has grown,
some inspired by spiritual considerations, others by requirements of the State.
Educational philosophy, as such, however, has not so far received the attention
it ought to have received. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>With the younger generation of the vocalized urban
public in India Russia has become a word to swear by. Youth is carried away by
the imagination of the revolution in that vast country but many of them do not
seem to realize the implications of the revolution, and the thorough going
materialistic philosophy that has come to be accepted by that nation. This
materialism does not stop with politics. It encroaches into the field of the
education of the youngest nurslings of the nation. While the rest of the
civilized world has accepted the principles of the liberty of the child, with a
sheer attitude of vengeance and reaction, it would seem, the Russians wish to
apply the opposite Philosophy. The following striking sentence from a
resolution passed at a large Conference held to consider the principles
underlying pre-school education will reveal this attitude unmistakably. The
import of the words become all the more striking when we remember that it
refers to children under three years of age. It laid down the object of even
pre-school education as “the development of the maximum activity and initiative;
the maximum possibility of collective direction of activity; while preserving
and developing such elements of individuality will guarantee each child the
greatest capacity for living and manifesting its instincts of creative work and
research, and the possibility of acting on its own experience, from definite
sense observation capable of immediate utilization.”<sup>1</sup> In another
place<sup>2</sup> Mr. A. Pinkevich states as follows in so many unmistakable
words: “It need not be stressed hat the pre-school period, as well as the
school period, aims at the inculcation of the materialistic international world
outlook.” These are plain indications of the philosophy underlying education in
Soviet Russia. How many of us here want this attitude in India when its
implications are fully understood?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>America is perhaps the other country which strikes
the imagination of Indian youth. America does not take the extreme utilitarian
and materialistic position as Russia but the Pragmatic philosophy which is the
accepted basis of American education contains the same principle though in a
more diluted form. There are no absolute values in Pragmatism. What ‘works’, or
succeeds here and now, is everything, and the True and the Good are to be
reduced and boiled down to terms of usefulness if they are to be acceptable to
the pragmatist. This philosophy might suit certain stages of the development of
the individual personality in the process of education but it cannot satisfy
all stages. The child under twelve must definitely be left free to understand
things which may not fulfill the strict pragmatic tests. In higher education,
again, the pragmatic touchstone in education would mislead us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The failings of the matter-of-fact and conventional
English attitude in Education is what we know so well here in India. It is
supported by the philosophy of Spencer and Locke and at the best works on the
basis of biological analogies. Purely human values get left out and the scope
of education becomes restricted by a biological determination, on which mental
testing is a superstructure. The development of a strong individuality is all
that it aims at, even when it works at its best. Competition and survival of
the fittest are ideas that are tacitly implied, and the higher and truly human
aspects of the development of the personality are left out of its scope. Some
public schools attempt to develop something vaguely resembling character; but
this they succeed in doing through certain traditional factors peculiar to
these institution rather than on the basis of any conscious educational theory.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In our search for a suitable educational theory for
our country we can go to more remote continental philosophers. Here, again, we
cannot find a basis which can be said to be perfectly in keeping with India’s
heritage. The idealism of Kant comes very near to what we want and what in
keeping with the genius of our country. Kant himself depends on Rousseau, who
may be said to be the father of modern educational theory. Close students of
Rousseau’s philosophy and his ideas as developed in the <i>Emile </i>See
revealed for the first time some simple concepts which would throw at least a
faint light on our own basic concepts like <i>Brahmacharya, Gurubhakti </i>etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is not, therefore, to Russia, America or England
that we have turn to see common aspects between the soul of India and what is
most genuine and true in the thought of modern humanity. Hidden away from the
glamour of modernism there is a thin line of thought which brings back to our
own national experience; and this is to be sought in the line of thought that
unites Rousseau through Kant and Froebel, through Pestalozzi and Fichte to
modern idealists like Giovanni Gentile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Every patriotic Indian talks of education along
national lines refers to the ancient forest schools of our country. There are a
few catch words like <i>Gurukula Vasa </i>on which he keeps harping; but the
great task of formulating educational theory still remains to be accomplished.
We are still in the stage of slogans in this matter. Tacitly we look at each
and seem to think that we understand what we want but when it comes to a
formulation of accepted notions we get lost in banalities and contradictions.
Indian educational practice, even in national institutions, is at that
precarious stage in which we intend to do one thing but are actually compelled
to do quite another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Dr. Zia-uddin Ahmad has put his finger on a
difficulty peculiar to this country when he says: “No sound system of education
can be devised till we answer the question, ‘Who is responsible for our
education? The State or the people?’ “The joint responsibility of the State and
the people means,” he goes on to say, “dyarchy in education, which is bound to
be even more disastrous than dyarchy in Political administration, for its evil
effects do not become visible to the people till it is too late to find a
remedy.”<sup>3</sup> Popular sentiment grows in one direction till it attains a
point in which action is likely to follow and then opposite forces push it
back, till another wave brings it again forward so that between advancing and
receding impulses the matter of national education remains without proper
formulation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>What is it that can save us from the disastrous
effects of dyarchy in education? It is evidently a love of investigation for
its own sake. Investigation has to be undertaken free from any kind of
religious or political bias, in what is called an ‘objective’ spirit. There
must be an institution which will devote itself to the organization and
codification of existing knowledge and which will be neutral in politics and
unprejudiced in matters religious. Vague spiritual values, which might easily
degenerate into a sort of sentimentalism, must be carefully avoided in the
study of educational problems of our country. Too easy generalizations,
convictions based on metaphors and analogies, acceptance of particular schools
of orthodox thought which conduce to so much vagueness in educational
literature, taking the end however noble to justify the means, all these have
to be vigilantly fought against.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>When the foundations of a national institute which
would undertake study educational problems impartially have been laid, we shall
begin witness the rare phenomenon of the growth of education thought from stage
to stage. Concepts will be piled on concepts. The publications and discussions
will make it clear that we have been traversing definite ground. The ground
once conquered will then be annexed and made part of the stock of knowledge
that is accepted. Consensus of opinion then grows beyond that stage and as a
result of decades at least of persistent effort, we shall have worthy basic
concepts which shall furnish the administrators and statesmen with definitions
and programmes which will help them in the task of expending large sums of
money at their disposal in a more intelligent and consistent way than hitherto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Educationists should not blame administrators for
not spending the large amounts that governments budget year after year more
intelligently according to them. The task of making this possible is mainly
that of Educationists themselves, and so long as educationists themselves fail
and shirk their responsibility the difficulty is bound to remain. Enthusiastic
young men in India are ready to put the blame on our lack of political
independence in this country. It is patriotic to feel keenly for independence
but it should not be an excuse for educationists to shirk their
responsibilities in formulating what they want in clear-cut terms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Aimlessness in education is defect which is found
even in countries which enjoy full political freedom. This is due to lack of a
philosophical back-ground. England itself can be cited as an example. Professor
J. Welton, an Eminent English authority on education, himself states: “There is
no longer a universally recognized circle of knowledge constituting a liberal
education preparatory to specialist studies, as there was in the middle ages.
Nor is there general agreement….as to the end that should be sought by
education as a whole.” Mr. Maxwell Garnett, another author, states the same
fact more pointedly when he makes the statement: “The most easily observed
characteristic of English education at the present time is perhaps its
aimlessness.” <sup>4</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>That India enjoys good company in this matter
should not blind us to the necessity of making a real beginning in the
direction of formulating our own ideas in respect of education. Dyarchy in the
thought world can exist even when we have political independence. There is no
excuse, therefore, for delay in the initiation of this very important item in
our plans for reconstruction, and if some plead absence of independence for
delay, they have to be considered as those who shrike their responsibilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One difference between England and India in this
matter is that India has the advantage of a rich heritage of fundamental
educational ideas which are sound. The first task would be to restate these
concepts in modern form and bring them in line with the best trends of
education thought available to us now. Much that is tacitly implicit has to be
made explicit. Ideas that have been expressed in the form of aphorisms have to
be elaborated. Terms have to be correlated and made into more standardised
expressions so that educational parlance would rid itself of the bane of
allegory, allusion and figure of speech and develop a set of terms which,
though not scientific in the strictest sense, may lend themselves to be used as
such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian education are to be found scattered in the ancient writings. Valuable
indications about the object and aims of education are found in the <i>Minamsa
Sastras </i>and in the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>. The opening passages of the <i>Taittriya
Upanishad</i>, the Dharma Sastras and the <i>Puranas </i>and books like the <i>Gnanavasishta
</i>contain, when studied and elaborated, a theory of education that will be
found to be sound in the best modern sense. This is a proud claim that we have
been making for many decades now but one which we have not seriously tried to
substantiate to the present day. It is true that occasional articles appear in
some of the Indian magazines from time to time.<sup>5</sup> If one looks
between the lines in such literature, one invariably finds that we are still on
the defensive merely. With the impact of Western civilization our own standards
became questioned by ourselves and we are still answering half-wakefully the
question, “Is India civilized?” forgetting that we have been answering this
long enough and that it is now high time that we moved on to the next item on
the programme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A retrospective survey of educational thought in
India from the earliest times has to be undertaken first. A national philosophy
of education will emerge out of the past when we re-state it in objective terms
and relate it to the future of the nation. Prospective considerations have to
be given as much importance in the matter as retrospective ones. More and more
groups should discuss such questions so that a proper philosophy of national
education may emerge out of the systematic thinking of the nation<o:p></o:p></span></p>

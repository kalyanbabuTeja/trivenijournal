who maintain that my fair lady Miss Nicotine is foreign. There is proof
incontrovertible to show that she is 100 per cent Indian and labelling her as a
Yankee stuff uncharitable. You may call her a Virgin in the sense that she was
discovered in Virginia by the Englishmen. My fair lady’s kith and kin living in
the inaccessible areas of India believe that she was created for the good of
the mankind. The origin of tobacco is traced by the autochthon our tribal
people of India to its utility as a means of breaking the monotony of
continuous work or for offering it as a gesture of friendship or hospitality.
Its origin is also attributed to its medicinal properties such as alleviation
of pain. Accidental discovery is also claimed. These traditions of the
aboriginal population of India are at variance with the generally-accepted
theory that tobacco is a native of America and it is the Portuguese who
introduced it to India about the year 1600 A. D., following its popularisation
by Francisco Fernandes in 1558 in Europe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The medicinal qualities
of tobacco were known to the tribal people of India since time immemorial. They
did not impart its secrets to the Aryans as they have not done so in the case
of indigenous methods of family planning. The tribal people of India living in
and around Andhra Pradesh, where the bulk of India’s tobacco is cultivated,
have several myths. In fact the tribal people all over India have different
folk traditions about the origin of tobacco. The tribesmen belonging to the
Gond, Bondo, Gadaba, Juang, Kamar, Koya, Kond, Muria, Ojha, Pardhan, Parenga,
Saora and Santal communities have interesting aetiological myths. From the
available literature it may be concluded that tobacco is a Dravidiun trait, as
there is no reference to it in the sacred scriptures the Hindus. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Divine origin is
attributed to tobacco by the Bondo, Kamar, Khuntia Chokh, Kond and Saora
tribesmen. It is Mahaprabhu, the supreme god of the Bondos, who gave tobacco to
their ancestor Soma Bodnaik. The Kamar tribesmen inhabiting the lonely areas of
the Bindranawagarh and Kariar Zamindaris tell us that it was Mahadeo, their
supreme god, who gave a little morsel of tobacco to Kachara-Durwa, their
ancestor. The Khuntia Chokh blacksmiths residing in the Chattisgarh area also
believe that it is their Mahadeo who showed the mankind the art of preparing
the tobacco leaves for the pipes. The notorious Maria sacrificers inhabiting
the Ganjam and Koraput districts of Orissa believe that it was Nirantali, their
goddess, who created tobacco. The properties of the leaves of the tobacco plant
were explained by Durha Pinnu and Pusrudi to Sonali Dom and his wife, Rupamali
Dom. Another tradition of the Konds of the Kalachandi district describes that
Nirantali created tobacco by picking up some dust and ash and rubbing a little
dirt of her body by throwing it all on the ground whence the tobacco plant
sprang up. The wildest section of the Konds, the Kuttia Konds, who inhabit the
Ganjam district, believe that the tobacco seed was dropped by Nirantali from
the bun of her hair on the banks of the river Bujiano whence the plants took
root. The Saoras, who are immortalised by their reference in the Ramayana, have
various traditions about the origin of tobacco. The Hill Saoras of Koraput
district believe that it was Ramma and Bimma, who were brothers, who got
tobacco seeds and taught a Dom to make them into cheroots. However, the Hill
Saoras living in the Tarebil village of the same district assert that it was
Piskisum, their tribal god, at the request of their women, bestowed tobacco on
the mankind for giving notice of the approach of their menfolk. The Lanjhia
Saoras, a branch of the great Saora tribe, inhabiting the hills of the Koraput
and Ganjam districts of Orissa, give credit to Mahaprabhu, their super god, for
creating tobacco from the dead body of an issueless Pano lady’s breasts and
bones. The Ojhas, a Gond sub-tribe of soothsayers and minstrels living in the
Raipur district, think that it was Mahadeo who created tobacco by cutting two
ears of the cow and bull of Baghirati’s son and throwing them away which took
root to sprout as tobacco.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are a number of myths about the creation of
tobacco from the dead body of a girl whom nobody loved in her lifetime, but who
becomes the object of love of all the world. This motif, ‘The Girl Nobody
Loved’ is widely distributed in India. “I have,” wrote the late Verrier Elwin,
“found it among the Kond, Gadaba and the Juangs of Orissa, the Muria of Bastar
and the Gond of Mandla.” Curiously, this motif is associated with opium and
Khampti, Moklum, Taroan Mishmi and Singpho stories repeat it with interesting
variants in details. The popular version of the myth is transmitted to the
posterity by the Santal tribesmen. The gist of the story is: Once upon a time
there lived and died a young lady whom no one wanted to marry. In fact she died
of a broken heart. The benign gods felt great compassion for her sorrowful end.
They decided that, as no one wanted to marry her while she was living, they
should arrange matters in such a way that everybody should ask for her, now
that she was dead. Having come to this conclusion, they metamorphosed her ashes
into the tobacco plant. Ever since then, men have come from far and near for
its leaves. In this way, it came to pass that one, who had been neglected while
she was living, was wanted by all men after death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The great Gadaba tribe
living in the Koraput district believes that a certain Rajah’s cross-eyed and
ugly daughter had the meanness to request Mahaprabhu to make love to her.
Mahaprabhu cursed her: “Go, you will be no more a woman; become a tobacco plant
and then all of the men you want will enjoy you.” As she stood there the girl
became a tobacco plant, the precious leaves of which all men desire above food
and wives. “There is no difference between tobacco and a wife: we love them
equally” say the Juangs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The motif, “The Girl
Nobody Loved” occurs in a somewhat different form in a Bondo story gathered
from Dumiripada village of Koraput district. Mahaprabhu, supreme god of the
Bondos, fell in love with Diyamati Kaniya. Both joined hands in killing her
husband, a snake, but the paramour found that she was sexually insatiable even
by elephants. So, Mahaprabhu killed her and out of her grew a plant. “Many men
enjoyed the leaves and now at last Diyamati was satisfied, for soon the whole
world was enjoying her,” the Bondos say. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The tradition of the
Rajnengi Pardhans of Patangarh, Mandla, is also slightly different. A Brahmin
girl, who was married by a Chamar boy impersonating as a Brahmin, died of
broken heart when she came to know of her husband’s identity. The boy committed
suicide when he found his wife dead. The two bodies were cremated together and
from the ashes of the girl’s body grew the tobacco plant and from the boy’s
ashes grew the hemp plant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The accidental discovery
of the plant by Juangs and Doms have fascinating backgrounds. However, the
strong belief that God<i> </i>created tobacco on account of its utilitarian
qualities is shared by a number of tribesmen all over India, especially by the
Kamar, Kond, and Ojha tribesmen, whose traditions have been handed down to us.
The Kamars of Dilaijhar village of<i> </i>the former Bindranawagarh Zamindari
believe that their supreme god Mahadeo created tobacco at the request of the
cow-queen who implored him to take pity on the bullocks of Kochara-Durwa.
Mahadeo, in the form of an old man, came to earth and met Kochara-Durwa, who
used to plough the land all the day. Mahadeo asked for<i> </i>fire to light up
his pipe and gave Kochara-Durwa a little of tobacco and taught him to sow its
seeds and prepare the pipe. “Soon every half an hour Kochara-Durwa and his men
were finding it necessary to rest from their ploughing so that they could sit
down for a smoke. In this way the bullocks got a little rest,” say the
tribesmen. Nirantali, according to the Konds, had a great deal of trouble by
working all the day and created the tobacco plant from the hair of a little
girl and a white bug. Nirantali gave a pipe to her husband, Semakupli. He
propagated its culture and transmitted the art of<i> </i>smoking to the
posterity as an excuse for taking rest while working. The Ojha tradition gives
credit to Mahadeo for the creation of tobacco. He taught the art of making the
pipe to Baghirathi’s son, who used to plough all the day. “Ever since when
people plough they step frequently to smoke their pipes and in this way the
cattle get a little rest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another motif which not
infrequently underlying the tribal beliefs is the notion that the gods bestowed
it on the mankind as a means of giving entertainment to visitors. Tobacco is
also used for cementing friendship. In fact giving one’s pipe to another is the
greatest sign of friendship among the tribal and civilised people of India. The
Bondo and Saora traditions illustrate this point. Mahaprabhu, according to the
Bondos, created the tobacco plant with this advice: “When visitors come,
entertain them with it and they will admire you and become your friends.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The offer of tobacco as
a sign of hospitality is prevalent all over India. The tradition of the Murias
living in the Berma village in Bastar is interesting: Once rice took flight as
it became disgusted with the tribesmen who had to offer it first to every
visitor as there was no other substitute in those days. On the way rice met a
tobacco plant which asked what was the reason of her flight. When it heard the
story, the plant said: “Don’t worry. From today, when visitors come to the
house, I will take the first place and you can come afterwards and be given as
food.” So today tobacoo is first given to a visitor and afterwards comes the
rice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tobacco alleviates pain.
People smoke cigarettes, cheroots, etc., in increasing numbers when they are mentally
worried. The grief resulting from the death of one’s near and dear ones is the
severest. It is the custom among many a tribe that the relatives of the
deceased should present a quantity of tobacco to the survivors. Even a highly
civilised community like that of the Nairs of Kerala does not dispense with
this custom. The Konds or Kurutigadu, Koraput district, plain that the custom
originated in this way: Sonamali, husband of<b> </b>Rupamali Dom, died sometime
after their discovery of the tobacco plant. All efforts to revive the
grief-stricken Rupamali failed. Then her mother put a little tobacco leaf into
her mouth and she sat up and wept no more. “Since then whenever someone dies we
buy tobacco from the Dom and give it to the mourners and they soon forget their
sorrow.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The medicinal properties
of tobacco were recognised by the tribesmen long before the Portuguese are said
to have brought it to India. The Didayi, Gond and Saora traditions illustrate
the point. The Lanjhia Saora, and Juang traditions state that the medicinal
properties were imparted to them by animals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The tribal people of
India, who still remain inaccessible, have very fascinating traditions about
the origin of tobacco. These un-contaminated people cannot fabricate stories to
show that tobacco is indigenous. They have no need for it. Not a single myth
points out to a foreign origin of my fair lady, Miss Nicotine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the standpoint of national welfare, Rajaji is the most important man in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> today.
Importance is different from power and is measured by the influence that one
exercises on the lives and thoughts of others. The British Viceroys in their
time were powerful but they have been proved all the bar of history not
proportionally important. Mahatma <span class=GramE>Gandhi</span> who started a
campaign of resistance against them, wielded no power when he started it, but
he is acclaimed by the whole world as the most important man born in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
in recent times. His importance arises from the fact that he performed the feat
of liberating his country from foreign rule at a time when it seemed to have no
adequate resources. He supplied the strength and the resources with his
leadership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> today is
in the throes of a second liberation movement. The freedom that the Mahatma won
has not fulfilled its promise of happiness for the people. Two reasons have
mainly contributed to the distressing result. First, the leaders of the
indigenous government formed after the withdrawal of the British, ran after
power, and in the process of making themselves more and more powerful, they
swallowed up popular liberties one after one relentlessly. Secondly, in the course
of consolidating their power they abandoned intrinsic concepts of justice, and
replaced them with <span class=SpellE>organised</span> mob <span class=SpellE>clamour</span>.
Anything that a large number of people could be got together to demand became
administrative policy. The pampered covetousness of the multitude, let loose on
society with State patronage, made class hatred fashionable and deprived
property of its sanctity. To cover up the depredatory, character of this policy
and make it look grand, the name Socialism was given to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Nehru-Socialism the people of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have as individuals lost their liberties. Their property and possessions have
ceased to have any assured legal validity. An atmosphere of insecurity
permeates the land. The Government on the other hand has made itself more powerful
than any previous government had been by drawing unto itself more and more
economic power, thereby tightening its strangle-hold on the lives and
occupations of the people. Existence for citizens is being rendered practically
impossible without the <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the ruling party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
are now in need of a second liberation movement but the fight for it is
complicated by the all-pervasive character of the opponent’s power. Just as
civil war is more dreadful than war against a foreign enemy, the wresting of individual
liberties from a government established within the country is more difficult
than the achievement of national freedom from a foreign power. It is to the
undying glory of Rajaji that, at a time when Congress rule had come to be
accepted as invincible and irreplaceable, and people had lost all hope of ever
being saved from its Communistic regimentation and oppression, he came forward
to essay this supremely difficult and seemingly impossible task. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> movement of Rajaji is thus the lineal
successor of the Mahatma’s movement in the cause of freedom. The odds against
Rajaji seem tremendous at the moment. So they were against the Mahatma when he
embarked on his apparently foolhardy Quit India movement. The ordinary pattern
of leadership is built on a psychology of expectancy in the human pursuit of
power and prosperity. The successful leader has to distribute <span
class=SpellE>favours</span> to his followers at the moment of success as its
penalty, and these <span class=SpellE>favourites</span> not only corrupt the
administration with their interference, but the privileges they enjoy also
serve as a constant temptation to one and all to improve their fortunes by
copying them in rallying round the leader. This type of leadership is mainly in
the nature of a commercial transaction. It flourishes on votes that are in many
cases secured in return for some profit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>If <span class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span> movement had
depended on this sort of leadership, it certainly could not have hoped for
success, as its power of purchasing support is practically nil compared to that
of the Congress rulers. It is the unique distinction of Rajaji as a leader that
he offers no personal gain to any follower in exchange for his loyalty. From
the Prime Minister downwards, Congress leaders when they rise to power regard
their followers, friends and relatives with rich plums in various forms. This
was their strength, as it bound large numbers of acquisitive fortune-seekers to
their standards with the secure bond of self-interest. Such nepotism is
conspicuously <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>absent in <span
class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span> record as political leader and administrator.
There has not been a single instance of administrative or other <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> conferred by Rajaji out of domestic affection or
clannish partiality or as undeserved reward for political allegiance. Those who
rally round the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> party in the expectation of
personal advantage through its success are therefore foredoomed to
disappointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is the true significance of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> movement.
The leader expects all who join it to discard self-interest in their politics,
and to impel them to do so, <span class=GramE>his own</span> life is exemplary
and dynamic. With the resources of character in the country, Rajaji seeks to
combat the ramified enslavements of <span class=SpellE>organised</span> greed
and power emanating from an exceedingly selfish and self-<span class=SpellE>centred</span>
ruling set. Here we have the actual political content of renovated <i>Dharma. </i>To
believe that character is more important for the nation’s welfare than cunning
bidding for votes, and that <i>Dharma, </i>and purity of mind will lead to
people’s happiness and not covetous grabbing at others property is to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> the true significance of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
movement initiated by Rajaji. <i>Dharma </i>means a fair deal to all,
administrative justice, treating others as one would like to be treated by them
and it is the only potent solvent capable of ridding the people of the
corruption, waste and nepotism, apart from the aggressions on the community of
the rulers’ greedy quest for power, rampant in the present set-up of the
government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dharma
</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is not
like propaganda which has two faces, reality and make-believe. The margin
between reality and make-believe is occupied by falsehood in propaganda. There
is no scope for such falsehood in <i>Dharma. </i>It is by prescription
something that cannot cheat. Truth and <i>Dharma </i>go together and all
religions teach that there is no greater power than <i>Dharma </i>based on
truth. But the teaching of <i>Dharma </i>cannot be done by all and sundry. It
needs a leader whose life is cast in the resplendent mould of <span
class=SpellE><i>Dharmic</i></span><i> </i>example from which all false values,
pettiness and self-seeking have been burnt out. Such a leader of flaming
probity is Rajaji. The historic role of saving our democracy from the
perversions imposed on it by the false disciples of the Mahatma has fallen on
him by divine dispensation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dandappa
was an old Havaldar in the Bombay police service. He was fifty. He had a
stalwart body; and, having trained himself his in younger days as a wrestler,
he had somehow found his way into the police force. He had a broad face with
bulldog jaws, and his half-gray moustaches, trimmed at the sides, and somewhat
blood-shot eyes imparted a fierce appearance to his look. Blue shorts, a coat,
a yellow cap, a leather hose, a heavy pair of sandals, a short baton tucked at
the waist, his number in brass figures, these completed his outfit and he
looked a model Havaldar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
temperament, his grim resoluteness in times of crisis, his coolness, his skill
in investigation, his devotion to duty, his power of endurance, his loyalty to
the Department,–all these had earned for him good opinion of his officers. He
was in the forefront when difficult duty had to be performed; similarly, when a
delicate piece of work was to be undertaken, Havaldar Dandappa was always
chosen to attend to it. He had acquired the reputation of being ‘a safe man’ in
the Department. His illiteracy was his one handicap,–or he would have certainly
risen to higher positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was thirty years since Dandappa had come to Bombay. He lived his early life in
his village as a cultivator. He owned too an acre of land. But the rains had
failed and his living had become precarious. So he made up his mind to leave
his village in accordance the well-known Kannada proverb: “When you are down
and out, take to the city.” He had heard a great deal of Bombay, and somehow
deposited himself there. He spent about four years undergoing great privations,
driven from pillar to post, in and out of jobs, until at last through the good
offices of a friend he secured a place in the Police Department. His life now
became more comfortable. Within two years he saved two hundred rupees, went to
his village, married Ambavva whom he had fancied, brought her to Bombay, and
hired one portion of a partitioned room for five rupees a month in one of the
top floors of a chawl in Kandewadi, situated in one of the by-ways<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ambavva
was a handsome woman, slim and fair-complexioned. She had an artless and tender
nature, and so docile that she was as the shadow of her husband. She was ever
intent on fulfilling the least of his wishes. This purpose filled all her life.
Her devotion was the result of her love for him–not unmixed with a certain
amount of awe with which she looked upon him: for, though Dandappa was not
lacking in tenderness towards her and showed it by his occasional presents of
jewels and finery, there was still a certain amount of hardness and discipline
which coloured his domestic behaviour–a natural overflow from the current of his
official life. On such occasions he exhibited his temper, and the sharpness of
his tongue. And she felt hurt and broke into tears. Reconciliation followed,
but took some time. Such fear was ever present in mind and always put a
restraint on her behaviour, because one could never tell when he would fly off
into a temper. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Panduranga
was the child born to them after some years of married life. Both in appearance
and disposition he took after his mother,–the same tenderness of feeling, the
same gentleness and dignity of outward behaviour. But on occasions he gave
evidence of some of Dandappa’s courage, spirit, and unbending nature. Thus
Dandappa recognised in his only child the looks he loved so well as also the
traits he admired so much, and began to dote on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Panduranga was a baby, Dandappa had never enough of fondling of the baby. He
used to take him, exhibit him before all his friends and was indeed very proud
of him. He bought dresses, ornaments and toys for the boy beyond his means. He
brought sweets and eatables for him to the point of causing indigestion. Though
usually so dearly fondled, when the baby was naughty. Dandappa administered an
occasional whacking. And Ambavva would intervene and rescue the little one,
saying, “Though his love is like milk, his anger is like fire.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy was admitted to school in due course, the parents stinting themselves even
the necessaries of life to maintain him there. Dandappa’s greatest ambition was
that the boy should get education, pass high examinations and secure a big job.
So he spared no expense to provide the boy with books, paper, pencils and other
things. He had even given him a hat and a pair of boots. That he could not
engage a private tutor for him was one of the things that grieved him. Being an
illiterate himself he could not undertake the boys teaching. He contented
himself with seeing to it that the boy did not waste his time at home; and this
he did effectively. If now and then the boy went a little astray, Dandappa
brought down his heavy punishment and kept him on the proper path. On such
occasions he acted the strong father’s part rather too strongly, so as to make
Ambavva venture to intervene protesting: “What–are you going to kill the boy?
Please, for God’s sake, leave him alone; don’t hurt him so,” And he replied in
a voice of thunder, “If he does not read now, what should happen to him? I
can’t bear to see him idling his time.” His behaviour was like Goldsmith’s
schoolmaster who, “if severe in aught, the love he bore to learning was in fault!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
War came. The cost of living went up like a rocket. It became very difficult
for the poor Havaldar to make both ends meet. How should he continue to provide
for the education of his son? Poor Panduranga’s education came to an abrupt end
with the fifth standard. He was sixteen years old. And there was need to
increase the family earnings. How should Dandappa keep him idle at home? He
wanted him to take up a job. Ambavva said, “Why burden him so soon? There is
time enough for him to slave till the end of his life. Let him rest for some
time.” Dandappa said, “What do you mean? How can any one afford to be idle
these days? No–he must become an earner,” and clinched the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
the kind of job that Panduranga should take came in for discussion. Dandappa
said, “It is obvious: he should join the police force.” Ambavva pleaded, “No,
let him not become a policeman. It is enough that you are in that department.
It is a place where one has to do the most unpleasant duties.. If he has to
earn, let him get into some other job.” Dandappa got wild on hearing such
aspersions against his department. “What did you say? Is my work so bad? It is
the King’s work. It implies authority to arrest even a millionaire. What can
there be equal to it? It is because of this that we are alive now, and fairly
comfortable. Don’t forget that. Don’t foul your own nest.” Ambavva rejoined
“Yes–all the honour is only in your presence. When your back is turned, what
things they can speak of you! I hear everyday–” Dandappa put a stop to her
further talk: “Let them say what they please. I do not care a brass button for
their opinion. Nowadays everybody has a grouse against the police. Hartals,
processions and meetings almost every day. We know very well the amount of
unrest and disloyalty there is in the country. I do not care for all the talk
against the police. If any body attempts to speak disloyal nonsense to you, be
on your “guard.” Ambavva at this juncture somehow took it into her head to
reply: “Why should any body attempt to speak to me? Have I not seen for myself
something of this slavery?” As soon as these words came out of Ambavva’s mouth
in spite of herself, Dandappa was roused like a cobra. “Ha! such words to my
face! Shut up! I have to give you a good whacking.” At this moment, the son
came between them and, holding his father’s hand, said, “Please don’t raise
your hand against Mother. I am ready to join the Police Department.” Dandappa
was somewhat mollified. Ambavva broke into sobs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Panduranga had not yet from his duty. Hour after hour the incidents of that
fateful day were reaching the ears of Ambavva. The more she heard, the more she
was agitated. She felt more and mare concerned for her son as time was passing.
It was 1 p. m. – 2 p. m. and yet Panduranga had not returned. Ambavva who was
going to the door now and again eagerly looking out for the arrival of her son,
now stood in the verandah in front of her house watching in anxious
expectations. Another half-hour passed: Ambavva did not stir from her place.
Dandappa was not yett awake. Ambavva was tired of standing and was about to go
inside when an Ambulance car turned towards the house and drew up in front.
Ambavva’s heart beat fast. In another moment, a body swathed in white cloth was
lifted out of the van by the police. Ambavva gave a shriek of horror. Dandappa
got up to a flurry and came out to see what all the commotion was about. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sight fell upon the corpse of his son. Yes; among the thousands who lost their
lives that day, his son was one. The two friends who had brought the body stood
with downcast faces. Ambavva fell on the corpse and broke into sobs. Dandappa
was stunned for a moment and stood with a vacant look. Then it all flashed on
him. One of the friends narrated the happenings in detail. The police had to
open fire to disperse a procession. But this time the people, instead of
dispersing, rushed forward and wreaked their vengeance on the policemen on whom
they could lay their hands. Panduranga was among those victims. But the
narration did not produce any impression on Dandappa. Gradually his grief gave
way to anger. He found, his tongue at last, and asked faltering, “Have any
arrests been made in connection with this?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that day, Dandappa addressed himself to the task of tracking the culprit, with
the approval of the officers. He got to know the particulars about the leader
from the persons arrested. He was a young man from Pandharpur, of the name of
Deshpande. He was living with his brother-in-law in Bombay and studying at
college. He was aged about eighteen. As soon as Dandappa gathered these
particulars, he went to the brother-in-law’s house, made a search and secured a
photograph of the youngman. He arranged for the house to be watched. Three days
later there were posters stuck on the walls all over the city offering a reward
of Rs. 2,000 for information leading to the arrest of Deshpande. His photograph
and other particulars were also widely published. Dandappa resolved to track
down Deshpande and bring him to justice and thus wreak his vengeance: and he
would get the reward of Rs. 2,000 in addition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that day Deshpande’s photograph was always in Dandapa’s pocket. Wherever he
went he was always on the lookout for the person who bore any resemblance to
the photograph. He would take out the photograph and compare the faces. He got
at Deshpande’s college-mates, his relations and friends, made searching
enquiries regarding his habits, learnt about the places frequented by him, the
picture houses and hotels usually visited by him, and started watching these
places. Once while going on the Vittalbhai Road, someone looked suspiciously at
him, and made himself scarce in a moment. Dandappa, after a great deal of
effort, was able to capture him. But the arrested man turned out to be an old
offender who was ‘wanted’. Dandappa got complimented for the arrest; but this
gave him no satisfaction or peace of mind. He got stray bits of information now
and then; and he would follow them up with great care. Still he had not tracked
down his man. He even went out of Bombay visiting a few towns on this quest.
His efforts bore no fruit. But despite all frustration, he never lost hope, and
his efforts never slackened. This quest became the purpose of his life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

passed, months passed–it was almost a year: and yet his quest had not
succeeded. Sometimes a doubt crossed Dandappa’s mind whether the culprit was
still alive. And immediately he assured himself: “Why not? He is in hiding
somewhere about here, and will be caught one day or other. Let us see” His
officers had begun to feel displeased with his failures, in spite of numerous
hints being given to him which should have led to an arrest. Dandappa knew all
this. But what could he do? Was he not bending all his energies to this one
task? He was beginning to feel displeased with himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

day he was coming out of his house with a companion on his usual hunt. “Come,
Gangappa, let us have a little tea, we have to watch the whole night,” he said
to his companion and entered the Royal Restaurant at the end of Kandewadi. It
was after dusk and the lights were on. The two settled themselves at a table at
one end near the door. Dandappa ordered two single teas While tea was arriving,
he turned to his companion and said: “Gangappa, what shall I do? I am wearing
onto my very life on this business. And yet the Inspector is displeased. My son
has lost his life; do I require greater spur to effort than that? And there is,
in addition, a Rs. 2,000 reward.” As these words were uttered, there was a
noise of a moving chair in the corner diagonally opposite to where they were
seated. And they heard a loud cough–as what was gulped in by the person had
gone in on the wrong side. Immediately Dandappa’s attention was directed to the
place. The man at the further corner was getting up to leave. He had not yet
taken his tea. Dandappa’s suspicions were roused. He gazed at the man’s face in
a moment and took out the photograph from his pocket. Even in that insufficient
light, there was no mistaking the resemblance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

aimed a plate full of savoury and hot stuff right into Dandappa’s face, and

the pungent things thrown at his face, and, before he or any one else realised
what was going on, the man got into the closet and fastened the bolt. They
broke open the door, but meanwhile he had escaped through a window opening out

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Just then Ambavva was sitting near the door engaged
in cleaning a quantity of rice, picking out dirt and pieces of stone from it.
Suddenly she heard the sound of footsteps entering in. She looked up, and saw a
stranger inside the open door. She got frightened. She was about to scream but
the stranger, trembling all over and in a pitiable voice, said, “Mother, do not
fear. Please save me; hide me; close the door.” She was perplexed, and merely
continued to stare. The stranger himself gently closed the door “Good mother, I
have sought refuge with you. My life is in your hands.” Saying this he
collapsed on the floor.</p>

chin, glistening and frightened eyes like those of a hunted animal–these filled
her mother’s heart with pity. Without a moment’s hesitation she took the stranaer’s
hand and led him in and made him sit down in the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At this moment she heard someone pushing in the
outer door and heard the voice of Dandappa. Ambavva was startled. He had gone
his night duty–how should he return so soon? She was greatly frightened. Her
limbs seemed to get paralysed. Meanwhile Dandappa entered the house; and with
great effort Ambavva came to the outer room, As soon as he saw her, Dandappa
asked, “Did anyone come anywhere this side?” Ambavva’s limbs began to quake.
She could not manage to speak and simply said, “What?” “Why are you so scared?”
he asked, “Did you not see any one run in this direction? This is all I asked
you. Why are you so agitated?” With great difficulty she mustered courage
enough to say ‘No.’ Dandappa said patiently, “So much time merely to say ‘No’.
Gangappa, the murderer must have moved on further.” Saying this to himself, he
banged the door behind him and moved out. Gangappa, who had been observing
Ambavva, followed Dandappa but not before turning back and casting a suspicious
glance at her. When he got on the road, he asked Dandappa, “Why did your wife
look so frightened?” Dandappa merely said, “She is a timid creature. My very
presence puts her in a fright. And when we spoke of a murderer, that must have
scared her out of her wits,” Gangappa drawled out, “That is all, you think?”
Dandappa reassured him, “What else? Will she ever speak false to me? Does she
not know the consequence? You have no idea how I have kept my wife?” Gangappa
remained silent. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When she heard the word ‘murderer’ Ambavva for a
moment felt like telling Dandappa everything. But Dandappa had moved out of the
house. Just then, as if to strengthen her former determination, the poor
stranger asked for water in a faint and pitiable voice. Ambavva went into the
kitchen and gave him some water. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>He
quaffed it with eagerness and made signs begging for some food. Ambavva had not
yet taken her meat, so she served him some food on a plate; The stranger
gobbled up what was placed before him Looking at his eagerness Ambavva thought,

soon as his hunger was satisfied, the youngman pleaded “Mother, I am not really
a murderer. Don’t believe it.” Ambavva, not knowing what to say, merely looked
up and down. The young man proceeded, “Terrible things happened on the 9th of
August. The death of Panduranga immediately came to Ambavva’s mind. She said,
“My son, too, lost his life on that day. He looked very much like you, and
tears streamed from her eyes. The youngman responded, “Alas! How many lost
their lives that day, with or without reason! For myself, I did not raise my
hand against any one I have not hurt anyone in my life. I have had some
education. What then? The fates are all powerful.” “Many foolish things were
done in the exciting conditions of that day,” he added in a repentant voice.
Supper was taken. He asked, “Mother! May I rest here for the night?” Ambavva
hesitated for a moment. Would it be better to send him away from this place of
danger? But where should he get a shelter outside? And his safety? The police
may be still after him searching for him everywhere. But would it be right to
let him sleep in this house? Why not? Poor fellow! But Dandappa–no, he was not
likely to come back yet. He was on his night shift. After the youngman had some
rest, he might be roused and sent away. Yes–that is the proper thing. As soon
as Ambavva came to this decision, she said to him, “All right. You sleep in the
kitchen. I shall rest outside. You must get up before daybreak and go away. I
shall wake you up.” The youngman folded his hands in gratitude and exclaimed:
“You have been my mother! I am born again, today!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gave him a mat and a woollen covering. The young man dropped off to sleep in a
few minutes. Spreading her bed, Ambavva said to herself, “Perhaps he has not
had rest for many days, poor chap!” She did not steep. Various thoughts crossed
her mind: doubts and apprehensions troubled her. About half-an-hour must have
passed by. Suddenly the front door opened. In her excitement she had even
forgotten to fasten the bolt. Who should walk in, but Dandappa again! She was
filled with surprise and fright at the same instant. Without knowing what she
was doing, she sprang to the entrance to the kitchen–it had no door–and stood </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>against
the doorway. Dandappa, as soon as he came in, flung his cap on the bed saying,
“It is all over for me, this day. The toil of all these years has come to
nothing.” And he sat on the bed. Ambavva did not understand anything. She did
not know what to say. So she simply asked, “That means?” “It means, I am
suspended. Do you understand? What does this new officer know of my worth? He
knows only about this case. I am devoting all my energies to it. But luck is against
me. What is to be done? It seems that I have been given many chances: and he
got quite wild that the murderer had slipped through our fingers this time. And
that Ganga carried tales against me. ‘You should not have done this! You should
not have done that! You should have caught him, using greater skill.’ These
fellows presume to teach me skill! Yes, it is on account of this murderer that
my job, my promotion, my pension are all ruined–not to speak of the Rs. 2,000
reward. My entire career is blasted. Ah! If only I can catch him!” And so,
unasked, he unburdened, himself, and relieved himself, of his distress. Ambavva
said nothing. It is impossible to describe the state of her mind at the moment.
After brief silence, Dandappa said again, “Yes–let us see–bring me a cup of
water.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in a fright. The noise of the waking person reached Dandappa’s ears: and he
asked suspiciously, “What is that?” Without replying a word Ambavva went again
and stood against the kitchen doorway. It occurred to Dandappa that someone was
hiding inside. He sprang up and asking, “Who is that paramour of yours?’,
rushed to the doorway. What courage possessed Ambavva at this moment, it is
difficult to say, but she said– “No paramour– but son.” What strength she
mustered one can never know: but she stood facing Dandappa and blocking his
way. Dandappa was furious. “Son! Your son is already dead! Who is this fellow?

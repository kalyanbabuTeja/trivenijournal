war made itself felt in Assam by about 1942; it came as a dark cloud
threatening the normal activities of the people. Literary expression tended to
get stifled; publication of books became difficult; the magazines became
erratic; many writers found the social and economic atmosphere uncertain and
uncongenial for creative work. It was further a period of ideological turmoil
for younger writers, and some of them, those who probably did not produce much
though promising considerably, made themselves conspicuous before long and
seemed to give a lead to those older writers who had not been able to decide
which way to go–to go the way of<i> </i>the art of the leisured class or follow
in the van of a fast changing world. The temporary revival of the monthly <i>Jayanti
</i>and its management in younger hands seems to be a significant event in the
history of literary ideas of the last ten years or so. For the magazine tried
to clarify many issues, and in spite of its occasional idiosyncrasies, it was
able to expose the futility of<i> </i>writing sentimental stories and
conventional love-poems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
war years and especially the August movement of 1942 gave to the thought of the
people a socialistic bias and the younger writers became acquainted with
Marxian doctrines. There was no regimentation of thought, but the change in
thee outlook could not be denied. As a result of this changed outlook the note
of national consciousness which had been felt in the modern literature of
Assam, and which occasionally had tended to ring out in a cry of the oppressed
in general, became less sentimental, less romantic, and indeed underwent a
transformation in the face of the sterner realities storming the consciousness
of sensitive persons. Most of the poems in the anthology <i>Adhunik Asamiya
Kavita </i>(1946) record an awareness of capitalist exploitation, class
conflict, and the need for a quick change in the order of things. How the same
poet turned from a patriotic stand to an anti-imperialist fighter could be seen
in the later work of Jyoti-prasad Agarwalla (d. 1951) who composed songs and
poems of a revolutionary character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the most promising of the younger poets, Amulya Barua, lost his life in the

considerable amount of the new poetry seems a little futile, for it has not
only freed itself from the restraint of rhyme and logic but tended to lose all
sense of rhythm and “the light that never was on sea or land”. The younger poet
is oftener a <i>poseur, </i>a critic in verse (or in ‘market-report' prose!),
using new forms to advertise new doctrines, and to attack what had gone before.
Moreover the new poet is frequently an under-graduate with neither a true
conception of poetry nor an understanding of the means in the hand of the poet.
The outward shell of modern English poetry has befogged a considerable number
of these youngsters who are normally deficient in their knowledge of the
English language, not to speak of speech-rhythm, sprung rhythm, stress, Image,
and such features of modern English poetry. They have further been misguided by
a few of their seniors who even think of introducing surrealism at this date.
It is of course undeniable that the range of subjects and the gamut of
consciousness have been enriched and the move towards fresh ideas is
legitimate, yet an occasional happy image or two do not balance the loss the
poetry has sustained in imaginative quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fiction the post-war years seem to have seen a revival. As in poetry in fiction
also, there has been a change in method and content. The narration has greater
verisimilitude than before<i> </i>and the characterisation is nearer to life. There
is a greater awareness of the changing environment. A comparatively young
writer, Md. Piar, has produced several novels and at least two of<i> </i>them<i>–Sangram
</i>and <i>Herowa Swarga</i>–deserve notice. In <i>Sangram </i>the story is
about a poor and struggling Muslim lad who faces the world alone and, in order
to realise his inner potentialities, does not accept defeat, but goes ahead and
discovers himself to be a writer of originality. His work is put across to the
public with the patronage of a high-minded Hindu girl. The problems that
Rafique has to face are those that have disturbed the mind of the middle class
in our society, and circumstances tend to transform him from a struggling poor
man to a rebellious social worker. In the latest of Piar’s work, in <i>Herowa
Swarga, </i>there is a vivid picture of the small world of unsympathetic
relatives and ignorant people in which a poor Mussalman boy drifts about in
search of shelter and sustenance. The waif finds his haven in the house of a
Hindu youth: this haven is lost once, but is regained with complete peace to
the central character. In grasp of social reality the second work is much
better, but in both Piar writes of people he has known. Piar is not much
disturbed by ideologies, hence his narration is easy and flowing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
novel of a different type is Navakanta Barua’s <i>Kapilipariya Sadhu, </i>which
is only the first part of the projected work. </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here the
emphasis is on the vagaries of the river Kapili and the hopes and despairs it
raises in the heart of the peasants dwelling on its banks. The central
character Rupai is found on the breast of the Kapili and all his life he feels
a peculiar kinship with the river. His sweetheart Sonpahi loses her life in the
Kapili and he consoles himself with the feeling that after all it is his river
which has taken her away. The human story takes on a tragic colouring from the
uncertainty and wildness of the river which serves as its setting. The picture
of rural life presented in the novel is not idealised, rather the pity of it
has been worked out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Psychological
preoccupation characterises Radhikamohan Goswami’s <i>Chaknaiya. </i>It is a
fairly large work devoting most space to describing the unhappy contacts of
Vivek with hypocrites and snobs. There is considerable character analysis but
the work suffers as a whole because Vivek has no tangible ground for railing
against the world; the reader does not discover what circumstances have made
Vivek what he is. The author has succeeded in making certain minor characters
convincing, but the novel fails because the central character is unconvincing.
Characterisation is also the concern of <i>Kecha Patar Kapani </i>by the author
of this essay. In this novel is a group of young people with the passional
unrest typical of the young and the ideological unrest typical of the times.
Young and educated Utpal makes an attempt to eke out his living in business,
does not quite succeed, but contacts Nilima and loves her. She drifts out while
Minati, a school-mistress, tries to grab him. Knowledge of the hard life led by
young Bohagi and other Kachari tribals, as well as contacts with underground
workers like the artist Rabinkumar, seem to make Utpa all the more undecided.
Minati at last goes over to a friend of Utpal’s and the young chap is left
without<i> </i>any plan as such. There is some amount of experimentation in the
style of the novel as demanded by the analysis of moods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
other works, Gnanakanta Gagoi’s <i>Sonar Nangal </i>(First part) deals with
rural conditions while Sureshchandra Goswami’s <i>Sat Rangar Natun Krareng </i>is<i>
</i>preoccupied with the artistic regeneration of Assam. Hitesh Deka’s <i>Ajir
Manuh </i>is full of promise in spite of its idealistic ending. The crime novel
has come to its own in the hand of Premnarayan Datta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
short-story, like the new<i> </i>poetry, has suffered a little in respect of
form. The range of themes is varied, the life of the humbler people has been
drawn on, some amount of translation is also there, still the <i>genre </i>does
not seem to be as full-blooded as in the thirties. Formlessness and an undue
intrusion of personal feeling weaken the stories of even Abdul Malik who is
considered to be the most notable short-story writer of the last fifteen years </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>or so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
concern for character could be felt from the forties, but writers like
Jagadishchandra Medhi and Prabodhchandra Goswami did not persist in their
experimentation. Medhi’s eye was for the pitiable villager who spent his all on
litigation while Goswami concerned himself with the reactions of the under-paid
clerk. Of the present writers Jogesh Das has a condensed style and a feeling
for atmosphere while Saurabh Chaliha an understanding of the neuroses of the
lower middle class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Assam
is a land of backward tribals, and their modes of life and relations with the
more advanced sections of the people should have offered an interesting field
for exploration to the short-story writer. The sad fact is that this virgin
source has remained almost untapped. An occasional exception is seen in a novel
like <i>Kecha Patar Kapani </i>where there are glimpses of Kachari and Khasi
life and, in a story like Medini Chaudhury’s <i>Panu, </i>about a Kachari girl.
But there are stories which have attempted to speak of the people in general;
for example, Biren Bhattacharya’s Kalang Ajiyo Bay, almost a novelette.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as such is no longer the staple of these stories: they have grown mote serious
in the meantime. Humour too seems to have evaporated from the new story, but
there is satire and caricature, as in the work of Papiya-tara, Premnarayan
Datta and Lakshminath Phookan. The Assamese story would gain much if the
technique of reportage were mastered by the younger writer for in reportage
there is observation and consideration objectivity, both essential to the
short-story writer. The war atmosphere also seems to have eluded the Assamese
writer and a whole range of experiences has remained untapped. Better knowledge
of the tribal areas and the Assam-Burma frontier, the wide scale social
upheaval caused by the advancing armies and the Burma evacuation, and unusual
personal adventures could have added richness to the literature. With the
possible exception of Hariprasad Gorkha Roy no other writer took these things
seriously. It was not possible to utilise the war material when the upheaval
was there, but by now, from a distance, it could be harnessed to creative </span><span

the drama a revitalisation has taken place as in the novel. The tendency has
been towards the social play, as in the work of Pravin Phukan. The Assamese
stage is not professional, hence in towns there is not much demand for good
plays, the cinema further making a greater claim on the interest of the people.
In the villages usually mythological and historical plays hold the stage. So
the scope for the good social or problem play is limited indeed. Even then in
the last few years two historical plays of the realistic type made stage
history by drawing full houses. <i>Maniram Dewan </i>by Pravin Phukan, and <i>Piyali
Phukan </i>by Chandranath Phukan and others held up to the public the inspiring
lives of two nineteenth-century patriots who had made attempts to dislodge the
British from Assam. The plays were well written; the characterisation was sharp
and clear, the dialogue crisp and effective and the plots had considerable
suspense. These plays were produced in the open air at Gauhati last year and
were again received well by the public. Sarada Bardaloi and Kumudchandra Barua
have attempted to write social and humorous plays. The talented Jyotiprasad
Agarwalla published <i>Labhita </i>just before his death. The setting of <i>Labhita
</i>is 1942, the August disturbances and the Allied Army occupation of Assam.
Labhita has some unhappy affairs with a soldier, becomes a social outcast,
joins the army as a nurse, goes over to the I. N. A., and finally loses her
life in the front. The play is meant for the stage and there is detailed stage
direction, as is usual in a play of Jyotiprasad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
future of the drama lies in greater education of<i> </i>the public mind, more
plays on social themes, and on Government patronage. Otherwise, in the face of
the onward march of the cinema, the stage would be amateurish and may even die
out. The recent move of the I. P. T. A. has done a little to stem the downward
trend of<i> </i>the Indian theatre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Recent
years have further seen developments in the journalistic sphere. Journalism has
trained young people to write well on a variety of themes, and at the same time
made them impatient and less painstaking where they should give more attention
and expend more energy. The war and the August movement have immensely
broadened the intellectual horizon of the younger writers, but, as it seems, it
may take some years to see the full flowering of the literary experimentation
that has been going on at present. Publication difficulties and a limited
reading public have often stood in the way of the Assamese writer’s self-expression,
though in recent years there have been publishers who have ventured to invest
money even in works of academic importance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

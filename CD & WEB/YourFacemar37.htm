<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was evening. From the terrace of my house, I was gazing at the sea and the sky. I saw the circle of the heavens smile, kissing the lips of the sea. I was lost in contemplation of the blue meeting the blue; I was so engrossed with the many day-dreams that the vision started in me, that I did not feel the time pass.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then suddenly, behind me came somebody; and sudden hands blindfolded me. By the feel of those hands, I knew who it was; by the aroma of the silk dress, I knew; by the joy that gushed in my heart, I knew; by the beat of our hearts in unison, I knew. "Hands off, Kannamma," I said, "Whom do you seek to hide yourself from?" And taking her hands off my eyes, I turned round rippling with laughter and embraced her and said, "What is the matter?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She asked: "What do you see in the breakers of the sea? What do you see in the blue sky? What do you see in the singing foam? What do you see in these tiny whirls and ripples? What good is it to you–thus constantly taking the measure of the sky with your eyes?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"In the breakers of the sea, I saw your face. In the blue sky I saw your face. In the singing foam I saw your face. In those little whirls and ripples, I saw your face. By constantly taking the measure of the sky with my eyes, I got naught but the sight of your face. And by taking your hands off my eyes and turning round rippling with laughter, and embracing you, I saw your face."</P>

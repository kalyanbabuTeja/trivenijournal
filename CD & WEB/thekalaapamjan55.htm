Kalaapam is a lyrical drama which cares not much for the dramatic sequence or
action, but can bring out the effect by a subjective exposition of the
characters themselves, accompanied by a systematic dance and tune, suggestive
of the situation. This is not mentioned as an Uparupaka in any of the works on
Sanskrit dramaturgy, but it has the essential features of an Uparupaka. As in
the Kabuki or the No of Japan, and as in the Kathakali, the famous pantomime of
Malabar, so in the Kalaapam, each and every movement of the limbs of an actor
should be apt to convey an idea, and each of the above-mentioned art forms
pursues its own traditional technique in practice and presentation. It is evidently
of the status of the Uparupaka as distinct from that of the Rupaka: “The chief
object of the ten types of dramas <i>(dasa-rupakas) </i>or Natya is to arouse
the Rasas in the minds of the spectators, while that of other types of drama
which are known as Uparupakas is to present the particular Bhavas by means of
appropriate gestures, and therefore they are known as Nritya.”<sup>1</sup> That
apart, the Kalaapam is something akin to a particular type of the recognised
Uparupakas which will be dealt with later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
diving deep into the subject, the relation of the Kalaapam to the Yakshagana
should be taken into consideration. Yakshagana is a type of indigenous drama,
peculiar to Telugu in particular and the South Indian languages in general. It
is poetry, music, dance and drama, all in one, something like the Javanese
Wayang Wong and the Yatra of Bengal. The Yakshagana seems, to have passed
through three stages in the course of its development. In the first instance it
came into being as a piece of narration set to music. Later, traditionally
trained danseuses set to rhythmic movement and gorgeous costumatic
presentation. Lastly the histrionic element took its turn and the Yakshagana,
with some of its earlier features preserved, has assumed the form of a regular
play. The Kalaapam should be ascribed to the second of the above stages, that
of an Uparupaka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
word Kalaapam, as applied to a work of the above kind, and as its meaning
stands today in the lexicons, is not quite significant of its content. Sanskrit
dictionaries like that of Monier Williams, besides giving various other
meanings, speak of it as ‘A poem written in one metre’. This is not exactly the
case with the text of a Kalaapam, but a certain metre, <i>dwipada, </i>is a
major constituent of it. The ‘Bharata Kosh’, a monumental dictionary on
Sanskrit dramaturgy compiled by Sri Manavalli Ramakrishna Kavi, gives the
meaning of Kalaapam to be a type of a certain <i>taala </i>and a <i>hasta. </i>This
hardly suits our present purpose of elucidating the meaning of the Kalaapam.
Mr. F. Kittel picks up another meaning, from common parlance, to be a quarrel
or contention and so mentions it in his Kannada-English dictionary. This to a
certain extent expounds the sense of the Kalaapam, as the main interest of the
theme really lies in a quarrel between the leading characters of the play.
There is a work called ‘Pranayakalaha Kalaapam’ in Telugu by Kovela
Raghavadasa; its title and the theme adds to the weight of Kittel’s view of
Kalaapam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

associated with the Kalaapam is the name of Kuchipudi, an <i>agrahara </i>in
the Krishna District of the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Andhra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType>, which, like Merattur and Sulamangalam in <st1:place
w:st="on">South India</st1:place>, is regarded as the venerated centre of

Besides Kalaapam, they used to perform mimicry and the popular drama, and they
also imparted instruction to the dancing girls; but their major contribution to
the world of art and the specialty about them lies in the Kalaapam. Every year,
seasonally, they used to tour every nook and corner of the country, mainly the
Andhra, in troupes, were warmly received everywhere, and on their way home
carried rich gifts. In fact their abode, Kuchipudi, was an <i>inam </i>given to
them in token of appreciation of their art. They became popular as early as the
Sixteenth Century. Dr. N. Venkata Ramanayya, M.A., Ph.D., Retired ‘Reader in
History, of the University of Madras, picks up a reference from the Local
Records, Vol. 56, pp. 66, which resumes to the above fact. From that reference,
we learn that the Kuchipudi dramatists visited the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>royal
court of Vira Narasingaraya, the then Emperor of Vijayanagara, and there is
also evidence to the fact that the ladies of the harem witnessed the Kuchipudi
show. Those were days when Kuchiptidi performances were considered to be
pleasant amusements by the man in the street and the prince in the palace
alike. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some say the Kuchipudi performances even
influenced the South Indian “People’s Theatre.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kuchipudi stage is quite a simple one. It could be constructed in an hour or
two, just on the eve of the performance, in some convenient corner of a street
with the help of a few<i> </i>bamboos serving as poles and a few<i> </i>palm
leaves to form the roof. A plain piece of cloth, supported by two men at each
end, serves as the curtain. Another couple of men hold each a country torch
called ‘kagada’ at each end. Behind the curtain <i>hangu </i>and <i>vanta</i>,<i>
</i>or the chorus and the play-back parties, take their seats with their <i>saranja
</i>or the usual musical accompaniments, the drum (Mridanga) the bellow-pipe <i>(titti)
</i>replaced afterwards by the harmonium (only for the purpose of <i>sruti), </i>and
the cymbals. The green-room is tentatively set up in some yard of a house or a
temple nearby according to convenience. ‘This is all due to the limited
resources of the performers, they being peripatetic professionals. Their stage
is simple but not the performance. It would last from 9 P. M. till day-break.
Their make-up box, the <i>ganiyam pette, </i>is a heavy treasure of a variety
of costumes, ornaments, paints and masks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

play commences with a prologue, usually a eulogy of the gods, and ends with an
epilogue, as in a Sanskrit play. During the course of the performance, the
erudite stage-manager often comes in front of the curtain and explains the
sequence of the Story to the audience with his usual eloquence; and at moments
of tedium the comedian engages the audience in an interesting jovial talk.
Enlightenment and entertainment go hand in hand in Kuchipudi performances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Siddhendra of Kuchipudi is held in high esteem as the father of the Kalaapam.
(His date is not definitely known.) His Kalaapam, thematically, is of two
kinds–the Golla Kalaapam and the Bhama Kalaapam, which are celebrated in the
rich repertoire of Kuchipudi. The two represent two aspects of the incarnation
of Sri Krishna, the spiritual and the secular. The Bengali proverb, <i>‘kanu
bina geet nai’ </i>meaning that there is no song without <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>,
suits the Telugu Kalaapam also in all its propriety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
these Kalaapams we see the characters themselves narrating their story to one
who goes under the technical name of Madhavi. Madhavi is invariably found in
every Bhama Kalaapam and, in the other, his place is often taken up by a Brahmin,
usually the stage-manager. Madhavi is something of the Vidushaka of a Sanskrit
play, and of the Lu-byet of the Burmese Nibhatkin. To be more specific, he has
a striking resemblance to the Tora-taru Kathakaraya of the Sinhalese Kolam
Natima. <sup>2</sup> Madhavi, like the latter, is the friend of every character
that appears on the stage, and at the same time behaves like an agent of the
audience for the<i> </i>purpose of introducing the characters by means of
eliciting information from them. He has no prescribed costume. He behaves like
a male with males, and like a female with females. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
is present throughout the play, but is not involved in<i> </i>it. In that he
may be called the catalytic agent of the dramatic activity </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
the Kalaapam. He is otherwise called Madhava. Madhava and Madhavi are terms
applicable to <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place> and any of his consorts
respectively, but curiously enough they are applied also to the above
theatrical agent. In the Bhama Kalaapam, <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>
and his queen Satyabhama are the protagonists. Sometimes they have no
opportunity to address each other, or anybody else involved in<i> </i>the play.
But the characters are expected to give vent to their feelings. Monologue is a
monotony in a play, and even unnatural as some argue. The above agent, it may
be presumed, might have been invented for the purpose of avoiding the
monologue. But a Madhava speaking to another Madhava, and a Madhavi to another
Madhavi, is something curious. It is almost like the characters speaking to
themselves. Herein lies the beauty of the Kalaapam; one can feel the pulse of
its lyrical element.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Golla’
in Telugu means a shepherd. It might be a corrupt form of the Sanskrit word
‘Gopala’. The Golla-Kalaapam usually begins with the song of the chorus
indicating the entrance </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of a shepherd girl, the ‘golla-bhama’,
with a pot of <i>challa </i>or butter-milk. The sing-song selling cry of hers
follows. A Brahmin usually the stage-manager, enters along with the
‘golla-bhama’ and puts her several questions in a charming and comic manner as
to the customs of her caste, the specialty of her butter-milk, and so on. While
answering them, the ‘golla-bhama’ somehow makes a context and delivers a
lengthy philosophical discourse on many themes, right from the beginning of
Creation to the salvation of the human soul. In former days this was very much
appreciated, but as days passed it was considered to be a prolix talk and a
detriment to the dramatic interest. Consequently, in later productions of this
type it was abandoned and a new character, namely Sunkari Kondayya or Kondadu,
was introduced, who became an </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>indispensable character, and appeared
under the same name in all the plays. He has a likeness to the <i>rangalo </i>of
the Gujerati </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bhavai’. ‘Sunkari’ means a toll-collector. He
is very rude by nature. He insists on the ‘golla-bhama’ paying the toll for her
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>selling the butter-milk or to give a kiss instead. She tries
to evade him. A funny quarrel takes place between the two. Their dialogue,
especially Sunkari’s, is interesting but somewhat vulgar. The play Usually
comes to a close when the termagant mother-in-law of the ‘golla-bhama’ appears
on the scene and takes away her daughter-in-law. From this the misbehaviour of
the toll-collectors </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the time can be inferred. There is yet
another point for consideration. In two Telugu Works called ‘Sunkari Kondhdu </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Veshamu-katha’
by Lala Kannayya and ‘Rangapuri Parijatam’ by Srinivasadas, it is clearly
stated that <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place> himself assumes the form
of Sunkari to test the ‘golla-bhama’. Then, one is prone to interpret the
Golla-kalaapam to be a Krishna-lila (a miracle done by Krishna), taking Sunkari
to be a symbol for <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place> and the
‘golla-bhama’ to be a symbol for Radha, His consort. Quite famous is their
romance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a fascinating and an eagerly awaited moment when the stage-manager, late in
the night, presents her close behind the curtain. It is a captivating sight, as
the curtain slowly slides down accelerating the curiosity of the audience for
some time. All of a sudden, as the country torches flare up with powdered
resin, the curtain is removed. Bhama appears in an attractive pose, and as the
cymbals are sounded, she commences movement. As the chorus give the leading
line, she calls upon Madhavi and sings the song in which she tells her tale and
explains the present problem of the play. What is that problem? A
misunderstanding, of an amorous nature, occurs between herself and <st1:place
w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place> in the bedchamber. <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>
leaves her and goes to Rukmini, his senior queen. Soon comes reentrance to
Bhama. “She feels keenly her separation from the Beloved. Now she is in the
state of a <i>kalahantarita. </i>That is not only her problem, but also of the
play. The play proper usually commences here. Bhama repeatedly sends messages
to <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>. In the end, another interesting
event takes place. It is Bhama’s quarrel with her rival, Rukmini, at last
resulting in a happy reconciliation of all. This kind of quarrel between two
wives of an individual is a popular feature in the Yakshagana and a speciality
in the Bhama Kalaapam. For this, very often, the famous Parijatapaharana story
of the ‘Bhagavata’ forms the theme. Besides this, the Bhagavata supplied many
other themes for a number of plays of they Yakshagana stock, and became a
common name for all of them; and the term Bhagavat (-ar) connotes a performer
of the Yakshaganas in general. Likewise, Parijata being the most popular of all
themes as evidenced in a host of such plays, it has come into vogue as a
general term for all plays of that type, especially of the Bhama Kalaapam
variety. Parijata is a name to conjure with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a strange correspondence between this and an Uparupaka of the same name,
i.e., ‘Parijatakam’ or ‘Parijatalata’ defined in the ninth chapter of the
‘Bhavaprakasan’ of Saradatanaya (about 1175-1250 A. D.) To compare them,
Parijata of<i> </i>the Bhama Kalaapa is in no case more than one Act. The <i>Mukha
</i>and the <i>nirvahana sandhis </i>are there, respectively, in Bhama’s separation
from Krishna in the beginning, and in her union with Him in the end. Sringara
is evidently the dominating <i>rasa, </i>and <i>vira </i>is believed to have
taken its course in the fight for the Parijata which occurs between Krishna and
Indra, the presiding deity for <i>vira rasa. </i>It is well known that Krishna
is a <i>deva </i>and hence an “Udatta-nayaka’. The role of Bhama, the heroine,
begins exactly while she is in the state of ‘Kalahantarita’. As regards the
number of heroines, Krishna’s harem of eight queens is quite famous and needs
no illustration. But only a few Bhama-Kalaapams bear evidence of the presence
of the number in full. Their proficiency in <i>dandalasaka </i><sup>3</sup> is
left for presumption. Madhavi ever and anon serves the purpose of a <i>vidushaka.
</i>The other miscellaneous items like the <i>khandatala </i>and the <i>gatha </i>are
a matter of the metrical content and may well be counterpoised respectively by
the <i>daru9vu) </i>and the <i>kanda </i>of the Kalaapam. Some other items like
the <i>apasara </i>and the <i>geya </i>mean dance and music and they are the
life of the Kalaapam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

though a few aspects may be collated as above, I do not hold that the
Parijatalata was the precursor of the. Bhama Kalaapam, or mean that the latter
is quite a suitable example of the former. This is only to show that the Bhama
Kalaapam has something in common with at least one type of Uparupaka. The other
one, the Golla Kalaapam, does not come under the scope of the recognised types
of the Uparupaka. But within its own scope, it contains the essential features
of an Uparupaka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Kalaapams fashioned after the models supplied by the Kuchipudi repertoire

Every text has also a literary interest of its own. It is a pity that most of
them are in palm-leaf manuscripts and remain unpublished. The Telugu Academy,
Kakinada, and the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras, made a
considerable collection of these manuscripts. The pristine glory of Kuchipudi

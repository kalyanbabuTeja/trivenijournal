<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>If art were only spontaneous self-expression, the
artist would do well to produce his works as unconsciously as a healthy man
breathes. Matters would then be left at that and there would be no field for
criticism. But happily, art invariably presupposes communication. The artist is
undeniably conscious of the self he wants to express, and it is his desire to
convey that sense of consciousness to the world outside his own self. Criticism
is, therefore, found to register this fact of communication which is an
essential part of the artistic process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Even as the artist composes, he has his own methods
of arranging the manifold vistas that spread before his mental eyes. He selects
and orders them in the most effective fashion. Even in the case of a few
masterpieces, written almost in a trance, such as Coleridge’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kubla Khan, </i>there is a most readily
recognizable fact of the poet’s conscious self-mastery, to organise the vision
according to the rules of English syntax, with an intelligible vocabulary and a
certain prosodic scheme. The work of creation, therefore, mostly involves
rejection of the teeming fancies with which the author’s vision is overcrowded.
The author knows that some of them are irrelevant. He will select only those
which will be communicable to a public, however limited. Thus we see that an
artist, to begin with, is his first critic, and perhaps a most pitiless one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As soon as the work reaches its very first public,
a response–either purely negative or positively approving–becomes inevitable.
This response may well be styled as literary criticism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Under modern conditions, when books have to be
printed and published, they pass through criticism at every turn of the
business. The work is submitted to a publisher who decides upon the probable
response on the part of the public. If the publisher undertakes its
publication, that means, in his opinion, the book is good, and that is an act
of criticism. The booksellers are induced to confirm the publisher’s judgment
through advertising in trade journals. The customers, in their turn, naively
perhaps, depend on the recommendations of the booksellers. Thus, at every step
in the creation, manufacture and distribution of the book, we find acceptance
or rejection, that is to say, criticism, even before a professional critic
pronounces any formal judgment on the work concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Critics are often accused of following too
literally St. Paul’s stern injunction, ‘Reprove, rebuke,’ and nothing is so
unpleasant as eternal fault-finding. To criticise, however, does not mean to
condemn; it means to judge, to try, to prove, to test, and most exactly,
perhaps, to discriminate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A fundamental objection to criticism is that it
passes judgment when there is no established or accepted code of laws.
Criticism would be legitimate if we had a dogmatic conception of what
literature should be. Impressionism may form its exact antithesis. Between
these two extremes there is room for a ‘judgment’ which is neither absolute nor
purely personal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Many prose writers, philosophers, historians,
dramatists and novelists count among the great critics: Aristotle to begin
with, Pascal, Moliere, Burke, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Zola, Anatole France; but also
an even greater array of poets. Not only mediocre ones like Boileau, Dryden,
Pope or Voltaire, but also those in whom there was an undeniable tinge of
divine madness: Horace, Dante, Du Bellay, Sir Philip Sidney, Schiller, Goethe,
Blake, Coleridge, it Wordsworth, Poe, Victor Hugo, Baudelaire, Swinburne and
Mallarme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is interesting to note that no critic so far,
purely as a critic, has achieved a rank comparable to Shakespeare’s or
Balzac’s. The writer who attained the most notable position solely for has
critical work is probably Sainte-Beuve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Another common objection to criticism is that it
destroys the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>immediacy </i>and with it
the purity and intensity of our pleasure. While admitting its partial truth it
must be stated that criticism also heightens our power of enjoyment by refining
our artistic taste. It is criticism, again, which induces the author and the
public to meet on some common platform. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The usual task of the critic, however, is one of
re-discovery and re-valuation. The critic is an interpreter from nation to
nation, from age to age, from group to group. “The great function of criticism,
when applied to works of the past, is to reveal under a puzzling variety of
forms.” Criticism, above all, makes us realise that men were men in the days of
Pericles, although they spoke a different tongue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Unfortunately criticism is subject to the many
vicissitudes of literary taste, which often varies with different ages and also
with different individuals. It, however, helps the process of preservation by
the very act of its approval of that which is eternally <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Good, Beautiful, and True. </i>It is, in the last analysis, an attempt
to define and enjoy the aesthetic or characteristic values of literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Roughly speaking, there are four types of criticism
based on the different conceptions of literature. Firstly comes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>scientific criticism. </i>It corresponds
with that definition of literature which covers everything written. Its sole
concern is to elucidate and not to judge. The most it can do is to pile up
facts about a particular author, but never can it hope to introduce any notion
of valuation, and hence it is not criticism at all. Secondly comes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dogmatic criticism </i>which corresponds
with the idealistic conception of literature, determined by some eternal
principles. Popular dogmas may be wrong, but dogmatic criticism, if ably done,
has at least a stimulating value. Thirdly comes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>literary history. </i>It corresponds with the pragmatic conception of
literature, the criterion of which is an appeal to a sufficient number of
people over a sufficient period of time. The pragmatic critic deals with only
those authors who are a chosen few of the public: Shaw, Thomas Mann, Andre
Gide, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce. Finally comes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>impressionistic criticism </i>which corresponds with the
individualistic conception of literature. Honesty of purpose is its watchword.
In the last analysis, every form of criticism has its foundation in
impressionism, for it is the self and nothing else that ultimately appreciates
literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Coming to the criticism of the century, we find
that it has amply responded to the changing social situation in much the same
way as its imaginative literature, the characteristic feature of which is the
lack of tradition to fall back upon. In fact, this lack of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tradition </i>is the key-note both to its literature and its criticism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Mr. John Crowe, the American poet, in a recent
volume of criticism, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The World’s Body, </i>states:
“The kind of poetry which interests us is not the act of a child or of that
eternal youth which is in some women, but the act of an adult mind, and, I will
add, the act of a fallen mind, since ours too are fallen.” This attitude may
well be considered to be the very basis of all modern criticism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>T. S. Eliot represents this attitude, alike through
his literary efforts and critical writings. It is, however, interesting to note
that the latter sometimes verge dangerously on the side of theology and
metaphysics. In one of his later essays he says: “You can never draw the line
between aesthetic criticism and moral and social criticism; you cannot draw a
line between criticism and metaphysics.” In his short book, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>After Strange Gods, </i>he asserts that
criticism cannot dispense with theology. This is indeed a dogmatic assertion
and one feels that this is not the way in which theology should modify criticism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Eliot’s criticism is invariably tinged with
theological implications. It is the product of a mind that is definitely aware
of its “fallen” state. He has, however, ably illuminated Elizabethan and
Jacobean poetry. He maintains that the poets of those two ages were capable of
“digesting” a far greater variety of experiences than the 18th century poets
could do. According to Eliot, therefore, experience in its fullness is only
perceptible by a “fallen” mind and so there is a theological implication behind
all his criticism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Another characteristic feature of Eliot’s criticism
is that he is out to trace the line of tradition in literature and consequently
this leads to the contemporary social environment of the writers whom he is
discussing, to morals, and, lastly, to theology. One feels that his sole aim
was to be a traditionalist both in literature and criticism. That is why
perhaps he was at home with the meta-physical poets, Pope, and Dryden. The
tradition which Eliot has adopted has its roots in the Church. This implies
sociological and educative implications. It is rather strange that in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>After Strange Gods, </i>he has restated his
traditional faith, unfortunately extending it beyond the world of literature:
“What I mean by tradition involves all those habitual actions, habits and
customs, from the most significant religious rite to our conventional ways of
greeting a stranger, which represent the blood kinship of the same people
living in the same place.” His criticism, I think, reflects the very atmosphere
of his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Waste Land. </i>His influence on
poetry and criticism was, however, far from negative. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Herbert Read, a critic of fine sensibilities, has
much in common with T. S. Eliot<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>, </i>but
differs from him in tendency. No doubt he stands for tradition, but how different
is his outlook from Eliot’s Read’s chief concern is “to<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>appreciate everything which frees man from institutionalized ways
of thinking and feeling”. Eliot was too much of a theologian to achieve such a
critical excellence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Mr. I. A. Richards stands on quite a different
level from the critics mentioned above. He is a figure by himself whose <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principles of Literary Criticism </i>was
greeted as a revolutionary book. But<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>hardly
does it seem to have revolutionized. Mr. Richards is first of all an eminent
psychologist. His chief concern, therefore, is to trace the effect of poetry on
the mind. It is gratifying to note that he is an optimist, in so far as he
hopes that such a kind of approach can sometime in future be scientifically
sound. Here, faith in the future of neurology comes to his rescue. The mind,
Mr. Richards holds, is the nervous system–a system of multitudinous responses.
The understanding of the nervous system, therefore, serves for him as the
criterion of poetry. The fundamental objection to Mr. Richards’ view is that it
ignores the very spirit of poetry, by regarding it as a means to make the
nervous system work properly. Mr. D. G. James, in his excellent book, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Scepticism and Poetry, </i>has ably brought
out the glaring fault of Richards’ <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principles
of Literary Criticism. </i>He states that it ignores the fact that poetry is a
way of apprehending the world through imagination. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Coleridge and Imagination, </i>Mr. Richards tries to supply this
omission, but he still clings to his materialist “associationism”. The value of
his works, however, lies not in the principles he lays down, derived as they
are from science whose validity will not be demonstrable until A. D. 3,000, but
in his realization of the many meanings implicit in poetry and the enthusiasm
with which he pursues them. Mr. Richards thus attempts to bring a psychological
science to bear upon the problems of the critic.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Richards’ chief disciple is William Empson who
excels him both in fineness of spirit and intricacy of perception. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Seven Types of Ambiguity </i>is an excellent
book, almost exasperatingly subtle. This book is certainly kaleidoscopic in its
variety of interests. It illuminates the different shades of meanings from
Shakespearean poetry, which it is a great pleasure to read. For one thing it deepens
our understanding of some of the richest poetry. Its greatest contribution is
towards a possibility of explanations of all the literatures of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

criticism, and is almost annoying. However, this also is useful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One thing which strikes us most in regard to modern
literary criticism is a lamentable lack of enthusiastic efforts on the part of
critics and professors to survey the field of literature in an enlightening and
perspective way. That is why there has been no interesting book in the
historical field. The only admirable “History of English Literature” is by two
French scholars Legouis and Cazamian. It is at once astonishingly scholarly and
easily readable. Ford Madox Ford’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
March of Literature </i>is, of course, an ambitious work. The book covers a
wide range of world literature, from the early Egyptian and Chinese ages down
to the present day (1939). But unfortunately the author allows himself to be
overweighed by prejudices and hence he records his own impressionistic choice
of individual works, by no means free from dogmatic assertions and unreliable
magnitude of literary level.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is high time that critical books of a historical

forth both from the literary critics and experienced professors of English
Literature. Prof. Albert Guerards <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Preface

efforts are, indeed, badly needed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Recently, there has been in evidence a Marxian
approach to literature. Sometimes it borders on absurdity. A poet like Auden,
for example, is blamed for not identifying himself with the working class
struggle. Besides, its attitude to tradition, on which Lenin so much insisted
is uncertain. Such being the case, I had better content myself with only a
casual mention of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Modern criticism has thus become all the more
complex owing to the manifold and diverse influences that have gone to the
making of the modern mind. Its tendencies are yet uncertain. Sometimes it
defeats its own purpose, as in the case of I. A. Richards. The most that could
be said about it is that it is still making its way towards a better
understanding of literature. But whether it succeeds or fails is a matter for
that inexorable factor called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Time </i>to
decide. The modern critic has indeed a more responsible and formidable duty to
perform. He is, as should only be expected, an ideal bridge between the author
and the reading public. At a time when literature itself is passing through
most puzzling stages, the literary critic, at best, is left to himself, with
hardly a hope of succeeding in his otherwise splendid enterprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is nearly sixteen years since Dr. Ananda K.
Coomaraswamy, the high priest of Indian Art, passed away from mortality to
immortality. In order to have a comprehensive view of his eminence it is
necessary to look at his life in the proper perspective. This son of a
Ceylonese father and an English mother inherited oriental imagination and
occidental thoroughness. His father, Sir Mathu Coomaraswamy Mudaliar was a
scholar and a barrister from an ancient Tamil family. He was also a member of
the Legislative Council of Ceylon in the middle of the last century and he was
the first knight in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>. His mother Miss
Kentish belonged to a notable English family. Thus in Coomaraswamy the idealism
of the East and the intense practicalism of the West were harmoniously blended.
Though he returned to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ceylon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
at the age of 25 as the Director of Mineralogical Survey, he quickly discovered
himself and his mission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Till
then he had no idea of the oriental heritage. His upbringing and education were
out and out Western like that of Sri Aurobindo. He was well versed in Greek and
Latin long before he knew Sanskrit and Pali. He got a Doctorate for his
researches in Natural Sciences (Botany and Geology.) In spite of this helpful
background–he made up the leeway by colossal strides. He clearly perceived the
damage caused to oriental culture by the indiscriminate imposition of Western
civilization. His conviction cost him his career. He gladly gave up his job and
spontaneously and wholeheartedly devoted himself to the serious study of Indian
Art, Culture, Literature and Philosophy. His first wife Ethel Mary, was a
marvellous companion in the work. His monumental work, “Mediaeval Sinhalese
Art” was produced with </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>her co-operation. His second wife
Ratandevi did the work on Indian songs. Srimathi Dona Luisa Coomaraswamy, a
savant from </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
who was more a chela than a wife, assisted him in his later day work with
sympathy and co-operation. In his civilization it takes two to make marriage
successful. Evidently children are not enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Besides,
he was an accomplished linguist well versed in English, French, German, Latin,
Greek, Sanskrit, Pali and Hindi. He also knew something of Italian, Spanish,
Icelandic, Dutch, Persian and Sinhalese. Above all he had a long vision, a keen
perception, a rare balance of judgement and an impersonal attitude towards
things. Gentle in speech, perfect in manners and unruffled by any hostile
criticism, tall, of acquiline features and of distinguished bearing, he wore
European clothing, but always with a turban. His thoughtful eyes, his
impressive beard, his sensitive nose and fingers–all these symbolised the
scholar. He lived a pucca Hindu life in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Not a day passed without
his brow being adorned by the brilliant sandal paste and kumkum. Thus he chose
to reside in a Western land to serve the East better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

saw around him a hybrid culture fast taking roots and transforming the fairy
East into a colourless <st1:place w:st="on">Eurasia</st1:place>. In this
connection he travelled extensively in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
and the Eastern countries gathering material for his life-work. In 1917 he was
appointed as a Research Fellow in Indian, Persian and Muhammadan Art at the <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fine Arts</st1:PlaceName>
at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boston</st1:place></st1:City> and
later became the Curator of the section of Indian and Far Eastern Art, where he
remained as such till he retired a month prior to his passing </span><span

on 9-9-1947. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
he came on the scene, Indian Art was a curious mixture of undigested
archaeology, Pedantic views and a Western approach to thoroughly Indian concepts.
He laid stress on the symbolical, metaphysical and aesthetic background,
without a knowledge of which it is almost impossible to comprehend the
subtleties of Indian Art, which is associated with the Indian way of life. He
was justly regarded as one of the greatest scholars in that field. Under his
guidance the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Boston</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> acquired choice
collections on Eastern Arts, which have come to be regarded as the most
important in the world. With his convincing logic and careful analysis he
succeeded in putting Indian Art in the category of the great arts of the world.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
mission was to interpret the Hindu civilization of old to modern Hindu society
so that it could help their cultural revival. While E. B. Havell spoke in terms
of abstract philosophy and Vincent Smith was only a dry chronicler, Dr.
Coomaraswamy was the real aesthetie (Rasagna) of high order. With his
persuasive </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and forceful style he turned apathy and
hostility into sympathetic understanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
supporting the Swadeshi Movement, he pleaded for the revival of our ancient
arts and crafts and pleaded for avoiding cheap imitation of Western
Industrialism. He put forth a strong plea for National Education and invariably
stressed on spiritual and cultural values. He advocated a principled, orderly
and integrated life of joy and beauty and valued development of personality
over acquisition of knowledge. Thus the Indian Renaissance was completely
summed up and expressed in him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Referring
to the Brahminical caste system he dared to maintain that, “it is the nearest
approach that has yet been made towards a society, where there shall be no
attempt to realise a competitive equality, but where all interests are regarded
as identical.” To those who admit variety of age in the human souls this must appear
to be the only true explanation. One cannot alter suddenly his subconscious
heritage. Democracy is not standardising of every one so as to obliterate all
peculiarity. We cannot put our souls in uniform. Freedom consists in making the
best of what we have our parentage, physical capacity and mental gifts.
Evidently, “the institution of caste illustrates the spirit of comprehensive
synthesis, characteristic of the Hindu mind with its faith in the collaboration
of races and co-operation of cultures,” as Dr. S. Radhakrishnan
epigrammatically put it. Though it developed later into an instrument of
oppression and intolerance and tended to perpetuate inequality and developed
exclusiveness, originally it was the outcome of tolerance and trust. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He deeply deplored that, “A single generation of
English education succeeded in breaking the threads of tradition and created
nondescript and superficial beings deprived of roots–a sort of intellectual
pariahs belonging neither to the East nor to the west, neither the past nor the
future.” He even warned that “Our leaders are already denatured, quite as much
as Lord Macaulay could have wished them to be, a class of persons Indian in
blood and colour but English in tastes and opinions, in morals and intellect,
because they have yet to ‘discover’ India; they have not realised that the
modern world is no longer an integrated culture, but an organised barbarism,
and political pandemonium”. Though Macaulay’s method of education has come to
its natural end, it will take many long years yet for Indians to recover their
spontaneity. He emphasised plain living and high thinking. Easy and pleasant
life made possible by modern times is not the essence of civilization. It is a
living spirit and not a mechanical apparatus. He has shown how absurd it is to
exalt the economic man by ignoring the common man in every man, how very
suicidal to attempt to live by bread alone, and how disastrous to embark on a
rudderless voyage under the illusion that it is progress. We are not a rootless
people deriving fickle inspiration from transient fashions. Nations, like
individuals, become great, not by what they gather, but by what they give away.
When the culture that we know and propose to restore was alive, learned men of
foreign countries came in large numbers, even though the communications were
primitive and the means of transport almost none, to study in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Therefore, “the measure of our culture” as Dr. Coomaraswamy observed “is not
our ability to learn new tricks but that of what we have to give,” He insisted
on adherence to tradition with a capital “T”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
regarded Indian women as the best conservators of our culture, since they have
not yet been “brought uptodate.” His observation that “literacy in the modern
world of magazines, newspapers and Radio is no guarantee of culture whatever,
and it is far better not to know how to read and hear than not to know what to
read and hear” is significant. Indian women, wellversed in the lore of Ramayana
and Mahabharata, working selflessly for the joint family, may be unlettered,
but are not uncultured. Literacy is not education and education is not culture.
Writing on the future of Indian women he pleaded that, “it would be worth-while
to pause before we make haste to emancipate, that is to say, reform and
industrialise the oriental woman. For it is not for <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>
alone that she preserves a great tradition in our age that is otherwise
preoccupied. If she should be persuaded to expend her powers upon externals,
there might come a time on earth when it could not be believed that such women
had ever lived as the ancient poets describe. It would be forgotten that woman
had ever been unselfish, sensuous and shy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Born
with a keen aesthetic sensibility and a discerning appreciation of beauty in
life and art and seeing so much of the beauty of the old world all about him in
ancient monuments. Decaying arts and crafts and in the art traditions of his
people he felt an irresistible impulse to devote his life and talents for their
regeneration and survival. It is his intuition that enabled him to see the
spirit and meaning behind the forms of Indian Art. His critical studies of the
various aspects of Indian Art have depth of knowledge, a penetrating mind and
an understanding of high order. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
contribution to the elucidation of the various facets of Indian Art was
monumental. We have no doubt a good number of artists and art-critics,
undoubtedly famous, great in their own way, but small in stature when compared
with Dr. Coomaraswamy. “Occasionally” says the Italian historian, Vasary,
“Heaven bestows upon a single individual beauty, grace and ability so that
whatever he does, every action is so divine that he distances all and clearly
displays how his genius is the gift of God, and not an acquirement.” It was
evident in Dr. Coomaraswamy whose genius could not be exaggerated and whose
abilities were so extraordinary that he could readily interpret every aspect of
Indian Art in the most original way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reading
his last work, “Why Exhibit Works of Art” (published in 1943) one realises with
what concentrated enthusiasm, immense patience and profound scholarship he
applied himself to his self-imposed duty of interpreting Indian thought forms.
He saw beauty and the form of God in such beauty. As a great man he saw many
things which others did not see. When one reads Coomaraswamy one feels like
listening to the voice of a Socrates, a Plato, a Vyasa or a Sankara. He took no
sectional or compartmental view of life or the achievements of mankind. He did
his life work at a Yogic level and the gain to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the world’s eye has been
immense. As a connoisseur he did open a new vista by revealing the past
achievements of the ancient masters and also showing the way to the younger
generation to discriminate art objects in their proper light and spirit. The
art of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
before his time was covered under the debris of age-long indifference and
ignorance of its own people and its tradition and ideals were as good as dead.
If today Indian art has become not only a great asset of the nation but is one
of the cherished possessions of the civilized world, it is mostly due in a
large measure to his genius and efforts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tremendous upsurge of awakening of art and thought in <st1:country-region

impetus from him. He was actively associated with a number of learned bodies in
the East and the West. He urged the Indian students going abroad for studies
not to lose their culture, tradition and individuality, but to act as the
accredited representatives of their country. His contribution to Indian Renaissance
was unique and can be favourably compared with the combined contribution of
Western savants, like E. B. Havel, Fergusson, Sir John Marshall, Percy Brown
and others. He was without a peer as a scholar among the Orientalists. It would
be a discovery if one could find another like him anywhere whose studies and
publications cover as wide a range and are at the same time as numerous in
quantity, and as excellent in quality. His interpretation of the various facets
of our heritage was classic alike for imagination, originality, dignity of
phrasing and loftiness of thought. He took no sectional or compartmental view
of life. He was noted for creative thinking and there was invaluable matter in
whatever he said. He combined in himself the dignity of a master and the
humility of a disciple. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

affectation, belief a dogma, and behaviour a habit. But he had the faith and
the vision to apprehend spirituality in our heritage. He did not hesitate to
subordinate intellect to intuition, in spite of the fact that he was brilliant
beyond words. He preferred inward realisation to outward experience. He
demonstrated that our beliefs primarily intended to foster and promote
spiritual life are in accordance with nature and the laws of the world of
reality. His theories were not so much dogmatic dicta as transcripts from life.
He was truly a perfected soul and reminds us of Valmiki, Vyasa, Vachaspati and
Vidyaranya, the greatest savants of antiquity. Above all his interpretation was
inspired. He became for Vedic religion and philosophy what once Philo of
Alexandria had been for the religious thought of the Jews. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

alive he secured a place in history. For the fourteenth edition of the
Encyclopedia Britanica he contributed eight articles on Oriental Art. Up to its
thirteenth edition this publication ignored Indian and Asian Art. He was also
invited to write to the National Encyclopedia of America on Eastern Art. In the
fitness of things he was called upon to edit “Words of Indian Origin” for
Webster’s New International Dictionary. He produced the monumental work “Myths
of Hindus and Buddhists” in collaboration with Sister Nivedita. He wrote his
earliest work on Indian Dancing “Mirror of Gestures” with the help of
Andhraratna D. Gopalakrishnayya. He covered Oriental Art and Culture region by
region, period by period and piece by piece. It is no exaggeration to say that
he reigned supreme in the realm of Oriental Art with regal dignity and utter
simplicity. His supremacy had something like the authority of a natural
element. He was the finest flower of Oriental culture and radiated fragrance
far and wide. It<b> </b>is no wonder that the whole world bowed in rapt
veneration before him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dr. Coomaraswamy was so immersed in his work that he
never expressed himself in a reminiscent mood and indeed very little is known
to the outside world about his private life. He was modest to the point
self-effacement. His stock reply to any enquiry about his personal life was,
“anything personal, anything do with my own life must not intrude in my work,
it would ‘Aswargya’ to allow such things any space……Not I, the I that I am, but
He, is the part in me that should interest you.” It may be of pathetic interest
to note that Narada his son by Ratandevi who showed signs of becoming a great
novelist was killed in an aeroplane crash. His daughter Rohini who is an expert
musician is lost to the East being under the spell of the West. Fortunately his
widow Mrs. Dona Luisa Coomaraswamy, proved to be a true Ardhangi and a
veritable Sahadharmacharini. In the fitness of things she has undertaken the
task of editing several books, that Dr. Coomaraswamy had almost finished, and
are nearly ready for publication. Their son Rama who had his early education in

principal Indian and Asian languages and institute professorial chairs on Art
at the various Universities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

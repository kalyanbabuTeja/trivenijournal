last twelve years following the achievement of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s freedom have been marked by
a tidal wave of renaissance in the fields of literature, arts, and music.
Foreigners left our country, a national </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
all activities pertaining to the nation’s culture. With the coming of peaceful
and stable times, people evinced a new enthusiasm for all kinds of arts. Under
the cover of a newly-found spacious phrase, ‘Cultural Programme,’ dramas, dance
recitals, ‘<span class=SpellE>tamasha’s</span> and musical concerts are being
arranged endlessly. Not a day passes, but some sort of a cultural programme is
billed somewhere in every city. What with the birth and death anniversaries of
dear departed artists, and the Annual Day celebrations of institutions, some
excuse or other is easily available for all the three hundred and sixty five
days of the year for these so-called cultural programmes. Huge attendance is
the order of the day. Economists continue to tell us that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a poor
country; and the <span class=SpellE>organisers</span> of musical concerts
continue to raise enormous incomes, in spite of prohibitive admission prices.
Whenever people want to raise funds for an institution, they plan an ambitious
cultural programme. Half a dozen dramas, <span class=GramE>two</span> or three
musical concerts, and a ‘<span class=SpellE>tamasha</span>’ under the
new-fangled name ‘<span class=SpellE>Lokanatya</span>’! This is enough to bring
in tons of money! Looking at this flood of cultural programmes and the public
enthusiasm which they evoke, one cannot help thinking that our cultural level
must have gone up very <span class=SpellE>very</span> high during the last
twelve years, and it will most decidedly touch the very heavens soon, if the
present craze for cultural programmes continues! God save our culture in case
it reaches the height of <st1:place w:st="on">Mount Everest</st1:place>!
Scientists tell us that breathing is rather difficult on dizzy altitudes! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Today,
people flock in their thousands to musical concerts. Sixty years ago two or
three hundred people were considered a fairly good attendance at a musical
concert. But, now, these concerts have assumed colossal proportions. The fees
of the artists have also mounted up amazingly. The great <span class=SpellE>Rahimatkhan</span>
was after all an ‘<span class=SpellE>Avaliya</span>’ who did not charge a
single farthing for his incomparable music. But top-ranking artists like <span

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be heard on payment of
a mere fifty or seventy-five rupees. The current charges of first-class artists
have to be measured in terms of thousands. Formerly, the ‘<span class=SpellE>tabla</span>’
player used to be quite content if he was paid ten rupees. Now he would not
touch the ‘<span class=SpellE>tabla</span>’ unless he receives a crisp
hundred-rupee note. Be it summer or winter, thousands of men and women flock to
musical concerts today, pay fabulous admission fees, give generous rounds of
applause, and manifest their appreciation with such zest that the performing
artists might feel as though they were celestial ‘<span class=SpellE>gandharva’s</span>
come to earth for the benefit of the mortals! Ample proof is provided that,
apart from many other forms of madness which may or may not be attributed to
us, we are music-mad! Throughout the length and breadth of the country, there
goes on, today, day and night, a continuous swell of music! Surely our music
has today achieved a spring-time bloom, as never before! Surely, our people
have cultivated a remarkable understanding and love of music! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the range of his voice, or fill us with ecstasy by the limpid sweetness of
his voice? Can we mention an artist who has a stock of four or five hundred ‘<span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Measure today’s musicians and instrumentalists by
their study and knowledge, and they would look mere dwarfs in comparison with
the former giants. There were no microphones in the days gone by, and yet

such <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> that their music could be heard by the
last man in the farthest corner of the crowd. The feeble-voiced musicians of
today require half a dozen microphones, without which their music would not
reach beyond the first three rows of chairs. Musicians of the past generation
sang for seven to eight hours, Today’s concerts have shrunk in the dimension of
time, like the present-day theatrical performances. <span class=GramE>A couple
of ‘<span class=SpellE>ragini’s</span>, a ‘<span class=SpellE>thumri</span>’ or
‘<span class=SpellE>kazri</span>’, and a ‘<span class=SpellE>bhajan</span>’!</span>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Could
it be said that there has come about an appreciable increase in people’s
understanding of music? Amongst the thousands who crowd at a musical concert,
how many souls can be found who possess a true understanding of music? How many
who have at least an elementary knowledge of the twelve musical notes? How many
who can tell ‘<span class=SpellE>trital</span>’ from ‘<span class=SpellE>dadara</span>’?
How many who know how many strings the ‘<span class=SpellE>tambora</span>’ has,
and in what notes they are set? Most of the men and women who flock to the
musical concerts come because it is the current fashion to do so, and because
it gives them an occasion to display their costly, fantastic clothes. There is
hardly any difference between the crowd at a musical festival and the mammoth <span

wrong would it be then to point out the present popularity of musical concerts
and to argue that the financial success of these concerts is a sure indication
that the knowledge and love of music are spreading fast, and that our music is
progressing as it had never done before? On the contrary, there is enough
reason to suspect that the present growth of our music is only a misleading,
unhealthy obesity. The time has surely come when we must seriously think who
are the true promoters of our music, and who mere pretenders to the title,
camouflaged enemies? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
inherent strength and beauty of our music are undoubtedly such that it should
have a perennial appeal, unaffected by the passage of time or the change of
environment. It is usual to say that, while the principle of ‘harmony’ rules
Western music, our music is principally governed by ‘melody’. It would be
simpler to remark that two fundamental features of our music are the ‘raga’
classification and the concept of the ‘<span class=SpellE>tala</span>’, out of
which have arisen the various ‘<span class=SpellE>tala</span>’ patterns. Those
who formulated and organized our music have developed both these features with
such thoroughness and such aesthetic sense that we have every reason to feel
deeply proud of our music, and even to believe that our music is incomparably
superior to the music of other countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The urgent need of the hour in the field of our music is two-fold. We must
abandon certain time-worn practices and myths, and we must graft on our music a
few new ideas. We are guilty of certain sins of commission and also of some
sins of omission. We shall succeed in preserving, and also enriching, the great
traditions of our music only if we are prepared to discard fossilized ideas and
to adopt certain new vigorous concepts, with a view to widen the appeal. of our
music. It would require a separate long article to examine the traditionally
accepted idea that specific ‘raga’s must be sung at prescribed hours of the day
and night, and also the idea that specific ‘raga’s evoke specific ‘<span
class=SpellE>rasa’s</span> (that is ‘emotional moods’), and to prove how both
these ideas are unscientific. I shall, therefore, content myself here with
suggesting that the time has surely come when connoisseurs–and, of course, the
performing artists, too–must reassess the values of our musical ideas and
practices.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

though concerts of classical music draw large crowds of listeners, it will be
foolish to conclude that its appreciation has become wide-spread. On the
contrary, there are undeniable indications that there is a widening gulf
between ‘classical music’ and ‘light music’, and the public are being
increasingly drawn towards the latter. And no one is more responsible for this
growing popular distaste for classical music than the musicians themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us remember that what is known as ‘classical music’ is, after all, essentially
a science and not an art. Its appeal is to the ‘intellect’, and not to the
‘heart’, Classical music may thrill the listener’s intellect, but it does not
have the power to create emotional rapture. It is usual to say that music is an
art. But an art aims at arousing the exuberance of an emotional mood; and
classical music–however expertly sung–can never produce this effect. Faithful
purity of notes, the perfect correctness of ‘raga’, and the clever execution of
‘<span class=SpellE>laya</span>’ patterns–these are indeed wonderful forms of
artistry, which mark the first-rate performance of classical music. They will
indeed be hugely enjoyable. But the experience of the listener will have to be
described as ‘intellectual joy’–not ‘emotional delight’. Patterns of melody,
emanating from a human voice or an instrument, however rich and astounding they
may be, will fail to produce what I would like to call ‘the complete and full
delight’ of music, which can arise only from the co-<span class=SpellE>ordinated</span>
blending of melody, words, their meaning, and their emotional suggestion. The
present ever-widening gulf between classical music and light music will be
bridged only if our musicians and artists realise this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the old days, music thrived under royal patronage. Today, it has to live on
public support. Formerly, the role of the common people was that of mere
listeners. Now, they are also the patrons of music. As a result of this change,
our musicians must carry out the delicate and difficult task of at once
pleasing the public and cultivating in their minds a musical taste of a high
order. On the one hand, they must acquaint the people with all the glories of
classical music, and, on the other hand, they must <span class=SpellE>instil</span>
as much artistic element in their performance as they can, so that listeners
will derive, from their music, true emotional delight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

acrobatics of ‘melody’ and ‘<span class=SpellE>tala</span>’ that they strike
the listener as emotionally dehydrated products which do not have the power to

impression which can be gathered after attending concerts of classical music is
that our musicians do not ‘sing’. They only go on playing on the instrument of
their voice, utterly ignoring the words of the composition, their meaning, not
to speak of their emotional suggestion. They do not give ‘music’, but only
long-winded bundles of repetitive monotonous ‘<span class=SpellE>tana’s</span>.
They mislead the audience into believing that these acrobatics constitute
Indian music, and the poor ignorant souls who make the majority of the crowd
swallow this misconception. People who come to listen to renowned musicians and
instrumentalists want to witness a cock-fight between the artist and the ‘<span
class=SpellE>tabla</span>’ player. And, since such a cock-fight is the easiest
thing to perform, the artists oblige the crowd most willingly and repeatedly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

musical concert ought to be an artistic piece–like a lecture. Just as a lecture
must be a composite progressive whole, each succeeding point arising logically
out of the preceding, a musical concert too must be marked by a delightful
logical development–first the skilful ‘filling’ of the ‘<span class=SpellE>ragini</span>’,
then the transition to the ‘<span class=SpellE>tana’s</span>, followed by the ‘<span
class=SpellE>bol</span> <span class=SpellE>tana’s</span>, then the full-<span
class=SpellE>chested</span> ‘<span class=SpellE>jamak</span> <span
class=SpellE>tana’s</span>’. And, above all, the basic composition–of which ‘<span
class=SpellE>tana’s</span> and ‘<span class=SpellE>meend’s</span> and ‘<span
class=SpellE>murki’s</span> are after all the decorations–must be presented
again and again with all its implications of meaning and emotion. If this does
not happen, the performance, however renowned the artist may be, cannot be
called a musical concert. It becomes a ‘<span class=SpellE>tamasha</span>’.
People have come to be fond of such ‘<span class=SpellE>tamasha’s</span>. The
musicians and artists say to the public, “Please yourselves, have ‘<span
class=SpellE>tamasha’s</span>.” The musicians and artists cheat themselves and
their public. The people, in<i> </i>their turn, applaud the artists and cheat
them. Everyone joins in a huge hoax. A vicious circle of ignorance and humbug
goes round. There arises an illusion of music’s progress. In truth, true
musical talent and appreciation are both rapidly declining. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the old days, music had to be studied under a master. The pupil had to live in
the master’s house and win his good opinion and <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
by personal service. Now, there are classes and schools and colleges where
courses of musical instructions are taught. I am prepared to admit the
importance and value of bookish instruction and degrees. But there are certain
arts and branches of ‘knowledge which cannot be acquired from mere books and
courses. Their acquisition can come only from personal association, from close
contact between the teacher and the taught, and from years and years of
continued teaching and patient practice. Such devoted practice is today being
ignored. Artists hanker after cheap degrees. Even small lanes are crowded with
‘<span class=SpellE>Sangit-Ratna’s</span> and ‘<span class=SpellE>Sangit-Acharya’s</span>!

music is progressing, if at all, in a horizontal line. Its vertical progress is
lamentable. Theoretically, one cannot object to books on music or courses of
musical studies and degrees. But there is definite danger in over-estimating
their value. First-class artists were never manufactured in schools and
colleges. The Goddess of Art will never smile on an artist who regards art as a
mere means of livelihood. Such devotees will always stand in ankle-deep,
shallow waters of knowledge. They will never reach the depths of what our
ancient musicians have described (in many a musical composition) as an ‘ocean
of music’. In the light of the light-hearted attitude of the present musicians
towards the study and practice of music, anecdotes of the bone-shattering <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>, which the older musicians took, seem like fantastic
fairy tales. These artists of the older generation, whose names are deservingly
recorded as of giants, spent twelve to sixteen hours a day on their practice.
We are told that they spent several hours of the early morning in perfecting
their ‘<span class=SpellE>kharja</span>’. It is foolish to imagine that the
science of ‘Voice Culture’ was unknown to our ‘maestro’s, and that one must go
to America to initiate oneself in this science. All the present ills in the
field of our music arise from the fact that our musicians do not want profound
knowledge, do not want <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and effort, do not want
years and years of study. They want only one thing–cheap and quick publicity.
This is killing our music! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of today are as guilty as the artists. No one seems to realise that listening
to music is as much an art as music itself. To hear music is certainly not an
irresponsible pastime to be indulged in by any one who can fling a few rupees
and buy a seat in the concert hall. The capacity to appreciate music–and
specially our classical music–can come only after one learns to, understand at
least the elements of ‘<span class=SpellE>swara</span>’ and ‘<span
class=SpellE>tala</span>’, and the ‘raga’ classification. How many listeners of
such capacity can be found in the crowds which attend today’s musical
festivals? These vast audiences possess a crowd mentality, and </span><span

musical taste is shallow and vulgar. Our artists naturally sing and play to the
gallery, and stoop to conquer, sinking to the level of dolts and fools. Real
high-class music is thrown to the winds, and there takes place an exhibition of
cheap acrobatics. One could wish there existed even a single courageous and
honest artist who would pull the ears of the audience and tell them that what
they applaud is not real music. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the glamour of publicity. Music in which there is a beautiful blending of
science and art is becoming rarer and rarer. Ignorant people are pretending
that they possess a great love of music, and artists are fooling such audiences.
The future of our music would be bright and hopeful only if this vicious circle
is broken, and only if both the artists and the listeners begin to understand
their respective duties and responsibilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

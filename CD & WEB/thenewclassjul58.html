the time of the second Russian Revolution, Kautsky and most of the orthodox
Marxists considered that Lenin ought not to have taken power but should have supported
the democratic republic, under which, in Lenin’s words, <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> was for
eight months “the freest country in the world.” They argued that according to
the Marxian theory the socialist revolution ought not to have taken place in <st1:country-region

should have come first in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>,

has been heard of this argument lately. The revolutionary regime has grown very
powerful and is spreading fast, and the protest that Marx thought it ought to
have started somewhere else is apt to seem a mere debating point. However, it
is more than that. Together with his scholasticism, there is much shrewd
political sense in Marx. Though his tactics were not entirely consistent, there
can be no doubt that the main drift of his doctrine supports <span
class=SpellE>Kautsky’s</span> protest against Lenin’s opportunism. “New and
higher social institutions are never established until the material conditions
of life to support them have been prepared in the womb of the old
society...mankind never sets for itself any tasks except those for which it has
received the proper training and which it is able to perform.” Translated out
of Marx’s metaphysical language, that is sound common sense. <span
class=SpellE>Engels</span> pointed the moral with an emphatic warning of the
embarrassing situation a socialist party wou1d find itself in, if it were to
come to power too soon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and <span class=SpellE>Engels</span> argued that a highly developed capitalist
economy would have built up the pre-conditions necessary to central control,
whereas in a backward economy such pre-conditions would not exist, and the
socialists would have the difficult and unpopular job of constructing them. In
such a society the public would still be ‘feudal’ in mentality, alternating
between slavish submission and anarchic self-assertion; the democratic outlook
and habit would be ill-developed; the rights of the individual would not be
firmly grounded in public opinion and could be infringed with impunity; and
democracy would be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Further, the proportion of industrial workers, the principal supporters of
socialism, would be small, and they would be ill-educated and without the
‘proper training’ to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>run the State and the economy. The
economy would, in any case, be unable to provide a reasonable standard of
living for all. In such a situation a socialist party in power would be unable
to fulfill the promises implied in its socialist slogans of liberty, equality,
democracy and prosperity. In order to stay in power it would have to set up a
dictatorship; in order to obtain efficiency it would have to permit extreme
differences of reward; and in order to develop the economy it would have to
hold down the standard of life and compel the workers to give up a big slice of
surplus value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

equality, no democracy; even prosperity will be very slow in coming; but in the
hands of the ruling group or individual there will be such power as no ruler

is doubtful if Marx’s exalted vision of socialism was realistic in any respect.
Even if the revolution had been postponed, as he desired, until capitalism had
fully “solved the problem of production,” it might well have failed to achieve
the ideal society he foretold. Whether, in the long run, economic socialism and
political democracy are compatible is highly problematic. Probably the soundest
conclusion from the experience of the past century is that, while the threat of
revolution may be progressive, its actuality is to be avoided.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

great harm. We cannot expect a premature revolution to lead to the ideal goal
after a brief transition period. The direction of social evolution has been
drastically changed, and to get back to a world in which the liberal principles

in a Yugoslav jail in 1956, and smuggled out and published abroad–the first
time that anything of the kind has happened in a communist country–<i>The New
Class </i>earned its author an additional sentence of seven years. As a former
guerrilla leader and party theorist he had been one of the ruling group round
Tito, and one of the top personalities in world communism, grudgingly admired
by Stalin as ‘a very frank man’. But, alone of all the men <span class=SpellE>rvho</span>

said so. <i>The New Class </i>is the considered judgment on communism of a man

Khrushchev’s speech on Stalin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

purpose, however, is not indictment but analysis. It argues that the way in
which the communist societies have developed is to be explained in the Marxian
terms by the evolution of the communist party, or its upper ranks, into a new
ruling and exploiting class. Addressed to fellow-Marxists, that conclusion is
enough. Their theoretical aim is to abolish classes, and if he has proved that
they have not succeeded, he has made his point. For non-Marxists the
implications are not so devastating. There are ruling classes and ruling
classes, and though, even at their best, we may not like them, we are not so
impatient to get rid of them. What is devastating about the communist ruling
authorities, whether they are a class or not, is the way they behave to those

that the communist parties are forcing socialism upon societies which, according

he is right to assert that there is a connection between communism and economic
backwardness. He also sees that there is a connection between backwardness and
the continuance of violence long after the revolutionary crisis. “In earlier
revolutions, revolutionary force and violence became a hindrance to the economy
as soon as the old order was overthrown. In communism revolutionary force and
violence are a condition for further development. Force and violence are
elevated to the lofty position of a cult and an ultimate goal. In the past, the
classes and forces which made up a new society already existed before the
revolution erupted. The communist revolutions are the first which have had to
create a new society.” (Pages 21-22). It is not his purpose to go into detail,
but he remarks that communist methods “are perhaps the most brutal ones
recorded in history.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

magnitude of the task of transformation brought it about that the party was
uncommonly dogmatic and fanatical. “None had, before, the task of transforming
all of society. For such a task a complete, fanatical confidence in the
righteousness and nobility of their views is necessary. Such a task calls for
exceptionally brutal measures against other ideologies.” (Pages 76-77). He
devotes a whole chapter to ideological dictatorship, and reserves for it his
harshest condemnation. “A sword hangs over Yugoslav culture, but the sword has
been driven into the heart of Soviet culture. “The Communist oligarchy cannot
but accomplish complete corruption of the mind.” “History will pardon
Communists for much...But the stifling of every divergent <span class=GramE>thought,</span>

adopted, these power-wielders pay the least attention to <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
and manpower, regarding them as something very little value which can be
readily replaced.” <span class=GramE>(Page 120).</span> This is the normal
mentality of the backward society, with its vast gulf between the educated
administrative class and the illiterate masses who cost nothing for education,
swarm everywhere in greater numbers than can be employed, and are constantly
reinforced by reckless procreation. In a highly developed capitalist economy,
the workers output and wages rise, their birthrate falls, their numbers
diminish, their education costs money; in short no employer or government can
afford to treat them as “something of very little value.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all-round moral decline<i> </i>of communism after taking power is a puzzling

emotions in art more readily than in practice. The mediaeval noble solemnly
proclaimed his belief that his high social status should be the reward of
virtue: he commiserated with the poor, enunciated the principle of the equality
of men, and long before John Ball, sang “When Adam delved and Eve span, who was
then the gentleman?” In the same way he professed the ideal of courtly love,
while his actual sexual conduct was shameless. All this high principle and
devotion to Christian ethics remained stereotyped and theoretical.” “The soul
of the middle ages, ferocious and passionate, could only have been led by

us make what allowance we can for men brought up in a mediaeval social climate
which makes them schizophrenic. Still the puzzle is not solved. Lenin was an
honest and clear-headed man, completely free from sordid ambition. He was under
no compulsion when in 1903 he began to think out and put into practice the plan
of party organisation which, as he knew, and <span class=SpellE>Martov</span>,
Trotsky and Luxemburg also knew, would end, if he succeeded, in making him the
Robespierre of Russia. They called him by that name long before the revolution.
Stalin was under no compulsion when, long before Hitler took power in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, he
decided to launch a series of plans which frantically over-stressed the heavy
industries and neglect consumer goods. M. No Roy, who knew him intimately at
that time, has told us why he did it: it was to build up an invincible army
which should force socialism on the rest of the world. Stalin need not have
decided to <span class=SpellE>collectivise</span> agriculture, an operation
which, as he confessed to Churchill, cost the lives of ten million peasants. He
need not have given the series of orders which allowed his police to set up the
<span class=SpellE>labour</span> camps, herd scores of millions of innocent
people into them, kill those people off by tens of millions, and keep the
system going for twenty-five years. These policies were carried out in
pursuance of the same end: the building up of overwhelming military power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the man-made horrors which have befallen our long suffering race have
resulted from quandaries, deadlocks, situations of Compulsion, from which there
was no harmless way out. The communist policy of forcing socialism on societies
which were not ripe for it did not result from any such situation. It was a
free decision, made by men who, as well-read Marxists, knew the evil
consequences prophesied for it by their own theoretical masters. Yet they did
it. Why?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

senseless race of the ‘leading Socialist country’–the U.S.S.R.–to overtake and
surpass the most highly developed countries. What does this cost? And where
does it lead? Perhaps the U.S.S.R. can overtake some branches of the economy of
the most highly developed countries. By infinite waste of manpower, by low
wages, and by neglect of the other branches of industry, this may be possible.
It is quite another question whether this is economically justifiable. Such

industrialisation, concentrating on power could still be </span><span

power in the hands of its rulers. This prospect also is intoxicating to those
who can identify themselves with the rulers, as all middle-class people now
can. It is typical that the nationalist-socialists now in power should rush
ahead into grandiose industrial constructions, beyond the capacity of the
economy to pay for, and before taking care of the primary necessities of the
poor in whose name socialism is being set up. It is reminiscent of the

popular discontent. It is bound to continue doing so, and eventually to bring
about the downfall of the present ruling party. If the passion for socialism
continues to animate the intelligentsia, the result must ultimately be to
transfer power to the fanatical party which will scrap democracy, ignore the
suffering and suppress the protests of the masses, and force socialism through
at any cost–the Communist Party. The only hope is that while there is still

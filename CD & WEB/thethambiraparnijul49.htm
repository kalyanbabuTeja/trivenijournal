Punnaikayal where it meets the Eastern sea, it is only 75 miles long and, at
its broadest, at Srivaikuntam, it is less than half a mile across. Compared
with it, the Godavari is a giant and the Cauvery, though small, is still nearly
six times longer. But to the Tamils, this little river is something sacred, its
cool, clear waters are replete with legend and history and sentiment. It is, to
them, along with the Cauvery and the Vaigai, the river of destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you linger on a moonlit night on the Thambiraparni sands and yield yourself to
the witchery of the hour, the stream will whisper to you its age-long secrets.
Long, long ago, before the dawn of history, a race of dwarfs dwelt on its
banks. They have now disappeared from this region. What rack of time it was
that dislimned them is not definitely known. That they lived here is indicated
to us by the melancholy remains dug out of a swell of the earth at
Athichanallur on the right bank of the river, some 13 miles from Tirunelveli.
Pear-shaped urns containing human bones, a few containing complete skeletons,
have been found here. Buried round about the urns, sometimes within them; were
iron swords, daggers and lances, agricultural implements, iron tripods and
lamps. A bronze mirror and figurines of dogs, cocks and buffaloes found among
the remains show that the ancient dwarfs were not untouched by vanity or
untroubled by the tumultuous instinct for </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>beauty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the dwarfs, the Thambiraparni basin has been the home of the Tamils, and one of
the chief centres of Tamil culture. It cannot be said that the spacious leisure
that the bounty of the river certified, remained unbroken all through the
centuries. There were alarums and excursions of course, and the heavy tread of
armed men broke the tranquil seclusion of the river often enough. But these came
in the later centuries of its history. Earlier, the Thambiraparni or Porunai as
it was called, was one of the rivers over which the Pandyas held sway. One of
the speculations about the origin of the Pandyas has it that the founder of the
dynasty came from Korkai near the mouth of the river. When in the sixth and the
seventh centuries, the Pallavas and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chalukyas reduced the
Pandyas to the status of vassals, the quiet of the river was not appreciably
disturbed and the people of Thenpandinadu </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>kept the even tenor of
their way apparently untouched by the mad struggles that developed in the
north. In the eighth century, the Pandyas gained their independence only to he
reduced to feudatory chiefs two centuries later, by the expanding Chola empire.
For a while, the Thambiraparni came to be known as Mudikonda Chola Peraru, that
is, the river of the Chola conqueror. But the Chola conquest did not alter the
life of the people. On the contrary, Chola initiative and the vigour of Chola
administration only served to strengthen the religious fervour that the
centuries immediately preceding had brought. A number of temples sprang up all
along the river, older shrines of the days of the Pandyas were enlarged and
renovated, and the plain between the western hills and the sea became studded
with <i>mantapams </i>and towers lifting their shapeliness in mute adoration to
the Infinite and serving as nurseries of poetry, music and dancing and of
ethical and philosophical speculation. And the old river flowed among them
murmuring praise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the decline of the Pandyas, there was a short period of Moslem rule initiated
by the southern conquests of Malik Kafur, General of Allaudin Khilji. Then came
the Nayaks of Vijayanagar and the four centuries of their rule were filled with
internal dissensions and external </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>aggression. In the
middle of the 18th century, the British appeared on the stage and their attempt
to reduce the Polygars is a tangled tale of heroism and ruthlessness,
treachery, hatred, and destruction. The peace </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the old river
was broken and when it was restored early in the 19th century, it was no longer
the energising quiet of the earlier period but </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>something of
the stillness of the grave. The soullessness of foreign rule had set in, and it
took more than a hundred years for the valley, as for the rest of the country,
to recover and come to life again.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will thus be seen that the Thambiraparni (the river of the red leaves) or the
Thambiravarni (the copper-coloured river) as it is sometimes called, does
deserve equally its old name of Porunai (the agreeable </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>river).
Its sequestered valley sheltered the people who dwelt there from the ‘madding
crowd’s ignoble strife.’ Its waters, the gift of both the monsoons, spread
plenty over a land, small it is true, but smiling and fruitful. On its banks,
therefore, developed a thoroughly indigenous culture, essentially Tamil in
origin and outlook. This does not mean that the Thambiraparni region did not
have stimulating contacts with the outside world. In every early times,
Punnaikayal at the mouth of the river, was a famous port and the wealth of the
mountain slopes and the plain–teak, sandal, peacock feathers, rice, sugar,
ginger, and spices–flowed through it to far-off China in the east and to Greece
and Rome and Arabia in the west. At the height of the Pandya power, there were
embassies in China, Arabia, and Rome. Marco Polo, Prince of Wanderrers, is
supposed to have visited the region towards the close of the 13th century. Vira
Pandya and Jatavarman Sundara Pandya are mentioned by him as also by Mahommedan
historians. Earlier, during the days of the Pallavas, the influence of the
magical fusion of Tamil and Sanskrit at Kanchi spread to the banks of the
Thambiraparni and flowered as mystical poetry and religious sculpture and
architecture. Nayak rule brought Andhra settlers to the valley, Muslims had
already their villages near the mouth of the river and, a little later,
Christian missionary settlements rose in the coastal belt, north and south of
the river. The culture of the Thambiraparni, therefore, is like that of the
rest of the Tamil land, a composite one. But with this difference. The
Thambiraparni valley was far removed even in Pandya days from the courts of
kings and escaped the sophistication and pomp of capital cities. Its cultural
development had nothing forced, artificial, and temporary about it. The larger
world outside visited the valley only like the monsoon clouds. And like the
clouds, it had to convert itself into the native stream before it reached the
people and enriched their life. Even today, the people of the Thambiraparni are
lovers of the simple life and their customs and dialect bear the strongest
impress of the days of old Tamil. Words like <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype

the Upanishads. Under the venerable tamarind tree where Nammalwar, according to
tradition, sat all his life, the north and the south met and triumphed over
space and time. Saivism and the river gave us Kumaragurupara who carried to
distant Varanasi the message of the south. Through the centuries, a succession
of poets kept the Tamil literary tradition alive and it was this environment
that produced the greatest of modern Tamil poets, Subramanya Bharathi. Patient
scholarship both in Tamil and in Sanskrit flourished there. Some of the most

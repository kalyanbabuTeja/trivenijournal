style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ninety-seven years ago,
the Mother was born in France. As the daughter of a well-to-do banker, she had
a sheltered and comfortable life. But this did not prevent her from
contemplating upon the sorrows of mankind. A strange, recurrent dream made her
decide upon a career meant to cure the ills of humanity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“...every night as soon as I was in bed, it seemed
to me that I came out of my body and rose straight up above the house, then
above the town, very high. I saw myself then clad in a magnificent golden robe,
longer than myself; and as I rose, that robe lengthened, spreading in a circle
around me to form, as it were, an immense roof over the town. Then I would see
coming out from all sides men, women, children, old men, sick men, unhappy men;
they gathered under the outspread robe, imploring help, recounting their
miseries, their sufferings, their pains. In reply, the robe, supple and living,
stretched out to them individually, and as soon as they touched it, they were consoled
or healed, and entered back into their body happier and stronger than they had
ever been before coming out of it. Nothing appeared to me more beautiful,
nothing made me more happy; and all the activities of the day seemed to me dull
and colourless, without real life, in comparison with this activity of the
night which was for me the true life.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Mother’s early life and this dream of hers bring
to our mind a great epic heroine of Tamil Nadu, Manimekhalai. Manimekhalai too
was drawn to the life of the spirit while still young, and was concerned with
the sorrows of mankind. It appeared to those around her that she was ‘born’ to
save mankind from its ills. Towards achieving her life’s mission she had to
overcome the objection of her people and break many barriers placed across her
path by man and fate. The Mother’s early dream and her subsequent divine
ministry have a parallel in the pure and lustrous figure of Manimekhalai
standing near the Padapankaja Peetika in the garden at Kachi, relieving the hunger
of people through the divine vessel, Amudha Surabhi. The suffering people came
to her, received her grace and went away with their troubles dissolved.</p>

Paris, she developed coteries to discuss spiritual problems which helped many
perplexed beings to see straight. She also travelled widely with her husband.
Her introspective nature was filled with spiritual strength due to these
travels. A determination grew in her to chase away the shadows besieging the
world. She recorded in her diary, her ideas and resolutions, and her deep
desire for turning life on this earth into life divine. “Transmute me into that
burning brazier so that all the atmosphere of earth may be purified with its
flame,” she wrote on August 27, 1914. The prayer was a flame of enthusiastic
hope, because she had recently met Sri Aurobindo. The Tamil epic <i>Manimekhalai
</i>has a wonderful description of the Avatara of Buddha. “In the wide, wide
world where stretched darkness everywhere, Buddha appeared as an effulgent Sun
with rays extended.” The Mother met Sri Aurobindo on March 29, 1914 and

the beginning of a new stage in their spiritual life. Sri Aurobindo had
attained personal <i>Siddhi</i> by now and was on the threshold of performing
Yoga for the Supramentalisation of the entire humanity. The Mother too had
undergone deep spiritual experiences and was ready to put her plans into action.
For a time she, along with her husband and Sri Aurobindo, published two
philosophical journals–the <i>Arya</i> in English and the <i>Revue de Grande
Synthese </i>in French. The Mother had to leave for France because of the War,
and later spent three spiritually fruitful years in Japan. She joined Sri
Aurobindo in 1920 at Pondicherry to collaborate with him in his task of
uplifting humanity. Half a century and more have passed since that time. Under
the Mother’s guidance the Sri Aurobindo Ashram grew into an active spiritual
centre where an integral way of living has been made possible. Combining the
practical with the spiritual, all the activities of the Ashram are changed with
a rare perfection. This was made possible by the presence of the Mother in its
formative Fears. She directed all its activities for more than four decades
with infinite care, a large vision and with minute attention to detail. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Aurobindo himself found in her presence the help that earth’s children needed

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“When you come to the
Yoga, you must be ready to have all your mental buildings and all your vital
scaffoldings shattered to pieces. You must be prepared to be suspended in the
air with nothing to support you except your faith. You will have to forget your
past self and its clingings altogether, to pluck it out of your consciousness
and be born anew, free from every kind of bondage. Think not of what you were,
but of what you aspire to be; be altogether in what you want to realise. Turn
from your dead past and look straight towards the future. Your religion,
country, family lie there; it is the <i>Divine</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nothing is forgotten in
her total vision. Each segment of our life is given its proper plane of action,
but everything is to be done in a mood of total surrender to the Divine. Our
memories are often our bitterest enemies. Like a hidden opponent they come upon
us when we are least prepared, make us despondent, paralyse us with a sense of
failure and incapacitate us from striving for future achievement. Memories are
thus like the bonds of <i>karma</i> and create a sense of fatality. This
despondency is nothing but the suicide of the spirit. Only the Divine has the
power to cut the bonds of Karma; only a divine personality like the Mother can
save us from the treacherous bonds of memory, save us from self-pity and
self-denigration. Echoing Sri Aurobindo’s “We do not belong to the past dawns,
but to the noons of the future”, the Mother baptised even people who had no
contact with her into a new birth of aspiration and works. The Mother was
certainly a “living demonstration of Sri Aurobindo’s teachings.” Like the
Avatar described in <i>Savitri </i>she achieved a mighty awakening in earth’s
consciousness by setting in motion many projects and training a devoted band of
workers in Sri Aurobindo Ashram. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

O Lord, has taken the form of a beautiful rose, harmonious, full in bloom, rich
in fragrance. I stretch it out to Thee with both arms in a gesture of offering
and I ask of Thee: if my understanding is limited, widen it; if my knowledge is
obscure, enlighten it; if my heart is empty of ardour, set it aflame; if my
love is insignificant, make it intense; if my feelings are ignorant and
egoistic, give them the full consciousness in the Truth. And the ‘I’ which
demands this of Thee, O Lord, is not a little personality lost amidst thousands
of others. It is the whole earth that aspires to Thee in a movement full of
fervour.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

faith, a vision of the future, of the goal towards which humanity is moving, of
the future realisation of the world, the last spiritual revolution of which Sri
Aurobindo speaks, that which will open the New Age that is to say, a
Supramental revolution.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

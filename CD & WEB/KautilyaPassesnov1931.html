<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[One of the Court–rooms in Pataliputra. It is built of wood and richly decorated with carvings. Though there is broad daylight outside, the room looks dark, shuttered and dimly lit. All along the wall are low desks covered with files of State documents. A thin but well–built man of about fifty–five or sixty is seen pacing up and down the room. He has a dignified mien and fine features, and from his appearance, may be a Pandit or a Minister. He goes to the window, opens it, takes up a metal document, reads it, frowns, puts it back and reclines on his seat of cushions before a desk, and is lost in thought. It is Kautilya: Pandit, Courtier, King–maker and Minister.]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, that is the end!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To yield up all my dreams, to fortify myself with unnatural content, to say, &quot;Let all be as you wish&quot;–to whom? –not to the King's imperial self–not to the rising tide of popular demand which I have prophesied will overtake each State, not to a conqueror such as Sikander.<SUP>1</SUP> That would be natural. But nothing is to be natural in this most unnatural life of mine. To smile and to bow, to greet with reverence, to whisper and to nod–whom?–that shaven priest who prates of <I>nirvana </I>and <I>sushupti, </I>of ordained law that transcends all created rules, who shivers at the mention of my code, and blanches at the record of my life–whom, if twenty years ago he had dared to interpose betwixt me and the King, would have annihilated as the river Ganga does the creeping cottages of the poor upon her flooded banks. To such an one I yield my place. My place–not mine! For mine is not the place beside a senile man. I stand behind the King, the abstract, most imperial lord–the <I>man </I>is nought to me. But–Oh Chandragupta!–</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">[Enter Messenger–bows low and stands looking at the ground.]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speak! I am in no mood for ceremonies. I have no time to go through all the formulas, that I myself created.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MESSENGER: <I>[Blows again, joins his palms on his breast.]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;May the most learned master of all arts, be who is the ear and eye to the Lord of all this wide domain, the–.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enough, you mud-souled parrot, I say, enough; out with what thou wert commissioned to convey. Drop all the prefixes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MESSENGER</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My supreme Lord the King would speak to you.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[The Messenger looks surprised and bewildered. Bowing and stepping backwards, he goes out of the room.]</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He would speak to me. But what has he to speak to me? To me who always was the first to speak! Perhaps he wants me to stay on, to wean his son to Royalty, to begin yet again where I began with him–and by slow degrees to teach the boy the great fact that power and love are poles asunder, that the King is opposed to the Man, that there is neither reward, regret nor recompense to him who acts, that being conscious of the action is the only drop of heaven vouchsafed to supermen, while all the nameless millions of mankind can have their sleep, their loves and hates, and rhapsodies. Aye, to teach all this, and when his spirit breaks beneath the weight of will, to let the son go, take his father's course and follow cattle-like some single-visioned maniac. Let him ask me that–and I shall show him that even Vishnugupta can refuse the wandering <I>chela </I>of a monk. Why is it that I feel like this? Am I too on the road to vile decay? I–I am Kautilya–and I must fight. Fight for the King against the Man. I will not yield without a word. <I>[Exit]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MESSENGER</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know not, The King smiles on me, asks me what my name is, how much I get for my services, says &quot;Will you do this?&quot; or &quot;Will you go there?&quot; as if asking a kindness of me–and then Chanakya bursts upon me like an anger-laden thunder cloud, shouts at me to haste, to drop all prefixes, and after hearing my message, asks &quot;Yes?&quot; so coyly and so hesitant as would a bride upon the first night summoned to her lord's bedside.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But what was the message that got this wonderful reply?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MESSENGER</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was nothing; day in, day out, I carry such to all the ministers, and never once in all this thirteen years has His sweet Majesty once upon me smiled–nor ever has that marble-faced Minister lost once his placid temper and bid me haste.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MESSENGER</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tell it was nothing more than this– &quot;Go, as Kautilya if he can attend on me awhile,&quot; said my Lord the King.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ha– Ha–and on this you built up all this tale, We thought some second conqueror had come across the <I>Sindhu–[They laugh]</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[Within Chandragupta's chamber. Kautilya stands near a pillar. The King walks up and down, looking at times through the windows, and stops suddenly before Kautilya as he passes him.]</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But even in your wonderful chariot, will not the central axle once get worn? And when the outer wheel begins to slow, would you not rather change it? And to prove your own theory, will you not see if this same perfect chariot would go with another axle?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. If I do have the running of the chariot, as you so graciously say I have, I would pluck out the age-worn part without compunction. Be it the central axle or the veriest spoke in any little wheel, I would not hesitate. The dead and dying are not, and will never be, interesting to me.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHANDRAGUPTA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who else should know the axle is decaying than the axle's very self? Ah, me! </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[Kautilya loses his lassitude, takes a step nearer. His voice rises.]</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh King–and this from you, and that unnecessary sigh! I tell you it is not decay. It is but the dirt that gathers round the axle and makes slow the revolutions, and I am here to brush away the dirt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHANDRAGUPTA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chanakya, this is the truth: It is not the priest alone that has made the resolve. I feel–I feel–</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't feel–that is left for your innumerable slaves. Do, do as Sikander did! Don’t you remember that cold winter day when Taxila bent low as, from the West, sun-like, resplendent in his vital strength–dispensing punishment and justice without thought–he came? The mightiest man of Time that has been yet! And our own kith and kin–our loud–spoken Porus, and that wonder-bag of learning and humility, that long-forgotten king of Taxila,–begged favours and crept cur-like, with gold and wine, and softly-breathed praise–crept to his very heel. And you?–that stood by me in that vast throng that saw the Yavan going like the sun, preceded by the dawn-flush of his own bright glory into the heaven where, but a moment gone, a thousand stars had scintillated! Are you the same who turned to me with shaded eyes and said,–your breath all gone with suppressed ambition–, &quot;I will go West as he is coming East,&quot; And how far have you gone West? Not further than that, slow-wittd Nikator's, your father-in-law's, harem. The West is not Iran! It is past that and far away, and with such as you the East will never lay its hand upon the West. You and yours will ever bend to Time's decaying touch and yield what you have accomplished, when but the final touch is wanted, when the last effort alone remains for completion. Would I had been a Greek and had that man for master! I would have kneaded all this your petty empire as so much dough and mixed it with the glory of fast-breaking Greece! Oh! Rebel, my King, rebel against this onset of your weakness–say, &quot;I will not yield to stupor.&quot; Organise, as once you did. Tear up my hard-created constitutions, stamp upon your treaties as if they were poisonous worms, don't let your person's habits, and the customs of the Government, and the traditions, sit on your bright imperial mind. Act once more. There to the East lie all the war-ring millions of China. Or to the West unnumbered millions of Barbarians, who await but your approach to become nations. Have vision. Aye, do anything. I promise to withdraw my codes to write a thousand new ones. If you will but act. Be Chandragupta once again–the man who, looking on the glaciers of the North, that smiled in unsurpassable height, and at his famished followers, said, &quot;My friends, what glory! Better to die upon those peaks of frozen white, than weep here and be buried.&quot; Be the King again–Kautilya's master, your own dear peerless self. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHANDRAGUPTA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You indefatigable old man! Your Chandragupta, as you call him, will be where you are. I, the weakling, go, I leave behind me my own blood. And if Bindusara is my son, he cannot but flame up, as often I have done, at your supreme eloquence. Stay on. Forget me. Make him greater than I was.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHAMBER OF THE PRINCE</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[Bindusara reclining on a cushioned seat. Indulekha, the dancing girl, stands near a window, She looks very earnest. She has just stopped speaking and looks intently at the Prince for his answer. The Prince seems to hesitate]</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But I too love him, Indu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">INDULEKA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You do. Then do you earnestly want him to grow up in this cloying wilderness of intrigue, lovelessness, and falsehood? Do you want his slowly wakening mind to see that she whose breast fed him to strength is but a harlot? Do you want him to see me ply my wiles to collect deep secrets of State from enemies? Do you want him, least of all, to see my unhallowed love for you? No! No father worth the name would like his child to curse the womb that bore him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But when the King has given me the State, and Kautilya has been pensioned off, you shall lead your life as you would wish. You need not act the spy. Your only care shall be to bring him up, our child. He need not know that you are anything but my chosen consort, which indeed you shall be. And I promise you by his sweet self, he shall be the Emperor of a greater empire than I now inherit. Bear with me awhile–a little while, my Indu, and I shall wash this Court of all its dross, and make it chaste enough for our own love and our love's child. What say you? Yet doubting! Yet hesitant! Do you not know your Bindusara, Love!</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[Rises and goes to her–takes her hands in his.] </P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would I have taken you from where Kautilya's victim had cast you, and held you to my breast, if I had not intended, even then, to cherish you? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">INDULEKHA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No–No–my lord, remind me not of that. I may go mad even yet. Allow me but this. Let him be brought up, till the time you talk of comes, in some removed place. Let him breathe awhile unpolluted air, where courtesans will not kill his childish mind with their poison-breath;–where envy will not follow him, nor slander, nor this politics. Yield only this once to my wish, my Prince; and your Indulekha shall be ever grateful–ever.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[The door slowly opens. The Prince and the dancing girl glance towards it. Enter Kautilya. He closes the door, turns and sees them both. He stands silently looking at them. They fall apart. A moment of strained silence.]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. He is renouncing. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stay, dear one! I and Vishnugupta have no secrets that you may not hear. <I>(To Kautilya) </I>Has the priest come?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no interest in priests. They, like the words on their lips, are superstitions. I am a care only for facts. Prince!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why not sit, Vishnugupta–and you too, my love; come near me. Here is our man of facts, and there is no need to hide the truth from him. Our love is a fact; is it not? </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA: <I>[Sits down]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your father is renouncing his kingdom. He tells me he is weary of it. He has taken for his master a stray madman from amongst those lunatics who ever prate of <I>nirvana </I>and knowledge. He is leaving in a day or two with this same madman on an endless pilgrimage. Has he told you all his plans?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. Last night he called me to his bed-chamber and we talked far into the night. He recounted to me the troubles that he took to mould this State to what it is today. He talked of you and your inexorable will. He told me that he would leave me to you and you to me. He–</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leave me to you! When did I indeed become a thing to be <I>left, </I>a chattel to be handed over by sweet, renouncing, sentimental father to the young hopeful son? Listen, I have told him and I tell you–I am not a retainer–a flunkey to be paid well and pensioned off when sucked work-dry. I might die–my person might disintegrate. But I–the real I–am Fact. I have no sentiment. I am the Spirit of the State. I encompass the People, the Government and the King. I am not to be passed on with thanks and gratitude. I am the essence of the sense of nationhood–I have no separate existence from the organisation that has grown around me. People grow tired of me. They fly from me. Some dread me. But I assert. I am not some vile inanimate lovable toy to be shifted from owner to owner. When a king rejects me, he is no more a king. I–</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[The dancing girl rises up, looks half frightened at the two men, goes up hastily to the door. opens it and goes out.]</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA: <I>[Continues as soon as the door closes]</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I and your father made this kingdom. You raise your brows at my want of modesty. I assume modesty only with those I want to win over to my side. Your father and I met when he was a landless young marauder and I was but a stripling full of garnered old-world lore. But I had even then in me the vision of an empire, –the premonition of a scheme to weld the various peoples of our land into a nation. We met. He was ambitious. He was strong and brave. He was honest. I perceived in him the ideal First Ruler for a State,–the man who can with but a little effort be a God to men. We worked. We wrought this kingdom. And now he tells me he is tired, that he wants some calm before his death. I have told myself and him that it is not yet time for him to go away. Our foundations for an empire are strong. But the super-structure has not yet had the final touch. He tells me that I can remain and touch it up. And I will stay and touch it up if you will consent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most gladly I do consent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consent to what, my Prince?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To your remaining at Court, to your being what you all along have been–the main and central prop of our dynasty and our crown, the chiefest counsellor, and the dearest friend. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aye, all that and something more, my Prince.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your father and I, Prince, grew together. I modified him and he in turn might have affected my own growth. We complemented each the other till the two of us were but one single whole–the State. Now he goes and you step in. You in your youth, and your want of experience, will not complement me. I must mould you into what your father is. I must wean you from yourself, must take away your self and instead graft on you a mighty kinghood. Till I succeed in doing that, I must be free to be both parts of the whole, what your father and I have been. Do you consent to this?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not comprehend you. You talk in abstractions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was never fond of generalisations. I work in detail. It is only when I have achieved that I draw broad conclusions. So, then, if you want to know what my conditions are–well, listen. You must entrust yourself to me–not as heretofore, the pupil to the teacher,–but the King-to-be to the King-maker. You must give up your pleasures, your company, your personal happiness even.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My pleasures, my company, my happiness even! Oh God! When had I happiness? You and my father wilted my childhood and buried my youth in arid reasoning and ambition. Pleasures? What pleasures have I had between you two? I never played with flowers or children as others do. I never quarrelled, never laughed, and when my manhood was awaking in me, I never looked at women who were not in our pay. What pleasures then have I to give up? What company and what happiness?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KAUTILYA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Repining and sloth are the pleasures of weak kings. You must give these up–and more– I again assert you must give up tour present company. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">BINDUSARA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;You mean–</P>

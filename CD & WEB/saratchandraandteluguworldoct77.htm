<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nearly
a hundred years ago when a boy was born in Devanandapur of Bengal on Sarat <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purnima </i>(full moon) day nobody could
have imagined that the boy would grow up to be an immortal writer and would win
the hearts of the reading population all over India. It is Saratchandra
Chatterji, whose popularity competed even with Rabindranath Tagore’s in 1920s.
In fact some readers approached Sarat and told him that they liked his works
better than those of Rabindranath Tagore. Sarat replied, “Yes, I agree that I
write well. I write for you people whereas Rabindranath Tagore writes for me.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
may as well wonder how Sarat could become so popular in his days and how he is
still ranked among the top class writers. Even now many a literary Pundit would
raise their eyebrows to regard the genre of novel as a branch of genuine
literature. They consider it as a passing fancy and a momentary impulse to
express something in a readable and appealing way. Yet it is this genre that brought
fame and name to Saratchandra Chatterji whose works the present day readers
read with the same enthusiasm as did their counterparts half-a-century ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is humanitarian appeal, a sort of heart-to-heart talk, that counts first in
Sarat’s novels. It seems he never wrote his works in a hurry. He took pains to
polish his work till it could be polished no more. We have yet to come across a
writer who can glorify Indian womanhood as much as Sarat did. His sympathy and
understanding were not restricted to “respectable” women only. For him, woman
was a woman whether of a high class or was a lowly born. Her intrinsic value
and innate nature were same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
his childhood Saratchandra was more interested in sports and games than in
formal education. He led a care-free life. He mixed with all classes of people
and visited a number of places during his aimless wanderings. In this process
he enriched his experience. Philanthropist as he was, he acquired first-hand
knowledge of life. That is why there is nothing unconvincing as far as his
writings are concerned. They are realistic pictures of life in its many facets.
Sarat also underwent bitter experience of poverty. But in his case it proved to
be a blessing in disguise. It sharpened his vision and heightened his understanding.
We could say with Shakespeare that, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
can trace Saratchandra as an individual in his works. His childhood experiences
are so well-reflected in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Srikanta </i>that
it is claimed as his biography. Sarat did not attempt to write anything which
he did not know. Mostly the zamindari families and middle class families of
Bengal at the turn of the century served as milieu for his stories and novels.
He strongly reacted to the atrocities committed by rich and powerful people. He
discarded social evils and depicted the evil doings of the so-called upholders
of tradition in<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>true colours. The
novels were realistic but at the same time they were shocking to the complacent
society. He sympathised with child widows and shed tears for the women in
chains. Many a time he expressed that he could not believe evil of any woman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Saratchandra
glorified women to such an extent that he made them appear divine. No doubt he
discarded the evil customs of the society but he did not discard the society as
such. We are often faced with the criticism that though Saratchandra championed
the cause of women he never liberated them from their shackles nor did he
suggest the ways of liberation. It is all right for us to speak in a free and
changed society about the conventional attitude of Saratchandra. But during the
time when Sarat wrote, it was something novel even to register the cruel
customs of the society. To speak of a widow’s love for a man or to ennoble a
singing woman by making her a leading character of a novel was something
unimaginable. Sarat himself had to brave a hostile criticism in his days.
Moreover his stories about individuals written from a new angle certainly widened
human outlook. We should not forget that our so-called broadmindedness has its
foundation on the works of liberal writers such as Saratchandra Chatterji. It
is only just that we should judge their works in the context of the time they
were written. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is well-known throughout India. Though his works are in Bengali, Indians are
fortunate enough to have his translations in their respective languages. Telugu
people are more fortunate in this respect because they can read all the works of
Sarat including his unfinished novels. They are ever grateful to those
translators who made Sarat works appear so original and natural that Sarat is
not an outsider to Telugu readers. He has become one with them influencing
their ideas, moulding their ideals and guiding their literary trends. There are
a good number of writers who still imitate him. Apart from the external aspects
even in content a few writers attempted to write novels which have traces of
Sarat’s novels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this novel we have a character by name Rajani who very much reminds us of
Indranath of Srikanta. Yet another novel, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kalakanya,
</i>by Nanduri Vittal reads like Sarat’s novels. Kalyani and Raja Rao, two
leading characters of this novel, talk, behave and react like Sarat’s
characters. The way they defy the society, the sickly constitution of Raja Rao
and Kalyani’s sacrifice can easily fit into anyone of Sarat’s novels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to be influenced by any writer. She draws natural and realistic pictures with

better than she likes her own child. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

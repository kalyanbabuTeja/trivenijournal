H. Myers was the son of Frederick W. H. Myers, a Victorian enthusiast of
psychic research and the author of the popular monograph on Wordsworth in the
English Men of Letters series. Born in 1881, Leo Myers had his education at
Eton and Cambridge, but stood rather apart from the social groups of either
place. After his father’s death in January 1901, Leo went with his mother to
America, where he met his future wife, Elsie Palmer, 9 years his senior. Being
financially well off, he wasn’t obliged to work for a living, but his extreme
sensitiveness saved him alike from sloth and triviality. He could be sad, and
he could laugh; but he wouldn’t sneer, or give way to cynicism. While still
young, he had once sensed the infinite Real behind the play of Appearance, and
this circumstance was to leave a permanent effect on his life and work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years were to pass before his next work, <i>The Orissers, </i>was published.
The success of this, his first novel, brought him many friends–among them the
leading lights of ‘Bloomsbury’. But as he had earlier reacted against the
muscular and formalistic ethos of Eton, he now recoiled from the humanistic and
aesthetic modes of Bloomsbury. <i>The ‘Clio’, </i>Myers’s second novel, came
out in 1925. This was followed by <i>The Root and the Flower, </i>a trilogy
consisting of <i>The Near and the far </i>(1926); <i>Prince Jali </i>(1931),
and <i>Rajah Amar </i>(1934). After a diversion in the shape of ‘my naive and
sentimental little tale’, <i>Strange Glory </i>(1936), Mr. Myers returned to
the theme of the trilogy, and published the massive sequel, <i>The Pool of
Vishnu </i>(1940). <i>The Root and the Flower </i>and <i>The Pool of Vishnu </i>were
issued as an ‘omnibus’ in 1943, with the title <i>The Near and the Far. </i>Next
year, on the night of April 7, 1944, Myers sought the finality of death by
taking an overdose of vernal, and became a casualty, like Virginia Woolf, of
the moral offensive of the second World War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unhappy, gracious, witty man I knew,’ says L. A. G. Strong recalling L. H.
Myers; Miss Anne Douglas Sedgwick found him as a young man ‘melancholy,
sceptical, detached, very fastidious and delicate and sensitive,’ while C. F.
Meade’s predominant memory of ‘our youth together...is constant laughter.’ The
active period of Myers’s life fell between the two world wars, and his
sensitive mind was caught in the vortex of the clashing philosophies and
careering disillusions of the time. The search for certainty, the hankering
after serenity, was an exhausting and an almost hopeless task. Rejections and
retreats were easy enough, but where was the Everlasting Yea? How see it? Where
find it? Was it the ‘Magnetic Mountain’ of the Communists’ Utopia? Or was it
the Huxleyan ‘Ground’ of true mysticism? The best that Myers could do was to
put into his novels the rejections and the retreats, as also the undulating
search, the confused groping towards the goal, the mirages, the sloughs and the
chasms on the way, and–perhaps–a hint too of the still unrealized Infinite and
the Harmony to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the 7 novels that L. H. Myers wrote, the tetralogy <i>The Near and the Far </i>is
located in the India of Emperor Akbar’s time; <i>The Orissers </i>has a remote
and exotic Welsh background, <i>The ‘Clio’ </i>takes us to the Amazon on board
a ship, and <i>Strange Glory </i>opens in the swamps of Louisiana. Myers was a
careful and conscientious writer, and while readily responding to the
imperatives of his inspiration, he was willing to take infinite pains to give
them appropriate utterance. The pressure of the present was so insistent that
if he was to render his responses or reactions into art, he bad to transmute
them by achieving a feat of transportation of the scene and time. Of Myers’s
novels it may be truly said that they imply a ‘criticism of life,’ and strive
to articulate a reply to the question ‘How to live?’ The main preoccupations
are the same in all the seven novels, but the whole arc of Myers’s striving and
achievement is comprised in <i>The Near and the Far </i>his most ambitious work
and one of the great imaginative creations of the twentieth century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is,
superficially speaking, a historical novel like the late Hannah Closs’s
Alligension trilogy. Religion, philosophy and mysticism are alike woven into
the texture of L. H. Myers’s and Hannah Closs’s novels. But another aspect of <i>The
Near and the Far, </i>the kaleidoscopic pattern of court intrigues and sex
entanglements, licks L. H. Myers’s novel rather with Lady Murasaki’s <i>Tale of
Genji, </i>which, according to L. P. Hartley, Myers greatly enjoyed. Yet,
again, Myers had his affiliations with Dostoevsky, for they both saw their
characters in their spiritual uniqueness more than in their material reality,
and so characters and situations often acquired in their novels a psychical and
symbolic quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
physical terms Myers was a perfect stranger to India, but he was widely and
curiously read in Indian history and philosophy, and certain habits of
imaginative concentration must have familiarised him with the landscapes of
Indian thought and feeling. In his descriptions of places there is a vagueness
as well as a definiteness, they call to mind nowhere in particular–not even
Agra–yet we are free to recognize any cities, palaces, gardens, camps that we
know in the Palace at Agra and the Royal Hunting Grounds,–Khanjo and the Valley
Ravi, the Pleasance of the Arts, and the lake between–Kathiapur with the
snake-infested path leading to the Temple–the half-ruined castle in the
desert–the Old Summer Palace at Daulatpur–Hawa Ghar and the ‘Pool of Vishnu’.
These are backgrounds that with hardly an essential change survive from age to
age, and the characters who enact their many farces, melodramas, tragicomedies,
comedies and tragedies are also prototypical of humanity. Akbar the Great
Mughal; his warring sons, Salim and Daniyal: Mabun Das the chief of the Secret
Police and Shaik Mobarek the evangelist of Din Ilahi, who support Salim and
Daniyal respectively: Amar the Buddhist, the Christian Sita his wife, the
Muslim Hari Khan her lover: Prince Jali caught between diverse religions and
personal influences: a variety of women–Gonevati, the Yogini of the
Vamacharies; Lalita, betrothed to the impossible Daniyal but Hari’s mistress;
Ambissa, Srilata, Ranee Jagshri; Laksmi, Damayanti: a variety of young men
too–the effeminate Ali, Dantawat the physical and moral wreck, the brothers
Bhoj and Mohan, and Prince Jali himself: a convocation of teachers–Gokal,
Mobarek, the Yogi, Smith the Christian humanist, the Guru: prophets, priests,
politicians, kings, cranks, crooks, inverts, perverts, sadists, intriguers,
social butterflies, ‘herb’ women, all crowd the epic canvas of <i>The Hear and
the Far, </i>and the impression that is left on the mind is one of moving
multiplicity in character and action. The range, the comprehension is so
extensive, so all inclusive, that rival religions–Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism,
Christianity–meet here, they are presented alike in their strength and their
weakness; the same ideal, the same character, is now an arc of fulfilment, now
a mere caricature of perversion. The ‘action’ is played at different levels–the
visible theatre of the world, to soul’s sanctuary within, the ineffable
plateaus of the Spirit–and the planes are seen to intersect, mingle, fuse and
separate again. It is a strangely attractive and perturbing world, exotic and
intimate, murky but starlit, depressing and confusing yet touched with an
ambrosial taste and pregnant with reserves of meaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an Indian background. Problems are posed, beliefs are scrutinised, but it is
seldom possible to detach these from the vivid spectacle of human life which
the novel projects before us. <i>The Near and the Far </i>is thus an example of
what Mrs. Virginia Woolf has referred to as philosophy being ‘consumed’ in a
novel: philosophy being so perfectly integrated with action and character that
it is impossible to think of them apart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Guru’s belief in human nature–like Jefferson’s belief in the common man in the
context of American democracy–should yield rich dividends in an essentially
egalitarian society. On the other hand, there are reservoirs of evil also in
man–for example, Daniyal, Gunevati, Mujatta. How far they are evil because of
the tangle of circumstances in which they are trapped, and how far as an
ineradicable and essential law of their nature, must remain an open question.
The danger really is not in the power of evil to do mischief but with the
apparent powerlessness (or reluctance) of good to assert itself, fight evil,
and destroy it. Mr. Myers builds up the rival entities of ‘evil’ and ‘good’ in
Prince Daniyal and Rajah Amar respectively, and we are enabled to sense their
nature through a multitude of hints and obscure actions; we see them slowly–as
if unwillingly or unwittingly–gravitate towards each other, till at last they
meet in the Pleasance of the Arts at Daniyal’s express request. There follows
the incident of the lovely white cat–merely to vent his spleen, Daniyal lifts
the sole of his right foot, places it on the unsuspecting cat’s head, and
brutally tramples it to death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a demonstration of pure evil, and Amar can have no further doubts: with a

Rajah a stunning blow from behind, and ‘good’ crumples to the ground and ‘evil’
is all but triumphant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that is not the end; the thread of the story is taken up again in <i>The Pool
of Vishnu. </i>Amar, now a blind man, joins, a group of wandering Buddhist
monks, and finds peace at last. We learn that Daniyal’s menagerie at the
Pleasance of the Arts has been disbanded, that Gunevati has been trampled to
death by an elephant; we learn too that Hari Khan has been received into favour
by Akbar. While several of the old characters continue to engage our attention,
the centre of interest in <i>The Pool of Vishnu </i>is in a new tangle of
relationships involving Mohan and Damayanti, Bhoj and Lakshmi, the Guru and
Akbar himself. Prince Jali is now more a bystander than an actor, but he sees
things, he changes, he grows. He has lost his father, he presently loses Hari
Khan; the past is peopled with ghosts and shadows, and he feels suspended
between the past and the future. “The clouds, he thought, were gone in a
breath, and human beings in only a few breaths more. Only Vishnu remained.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would be wrong, of course, to dogmatise about the central message of Myers’s
tetralogy. He was still striving and groping towards the goal, constantly
testing the philosophies of the past on the hard anvil of actuality,
continually seeking filiations between the ‘outward things” and the ‘inner
landscapes of the mind,’ and although in the course of <i>The Near and the Far </i>he
seems to suggest various approaches to the problem of living, it is clear none
the less that no simple rule will meet every situation. Truth has many facets,
and to dogmatise is to distort and to stifle Truth. At first Prince Jali has
one foot here, one there, he moves in and out of diverse worlds, and at this
still experimental stage of his life he is merely puzzled, and rather uncertain
of his own individual reality; he feels too that his is a developing
personality, assimilating as much as possible from the numerous other worlds
that come within the range of his experience. Knowledge came from the Right and
from the Left, and he must grasp it all. This trying patiently to gather and
integrate varied bits of reality into a full round of truth is one way of
approaching the problem of<i> </i>living. But there is another, and a shorter
and surer, way,–one doesn’t seek it, but stumbles upon it,–the mystic’s direct
contact with Reality. Gokal describes such an experience to<i> </i>Amar:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

arduous experimentation and sudden self-transcendence do not exhaust the range
of human experience. There is the world of wickedness, there is the world of
triviality, and there is the world of sexual depravity in the name of religion.
The Yogi who blandly preaches that spirit and flesh are one, that sexuality and
religion are one and that sex is the true religion of man is an evil force,
however he may cloak his evil or carry conviction through an exhibition of
‘miraculous’ powers, and his realism is but a race towards death. Triviality is
no less an invitation to spiritual suicide. Prince Jali, although first
attracted by the superficial glitter of Daniyal’s Pleasance, is presently
shocked to discover its pretentious shallowness and its futile negations. But
Daniyal’s satirical shafts could only wound himself. So it must always be with
people who seek to defame sacred things. But while the eternal is unaffected,
on the temporal plane much immediate damage could ensue. Gokal see through
Daniyal’s veneer of fastidious bravado and warns Amar against minimizing the
propensity of triviality to evil; but later Gokal states clearly the
existential problem and lays down the law of right action:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is evil too, but less consciously or determinedly such; hers is elemental
animal cunning, she is the medium of mischief more than the mischief-maker. Yet
the snake within the woman terrifies Jali. A lethargy comes upon him, the
Present expands, stagnates, and reflects timelessness…“only there was no
foretaste of beatitude in this experience; it was rather an invitation into a
state of living death.” Is Jali escaping out of the fever of life and into the
eternity of–not felicity–but death’s dream kingdom? In his puzzled waking
moments Jali finds the world peopled by the wicked and the trivial–he sees
fools, fools everywhere, and wickedness itself is but a form of folly. “If that
was the case, if ‘nice’ people constituted only a handful–a poor, ineffective,
inarticulate handful–than nothing was left but despair.” He has a long long way
to go before he can gather up again the broken fragments of faith and chase the
spectre of despair away. The <i>‘Pool’ </i>of Vishnu will at last effect the
baptism of rebirth, and Prince Jali will be able to face the future with hope

relationships<i> </i>refuses to fuse completely into a unity. But there are
compensations: we meet the Guru, we meet Akbar–and Myers even brings the two

his true self. In a moment of divination, Emperor and Guru alike see identity
between King and Peasant–as Hamlet, in a very different context, imagines the
king<i> </i>going a progress through the guts of a beggar or as Lear identifies
himself with the bedlam beggar. Akbar enters into the life of Narodi Das the

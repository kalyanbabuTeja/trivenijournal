<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lalita-A </I>short play in Sanskrit with an English translation, by V. K. TAMPY, B. A., Principal, H. H. The Maharajah's Sanskrit College, Trivandrum.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a tragic little sketch of a girl who, born to be a courtesan, tries to rise above her station and fails, not through her own failings, but through the kind cruelty of a thoughtless benefactor. Manasimha, a general of the Emperor Akbar, buys her of her mother, who puts her up for sale. His purchase is made in the belief that thereby the girl is being seduced from a vile bondage. The girl herself is romantic enough to fall in love with her redeemer and imagines her love is requited. Though they live together for a while, Manasimha's feeling for her is not deep-rooted. He goes a way on affairs of State, forgets Lalita and legally weds another and comes back with his wife to the city where Lalita lives, ever expecting to welcome her Lord with the son, the pledge of their love. At the very last moment, from a letter carelessly dropped by the Mayor, she learns of Manasimha's marriage and her heart breaks. The theme is slight and requires all the delicate handling given to it by the author. The dialogue, in places, is spirited, the tragic end is worked up to by subtle touches and the final tension is relieved in part by the pompous soliloquy of the Mayor, for whom Lalita is no more than a worm crushed by the heedless foot-steps of those who tread the highway of custom and established usage. The translation which is the author's own, renders faithfully the spirit of the original. As a curtain-raiser, the play is bound to be a great success. </P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">National Anthems </I>and other songs of Freedom of the various countries of the world, with a foreword by B. G. HORNIMAN, Editor, ‘Indian National Herald’: compiled by R. K. PRABHU.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Price Re. 1.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A compilation of the national songs of several countries of the world is a distinct service to a people who are still struggling to win freedom. Their inspirational value cannot be too much stressed. Our own national songs included in this book tingle with patriotism, and for a people whose love of the Motherland is too flexible and incoherent, the fiery outflow of brave and unbending hearts will have a wholesome effect. But all the same, we cannot readily agree with Mr. Horniman that our national songs are dirges or laments and lack the fire and fervour that can march us to victory, If they are laments merely, they are laments born not of imbecility but of indignation of a non-violent character. Mr. R. K. Prabhu has done a national service by a compilation of the kind and it will serve in no little measure to spur slow-footed patriotism to greater endeavour and slow-witted minds to more inspired output. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Madras Law College Magazine, </I>Annual Number, Price Re. 1-8-0.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our young friends of the Madras Law College have produced an annual number which is splendid in its contents, get-up, illustrations and cartoons. To old students of the college, it must be matter for pride that their successors are evincing a remarkable spirit of enterprise and enthusiasm. We invite special attention to a very valuable ‘Full Bench Decision’ regarding the attractiveness of legal studies. The opinions of distinguished lawyers about the qualities necessary for success at the Bar make interesting reading, but we feel that the prefatory sketches of these lawyers by the interviewer are infinitely better. They are worthy of a Stead or a Gardiner. Messrs. Shanmukham Chettiar, A. Rangaswami Iyengar and the learned Principal contribute valuable articles on constitutional questions. The editorial committee deserves to be congratulated on this venture.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maharani Jhansi Lakshmi Bai </I>by M. JAGGANNA SASTRI, Rajahmundry. Price As. 12.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the detective novels which are produced by the dozen, and the cheap claptrap which passes for ‘drama,’ we turn with relief to works of surpassing value and perennial interest like this unpretentious volume by Mr. Jagganna Sastri, already well-known to the Telugu reading public as the author of a life of Vinayak Savarkar. Badly printed on inferior paper, and equally badly bound in a dull green cover, the book is very uninviting in outward appearance. But once you open and read through the first few lines, you are held spell-bound by the absorbing interest of the subject as well as the rare charm of the Telugu prose-style. You press through the chapters and finish the book, at a single sitting: you lay it down with a sigh of regret that you did not have more of it. To lovers of Indian freedom, ‘Sri Lakshmi Bai’ is a name to conjure with. The author's admiration and reverence for the subject of the sketch is evident in every line. He has used all the available materials, English, Hindi, and Marathi with great care. The early history of the principality of Jhansi, the circumstances under which the adoption of an heir to Maharajah Gangadhara Rao was performed, the unquenchable thirst of Dalhousie for more and more dominion, the thrilling episodes of the ‘Indian war of Independence’ and the heroic deeds of Lakshmi Bai are narrated in great detail. The author has rendered a distinct service to the cause of Telugu literature. We should like to see a second edition of this brilliant monograph, printed and bound in a manner worthy of the theme, and adequately illustrated.</P>

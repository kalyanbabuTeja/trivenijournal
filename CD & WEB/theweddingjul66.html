style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wedding was the event of the year in the little village. And many new things
had happened to it on that occasion. The villagers who had been dreaming of a good
road, apart from their ancient cart-track, from the main trunk highway between
Kurnool and Bangalore, had benefited by a windfall from the bride’s father in
the shape of a motorable road. Electricity, which was part of the scheme of the
Welfare State in the new regime of the country’s freedom, had been connected
overnight to about a dozen of the houses of prominent people inhabiting the
village. Many things more had taken place which had brought the existence of
the little hamlet to the notice of the outside world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

village was astir with activity for weeks before the wedding. For the
Collector’s daughter was to marry the son of the village <i>purohit</i>–a thing
heard of only in romance and unknown in real life! And to take place in the
village too, against the prevailing custom in which the bridegroom has to go to
the bride’s residence for the celebration and ritual! Strange things happen
nowadays, said the older village folks nodding their heads, but this is the
twentieth century, they did not forget! The story of Cinderella and the Prince
paled into the commonplace before this wedding of Rani and Raghuram. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a strike in the woollen factory for no ostensible ground whatever. The
owners had always been considerate to the demands of their workers and given
them all facilities for every years past in the shape of increased wages and
generous bonus every year, part from providing them with health insurance, free
medical treatment and other amenities. And more than anything else their Labour
Welfare Officer was one really interested in the welfare of the workers. He had
been to England for specialization in industrial problems after taking his
Master’s degree in economics </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with a brilliant first class. Coming of
poor parents, his heart was with the workers and though he was not disloyal to
his employers or sacrificed their interests, he was devoted to those under his
care, the workers of the factory. But this time he seemed to have lost his
influence with the workers, who had struck work and had taken to violence to
enforce their demands. Raghuram spent sleepless days and nights–it was the
eighth day of the strike–running up to his employers at all odd hours,
pacifying the recalcitrant labour leaders, sparing no effort to bring about
peace and harmony. But he seemed to be helpless, the workers seemed to be in no
mood to listen to him, a last minute effort was being made to resolve the
deadlock. The outcome of it all was that a meeting of the labourers and their
masters had been called that evening in the factory compound. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

blouse of matching colour, a wrist watch on her left hand with a pair of
bangles and diamond ear-rings to show off her beauty to advantage, dark glasses
to chide her big and brilliant eyes under pencilled brows, a rose stuck
sideways in her hair on each side of her head, lipstick to make her lips look

blacksmith of our village, <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>, is a
hefty fellow. He was an adept at <span class=GramE>many</span> trades–so we
called him an all </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

fashioning iron. There w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of breath and strain their last ounce of
energy was child’s play for him. It was wonderful to watch the sparks flying
from the bottom of the hammer as it came down with majestic sweep and power to
flatten out the red hot metal on the anvil. In the fading light of the evening,
boys of the village gathered at his smithy to observe the sparks that shot out
like arrows in all directions. It was a daily exhibition of which the urchins
enjoyed heartily. And, clad in his scanty clothing above the knee and
bare-bodied, the blacksmith let the sparks fly all round his body, and appeared
like a veritable <span class=SpellE>Allauddin</span> of the Wonderful Lamp to
the lads of the Village. I have already spoken of <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
as an adept at many trades–a <span class=SpellE><i>sarva-tantra</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>swatantra</span></i>–a rather rare title for versatile geniuses.
The great philosopher Vedanta <span class=SpellE>Desikar</span> was <span
class=SpellE>honoured</span> with this title: it is said that this far-famed
savant and philosopher once fashioned a pair of sandals which fitted perfectly,
and provided a model for the professional cobblers. He had a nimble mind and
nimble hands and his life was a lesson in self-help, even as Mahatma Gandhi’s
was in recent times. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> in his modest
way acted on the same principle–</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>though he may not have
been conscious of the fact that any </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>high principle was
involved in his way of living. Of course, he had not heard of Vedanta <span
class=SpellE>Desikar</span> at all. But it had become his habit to do all his
work himself without dependence on others. If anybody had praised him for his
fine quality or for following a noble principle, he would not have understood
it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
<span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> took up a <span class=SpellE>chiselling</span>
adze and started chipping a log of wood, the big pieces which he chopped would
fly like hawks in all directions. He was an expert in building a house, in
planning its foundations and its plinth, in erecting mud walls which were as
neat and precise as if they were made of brick, in fixing up doors and windows,
in devising hinges and bolts, in making up scaffoldings for building the upper
floors of tenements. His fame as a skilled designer and builder had spread all
over the region. Single-handed, he could do the work </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
ten blacksmiths, as many carpenters and masons, and had </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>constructed
numerous houses in the vicinity. Wherever one went in the villages near by, one
came across this evidence of his handiwork; and all the houses looked so firm
and lasting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Veerabhadrachari</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
constructed the house of <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>, the priest of
our village. If it had been situated in a town, it </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would
have cost anywhere from sixty to seventy thousand rupees. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it cost only as much as ten thousand rupees, though built in a village in the
good old days. It was one of the best houses built by <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
both from the point of view of cost and quality of the materials used. Though <span
class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> was a priest in the village temple, he had to
pay the customary due of a bundle of hay at the time of harvest to the village
astrologer, a custom handed down from many generations. But, latterly, <span
class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>, being himself in touch with divinity as a
priestly demurred to this payment to an astrologer who lived by divination.
‘After <span class=GramE>all the</span> astrologer derives his right by
devotion to the stars and planets: How is my prerogative, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>who
am engaged in the worship of <span class=SpellE>Anjaneya</span>, any the less?”
argued <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>. So this year when the astrologer
came to the threshing floor for receiving the customary gift: “Well, your
planets and stars can do nothing to me. I have my <span class=SpellE>Anjaneya</span>
to take care of me. You may go your way,” said <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>
to the astrologer. The astrologer, whose income had been gradually shrinking,
was not surprised at this, and went away quietly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
a few days later <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> had to solicit the <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of the astrologer to fix up an auspicious day for
the house-warming ceremony of his newly-built home. However much <span
class=SpellE>Anjaneya</span> was in his keeping, it was not possible for <span
class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> to take away from the astrologer his knowledge
of the movements of the stars and planets. Indeed, <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>
was not at all comfortable at having to approach the astrologer in regard to
this matter. But his wife was persistent: “It has been our custom to consult
the astrologer to fix up an auspicious date, and when he gives a date it has
always proved fortunate to the persons concerned. Please do consult the
astrologer,” she urged. <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> was reluctant:
“The astrologer’s talk is mere bluff, as the stars and planets have no better
business than to go about looking for my house!” Still, he proceeded to the
astrologer’s house and asked him to fix an auspicious date. The astrologer said
“The location of the house is not <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> to the
position of the planets at the time of your birth. If you go to dwell in that
house, you will not have any luck. You must propitiate the heavenly bodies and
it means expense–at least fifty rupees will be required for the necessary
ceremonies.” <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> knew that he had incurred
the displeasure of the astrologer, he did not, therefore, pay heed to his
warning or advice: “I have come to listen to your rigmarole. I am going to
dwell in that house without any of your advice” said <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>
and came away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as he returned home, he called his wife and said to her “Didn’t I tell you
already that asking that astrologer is no good? He is planning to deprive me of
fifty rupees. Am I going to bow before all this threat? We will move into the
new house the day after tomorrow”. “What an idea!” exclaimed the <span
class=GramE>wife.</span> “After spending so much over the construction of the
house, are we just moving into it as if it were a cattle pen? It should never
be done without proper religious ceremonies. It is a house which must continue
to bring luck to us and to our children for generations. Our days are over; bur
what about the good of the children? Do not do anything that may bring ill luck
to them in the future,” protested his wife. All news spreads quickly in a
village. The word soon went round that <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>
was occupying his new house without due religious ceremonies and people said:
“The pride of wealth has gone to his head.” <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>
came to hear of all this talk. Some elderly ladies called on <span
class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya’s</span> wife and took her to task for this
irreligious attitude. So at last <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> had to
agree to the performance of the necessary rites including the propitiation of
the deities before occupying the house. “But I am not going to have it all done
by that astrologer. Instead, I shall call in <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>,”
he said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Narasimhaiya</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> had a reason to come
to this decision. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> had been often
heard to say, “I know some astrology too. A person who can build a house surely
knows also something of the rites to be performed for occupying it!” Everyone
knew how versatile <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> was; and <span
class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> fully shared the confidence that the other
villagers had in <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari’s</span> many-sided
accomplishments. Further, here was a good chance of paying off his scores
against the astrologer and discrediting him. He did not want to lose such a
good opportunity. “This fellow thinks no end of himself; he imagines that the
crowing of the cock in his yard brings about the sunrise!” That very day <span
class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> met <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
and asked him: “You had better fix a good day for the house-warming ceremony
yourself.” After some hesitation, <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
agreed to the request. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Veerabhadrachari</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> knew a little reading
and writing. He immediately secured an almanac, and chose an auspicious day. He
had been present at several such ceremonies; so he pieced together in his
memory the rites he had observed and their sequence. He also consulted a few
house-owners who had performed these ceremonies. So he made a list of things
required, flowers, fruits, betel leaves, nuts, cocoanuts, new cloth, vessels,
lamp stands; cooked rice, dyed red and yellow; new clothes for himself and his
wife. Finally, when he came to know that the astrologer had prescribed special
propitiatory ceremonies to ward off evil planetary influences, he also put in a
demand for a hundred rupees towards the expenses of these special ceremonies.
This put <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span> into a state of great
embarrassment. But he could not draw back at this stage. If he called off the
arrangements and abandoned <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> now, all
the dinner being prepared, with so much trouble and expense would go waste: he
would cut a sorry figure before the people of the village, and, what was worse,
he would be giving a chance to the astrologer to crow louder than ever. He
would prevent at all cost the astrologer growing in prestige. So he meekly
submitted to all the demands made by <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>,
though he was <span class=SpellE>smouldering</span> with inward resentment all
the time. The ceremony was duly gone through and <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>,
decked in a new silk-bordered cloth, and his wife wearing the new sari
presented to her, took leave of him and went back to their house. The other
perquisites presented on the occasion, different kinds of grain, cocoanuts,
fruits, flowers etc., were all loaded in new baskets and borne by the servants
to <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari’s</span> residence. At one stroke, he
had earned on this single day more than he did during four months as a
house-builder. This became apparent to <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
as much as to the village priest <span class=SpellE>Narasimhaiya</span>. No one
had loaded the astrologer with so many gifts on the occasions of house-warming
ceremonies in the village. As <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>,
having his body daubed with sandal paste and flaunting a big round vermilion
mark on his forehead and wearing new clothes, strode along majestically in the
street accompanied by his wife was also wearing new clothes and suitably made
up, they indeed looked like Siva and <span class=SpellE>Parvati</span>. The
villagers looked on them with admiration and exclaimed: “He looks like a born
astrologer: he is equal to any job.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
incident made <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> quite another man
altogether. It looked as if a new world had opened before him: a new
opportunity, a new calling seemed to beckon to him: an easy and luxurious way
of making a living. “An astrologer’s is a lighter job than a builder’s, and
there is more profit in it. It also commands greater prestige, and is more
noble and dignified. The <span class=SpellE>labour</span> involved is certainly
very much less. “I gain as much in one day by following this occupation, as I
did by toiling for three months constructing houses.” These thoughts passed
through his mind. And in this new-found enthusiasm he forgot the fact that but
for him, the scores of houses he had built in the village and the surrounding
villages would never have come up. He forgot that hundreds of people always
remembered with gratitude the well-built dwelling-places that his <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> had provided for them. He was like the pillar–the
astrologer was no more than like the paint on the walls. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
was, for the moment, oblivious of this <span class=GramE>glaring ,</span>
difference between his occupations old and new. The desire to become an
astrologer became an obsession with him. It lured him as the mirage lures
thirsty <span class=SpellE>travellers</span> in the burning desert. The very
next day he started collecting textbooks bearing on the astrologer’s trade: <span
class=SpellE><i>Jyotishya</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Arudha</span> <span class=SpellE>Prashna</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chandrika</span>, <span class=SpellE>Vidyaguru</span></i> and so
on. He started <span class=SpellE>memorising</span> the names of planets and
stars. His <span class=GramE>chisel,</span> saw, adze, planning box and other
implements–everyone of which could build a kingdom–lay neglected in a corner
and gathered rust. They had shone with <span class=SpellE>lustre</span> in his
deft hands till the other day: now they retired into obscurity like an old man
whose days of active life have come to an end. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
ceased to look upon them, and instead, became absorbed in calculating <span
class=SpellE>favourable</span> conjunctions of planets, and numerous other
combinations, as expounded in the treatises on astrology. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the astrologer of the village. He prescribed auspicious dates for marriages: he
cast horoscopes; he officiated at house-warming ceremonies. The people of the
village flocked to him to consult him on all things and sundry, on omens, for
forecasts of various kinds, and to ward off all kinds of evil influences. This
gave him a sense of new prestige and he considered that his status in the
village had risen. The village astrologer whose popularity was already
declining was almost forgotten. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not long, however before <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> began
to have a feeling that he had also joined the ranks of the unemployed in the
world. One house after another in the village stood in need of repair. If a
pillar slanted or gave way, there was no one now to set it right. When the
handles of the villagers’ implements–the hoe, the spade, the shovel or the
pick-axe–broke loose or had to be replaced, there was no carpenter in the
village who could attend to it. There was no one <span class=GramE>to<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>sharpen</span> the ploughshare, or to <span
class=SpellE>retyre</span> the village cart. The barber’s razor needed
sharpening but no one could do it in the village. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
had been carpenter, blacksmith and general mechanic for the whole village: but
now that he had given up these jobs, the village began to present a ruined
appearance. The villagers had to go to the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span>
villages for all kinds of minor repairs. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
was merely on the look out to officiate at house-warming ceremonies: but no new
houses came up. The villagers found it impossible to get the services of
carpenters and smiths from <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> villages. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
had been one astrologer in the village. Now there were </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>two:
neither of them had enough to do: both became idle, dependent on others: mere
star-gazers. If <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> had continued as a
builder, scores of houses would have come up every year, and given a living to
four such indolent astrologers. In the old days <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
had had no rest: he was busy all the time from early morning till late at
night. His hands were always full of work of one kind or another. He toiled in
the sun and rain: his skin had become tanned and his body was firm and bright
as bronze. His mind was free and light as air. He seemed to be an image of the
Creator Himself: ever fashioning, ever creating: and there was no kind of
manual work at which he was not handy. In those days there was not a window in
the village which stood in need of repair: no beam or rafter which had bent out
of shape: no pillar which had slightest slant. When <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
worked as a master-builder he could not bear to see any building containing any
part which needed repair, just as rice-eaters cannot tolerate the presence of
grit or other foreign matter in a morsel of rice. The title of ‘<span
class=SpellE>Viswakarma</span>’ could be literally applied to him. He had
toiled for fifty years, and yet showed no signs of being borne down by age. But
during the last two years he had a paunch: his limbs were no longer supple and
firm but looked unshapely. His face showed signs of indolence: his moustache
which had not a speck of <span class=SpellE>grey</span> on it had now turned
white. The villagers uttered curses on astrology: “These evil planets have
brought ruin on our houses: ruin seize them!” But <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
looked on unconcerned. His astrological treatises were neatly bundled up in a
silken scarf, which he tied up and untied regularly. The bundle also contained
a slate, and a few cowries. He sat watching through the window and waiting for
his clients, and stroking his moustache, oblivious of which was gradually
spreading over the village. Crowds of people used to go to him for
consultation. Latterly had this had changed, and he had now few visitors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

two years had elapsed, and the roof of <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari’s</span>
own house began to leak like other houses in the village. White ants had
started making depredations on the roof. The rafters and crossbeams got loose
and had moved from their positions. In the old days when there was anything
that went slightly wrong, <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> would be
ready with his tools and set things right before further damage was done. To
remove the tiles from the roof, make necessary repairs and replace the tiles on
the roof was just a minor job for him. He was repairing all the houses in the
village; to set right something that went wrong in his own house was a very
simple matter. The wife had kept the house always spotlessly clean, taking her
cue from the enthusiastic energy of her husband. But of late, after the <span
class=SpellE>Achari</span> <span class=SpellE>beca</span> preoccupied with
stars, planets and astrological literature and cast aside his chisel, plane and
other tools, he had ceased to use his hands. His house was showing signs of
disrepair and neglect but he was gazing at the roof and at his implements like
a cripple looking up wistfully at the cocoanut tree far above his reach. One
night it rained so heavily that water soaked into the walls and the roof
collapsed. Luckily no one was hurt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>re-building his house;
but since it meant a mere eight or ten days’ work for him, he had gone on
postponing the undertaking., “</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>can do this at any
time; it is not such a big piece of work to bother about,” he used to say and
drop the idea for the time being. Moreover, since his hands were always full of
building houses for others, he had no time to attend to this small piece of
work in regard to his own house. But now that his house had come down, he had
to attend to its rebuilding. He started working on it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
<span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> was now a full-fledged astrologer,
he fixed a proper date for digging the foundations, and turning the sod with
due pomp and ceremony, scented sticks, cocoanuts <span class=SpellE>coloured</span>
powder and rice and flowers were all assembled for the rites which were
performed with great punctiliousness. The villagers w</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ondered
among themselves, “He has prepared a perfect plan and designed to build a house
that can last for ever. Why all this ceremonial </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fuss!” After
turning the sod, trenches had to be dug for the foundation. If it had been the
old days, he would have taken up the pick-axe himself and with the help of two
or three free <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> he would have dug trenches
three or four feet deep, without any further thought. And since his <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> was wanted by everybody, there was no lack of
willing <span class=SpellE>labour</span>. But now he had to hire <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> by paying at full rates. And if the handles of the
pick-axes got loose or gave away, he was not now in a position to fix them
right. The digging of the foundation which would have taken only three days
formerly was not completed even after </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thirty days. He used to
build the walls himself; but now he entrusted it on contract to the <span
class=SpellE>Harijan</span> <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> of the village.
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
knew how to erect them straight and strong; but now the work of the <span
class=SpellE>labourers</span> which left the wall full of ugly curves and dents
irritated him. After the Walls had been raised, he trusted the wood-work to a
carpenter who was not so skilled a worker, but whose greed was unbounded. Even
before he commenced his work, he extorted from <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
all the money, in advance, on one pretext or other. The walls were ding in an
unshapely way; the beams that had to be raised on to the roof were lying about.
It was already four months since the work had begun. There was untimely rain,
and as a result the walls were damaged by cracks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rainy season was coming on; and there was no hope that the carpenter would
finish his part of the work before the rains descended. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span>
lost his temper, and became wild with everybody. In the old days he would have
finished the whole job by himself in about a month. With an adze in hand he
would have prepared all the beams required in just one day. He looked wistfully
now and then at the tools lying neglected in a corner of his house. His shorts
which he wore when he was working at the forge and which he had not cast away
as it was still in good shape, was hanging from a peg, and his eyes wandered
towards them. He had been working with clay, wood as well as iron in former
times. Then his glance went down to regard for a moment the lace-bordered
cloth, the bundle of astrological treatises and the cowries–the perquisites of
his latter-day occupation. He immediately thought of fixing a day for the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>house-warming
ceremony of the house now under construction, and started making calculations
on the slate. Since he was now himself an astrologer, it was his intent to fix
up a thoroughly auspicious day for the purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was so wholly
engrossed in making the calculations, that he was not even aware that the
shades of evening had begun to cover the earth. His wife came in and said,
“Well, you sit here absorbed in your calculations, and the rain is likely to
pour down. Even a little rain will bring down the wall. If that happens, our
lot will be to dwell in a thatched cottage for the rest of our lives.” As soon
as the <span class=SpellE>Achari</span> heard the word ‘rain’ he started as if
a scorpion had stung him. He immediately got up, came out into the street and
looked up at the sky. Black clouds were gathering and sweeping on like a herd
of elephants moving in single file. The sky was pierced by lightning, and the
rumble of thunder shook the earth. But since the lightning flashed in the
north-west, <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> thought it would not
rain that day, nor for a week more. He looked at the walls exposed to the
ravages of the weather. He also saw the logs of wood, collected for being
fashioned into beams, lying <span class=SpellE>pell</span> <span class=SpellE>mell</span>,
and the bamboos and the tiles of the old house intended for the roofing lying
everywhere in disorder. They seemed to complain in mute helplessness: “We are
all here: but no one seems willing to put us into proper position.” Just then
he heard again a rumble of thunder. Something stirred within him and put a new
life into him. His face brightened with a new energy and a new determination.
His movements became agile. The silk-bordered cloth he was wearing seemed to
him like a fetter round his legs. Like a bee inebriated with honey, he swooped
into the house. His wife had been familiar with his vigorous and athletic
movements before he turned to be an astrologer. She now watched him with
wonder: he hardly noticed her but went straight to the peg from which his
shorts were suspended. He snatched it and put it on. The cloth he had worn
slipped down and lay on the floor. He took up the bundle of astrological
treatises, slate, cowries etc., tied up in a silk scarf and flung it all out.
There was a wooden plank on which was a sacred vessel, surmounted by a cocoanut
and mango leaves, and daubed with turmeric and red powder, his paraphernalia
and equipment in the pursuit of his trade as an astrologer. He made a clean
sweep of it all. His wife was noticing him with increasing fear and surprise,
and wondering whether he had gone out of his senses. The <span class=SpellE>Achari</span>
took up the adze and marched out. “What are you doing? Why?” shouted his wife
following his footsteps. The <span class=SpellE>Achari</span> spoke not a word:
he was like one possessed and proceeded to sharpen the tool. It had become
rusty, and dull, but now it glistened with a new <span class=SpellE>lustre</span>.
The clouds by now had scattered and stars appeared in the sky. Before he had
taken to the almanac and the trade of an astrologer, the <span class=SpellE>Achari</span>
used to work in just such a kind of starlight. And now he was at it again, once
more his old self! He started <span class=SpellE>chiselling</span> the log of
wood and shaping it into a beam. The strokes of his axe again fell in perfect
rhythm, and huge chips went flying about. Hearing this sound, many villagers
gathered at the shop. <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> worked on like
one in a trance. He worked all through the night. By sunrise he had shaped all
the logs lying about there into fine-looking beams. The chips of wood could be
put into four cartloads. The villagers who watched were greatly excited over
it. “The blight that had fallen on the village is now gone!” they exclaimed in
joy. In front of the <span class=SpellE>Achari’s</span> house, which had
presented a deserted appearance all these days, there now collected old carts,
ploughs and other implements needing repair. The forge was once more lighted,
and the bellows were plied. As the villagers depended on the <span
class=SpellE>Achari</span> for so many things, many of them <span class=SpellE>laboured</span>
willingly for him. They completed the roof of his new house in four days. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

smithy in front of <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari’s</span> house had come
to life again, and the adze was again in his hand. Noticing this the customary
astrologer of the village mused: “I had no job for a couple of years. No one
built houses. There were no house-warming ceremonies in consequence. The
eclipse that had overtaken <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadrachari</span> has
released him. Now new houses will arise and there will be the usual ceremonies
for entering them.” With these thoughts passing through his mind, the
professional astrologer dusted his almanac, and kept it ready for use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

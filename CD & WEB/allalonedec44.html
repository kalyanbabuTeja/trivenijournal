the eldest son of Vakil Dasaratharama Iyer, was insisting on studying England
for the Indian Civil Service examination; his father was anxious that his son
should proceed to England only after getting married, and because of the
excellence of Kalyani’s horoscope, it was settled that he should marry her. He
left for England the month after the marriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a week before Deepavali, Kalyani’s father was continually sending messengers to
his <i>sambandhi </i>Dasaratharama Iyer’s house inquiring whether there was any
cablegram. I was at Kalyani’s house as usual on the Deepavali eve. Kalyani and
I were discussing about the Chinese crackers we would have on the next day and
about the new dresses that had been bought for our use on the morrow. Suddenly,
both the elder brothers of Kalyani burst into our room holding out a cablegram
and exclaiming “Kalyani, <i>mappillai </i>(brother-in-law) has secured a pass”,
Kalyani was a bit shy, but could not control her joy; she snatched at the
cablegram and went into the inner hall. Her two brothers followed her there,
leaving me alone. And all the household were gathered together; I could hear
them talking and laughing and partaking of the merriment. Why did they not
invite me to join them?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

too became a girl of sixteen in due course. My mother kept worrying herself
that I was not married yet. My father was searching far and wide for a good
husband for me. Who would like to push his own child into the well? As he was
anxious that I should be happy, he did not like to do things in a hurry, for
this was a matter which would decide my future irretrievably; and as he could
not secure a suitable bridegroom, he had perforce to postpone my marriage from
year to year, He had secured fairly good bridegrooms for all my elder sisters.
But as financial troubles grew, he began to lose confidence in himself. My
mother used often to remark, “Oh, that this girl was born a boy!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day, I heard that somebody was coming to our house to have a look at me.
Although I tried my best, I could not learn anything from the subdued
discussions between my parents. Only, my mother took me aside and told me to
dress my hair and remain at home wearing a good <i>saree </i>and not to stir
out. I tried to picture to my mind how <i>he </i>would look, but I could not. I
did not know if <i>he </i>was dark or fair even; and there was nobody who would
tell me. It was only then that I felt, “Why am I not of the age of my younger
brother Kittu” Then, nobody would suspect me, nobody would hide things from me.
Kittu was always with my father; he was always sitting by my father’s side,
listening to his discussions with my mother. Nothing could be learnt from
Kittu, however. If I were only Kittu, how clearly would I follow the entire
discussions!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

could I do? My father came with us to the railway station and took leave of us.
I sat in a corner of the railway carriage. When the train started, my husband
came and sat by my side and leisurely surveyed me; and as he was new to me and
as I could not guess what sort of a person he </span><span style='font-size:

know what to do. I kept gazing towards the unshuttered door. His first words
which came slow, “Are you sad to marry me?” </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>stressed the fact that
he was an old widower. As I gathered from his faltering voice somewhat of the
storm raging in his mind, I just nodded, ‘No’. “But,” he added in a low tone,
“it would be somewhat of a task. My eldest boy Ramu is somewhat obstinate. With
him only, you will have to be cautious.” It was only then I knew that he had children.
I had a mind to know how many they were. But could I ask? If I asked, what
would he think of me? So, I thought it proper to keep mum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we reached his place, his car was waiting for us at the railway station. It was
then I learnt that he had a daughter also; for, as soon as we were seated in
the car he inquired of the driver, “Is Sundari at home?” and the reply came,
“Yes, Sir, she is here.” Then he turned to me and said, “Don’t worry about
Sundari. She is an innocent girl. You can easily take care of her.” I knew well
enough what was in his mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

car stopped in front of a small bungalow and the servants were busy with the
luggage. ‘Father’ came a shout from inside the house; and before we were at the
door-step, a girl came running towards us. Yes, she was Sundari. Nestling in
her parent’s embrace, she stared at me, while my </span><span style='font-size:

her up on his shoulders and walked in. As I stepped in behind him, a woman in a
white <i>saree, </i>greeted me, and talking hold of the <i>kuja </i>which I
carried in my right hand, she took me inside the house. I looked in vain for my
husband’s eldest son, about whom he had warned me. He came downstairs quietly
from his room, only when my husband called him later in the day, to come down
for breakfast; and, even then, saying nothing, he went straight to his place
next his father without lifting up his head. I looked at him from my hidden
corner. And when he was asked, “Have you no school today?” I heard him mumble,
“I have; but–” I was not able to see much of him afterwards. I was able to
observe him only on that day; thereafter I could scarcely notice him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years flew away. Not only was my husband very loving towards me but he never
even once felt uneasy about my conduct in any particular. And I, too, regarded
Sundari, as if she were my child. Only Ramu passed his days in the city
attending college, except on the few occasions when he came home for the
recess. When he topped the list of successful candidates in the B. A. degree
examination, his father’s joy knew no bounds. He used to reply at once to his
son’s letters and to send him every month whatever money he asked for. He did
not even object to his proceeding to England for<i> </i>higher study, but made
all the necessary arrangements therefore accompanied him to Colombo to see him
off and remained dumb stricken with grief for a whole week thereafter. But when
he talked with me, it was always, about me; sometimes it may be about Sundari
but, never, never, even casually, would he mention Ramu. What guilt of mine was
this a punishment for? I admired Ramu’s brightness of face when I saw him, and
I liked him. And whatever careful and elaborate attention his father might have
given to his future requirements during his sojourn in England, Ramu must have
felt the absence of a mother who would have anxiously and repeatedly advised
him on the eve of his starting on such a long journey to take care of himself,
and particularly to take care of his health. That day, I expressed to my
husband in tremulous words my anxiety about the boy going alone to such a
distant place at such a tender age; and he said, “If you like, speak to him
yourself.” How can I talk freely with one with whom I had not talked before?
But he could have spoken to me, at least a formal word of leave-taking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

husband was proud of his son’s studies in England. If anybody asked him, “When
is your son coming back?”, he would at once start off boasting, “He says that
he will sit for all the examinations, ‘Why, sit only for<i> </i>the I. C. S.?’
he says; his professors are all proud of him. Even Ranga Iyengar’s son who
returned from England last week admits that it is so.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evening, when I had just returned home, and my husband had not returned from
the club, our servant handed me a cablegram. I tore off the envelope and hurriedly
glanced through the message. Ramu’s friend had cabled that Ramu was having high
fever for over a week. I was oppressed on the one hand by the urgency of
sending the message to my husband, and on the other hand, by the uneasiness due
to having looked at the message. However, I hastened to send the message
through a servant to the club. In ten minutes my husband had returned; and,
without a word, he wrote a message and sent it to the telegraph office, while I
looked on with an anxious face. Hanging down his head in grief, he went
straight to his room and would not come out. Gently and slowly I stepped into
his room and saw him lying in an easy chair, with his eyes closed and
supporting his head with his hand. At the sound of my foot steps, he opened his
eyes just for a moment and closed them enquiring, “Has Sundari gone to
sleep?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apparently he did not believe
in my joining him in his grief. My mind was oppressed. What could I do? I did
not know how to induce my husband to share his grief with me. He could not take
food as usual. And when he did not take his usual food, how could I by myself
have my fill of food?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

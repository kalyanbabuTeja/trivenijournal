was a Public Reading Room situated on the top floor of a building in the bazaar
street of Trichinopoly–I do not know if it is there now. There were four
book-shelves stocked with books, mostly in English. There was a good collection
of books dealing with the National Movement in India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the middle of the room was a long table. A few armless chairs were lying about

gentleman walked into this place. Nobody took notice of him. Instead of taking
one of the chairs, the new arrival settled himself on the edge of the long
table. Immediately he drew everybody’s attention. I too looked at him, His face
beamed with intelligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Manager of the Reading Room was a quiet, unoffending gentleman. He came near
the stranger and said, “Sir, you should not sit on the table. Please get down
and sit on a chair.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The stranger regarded the Manager for a moment, and
turned away his look. He neither made a reply nor did he get down from the
table. The Manager pursued the topic, “Sir, don’t you hear what I am saying?”
This released a cataract of words from the stranger. “I hear very well indeed!
O, yes. I am quite good of hearing, You ask me to get down, don’t you? You want
to put me down, to degrade me somehow. Is that not all? Is it not because of
this we are a nation of slaves? We are always busy looking for opportunities to
pull down one another, to degrade one another. We never lose a chance. There is
no desire to lift up one another, to encourage one another. Even if there is
the will, there is not the capacity. But when it comes to pulling down one
another, well, we are ready. No, Sir, I won’t get down,” and so on and so on.
The Manager interrupted this unending flow of words and remarked: “Well, Sir,
you seem to let yourself go rather freely.” “Yes, Sir, indeed, I do talk, Sir.
And why not may I ask? And who are you to gag me? The foreign ruler, of course,
gags us and prevents our free expression of views. And you follow his example.
I am not going to be suppressed in this fashion. I will talk. You may hear if
you please; if not, you are welcome to stuff your ears with cotton wool.” And
more words to the same effect.</p>

seemed as if a storm burst, the thunder roared, the lightning flashed, and a
torrent of rain had emptied itself. The poor Manager was utterly discomfited.
There was silence for a time. The stranger who was doggedly sitting on the
table, glanced at the book which I was reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“O! This young man is reading Tilak’s lecture. You
know why? Just to improve his knowledge of English. If this book had been
written in Tamil, he would not have touched it. Chidambaram Pillai of Tuticorin
has delivered many speeches. Has any one thought of publishing them in
book-form? Not at all. And even if there were such a publication, who would
have cared to read it? None of us will touch a book if it is in Tamil. This
very Reading Room contains a good library. But is there a good Tamil book in
it? Not one. There is no one in this world so degenerate as the Tamilian. He
will read any other language but not his own. ‘What is there in Tamil?’ he will
ask unashamed. He feels no pride as a Tamilian. There are so many of you
sitting here, and you read all sorts of grand things. Have any of you heard of
Subrahmanya Bharati? Where is he now? What is he doing? Are any of you bothered
about these things? Why sirs, why are you all silent, why won’t you talk? You
will never even open your mouths. Why won’t you say something in reply. Well,
well, none of you seem to care what I am shouting about. Why should I cry
myself hoarse? I will not continue my cry in a widerness. Mr. Manager, here I
am getting down from the table. You are now satisfied, aren’t</p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>you? Be at peace. I
shall not only get down from the table but shall take myself away from this
premises altogether.” With this parting shot the stranger went down
precipitately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

year, Va. Ra is reaching his sixtieth year. There has been a proposal to
celebrate the occasion. It is also intended to present him with a purse. Among
the speeches that were delivered at the preliminary meeting convened to take
steps to celebrate his sixtieth birthday, some dwelt on his great services to
Tamil literature; others laid emphasis on the presentation of a purse to him
and the need to keep him above want, and to ensure that he lived in some amount
of comfort in his old age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an hour after the meeting, I called on Va. Ra at his residence in Madras. I
thought he would be cheerful and pleased. On the other hand, he seemed to be
put out and shouting at people. Someone had preceded me and acquainted him with
all that had happened at the preliminary meeting mentioned above. The reference
to his poverty had not at all pleased him, and so he was rather upset. As soon
as he saw me he burst out: “Well, Sir; what is this idea of giving me a purse?
Because I am a poor man? I am not a poor man. I command all the wealth of the
world. If you intend to present me with a purse because of my poverty, there
are many others poorer than I. Why not present purses to them? Why only to me?
I am a writer. I have done some little service to the cause of Tamil
literature. If in recognition of this you wish to honour me with a purse, do
so. Otherwise, I shall have nothing to do with your arrangements.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

saw that it was the same Va. Ra whom I had seen thirty years ago–the same
traits of character, nothing altered. His mode of talking, his way of arguing,
his sense of self-respect, these were as pronounced as ever. I said, “I request
you to listen to me. Different persons will always speak in different ways. No
two faces are quite the same in creation. In the same way no two have exactly
the same way of thinking about things. But all are actuated by motives of
regard and affection towards you. I beseech you to bear with everybody

Va. Ra. Love of the Tamil language is the very breath of his nostrils. His mind
and heart are set on its improvement. Love of liberty is the inspiration of his
life. Self-respect is his soul.” The welfare and prosperity of writers,
particularly of Tamil writers, is his religious creed. He gave up distinctions
of caste and creed long ago. But I do not think he will demur to my saying that
he belongs to the ‘Writers’ Caste’ and none other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

created a band of new writers. He inspired them with purpose and enthusiasm.
The honour of the Tamil writer became a matter of deep personal concern with
him. He was vigilant in guarding the self-respect of the writer. He made
himself their champion and protector and still continues to be one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

services rendered by Va. Ra to Tamil Nad and to the cause of Tamil literature
are great and incalculable. The power of the pen is readily acknowledged by
all. That it is more powerful than the Drama, the Cinema, and the Radio has
been put to the test in the affairs of the world during the last decade. The
Drama, the Cinema, and the Radio cannot bring about a change of government in a
country as the pen can. The country is beholden to Va. Ra. for having made it
realise the enormous power that the pen can wield. And Tamil writers are bound
to him by ties of great gratitude for all that he has done for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Pastoral poetry and the poetry of Nature are apt to
be confused with each other. The pastoral is a conventional type of poetry
handed down by the Greeks and Romans, and its greatest exponent in England was
Edmund Spenser. It deals with rural life, especially the life of the shepherds.
The poetry of Nature, on the other hand, depicts the varied splendours of the
visible Universe. William Wordsworth might be said to be the greatest exponent
of the poetry of Nature. We are here concerned with the pastoral, how it
originated and developed at different times and places.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
origins of pastoralism may be traced back almost to the beginnings of
literature. Vedavyasa, whose time cannot be determined with certainty, depicted
the life of Lord Krishna in detail in the tenth section of his <i>Bhagavata. </i>This
legend has ever since become popular and hundreds of songs, lyrics and poems
were written taking it as their central theme. Among such varied compositions,
the <i>Gita Govinda </i>of Jayadeva (1150 A. D.), written in Sanskrit, is
acknowledged by many to be the finest. Krishna, who belongs to the shepherd
community, was engaged in amorous sports with the Gopis, the cowherdesses who
allegorically represent the pleasures of the illusory world. Later, when he
sees Radha, the personification of Divine Love and Beauty, he feels ashamed of
his previous conduct and eagerly awaits union with Radha. After some delay,
which only serves to increase the longing of the one for the other, they are
brought together and this wonderful lyric drama ends in the inevitable union of
Krishna with Radha. Thus, the half-human and half-divine hero of the poem is
the allegoric representation of a person attracted alternately by earthly and
heavenly love and finally emancipated from<i> </i>all sensuous attractions. The
same story is told by Yerrapraggada (14th century) in his <i>Harivamsa </i>in
Telugu. It is only natural that<i> </i>such a popular legend as this should be
transcribed into several Indian literatures. What is more, a great oriental
scholar like Sir Edwin Arnold translated Jayadeva’s <i>Gita Govinda </i>into
English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the West, the earliest traces of Pastoralism may be found in the Sicilian
folk-songs. It was, however, Theocritus, the Greek poet of the third century
B.C., who created the literary pastoral in his ‘Idylls’ and ‘Epigrams’. He
delineated the fantastic scenery of the conventional Arcadia which included the
rich beauty of the Sicilian landscape, the wooded lawns of Aetna and the cool
streams from the high snows. Sometimes, the poet himself spoke in the guise of
a shepherd. The pastoral atmosphere is seen in the singing match in which two
shepherds competed by improvising alternate verses or stanzas, often preceded
by an exchange of banter or insults. Sometimes, there is a dirge for a dead
shepherd. The love-lay of courtship or complaint is also introduced in some old
pastorals. Theocritus took over these motifs and turned the lyric rhythms into
his own melodious hexameter and infused much of his own poetry into rustic
phrase. The religion of the shepherd was the germ of strange developments in later
times. Bion, the younger contemporary of Theocritus, wrote <i>Adonis </i>imitating
Theocritus. The story of this poem is taken from the Greek mythology. Adonis,
son of Cinyras, was loved by Aphrodite; he was killed by a wild boar while
hunting, and was changed by Aphrodite into the anemone. He was restored to life
by Proserpine. This poem is remarkable for its gorgeousness. Moschus, a pupil
of Bion, mourned the death of Bion in a fine poem. This poem owes more to the
intellect than the heart. When all is said, the elements of artificiality mark
off the work of Bion and Moschus from that of Theocritus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Virgil,
the renowned Roman poet, also comes under the Classical school. He elaborated
the pastoral more subtly and thoughtfully than Theocritus. He portrayed ‘delicate,
distilled beauties,’ but their charm is somewhat artificial and exotic. Virgil
added the ‘panegyric’ to the pastoral forms. The allegorical pastoral was his
original contribution to this <i>genre. </i>His bucolic ‘Eclogues’ were so
famous that the term ‘eclogue’ became a synonym for a pastoral poem. These
eclogues of Virgil marked the distinct beginnings of pastoralism in poetry. It
had developed into<i> </i>regular <i>genre, </i>ranking below Epic and Tragedy,
but highly respectable, a scholarly form having its own functions, rules and
scope. The conventional country for this pastoral was not Sicily, nor an
imagined Arcadia, but the poet’s own surroundings. The mind was not removed
from everyday life and the poet’s own interests, but it was occupied with them.
Virgil made the shepherd a mouthpiece for compliments addressed to statesmen in
the city, and with equal readiness, the eclogue in the Middle Ages passed from
civil into ecclesiastical allegory for the purpose of flattery or satire. A
certain convenient obscurity thus began to cover all pastoral utterances, so
that, to quote the words of Petrarch, “if the author does not provide a
commentary, its meaning may, perhaps, be guessed but can never be fully
understood”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Petrarch
was the leader of the Humanist school and he was the first person to use the
pastoral as a vehicle of veiled political satire. Boccaccio, the great Italian
story-teller, wove the eclogue material into the first pastoral romances in his
<i>Ameto </i>(1342). Three generations later, Mantuanus (1448-1516) and
Sannazaro whose influence coloured all the pastoral writing of the sixteenth
century, followed the, two lines of development initiated by Petrarch and
Boccaccio. Mantuanus, who died just before the dawn of the Renaissance,
following the tradition of his predecessors, wrote his eclogues in Latin. His
pastorals were a vehicle for piquant but intelligible satire. He refreshed the
worn-out topics and scenery with drastic realism. Sannazaro wrote his <i>Arcadia
</i>(1504) in Italian which exercised considerable influence over the
contemporary poets of all climes. The shepherds in Mantuanus meet to discuss
society, whereas those in Sannazaro meet to forget it. Sannazaro feigns himself
to have lived in remote Arcadia among the herdsmen and witnessed their innocent
gaieties. Here, the scenery becomes purely ideal and conventional. Arcadia is a
land of fountains, and birds that never cease to sing and woods that never
decay. Here was a form in which the tenderer idealisms and feminine
sentimentalities of the sixteenth century could find expression, in which all
who sighed for rural simplicity, or shrank from the splendid or sordid artifice
of cities and courts, could embody their golden dreams. Towards the middle of
the century, this indolent Arcadia was quickened by an infusion of the nobler
idealism of chivalry, and in this form it inspired both Montemayor’s <i>Diana </i>(1542)
and Philip Sidney’s <i>Arcadia </i>(1580) where the trumpet is heard as often
as the lover’s lute, and we are not for long allowed to forget that Arcadia
borders on Sparta. In the French Humanist school, Clement Marot was the portant
poet. He naturalised the form of the Latin eclogue in French vernacular and
wrote a dirge for the mother of Francis I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
England before Spenser, some people like Barclay, Turberville and Barnabe Googe
translated eclogues from Latin and Italian. Sidney and Spenser were the chief
poets who made pastoralism all-embracing and all-comprehensive by bringing
allegory and morality into its fold. In Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>Arcadia, </i>the
king, Basileus, had retired to the ideal haven of Arcadia where he brought up
his daughters as shepherdesses. The country portrayed in it is the most
delightful in the world, its people the earth’s happiest inhabitants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pastoralism
supplied to young Spenser “the poetry of personal atmosphere” which he needed.
And it was he who first turned from the artificial Latin style to the peasant
dialect of the actual rustics, and Sidney blamed him for this. Spenser’s <i>Shepherd’s
Calendar </i>(1579) is an epitome of all the trends of pastoralism. The twelve
eclogues are a sort of summary of the whole past history of pastoralism. In
one, the naturalism of Theocritus is more prominent, in another the conventions
of Virgil, in a third the political diatribes of Mantuanus, in a fourth the
gracious pathos of Marot. The shepherd does not talk of his life only as a
shepherd. He is a moralist, a lover, a poet and a rustic. Colin, the
unsuccessful wooer of Rosalind, is the least indistinct figure in the poem, and
his melodious despair recurs with the persistent iteration of a chorus or a
burden. The shepherd as a poet is portrayed in the October eclogue where
Spenser gave direct expression to his poetic ideals. This noble and pregnant
piece is the very core of the <i>Shepherd’s Calendar. </i>An undertone of
indignant scorn pervades it, but with the ethical and satiric strain there
mingles the thought of Colin’s love and of his poetry. Spenser’s high Platonic
creed of<i> </i>love is embodied in the <i>Calendar. </i>He would have confined
himself to the rendering of the traditional idea of pastoral love adapted to
the changes of different seasons. But, the unity of design solely lies in an
allegorical calendar, treated ethically, in agreement with the physical
characteristics of the different months. The idea of love is presented
prominently only in four of the eclogues, viz., those for January, March, June
and December; the rest four, those for February, May, July and September deal
with matters relating to morality or religion; two are complimentary or
elegiac, those for April and November; one, that for Augu describes a singing
match pure and simple; one, that for October is devoted to a lament for the
neglect of poetry. Spenser used the monologue as Virgil and Marot did, in
January and December, dialogues in February, and a conversation of three in
August. This last, again, may be of three kinds. It may be a genuine discussion
as in October and June, a contest as in August, or a narrative as in February,
March and May. Spenser was quite untrue to English scenery, flowers, speech,
weather, habits and everything else, since he was not writing about real
shepherds, but creating an English version of a convention and he gives just
enough detail to naturalise and anglicise it. He invented a new gambit in
linking his eclogues together in a calendar, but in most other respects he
followed the tradition. The <i>Calendar </i>could be recognised as belonging to
the new tradition which had triumphed in Italy and France, yet no one could
call it Latinised or Frenchified. Professor Herford rightly remarked that “the <i>Calendar
</i>marks the entrance into English poetry of the exaltation of beauty and the
rapture of song”. Professor Oliver Elton refers to it as “the bright flower in
the seedlings of the pastoral lyric, which has descended from Greece through
ancient and modern Italy”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the exuberant enthusiasm of the memorable Elizabethan Age several writers were
attracted by the pastorals, and some of them introduced this element into their
writings. Marlowe’s <i>The Passionate Shepherd to his Love, </i>and Drayton’s <i>Idea:
The Shepherd’s Garland </i>may be mentioned in this connection. The pastoral
found its way into the drama also quite naturally, since it was the most
popular literary form in the great Elizabethan Era. A number of plays were
written with pastoral themes between 1600 and 1642. Ben Jonson’s <i>The Sad
Shepherd, </i>Shirley’s <i>A Pastorall Called the Arcadia, </i>Fletcher’s <i>The
Faithful Shepheardesse, </i>Randolph’s <i>Amyntas or The Impossible Dowry </i>and
Rutter’s <i>Shepheard’s Holy-Day-</i>these<i> </i>and many others were dramatic
essays in pastoralism. Ben Jonson and Fletcher were the most successful in this
genre<i>. </i>It is needless to add that Shakespeare towers aloft in this as in
many other things. His sixteenth century comedies were, in general, pastoral in
character. In <i>As You Like It, </i>Orlando and Rosalind woo each other in the
Forest of Arden amidst a natural pastoral atmosphere. The sheep-shearing scene
in <i>The Winter’s Tale, </i>where Florizel falls in love with Perdita, the
‘Queen of Curds and Cream’, has hardly anything to compare with, in its charm.
It clearly shows us that Shakespeare had few equals in the delineation of
pastoral atmosphere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
pastoral elegy was also successfully handled by poets like Milton, Gray,
Shelley and Matthew Arnold. Milton laments the death of his friend, Edward
King, in <i>Lycidas, </i>Shelley the death of Keats in <i>Adonais, </i>and
Arnold that of Clough in <i>Thyrsis. </i>In <i>Lycidas </i>and <i>Adonais </i>there
is the same general plan. Both begin with grief for the dead. This is followed
by a stern denunciation the living and finally there are strains of solemn joy.
Gray’s <i>Ellegy Written in a Country Churchyard </i>is not a conventional
lament any particular personal friend, but a pathetic presentation of the short
and simple annals of the poor’, ‘their homely joys and destiny obscure’. Gray
shows us the transient nature mundane pleasures and declares that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

depicted country life with stark realism. <i>The Deserted Village </i>of the

conventional and stereotyped pastorals of the previous centuries, which only
idealised and prettified everything in the village. George Crabbe declared that

with the life of the sinners, the toilers and the have-nots who are at the
bottom rung of the social ladder. He wanted to picture reality and so he did
not very much care for the melody. He had succeeded well in rousing the
conscience of the readers and enlisting their sympathy for the poor. In the

Industrial Revolution had changed the texture of country life considerably and
the mechanisation and urbanisation affected life in the villages also. The
inhabitants of the villages gradually deserted them and opted for the urban
areas to earn their livelihood. This is not the singular misfortune of England.
This is equally true of our own country which we consider to be lagging behind
in industrialisation. Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, the renowned Bengali novelist,
portrayed the heart-rending conditions of the villages in one of his novels and
suggested that the only remedy for the present evils rests with the educated
youth of the village whom he urged to return to their villages and improve the
conditions, thus giving the benefit of their education to their own villagers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

upset the normal peaceful life of the people everywhere on the globe. The
Atomic Age has shattered the hopes and aspirations of the people and increased

influenced the writings of the last hundred years or so. Britons, particularly
the English Muse, have an innate love for country life, but they could not

are not very different even in India. Though we did not have any ‘tradition’ of
pastoral poetry, there were poems dealing with rural life. In the songs and
lyrics of renowned poets like Basavaraju Apparao, Nanduri Subbarao, Rayaprolu
Subbarao, Abburu Ramakrishnarao, Kavikondala Venkatarao and Adivi Bapiraju, we
often come across fine descriptions of rural life. Duvvuri Rami Reddi’s <i>Krishivaludu
</i>gives a full account of the life of the peasant. Mention may also be made
of Etukuri Venkata Narasayya’s <i>Kshetralakshmi. </i>The writing of pastorals
in the same quantity and quality as in the Elizabethan Age cannot be expected
under the changed conditions, and the pastoral tradition seems to have withered
away.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:

the foregoing sketchy survey of the Tradition of Pastora1 Poetry in different
times and climes, it may be seen how the pastoral, beginning in the West as a
simple pipe to represent either a contest in singing between two shepherds, a
lover’s complaint, or a dirge for a dead shepherd, was transported into the
region of allegory. The singing dialogue was turned into a channel for
discoursing on the contemporary state of poetry. Love was sometimes treated in
its Platonic character. The dirge was developed into a court panegyric. The
eclogue was invested with a certain novelty of appearance. Thus the pastoral
provided the accepted and acceptable way of treating personal and contemporary
affairs. It was an added virtue that it provided opportunities for pretty and
amusing descriptions and evocations of rural life and scenery; but no one
pretended the shepherds were real.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the words of Dr. Johnson, “the Pastoral is a way
of perturbations into Elysian regions, where we are to meet with nothing but
joy and plenty and contentment; where the gale whispers pleasure, every shade
promises repose.” The pastoral brings a perfect freedom with it:</p>

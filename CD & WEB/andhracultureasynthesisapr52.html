stands as a bridge between the North and South of India, between Aryan and
Dravidian cultures. It is a clearing house of cultures. Therefore we find that
‘synthesis’ is the key-note of Andhra culture. The very composition of the
Andhra people is an illustration. Here is an admixture of the Aryan Andhra with
Dravidian Tenugu. The Andhras were originally an Aryan tribe who were
excommunicated from the Aryan fold, perhaps for laxity in life. They are
mentioned in ‘Aitareya Brahmana’, which belongs to the Rigveda and is dated
probably 1,000 B. C. This ‘Brahmana’ describes how Andhras were cursed and were
grouped with non-Aryan tribes like Pundra, Pulinda, Mutiba an</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>d
Sabara. These latter were Dravidian tribes living in the Vindhya region. The
Sabaras, or Savaras, are to this day part of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the Andhra
people found in Visakhapatnam District. The river Sabari, a tributary of the
Godavari, seems to be named after them. The Telugu or Tenugu people were the
children of the soil. They were </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a Dravidian tribe.
Tenugu means ‘the people to the south’. The word Telugu seems to be
Sanskritised into Trilinga, ‘the land of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>three Siva lingas’.
These holy shrines are found even now at Drksharama in East Godavari District.
Kaleswaram in Karimnagar District, and Srisailam in Kurnool. The mention of
‘Trilingam by Ptolemy, the Greek geographer who lived about 130 A. D. lends
respectable antiquity to the word Trilinga. But ingenious as the conception of
Trilinga was, the truth seems to lie elsewhere. There was actually a tribe
called ‘Talaing’ inhabiting the Telugu coast. It is their name that survives in
the word Telunga or Telugu. This Talaing tribe sent forth its colonists to
Arakan in Burma. The Andhras came south and mixed with the Talaing tribe to
make the modern Andhra-Telugu people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
evidence of a fusion of races is seen even in the Telugu language. Originally
belonging to the Dravidian family of languages Telugu has heavily borrowed from
Sanskrit and Prakrit for its word material, to such an extent that the older
grammarians considered it to be an off-shoot of Sanskrit. Modern philology has
corrected this mistaken notion. Why the Telugu language leans on Sanskrit and
Prakrit so much, whereas Tamil and to some extent Kannada have retained their
original Dravidian nature, is easily explained. The dominant force in the
Telugu country was that of the Andhras who naturally spoke Prakrit. Prakrit was
the official language, the language of inscriptions and literature under the
Satavahanas, the Ikshvakus, the early Pallavas , and Salankayanas. The
Vishnukundins patronised Sanskrit. It was not till the Eastern Chalukyas came
on the horizon that Telugu was admitted as the language of inscriptions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
admiration that Andhras felt towards Aryan culture expressed itself in their
literature also. Late among the Dravidian languages to develop a literature of
its own, Telugu occupied itself for nearly four centuries to bring out the best
works of Sanskrit into itself. This was not due to lack of the original
creative faculty on the part of great poets like Nannaya, Tikkaha and Potana.
It was due to their sincere veneration for Aryan culture that these
master-minds contented themselves with free translation of the Mahabharata and
Bhagavata. It was a great service to the unity of Indian culture that the
Telugu poets </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rendered. Our Saiva poets on the other hand
developed a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>independent literature. From the Vijayanagara
period onwards Telugu marked out a new line of progress according to its
genius. Our great Prabandhas and the philosophico-tlidactic poetry like that of
Vemana are a pride for any literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
composite nature of Andhra culture is further seen in our religion and our
customs and manners. Side by side with Vedic Dharma which struck deep roots in
Andhra, the Dravidian concepts of religion like worship of Lord Siva and his
Consort, the worship of serpents and trees flourished. The Brahmin and some of
the higher castes leaned towards Vedic Dharma. The bulk of the people,
including the women of higher castes, were followers of the religion of the
soil. The same synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian is effected in our customs. For
instance in marriage, the Brahmins and higher castes adopt the Vedic ritual and
mantras. The generality of people follow Desi customs, but even the Brahmins
follow the custom of marrying the daughter of one’s mother’s brother. This is
called ‘Menarikamu’ and is the most popular and cherished matrimonial
relationship. This custom is as old as the Eastern Chalukya Kings. A slight
variation of this, known as ‘counter-menarikam’ viz., marrying the daughter of
the sister of the father, is also prevalent. This second form of marriage was
practised even in the days of the Ikshvaku line of Kings who ruled in the 3rd
Century A.D. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have seen the indebtedness of Andhra to Aryan culture. Let us put ourselves the
question, had it anything to give in return? The answer is: “Yes. Andhra gave
to Indian culture as much as it received.” To begin with, in the field of Government
and political organization, the Andhras count among the prominent
empire-builders in India. Lust for conquest and dominion was not their motive.
When Dharma was in danger they rose in defence of it, kept Adharma at bay, gave
peace and security to the people and incidentally showed their genius for
organization. The first essay in empire-building by the Andhras was in the
times of the glorious Satavahanas, who ruled the major part of Southern India
and part of Northern India also for nearly four centuries. Upon the fall of the
imperial Mauryas, India was thrown into confusion by the invading hordes of
Salva, Yavana and Pahlava. Buddhism threatened the existence of Vedic Dharma.
At such a critical juncture the Satavanan Andhras stood like a rock of safety
for the people, checked the depredations of foreign invaders at least into the
South, taught Vedic and Buddhistic religions to flourish like sisters by their
spirit of tolerance. The Andhras have a genius for tolerance and
reconciliation. That, I claim humbly, is the hall-mark of Andhra culture. From
the Satavahanas down to the Sultans of Golkonda, whom we rightly claim as
Andhra rulers in spite of their difference in religion, tolerance was the
guiding principle of our ruling dynasties. How the arts of peace flourished
under the Satavahanas, the pages of history will bear testimony. As to the
might of the Andhras, Megasthenes says in his ‘Indika’: “Next come the Andhras,
a still more powerful race, which possesses numerous villages, and thirty towns,
defended by walls and towers, and which supplies its King with an army of 1,
00,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, and 1,000 elephants.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
another great task of empire-building was undertaken by the Andhras during the
Vijayanagara period. I pass over the Kakatiyas and the Reddi Kings who were
bastions of Dharma, due to considerations of space. Every student of history
knows the challenge offered by the Muslim conquerors to Hindu religion. The
Vijayanagara empire was the answer to this challenge. The Andhras took up the
gauntlet. Wisely, they joined hands with the people of Karnataka, and together
these people defended Vedic Dharma for three centuries. The material and moral
prosperity of the country under the Vijayanagara empire can be studied in books
of history. Suffice it to say that the Andhras can unite among themselves and
organize other peoples for great tasks. That the Mahrattas under Sivaji drew
inspiration from Vijayanagara is common knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Turning
to the contribution of the Andhras in the field of religion, Andhra has offered
Acharya Nagarjuna to Buddhism, and Kumarila Bhatta and Vallabhacharya to Vedic
and Bhakti religions. At a time when narrow dogmatism ate into the vitals of
Buddhism, Acharya Nagarjuna, the great Andhra philosopher, founded the Mahayana
Buddhism, renovated that religion and gave it along lease of life in India. But
for Nagarjuna, the Martin Luther of India and his reform movement, Buddhism
would have disappeared from Indian soil in the early centuries of the,
Christian Era. This great man lived at Nagarjunakonda in Guntur District in the
last days of the Satavahanas. He was not only a great philosopher but also a
great chemist and a profound humanitarian. It is said of him that he got the
rules of health and maxims of medicine inscribed on public pillars so that
people might read them and be rid of disease. What Asoka did for the minds of
men, Acharya Nagarjuna attempted to do for their physical bodies. In the field
of Indian philosophy, Nagarjuna is a name to conjure with. He laid the
foundations of the Bhakti cult. The great Sankaracharya, the founder of Advaita
philosophy, learned his Mayavada from the Sunyavada of Acharya Nagarjuna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
contribution of the Andhras to all-India literature is equally impressive.
Foremost to deserve mention is the GadhaSaptasati Kavya. This is a great
Prakrit collection of verses, aone at the instance of the Satavahana monarch
Hala. It conditions poems of exquisite beauty replete with love, humour and
pathos. Several of the poets whose writings were collected in Gadha-Saptasati
must have been Andhras. Andhra life is well pictured in these verses. Another
great Prakrit work the ‘Brihat-katha’ was the store-house of story literature;
This was written </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by Gunadhya and received the patronage of a

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The contribution of the Andhras to Sanskrit
literature is too well-known. Among the great writers on Dharma Sastra,
Apastamba is pre-eminent. He was an Andhra sage. He was not only a law-giver.
In his Silpa Sutras, Apastamba laid the foundations for Indian geometry. Some
claim the great Sanskrit dramatist Bhavabhuti to be an Andhra. Dignagacharya,
the great Buddhist philosopher, dialectician and dramatist flourished in
Andhra. The Andhras specialised in commentary writing. Mallinatha is
universally acclaimed as the best commentator on Kalidasa. Our Reddi Kings
Kataya Vema, Kumaragiri, Pedakomati Vema and the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Velama King
Singa Bhupala were all authoritative Sanskrit writers. Vidyanatha and
Panditaraya Jagannatha were conspicuous writers on Sanskrit poetics. The latter
was patronised by Emperor Shah Jehan and Dara Shuko.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the field of Art, wherein the aesthetic soul of a nation is enshrined, the
Andhras have left a great legacy. Architecture was their pre-occupation where
solid rock was available. Where stone was not within easy reach, they used
brickwork. During the Satavahana period Buddhism was the motive that inspired
Telugu architects. Kings and rich magnates vied with each other in excavating
caves out of solid rock, beautifying them as the genius of man could desire,
and presenting them to Buddhist monks. The cave dwellings and chaityas of Karla
and Kanheri are sights for angels. The Sanchi stupa in Central India, and the great
Amaravati stupa near Guntur are a few of the monuments which immortalise the
skill of the Andhra architects. The stupa at Bhattiprolu is a colossal brick
structure. Nagarjunakonda in the Krishna Valley contains innumerable gems of
architecture. In later days the Kakatiyas of Warangal were great builders in
stone. The Swayambhu temple in Warangal fort, the thousand pillared temple at
Hanamkonda and the exquisite temple of Ramappa at Palampet, where the science
of dance was engraved on leaves of stone, are a few of their monumental
structures. The ruins of Hampi constitute an elegy in stone for their love of
art. In the fine art of painting. Andhra work is memorable. The earliest cave
paintings at Ajanta are the handiwork of Andhra painters. The paintings at
Macherla in Palnad, and at Lepakshi in Anantapur District are a few remnants of
this art. Our country painting is still kept alive by the makers of Kondapalli
dolls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the divine arts of dance and music the Andhra gave proof of great originality.
The dance system in Andhra is based on the ‘Abhinaya Darpana’ of Nandikeswara.
This rare work, on dance is available in the Telugu country only. During the
Kakatiya period, Jayapa Senani composed a great manual on the art of dance
known as ‘Nrittaratnavali’. Jayapa was the brother-in-law of Emperor Ganapati
Deva and the commander of his elephant forces. As previously mentioned, the
Ramappa temple at palampet is an illustration in stone of the theory of Jayapa.
This art is kept alive to this day in a flickering condition by the dance
masters of Kuchipudi, a village in the Krishna District. The ancestors of
Kuchipudi masters took this art into Southern India and popularised it there.
They are great exponents of Bharata Natya in its classical purity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the field of music the Andhra contribution to Indian culture is distinctive.
The Telugu language is pre-eminently suited for music. Even foreigners were
impressed with the melodious nature of Telugu and aptly described it as ‘the
Italian of the East’. Wielding such a pliable instrument of the vocal art, the
Andhras easily became supreme in the musical field south of the Vindhyas,
though of late they seem to have yielded the palm to Tamil musicians. The
system of music known as Karnataka Sangita was first evolved in Andhra and
perfected there. It took a definite shape during the Vijayanagara epoch. Aliya
Ramaraya patronised a great scholar named Ramayamatya who wrote the ‘Swaramela
Kalanidhi’, the first great work on Karnataka music. Raghunatha Nayaka, the
Telugu ruler of Tanjore, was himself a great musician. Under his patronage a
scholar named Venkatatamakhi wrote a great work on music ‘Chaturdandi
Prakashika’. Of the great masters of the art we should first mention
Annamacharya, a Vaishnava devotee who lived at Tirupathi. He composed many
‘sankirtanas’ on Lord Venkateswara of Tirupathi. These were inscribed on plates
of copper. The next great master was Kshetrayya. ‘Gopala-Padamulu’, are divine
cups of melody and sweet thoughts. Last but not least in importance was the
great Bhakta, Thyagaraja Swami. His impassioned and unpremeditated outpourings
of the heart in music are a matter of common knowledge. There is no profound
master of music in southern India who does not sing the Kritis of Thyagaraja,
Another great name in the music world is the Saint Narayana Thirtha whose
Tarangas composed in Sanskrit contest the palm with the songs of Jayadeva. He
hails from Andhra. The modern period has produced excellent masters of music
like Tumarada Sangameswara Sastri, the Vainika, and the great violinists Dwaram
Venkataswamy Naidu and Hari Nagabhushanam, and Adibhatla Narayanadas, the great
Harikatha exponent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

survey will be incomplete without a reference to the spread of Andhra culture
abroad. Possessing a long sea-board, the Andhras had a natural advantage to
take to the bosom of the ocean; and this they did eagerly from the
pre-Christian era. The people had the spirit of adventure in them. There were
forests near the coast which supplied excellent wood for making ships big </span><span

coast. During the Satavahana period </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there was brisk
maritime activity on the Andhra coast. Ships laden with goods sailed to Rome in
the distant West and to China in the East. The coins of Yajna Sri Satakarni
display the figure of a ship, indicating ocean voyages. When the Ikshvaku Kings
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ruled,
Andhra Buddhists set out for distant lands carrying the divine message. During
the Salankayana period Buddhism spread </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to the countries of
the East and the islands of the Pacific. With the revival of Hinduism in the
Chalukyan age, Andhra missionaries and colonists spread the message of the
Trinity in the eastern islands. Andhra culture sailed along with Andhra
religion and commerce. Place-names like Trilinga, Amaravati, Kakulam, Simhapura
and many others occurring in countries like Burma, Siam, Indo-China, Malaya and
the islands of Java, Sumatra and Borneo reveal the establishment of Andhra
culture in these regions. The use of the Salivahana era, which is peculiar to
Andhra and Karnataka, in the inscriptions of Java is another conclusive
evidence of the spread of Andhra culture. Andhra art and sculpture, influenced
the art of Java intimately. The great stupa at Borobudur was modelled on the
art of the Sangharama at Amaravati. To conclude, in the words of Dr.
Subrahmaniam, “the colonial expansion of Andhra civilised savage tribes in
greater India, gave them a new religion, art and literature, and created a zest
in them for a higher life”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

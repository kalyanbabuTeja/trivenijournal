<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
situation today in Indonesia is typical of the conditions which are developing
in very many countries of Asia and Africa which were till recently under
colonial rule and which have newly won freedom. They have claims to territories
which are still </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>under the rule of foreigners in some cases or
under the rule of indigenous peoples in other cases whose title they dispute.
The </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>acquisition of these territories has become a cardinal aim
of their foreign policies and many of their activities are directed to the
realisation of this aim even though they have serious domestic problems to
face. This is considered by the parties in power as highly useful in diverting
the attention of the people away from the domestic issues which they are unable
to solve. Despots and dictators have been found in history as following a
policy like this and it has had rightly or wrongly a large amount of influence
on the policies of the new States in Asia and Africa. Another aspect of the
conditions in these States is the difficulty created by nationalism not having
taken a sufficiently deep root. In many of them regionalism of a disruptive
character exercises a powerful sway. The artificial political unity which the
foreign rulers created seems to be losing much of its strength. There is a sort
of struggle between unitarism and federalism, between centralisation and
provincial autonomy. To add to this there is a conflict between rival political
ideologies especially between democracy resting on the maxim that individual
human personality has an intrinsic value of its own deserving respect and
recognition at all times and under all conditions and totalitarianism of one
kind or other claiming all power to the State. It so happens that in most of
these countries forms of democracy have been adopted but conditions do not
exist for their proper and effective functioning. The masses of people on whom
electoral rights have been conferred have no experience of democracy on a nation-wide
scale. Caste, communal and tribal differences are very strong among them. They
do not appreciate the value of freedom of speech or of other freedoms
associated with democracy. They are more anxious to have their standards of
living raised whatever be the political agency that does it. Communism makes a
powerful appeal to them. This conflict between rival ideologies has become a
disturbing factor in many of these countries. And the existence of numerous
political parties and splinter groups places serious obstacles in the way of
the parliamentary form of government working satisfactorily. Above all there is
the economic backward</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ness of these countries. There is
appalling poverty, accompanied by a rapid increase in population. People are
anxious to have a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>comfortable life and governments have to satisfy
them even though they are much handicapped by the scarcity of capital and of
technical knowledge and skill so necessary for any kind of economic progress in
modern times. It is the multiplicity of problems like these that governments in
the countries of Asia and Africa which have newly won their freedom are called
on to face and the difficulties created by them are very well-illustrated by
what has happened recently in Indonesia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indonesia
is one of the biggest of Asian States. It has a population of ninety millions.
It is made up of nearly three thousand islands–Java, Sumatra, Borneo and
Celebes being the largest among them–with rich natural resources like oil,
rubber, etc. It was freed from Dutch rule in 1949 but West Irian which is in
New Guinea and to which it has laid claim still continues to be under Dutch
rule. It was agreed in 1949 that this question of West Irian should be settled
through negotiation between the two parties. Negotiations have been going on
all these years but nothing has come out of them. The Indonesian Government
made an appeal to the United Nations General Assembly at its last session to
settle the matter but it also proved fruitless. The people of
Indonesia–especially the Leftists among them–grew rather impatient and resorted
to economic sanctions against the Dutch for getting the issue settled. The
Dutch own a large number of economic concerns in Indonesia. They have invested
in them five hundred to six hundred crores of rupees. Nearly fifty thousand
Dutch nationals work in them as managers, skilled workers and technical
officers. The Indonesian labourers working in them took forcible control of
many of these concerns. Government was faced with a crisis. It had to yield to
popular clamour. It consequently issued orders nationalizing all these concerns
and calling upon the Dutch workers in them to leave the country (though this
was not strictly enforced). It agreed to pay compensation to the Dutch owners
but stated emphatically that all questions regarding the amount and form of
compensation and the time of its payment would be settled only after a solution
was found for the West Irian problem. The idea was that rather than lose all
their economic concerns the Dutch would agree to give up their control over
West Irian.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far the Dutch have not cared to enter into any negotiations. A sort of
stalemate has come into existence. The problem of West Irian is as far from
solution as it has been all along. The internal situation in Indonesia has
however become considerably deteriorated. Communications between island and
island which were formerly carried on in Dutch ships have practically come to
an end. Revolts have broken out in some of them including Sumatra and Celebes.
Rebel governments have been set up in them. The complaint against
centralisation of all authority in Java has become louder The situation has
become more complicated owing to the rift between the Islamic parties of the
Right which are strong in the islands outside Java and the Communist and other
leftist parties which are strong in Java itself. There is scarcity of food
everywhere and famine conditions are prevailing. There are leaders like Dr.
Hatta who feel that the action taken against the Dutch by the government of the
day was rather hasty. Government’s difficulties have been increased as a result
of the lack of complete co-operation between the military and civilian
authorities. It is a peculiarity of Indonesia that adequate recognition is not
given to the wholesome and healthy principle of the subordination of the Army
to the civilian government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
government has to suppress revolts in the outlying islands. Arms and other
military equipment are needed for this purpose. How to get it has become a
serious problem. As there was no prospect of getting it from the United States
and the countries of the Western bloc negotiations are being carried on with
the countries of the Soviet bloc for getting it. And there is every prospect of
these negotiations succeeding. It is the fear of the Americans that arms
shipped into Java would fall into the hands of Communists and would be
ultimately utilised to establish a Communist regime in the country. It will not
be surprising if the deal between Indonesia and the Soviet bloc countries results
in Indonesia becoming Communist even though it may be after passing through a
phase of civil War. Regional forces are strong at present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are some who think that the arms received from outside would be used by the
Indonesian Government to wrest West Irian by force from the Dutch. But this is
not likely to be the case. It would mean a war between the Netherlands and
Indonesia, a war perhaps in which some of the allies of Netherlands may be
tempted to take part. At a time when world opinion is becoming more and more
unfavourable to war as an instrument </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for settling
international disputes it will be folly for Indonesia to resort to it for
getting possession of an outlying territory like West Irian with its sparse
population.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
many questions have been raised regarding the justice and expediency of the
Indonesian action against Dutch concerns. Like many undeveloped countries
Indonesia is in need of foreign capital for developing her resources. Even
Soviet Russia which is now prepared to extend economic aid to such countries
does it only on condition that interest is paid on loans taken and the
principal returned in due course. Will not a policy of nationalisation of
foreign concerns executed unilaterally become a serious obstacle in the way of
getting adequate aid in future from abroad? There is the other question, viz.,
whether the enforcement of the claim to West Irian is much more urgent than the
solution of so many of the domestic problems with which the country is faced.
Even China has tolerated the continued possession of Hong Kong by the British.
India has resolved on not using force to get Goa even though it rightly belongs
to her. What happened in Indonesia makes it difficult for that country to
adhere to the policy of non-alignment by which she stood all </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>these
years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the post-war period international affairs have been affected by two great
forces, one being the awakening of the peoples of Asia and Africa and the other
the bitter rivalry between the East as represented by Soviet Russia and the
West as represented by the United States and her allies in. Europe. Almost very
issue in every part of the world has been influenced by this rivalry. To
prevent the expansion of Soviet power and influence and of her Communist
philosophy and practices has been the one dominating characteristic of the
United States foreign policy and to prevent the expansion of the power and
influence of the United States and of her philosophy of private enterprise and
individual freedom has similarly been the one primary objective of Soviet
foreign policy. And the whole world has become the victim of this rivalry. It
has been caught up in its grip and whether anything can be done to lessen the
growing intensity of this rivalry and to put an end to the dangerous forms which
it is assuming has become the one grave problem with which the whole of
humanity is faced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>War
has all along been recognised as an instrument for satisfying political
ambitions. All historical empires whether in the East or the West, whether in
olden or in recent times have been the result of war or of the threat to use
it. It is no wonder </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>therefore that Stalin the dictator of
Soviet Russia was like Napoleon and several other power-lovers of the past
decided on using force for establishing his control over the whole of Europe
and over the rest of the world. The Communist way of life was the only right
way of life from his point of view and like all believers in Communist creed he
felt that there was nothing wrong or immoral in using force for spreading the
only right way of life over the whole world. It was this fear of Soviet
aggrandizement and of the spread of Communism that provoked the United States
as the inheritor of a quite different set of spiritual values to strengthen
herself in all sorts of ways so that she may be in a position to defend her way
of life from being destroyed. This strengthening took two forms. One was the
accumulation of weapons of warfare of all types including the nuclear weapons
and the other the entering into military alliances with as many countries as
possible. Thus began the race in armaments between Soviet Russia and the United
States. This also resulted in the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Alliance, the Baghdad Pact, the South-East Asian Treaty Organisation and other
defence pacts of all of which the United States is the strongest and the
leading member.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
point has now been reached in this race for the testing and the accumulation of
nuclear weapons of warfare when any further continuation of it will bring destruction
upon humanity as a whole. There was a time when Americans had more knowledge of
nuclear science than the Russians had, but that time is now over. The Russian
scientists have become their superiors and the sending of the two Sputniks into
outer space is only one piece of evidence of this superiority. The Russians
have also devised an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile with a range of five
thousand miles and they can from any base in their own country bomb any part of
the United States. The prestige of the latter country has come down as a
consequence in recent months and there is feverish activity to catch up Russia
and to become superior to her once again. All this involves further nuclear
tests and it is this that causes concern to the whole of mankind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has now become firmly established that nuclear test explosions poison through
radiation the atmosphere for miles and miles around them and cause deleterious
effects of all sorts. The tests therefore have become a matter in which all
nations in the world have the right and the duty to concern themselves. It in
not a matter in regard to which the Americans, the Russians and the British
alone should have the final say. The tests must be stopped and they must be
stopped without any further delay. The great problem therefore with which the
international world is faced to-day is how to compel those three powers which
are now in a position to carry out nuclear tests to stop them. The Russians
have come forward with a proposal to stop them provided the United States and
Britain also do the same. But these two countries are not prepared to stop the
tests and that for a variety of reasons. It is necessary to know what these
reasons are if we are to arrive at a correct estimate of the international
situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further
nuclear tests are necessary for them in order that they may devise an
Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile of their own and also some weapon of
defence against similar Russian Missile; otherwise their capacity for defence
will be lost. In the second place stopping of tests is of no use if the
manufacture and stockpiling of H-bombs is to go on. What they want is a
cessation of such manufacture and stockpiling. There must be guarantee against
all nuclear warfare. If Russians agree not to manufacture nuclear weapons any
more and if a system of inspection and control is devised to see that both
parties adhere strictly to the terms of agreement–it is only then that they
will stop further nuclear tests. There is also a third step in their argument.
The Russians have considerable superiority in conventional armaments. The
Sino-Soviet bloc has a population of one thousand millions and the military
forces it can raise are enormous. If there is to be some kind of parity between
the two blocs it is necessary that the strength of conventional armies of the
Soviet should be reduced. And all these steps should be taken simultaneously.
There should be no interval in which the Soviet possess a superiority in
nuclear or conventional weapons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is because no agreement could be arrived at in regard to these several issues
that disarmament conferences so far held have been completely a failure. The
Russians have refused to participate in any more of such conferences. What they
want is a discussion of the whole matter in the General Assembly of the United
Nations in which all the eighty-three member States will be present. They have
refused to participate even in the Committee of twenty five, recently set up by
the General Assembly on the ground that the Western bloc has a
disproportionately large representation on it. There is thus a stalemate on the
question of disarmament though every one knows that any further delay in
putting a stop to nuclear tests will bring ruin on mankind. It is not clear
what objection the Russians have to stop all manufacture of nuclear weapons and
agree to an effective system of control and inspection. They know as well as
others that nuclear warfare will be suicidal and there should be no hesitation
on their part to undertake not to resort to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is much more important at the present stage than the reduction in conventional
armaments which they have recently announced. Such reduction has already been
made by the British </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and the Americans. No special credit need
be given to this step as it is the logical outcome of the increasing adoption
of mecha</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>nical means of warfare. It is just like throwing
away labourers from industry, agriculture and other economic concerns when once
machinery is introduced. The numerical strength of armies has ceased to have
the same importance today as it had in the past. Attention should therefore be
concentrated on measures which will lead to the prohibition of nuclear weapons
in warfare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the course of the last two months some proposals have been put forward by Soviet
Russia to ease what she calls world tension though it is primarily a tension
between herself and the United States. One is a “Summit Conference”, a
conference of the Heads of States of some important countries to discuss the
principal outstanding issues on which acute differences have arisen–issues like
the unification of Germany, stabilisation of the situation in the Middle East
and so on. Another is to have a zone in Eastern and Central Europe in which no
nuclear weapons should be stocked–the zone to include Poland, Czechoslovakia
and East and West Germany. A third is a withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the countries of Europe–of Soviet forces from the satellite States and of the
British, American and French forces from Germany. A fourth is a dissolution of
the North Atlantic and the Warsaw Pacts. A fifth is not to have any American
rocket bases in Turkey and other countries in the Middle<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
proposals were made in view of the American proposals at the last meeting of
the North Atlantic Treaty Council to have American rocket bases in the
countries which are members of the <i>NATO. </i>American proposals were
accepted by almost all the members though it would take at least a year before
such bases could be established. There is to-day in America also a certain
section of people who think that such bases are not quite necessary in Western
Europe and that there is no harm in agreeing to the kind of demilitarization of
Central and Eastern Europe proposed by Soviet Russia. Their argument is that
there is no danger of Soviet aggression against the countries of Western Europe
by armed forces. Such a war is sure to create trouble for the Russians in the
satellite States like Poland and Hungary where there is a large amount of
resentment against Soviet domination. The Russians do not want to create such
trouble for themselves. If Soviet Russia wants to extend her power and her
empire it will be in areas outside Europe. They therefore came to the
conclusion that there is not much need for American rocket bases in Western
Europe. It is also a part of their argument that such bases will result in
similar Soviet rocket bases being created in countries like Poland and Hungary
and that this will perpetuate Soviet domination over them. Soviet Russia will
never hand over such bases to Polish, Hungarian or Czech armies for fear that
they might use them against herself. They will all be in possession of Soviet
armies and this would mean the continued enslavement of Central and Eastern
Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then about Communism being established in these countries through the process
of infiltration and through resort to violence by Communist parties? The view
is now held that it is best to leave the matter to the concerned governments.

ordinary security forces will serve the purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is because some Americans and many people in England, France and other
countries of Western Europe hold views like these that the atmosphere has
become favourable for the holding of “Summit talks.” A debate is going on as to
whether it should be preceded by a conference of foreign ministers to settle
the agenda for the “Summit talks”. But some compromise is sure to be arrived at
on these preliminary issues and ere long there will be a conference of Heads of
States to discuss the more important crucial issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is also becoming increasingly clear that Soviet Russia is now turning its
attention more and more to the uncommitted countries of Asia and Africa and
that she is hopeful of spreading Communism through the grant of economic aid to
them than by recourse to arms directly. If arms are to be used they should be
used by the pro-communist regimes that may be established in them. This is the
reason why Soviet Russia has been extending economic aid to very many of these
countries in recent months. This is a new feature in the international
situation which is bound to have serious effects in the years to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

become dependent solely on Soviet Russia or the West for the capital and the
technical equipment they need for raising the living standards of their
peoples. It is difficult to prophesy what the ultimate outcome of this
competition will be. It will be a competition not merely in matters economic
but also in matters cultural and spiritual. Unless responsible leaders deeply
attached to national tradition and culture come to power in these countries

people may lose their soul. It is because of this that the rivalry between

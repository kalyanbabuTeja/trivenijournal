style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Richard <span class=SpellE>Millhaus</span> Nixon won the American Presidency.
Mr. Hubert Humphrey, the outgoing Vice-President, lost the race rather
narrowly. The widespread disappointment with the Johnson Administration’s <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> policy
seemed to have given the Republican candidate the edge over Mr. Humphrey.
However, a few observers did predict that Mr. Humphrey’s ‘liberal’ politics and
Mr. Nixon’s reputation for conservatism, especially in the matter of
socio-economic policies within the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, would lead to Mr.
Humphrey’s success. But those predictions were belied. Incidentally, in his
survey for the previous issue of this journal, the present author himself
hinted that Mr. Humphrey would be the winner. The author is now compelled to
chew his hat! The deep dissension in the <span class=GramE>democratic party</span>,
consequent on the estrangement between Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Eugene <span
class=SpellE>Macarthy</span>, the rivals for the democratic nomination, partly
account for Mr. Humphrey’s failure. Mr. Nixon succeeded in projecting the image
of a self-confident, mature and knowledgeable leader, and <span class=GramE>his</span>
committal to a policy of a negotiated settlement in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region>
as also his approval of the need to continue the ‘detente’ with <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>, made up for his
reputation for conservatism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
it is still an open question as to what extent Mr. Nixon will change the
present trends in American foreign policy and through it the world scene
itself. Before a brief analysis of the future shape of things under Nixon could
be made, one observation may be <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span>. Thanks to
the balance of power in nuclear arms, no policy-maker, either in <st1:State
w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> or in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>,
however conser­vative or revolutionary he may be, can seriously think of a
deliberate departure from maintaining the tempo of the existing thaw in the
cold war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
his campaign and even before, Mr. <span class=GramE>Nixon,</span> expressed his
opinion that the cultivation of cordial relations with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>should
go on. It should be remembered that even before the announcement of his
candidature for the <span class=GramE>Presidency,</span> he undertook a private
visit to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
and had talks with some of the Soviet leaders. He seemed to share the
conviction of other Western and non-aligned statesmen that the Russian
protestations for peace are sincere and that the West could trust them. The
reaction of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
to Mr. Nixon also underwent a marked change. Though the Russian press did
occasionally refer to his past record of crusading anti-communism, on the
whole, no vituperative hostility was evidence this time. Time was when the
Russian press used such epithets like ‘Tricky Dick’ to <span class=SpellE>characterise</span>
Mr. Nixon. Such references have been conspicuous by their absence during the
recent elections. Even after the elections, no adverse reference after Mr.
Nixon’s victory as <span class=SpellE>enmical</span> to Soviet-American
relations appeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
best indication of Mr. Nixon’s desire to keep up the dialogue with <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> is to be found in the speech he made at <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Miami</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Florida</st1:State></st1:place>,
while accepting the Republican nomination. He stated, “And now to the leaders
of the Communist world we say, after an era of confrontation, the time has come
for an era of negotiations.” If this be regarded as the cardinal principle of
his foreign policy, then one can predict that the ‘<span class=SpellE>detenate</span>’
will continue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
Mr. Nixon’s statements on armaments do reflect a posture less sympathetic to
disarmament, which is but an aspect of the ‘détente’. During the election
campaign, he firmly advocated a policy of strengthening further the military
potential of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> as a
pre-requisite for meaningful negotiations with the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place>. Thus, apparently, he is harping on the idea of ‘negotiating
from strength.’ In fact, in his acceptance speech at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Miami</st1:place></st1:City>, Mr. Nixon qualified the eloquent statement
quoted <span class=GramE>above,</span> and said “where the world super-powers
are concerned there is no acceptable alternative to peaceful negotiation.
Because this will be a period of negotiations <i>we shall restore the strength
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
so that we shall negotiate from strength and never from weakness.” </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A revival of the slogan of ‘negotiating from
strength’ implies a reversion to cold war semantics, and what is <span
class=GramE>worse,</span> it puts a premium on re-armament, with all its
implications for the future of the ‘detente.’ In the immediate future this
would mean a set-back to the proposed negotiations between <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
on the limitation of offensive and defensive missiles. However, it is a matter
for gratification that the new President is very anxious that the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty should be ratified by the Congress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will be interesting to observe what attitudes Mr. Nixon will take towards <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. Will he negotiate with Communist China without
any pre-conditions? If the contemplated shift “from the era of confrontation to
the era of negotiations” is to be taken seriously, the President should think
in terms of starting a dialogue with <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>.
If he resorts to this policy, he, a Republican, will have accomplished what
even the Democrats did not do. But it is really doubtful whether the
President-elect will be prepared to talk with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> with a view to come to terms.
Firstly, can Mr. Nixon now decide to drop <span class=SpellE>Chiangkai</span> <span
class=SpellE>Shek</span>? Secondly, even if the Chinese are prepared to leave <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Formosa</st1:country-region> alone, any meaningful solution to the
present impasse between <st1:State w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> and <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> would necessitate an act of trust, involving at
least a partial withdrawal of the American protective forces from the eastern
areas. Would such an act of faith be forthcoming from Mr. Nixon? After all, there
is a difference in the way Mr. Nixon looks at Russian Communism and Chinese
Communism. In the case of the former, while he may harp upon negotiating from
strength, he may nevertheless be prepared to compromise on the aspect of
strength, if it becomes so necessary for progress in the area of negotiations.
Would such compromise be possible in dealing with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>? Further, the whole <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> policy in Asia is built upon the
assumption of a semi-permanent hostility of Peking towards the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region> as also of the <span class=SpellE>former’s</span>
expansionist designs over <st1:place w:st="on">South-east Asia</st1:place>. And
on this foundation are built a host of military alliances. Can the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
now repudiate these? <span class=GramE>for</span> there cannot be any useful
purpose served in negotiating with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, unless these avowedly
anti-Communist alliances are withdrawn. These considerations alone make it
improbable that Mr. Nixon would resort to any positive steps in negotiations
with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
And then there is his own psychological conditioning, which makes him view
communism, especially the Chinese variety, as inherently expansionist and
aggressive. To spotlight this aspect of the matter, it is very important to
refer to his recent article on, ‘Asia after <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>’ published in the quarterly
<i>Foreign Affairs </i>(October, 1968). He does not believe that the schism in
communism has blunted its votaries urge for old-style international communism.
Such a view, to him, “Ignores, however, the fact that with the <span
class=SpellE>decentralisalion</span> of communist control has <span
class=GramE>come</span> an <i>appropriately tailored </i>shift in communist
tactics. National communism poses a different kind of threat than did the
old-style international communism, <i>but by being subtler </i>it is <i>some
ways more dangerous.” </i>Again, on the nature of regional co-operation in
Asia, Mr. Nixon <span class=SpellE>emphasises</span> that efforts in that
direction should have in view the Chinese threat and, what is most revealing,
that such co-operation could not merely be confined to cultural and economic
spheres but should envisage a military arrangement to contain China.
Recommending the model of the American sponsored Asian and Pacific Council in
this regard, he says, ‘Despite <span class=SpellE>ASPAC’s</span> present
cultural and economic orientation, however, the solidifying awareness of
China’s threat should make it possible to develop into an alliance actively dedicated
to concerting whatever efforts necessary to maintain the security of the
region. I do not mean to <span class=SpellE>minimise</span> the difficulties of
winning acceptance of such a concept. In Japan, public opinion, still lags
behind official awareness of military needs. The avowedly neutralist nations
under China’s cloud would be reluctant, at present, to join any such grouping.
But looking further down we can project either an erosion of their neutralism
or the formation of their own loose associations, which might be tied into a
militarily oriented ASPAC on an interlocking and co-operative basis. “Mr.
Nixon’s convictions about an old-style western military solution to the threat
of China cannot find a more eloquent expression. Therefore one cannot expect
any major break-through in Sino-American relations in the <span class=SpellE>forseeable</span>
future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the issue of Vietnam, there is again an ambivalence in the Nixon policy. He is
fully committed to the peace-talks in Paris and indeed sounded impatient that
the Johnson Administration did not do enough in this regard. Yet on present
indications, it seems, he is going to be tough with the Communists at the
negotiating table. He mentioned that there can be no compromise on the issue of
American interest in South-east Asia, and, if this were to mean that he is
going to be <span class=SpellE>unaccommodative</span> to the demands of the
National Liberation Front, the Paris Talks will to that extent become less
fruitful. The point is that, given the present irreconcilable positions taken
by the government of South Vietnam on the one hand and the N. L. F. and North
Vietnam on the other. Any Indiscriminate American support to the South
Vietnamese Government may stall the negotiations. Further, there is the
likelihood that the United States would interpret such failures in the talks as
indicative of communist attempts to use the talks as a cover for their military
operations in South Vietnam. This<i>, </i>in its turn, might result in a
reversion to a policy of military solution. The appointment, by Mr. Nixon, of
Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge, as the Chief American Delegate to the Paris Talks is
indicative of the President’s thinking in the matter. Mr. Lodge had been
Ambassador to South Vietnam for two crucial terms and had been closely
identified with the present regime, and especially so with Vice-Marshal <span
class=SpellE>Cao</span> <span class=SpellE>Ky</span>, the Vice-President of
South Vietnam, and the leaders of its delegation to the Paris Talks. So close
are the relations between Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ky</span> and Mr. Lodge that
the former is described as the adopted son of Mr. Lodge. And the world knows
that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ky</span><i> </i>is implacably opposed to
concessions to the N. L. F. The nomination of Mr. Lodge suggests that the new
American President may choose to be tough with the Communists. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is also important to note that Mr. Nixon appointed Dr. Henry Kissinger as his
resource-man on foreign policy. Dr. Kissinger <span class=SpellE>favours</span>
a policy of bilateral talks between Washington and Hanoi with a view to impress
upon Saigon the need to be less intransigent with the N. L. F. and Hanoi. In an
article prepared before he was designated as Special Assistant for National
Security Affairs, and published in the January 1969 issue of <i>Foreign
Affairs, </i>Professor Kissinger advocated two-track negotiations, one between
Washington and Hanoi, and the other between the United States and North
Vietnam, and, by implication, recommends that the United States insist on
Saigon scrupulously observing American commitments to Hanoi. The
Kissinger-plan, thus, is against the United States giving all out support to
the South Vietnamese at the Paris Talks. Viewed in this perspective, the
appointment of Henry Cabot Lodge as the Principal American Negotiator in Paris
implies that the trend of Mr. Nixon’s thinking is at variance with the policy
behind Dr<i>. </i><span class=SpellE>Kissinger’s</span> recommendations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Certainly, there will not be a total withdrawal of American forces from the
region. No American President, much less a Republican, would pack-up and leave
the area in the context of the Chinese threat and especially so in the face of
American commitments to South Korea, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. Mr.
Nixon’s views on the reality of the Chinese threat and his continuing belief in
erecting military <span class=SpellE>defences</span> against the threat, only
confirm that an American withdrawal from Vietnam would not mean an American
withdrawal from South-east Asia. Probably, they will cut their commitments in
ground forces and may seek more of off-shore presence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
regards American policy towards India, there is not likely to be any change.
Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party in general are opposed to any excessive
commitments in the nature of foreign aid. For that matter, even the Johnson
Administration, during the last year of its tenure, has cut its foreign aid
programme very drastically. It is also significant that, while Mr. Nixon
pledged to continue economic aid, he insisted that the terms of foreign aid
must be tied to the aims of American Foreign Policy. This language is
reminiscent partly of the Dulles days. Though, to be honest, no government can
ever divorce its investment in aid from considerations of its policy goals,
there is also a marginal area within which aid can be detached from strings. In
insisting explicitly on a linkage between aid and foreign policy, Mr. Nixon has
been more than candid. One suspects that this norm might as well prove to be
the thin end of the wedge in leading to an artless pursuit of a policy of aid
with strings. There is also another aspect of the matter. Mr. Nixon is
committed to a conservative position on economic policy and it is not unlikely
that he might insist that aid-giving countries should have a say in the matter
of spending the aid. There have been instances before of American-aid missions
advising the recipients on the property of their plan priorities and of their
methods of organisation. The Republican Administration will in all probability
be more blunt in telling what types of economic projects they will render help
for. On this score the prospect of misunderstandings between the U. S. and some
of the developing countries cannot be ruled out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
area in which Mr. Nixon may bring about a welcome change is West Asia. In
contrast to the record of the Johnson Administration, which gave the impression
of being partial to Israel, Mr. Nixon remained relatively uncommitted over the
recent Arab-Israeli conflict. This affords him a better opportunity to press a
solution on the parties concerned. Though he was one with the Johnson
Administration on the question of American arms supply to Israel and approved
the supply of <span class=SpellE>Fanthom</span> F-4 jets, as a counter to
Russian arms build-up in the Arab countries, he has come but firmly against the
Israeli claims to the territories it occupied after the June 1967 War. This
stand alone should now make the Arabs distrust the U. S. less and respond
positively to American persuasions for a settlement with Israel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:.5in'>Immediately after the
election, the new president <span class=SpellE>despatched</span> Mr. Scranton,
the former Governor of Pennsylvania, as his personal envoy, on a fact-finding
mission to West Asia. Mr. Scranton had, extensive talks with Arab and Israeli
leaders and reports indicate that the Arabs evinced great interest in these
exchanges. The Russians also are engaged in a sincere effort at suggesting a
solution. There are indications that for quite some time Moscow has been
telling the Arabs to reconcile with the existence of Israel. The Russian
Foreign Minister, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span>, visited West Asia, and
what came to be called the Russian proposals for the West Asian settlement are
to be announced. Another hopeful development has also come about. Moscow has
been appealing to the Americans to use their influence on Israel. Thus, Mr.
Nixon’s attempts at trying to understand the Arab stand and Moscow’s anxiety
for an early settlement together highlight a convergence of attitudes on the
part of these crucial powers. In this, credit should go to the new President
for having initiated negotiations with the Arabs in a manner which convinced
them that the U. S. is not blind to their feelings and aspirations. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:.5in'>The foregoing analysis may
give rise to the doubt about Mr. Nixon’s willingness to effect important
changes in America’s deal­ings with the communist powers or with the
under-developed areas. However, one important factor must be remembered. Mr.
Nixon has shown tremendous capacity to grow as a statesman. No American
President has come to the White House with so extensive a know­ledge of the
outside world, its leaders, peoples, and problems. What is more, most of this
he acquired during the last few years. Perhaps no politician in recent times
could manage to live down a reputation for crude anti-communism and jingoistic
national <span class=SpellE>self­righteousness</span> as he did. On some
matters, he has shown an ability to alter his perspectives and it should
surprise no one if the pragmatist in him were to achieve the target of bringing
down the tensions in the world.</p>

few weeks after the President celebrated the tenth anniversary of his coming
into power (October 16, 1958), unprecedented opposition developed against the
regime. The last few months witnessed mounting tensions and an almost permanent
state of emergency prevailed in the country. The most surprising development is
the unexpected rise of opposition movements in the Western region, where the

all started with student agitations protesting against ban on students unions,
which the Government imposed since long. It is, however, clear that the roots
of discontent go deeper. The formation by Mr. Z. A. <span class=SpellE>Bhutto</span>
of the Pakistan Peoples Party, with its policy of <span class=SpellE>populistic</span>
socialism <span class=SpellE>signalled</span> the emergence of a <span
class=SpellE>centre</span> around which popular discontent found a rallying
point. The National <span class=SpellE>Awami</span> Party, under Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Wali</span> Khan (son of Khan Abdul <span class=SpellE>Gaffar</span>
Khan), has been the other important opposition group in the west. Both these
took up the cause of the students. Soon emerged yet another group, led by Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Narul</span> <span class=SpellE>Amin</span>, the President of the
National Assembly of Pakistan, who formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement and
made common cause with the other parties in challenging the regime. The
students’ demands in the middle of November were answered by repressive
measures by the Government, leading only to the further enflaming of passions
culminating in riots and the unprecedented attempt on the life of President <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span> himself. This, in its turn, led to the arrest of
opposition leaders, including Mr. <span class=SpellE>Bhutto</span> and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Wali</span> Khan. The wave of mass arrests in November resulted
only in the escalation of the disorder and ever since November, Pakistan has
been plunged in civil strife. To this upsurge against the regime came the most
unexpected support from no less a personality than Air Marshal <span

joining of forces by the former Air Chief added greatly to the stature of the
opposition movement by virtue of his reputation, popularity and his freedom
from the taint of political partisanship, and his apparently selfless
motivation in opposing his former master. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Asghar</span>
Khan <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> a studied and unsparing indictment
against the regime. In an interview to the <i>London Times, </i>he described
the whole political structure as ‘stinking,’ and attributed it to corruption in
‘very high quarters.’ Describing the existing electoral system as ‘highly
controlled,’ he prophesied that the coming elections are not likely to be
anywhere near satisfactory. On the issue of foreign policy, however, he held
that the regime has not ‘bungled.’ Asked where he belonged in the political
spectrum, the Air Marshal said: ‘I do not take a position, right, <span
class=SpellE>centre</span> or left.’ The Air Marshal’s entry into the
Opposition has been reinforced by that of Gen. <span class=SpellE>Azzam</span>
Khan. The latter came out against the <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span> regime
even during the last presidential election, and was all set to contest for that
office, when he was persuaded to step aside in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of Miss. <span class=SpellE>Fatima</span> Jinnah. Gen. <span class=SpellE>Azzam</span>
Khan served as Governor of East Pakistan and earned the trust, gratitude and
love of the people–a most surprising </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

His coming into the picture might help the unifi­cation of the Opposition
groups in the East and the West. Thus the anti-<span class=SpellE>Ayub</span>
movement snowballed even in the western region, where hitherto President <span

class=SpellE>emphasise</span> that the attempt on the President’s life in
November, and the manner in which the tempo of the opposition movement is
sustained, indicate that a qualitative change has come over in the nature of
the opposition to the regime. What till then had been a desperate struggle of
relatively weak political groups against an entrenched regime turned into a
formidable challenging force with the entry of the Air Marshal into the fray.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

east, which have been lying dormant. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Mohd</span>. <span

announced his support for the opposition ranks. Much respected and as untainted

Mr. <span class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan himself to the Court for violating a
prohibitory order in Dacca. The wave of protests continued in the western part
throughout December. Demonstrations by lawyers, protests by journalists and
even by Vice-Chancellors of universities, shook the establishment. It is clear
that the agitations can no longer be handled as a simple law and order problem.
Though prohibitory orders, mass arrests, prolonged detention of Opposition

indications that President <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span> Khan will seek

corruption in the administration and its repressive character account only
partly for this unprecedented tide of opposition. But it should be remembered
that these factors have been there for quite sometime. The arrival in the ring
of so many personalities at this particular moment is more accountable to the
coming elections in the country. Under the system of Basic Democracy, elections
to the Basic Democracies (the primary electoral colleges) commence this year
and these primary units elect the members of the National Assembly and the
President. Till now, only Mr. <span class=SpellE>Bhutto</span> and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Murshid</span> seem to be aspiring for the Presidency. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan’s candidature cannot be ruled out. But, so far,
the Opposition parties could not arrive at an acceptable choice. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Bhutto</span>, while being an articulate leader with an unbeatable
record of India-baiting, suffers from the sin of long association with the <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span> regime. Further, his new-found populism only makes him
suspect in the eyes of the moderates. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Murshid</span> has
the advan­tage of being a distinguished judge free from the odium that
naturally accrues to politicians, and his civilian image and the moderation of
his views might make him more acceptable to the different groups in the
Opposition. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan has not offered himself
vet. He is quite new to politics and his army background might be unacceptable
to certain sections which are disillusioned by a decade of army rule. Yet, it
may be that he alone can counter effectively the image of <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span>
Khan. It is probable that if President <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span> were
compelled to go, he might decide to support an army man like Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan and definitely not a demagogue like his former
foreign minister, or an intellectual like Mr. <span class=SpellE>Murshid</span>.
A very influential Pakistani correspondent, Mr. Z. A. <span class=SpellE>Suleri</span>,
writing in <i>The Pakistan Times</i>, a newspaper fully controlled by the <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span> regime, <span class=SpellE>analysed</span> that
establishment in Pakistan not only does not mind the 47-year-old Air Marshal
replacing the Field Marshal, but, perhaps, expect the change-over to take place
sooner than expected, in any case, not later than the next presidential
election, in 1970. Further, if the tide of revolt against the establishment is
seen as <span class=SpellE>unabating</span>, even the <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span>
supporters might plump for Mr. <span class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan, as
capable of upholding the values for which they depended on President <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span>. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan is a
Punjabi (neither Mr. <span class=SpellE>Bhutto</span> nor Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Murshid</span> is), has not frightened the upper crust of the
public with any <span class=SpellE>populistic</span> rhetoric, has approved the
existing foreign policy, and has not offended even the orthodox Muslim sections
of the country. Other leaders, like Mr. <span class=SpellE>Wali</span> Khan and
<span class=SpellE>Maulana</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhashani</span> suffer, because
their popularity is limited to certain regions only. The former has no base of
support in the eastern region and his <span class=SpellE>Pakhtoon</span>
platform, as also his not too rabid anti-Indian stand, qualify his hold even
over the people in the West. <span class=SpellE>Maulana</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bhashani’s</span> sway is confined only to the eastern part and
his zealous propagation of the rights of the Bengali Muslims lost him the image
of a national figure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>It is also difficult to assess the impact of the
recent events on the foreign policy of Pakistan. The point is that the
opposition groups themselves are hopelessly divided on this issue. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Bhutto</span> wants a further shift towards Peking and is
impatient for a military solution to the Kashmir problem. In an important
policy document of his party, he wrote: “Opportunities will arise in the future
as they arose in the past. On three occasions Pakistan came close to finding an
<span class=SpellE>honourable</span> solution. In 1948, we were at the
outskirts of Srinagar; in 1962 during Sino-Indian conflict, there was another
opportunity; in 1965 Pakistan came to the point of liberating the people of
Jammu and Kashmir. No matter how great the obstacles, no matter how great the
efforts, it would return to the brotherhood of Pakistan. This is the article of
faith of the people of Pakistan and the supreme mission of the Party.” Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Murshid</span> has not spelled out his policies, but it is likely
that while he cannot afford to be too moderate in his views on Kashmir, he
would not <span class=SpellE>favour</span> any adventurism in foreign policy.
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Asghar</span> Khan clearly admitted that the basic
tenets of the existing policy are quite valid. Over Kashmir, he <span
class=SpellE>emphasised</span> the point that Pakistan need project a better
face to the world and India, before it can press its case effectively. Thus it
is reasonable to assume that the Air Marshal is not in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of a military confrontation over Kashmir. In contrast to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Bhutto</span>, he is said to <span class=SpellE>favour</span> a
pro-Western orientation. The other groups are also less vocal about a war with
India. </p>

reliance on Peking is lessened, moderation in <span class=SpellE>Pindi’s</span>
adventurism is assured. It is significant that Peking itself seems to be angry
with President <span class=SpellE>Ayub</span>. While it formally congratulated
the President for escaping unhurt in the recent attempt on his life, it was not
prepared to condemn the violence and protests against his regime. There are
also other indications that Peking is hoping that the pro-<span class=SpellE>Bhutto</span>

Pakistani demands for the allocation of more quantities of water stalled the
talks. Later, understanding was reached under which Pakistan agreed to supply
more technical data to study the problem. It will be recalled that, in 1961, it
was decided to conduct talks at technical level between the two countries on the
eastern river waters issue. The very holding of the talks now and the fact that
the current round of talks were allowed to ‘progress’ at all are indicative of
the urge to resolve at least ‘other’ areas of disagreement in a spirit of good <span
class=SpellE>neighbourliness</span>. So also negotiations held recently,
between the governments of West Bengal and East Pakistan on the demarcation of
boundaries did end successfully and one should not miss the cordiality with
which both sides conducted these. Finally, it is most significant that the last
few months passed without even a single border clash between India and
Pakistan. Thus, not only in India, but in Pakistan also the disposition to keep
the peace and make it enduring is present. If in Pakistan, invective against
India is voiced frequently, it should be appreciated that their perspective </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>on
the Kashmir issue differs from that of India. Allowance should be made for
their feeling that the <i>status quo </i>over Kashmir is to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India’s
advantage and that it fans to their lot to demand a solution and thus even
sound bellicose and occasionally appear belligerent. It may be that the
Pakistani demand over Kashmir is untenable, yet should this be attributed
merely to an irreconcilable and permanent hostility towards India? If such an
obsession is really at the root of Pakistani attitudes, then, it is difficult
to explain over other matters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

India’s part, there should be a more forthright appreciation that Pakistan’s
‘intransigence’ over Kashmir fans into a class by itself, and that this does
not necessarily constitute the paradigm case of its stances on other areas of
disagreement. It is in this context further, even over Kashmir, the question
remains, whether India should not take some sort of an initiative. The Rajaji
proposal of last December has behind it this type of feeling. It proposed that
‘Pakistan and India should agree to request America, Britain and Russia to take
charge of Kashmir through an Official Board of Control appointed by the three
powers and administer Kashmir for ten years. At the termination of that period
this Board of Control should arrange to obtain the wishes of the people of
Kashmir In respect of their future and retire in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of the regime so decided.’ The proposal is a ‘mad’ one, as Rajaji himself <span
class=SpellE>characterised</span> it. It envisages the ‘<span class=SpellE>internationalisation</span>’
of the dispute as also the holding of plebiscite, both of which India has
firmly rejected. Assuming that an enduring solution would require the good
offices of a third party, the group of powers suggested by Rajaji is most
unsuited to the occasion. Firstly, even if Russia and America no longer view
for Kashmir as a military base to guard against each other, the probability
that together they might wish to encourage Kashmiri separatism in order to
install a combined base against China cannot altogether be ruled out. The
hostility of Moscow and Peking has reached a pitch to warrant the thought that
the former would welcome a covert American presence near the eastern borders of
China. This would mean that the Kashmir problem would now get embroiled in a
new type of cold war–not the old problem of Anglo-American bases against Russia
and China, but the new prospect of the Russians and the Americans together
trying to carve out a sphere of influence in the valley. Secondly, the timing
of the proposal is most unfortunate. Rajaji may have thought that the recent
efforts of Moscow to win the confidence of <span class=SpellE>Pindi</span> make
this moment propitious for a Russo-American good offices team in Kashmir. But
if the Russians are now accepted as friends and well-wishers by Pakistan, has
not the very trend of events meant a set-back to India? The point is, that two
of the members of the team have always been regarded in India as of doubtful
neutrality over the Kashmir issue and the third one seemed to have qualified
its policy of active support for India only recently. To choose this moment to
canvas for the Big Three intervention is sheer folly. The proposal has been
rejected by almost all sections of Indian opinion. The Congress, the PSP and even
the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party itself, have sharply rejected it.

the Rajaji plan is thoroughly unacceptable, the spirit behind the proposal should
not be lost sight of. As he himself later explained, it is inspired by the
feeling that something should be done to evolve a solution with a broader
consensus over Kashmir. India’s objections against plebiscite and foreign
intervention are all quite valid. At the<i> </i>same time, a recognition of the
fact that the present situation cannot seriously be regarded as the ‘solution’,
in the absence of unimpeachable evidence of support from the generality of the
people of Kashmir, has not come about. It is, in this context, that Pakistan
acquires a say in the matter. Unfortunately there has not been much discussion
in India over the matter and quite apart </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Rajaji has rendered signal service </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by forcing us to
rethink about Kashmir. It is true his plan will not work, but if it leads to a
new readiness on the part of the public to think about Kashmir, he will have
succeeded. The point is simply this: legal niceties apart, the Kashmir
situation warrants a solution that can either command the confidence of all the
people there, or win the agreement of Pakistan. To achieve either of these
ends, some concessions will have to be made. Admittedly, what shape these
concessions can take and what procedures are to be adopted in implementing
these, it is difficult to suggest at this stage. But there must be some effort
at rethinking on these lines. Now that the No-War Pact proposals failed, it is
to be hoped that the Indian Government will not slacken its efforts in
reopening bilateral negotiations, where fresh and meaningful alternatives can
be proposed and agreed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At about six-o-clock in
the morning, I opened the door leading to the inner verandah and stood at the
window facing the east. Patches of dark clouds were spread all over the eastern
sky, it wasn’t raining though. Cool moist breeze refreshed my mind and relieved
me of the tedium and weariness that I had been enduring since last many days
for a cause unknown to me. A very heartening sight enlivened and brought real
delight to my sick mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A very young Neem tree raised
itself straight and stood with a proud gait on the open plot of land behind my
house. It shook gracefully with all the load of its new branches and leaves and
looked as if it was thrilled by the revelation of some long awaited news held
secret from it. The green, wet leaves, shining under the mild sun-rays piercing
through the clouds, shivered gleefully and helplessly trying, perhaps, to
maintain the secrecy of the news. The tender branches held myriads of tiny
rain-drops over its new leaves like new pearls carelessly spread over the
tender body of a teenager bride. The entire world of the Neem was of freshness,
fullness and joy. It shook, it bowed, it shivered, sometimes in
quiet-absorption, sometimes in eloquent expressions. One who would follow nature’s
language would hear it whispering words of hope and great expectations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No apparent cause of all
this jubilation could be seen, yet it gave me a feeling that its merry mood
would certainly bring good news to me. The atmosphere around the Neem had, somehow,
got linked with my emotional world. The grimness of the young tree had always
indicated grief to come and it waved its arms in full humour whenever I had fun
in life. It had become a virtual partner in sharing my everyday emotions. Let
me think once again or scan the post carefully, does it bring any message of
joy. Oh! no, there are none. Then whom is it welcoming, whom is it inspiring?
It unleashed the secret a day later. It was Vasanti’s reunion with her old
father. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poor Vasanti! deserted
by her faithless husbands centered all her feminine feelings round her foolish
father. She left her village in Chattisgarh, the area of the tribals and
beautiful paddy fields. Twice she had been married for the prospects of a happy
family-life of their tribal type and both the times she had been discarded by
her husbands like a rotten fish. The reason was her weak health. She could not
cope up with the diverse domestic duties. She could not add to the family
prosperity by helping in their hard economic ways of life. Neither could she
satisfy the demands of the healthy, youthful husband. She proved there, worth
nothing and had to seek the asylum of her father’s insufficient household. She
was happy here even in poverty. No one looked upon her for contempt. No one
pretended to be her protector. She had choice before her to accept or reject
her task-masters. Now she lived in the city with her father Jhanku. She worked
for those who tolerated her sickly looks and imperfect work. Earned some money
for two mouths and some occasional purchases of tit-bits to beautify herself.
She spoke a language which was distortion of both, her own tribal dialect and
Hindi, the tongue of the civilized. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She attended to all my
domestic work with full interest and made best efforts to improve her standards
in presenting her work and her own self. She selected one of my used sarees and
a pair of sandals for a change after the day’s menial work. In the evening she
passed my door, donned in her bests, with a limp shopping bag in her thin hand,
all in smiles between her broad bony jaws. After about an hour she would return
the same way, except her slower speed and fuller bag, she would be the same
free bird to halt at my place for a short rest to her lungs, working fast,
beyond their capacity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She was happy with her
routined life and her non-interfering father. Gradually she realised that she
should work more to earn more to improve her failing health. She picked up work
with a number of households in the neighbourhood and stayed out for long hours
without rest and nourishing food. Her health would not permit this injustice.
She would naturally be compelled, intermittently, to lie down flat on her back
and pray for speedy recovery. Overloading always left her spine weak. Yet she
enjoyed her illness because it provided her opportunities to purchase medicines
and injections, though on credit, that charmed her in the houses of the
respectable ladies. The druggists wouldn’t mind selling medicines on credit to
ever-smiling and ailing Vasanti because they knew she was a regular pay-master.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her new mistresses
volleyed sour epithets on her return to work. She shrugged her thin shoulders
and gave a broad smile showing the milk-white teeth, the only sign of health on
her person, and started giving her explanations at a high pitch of voice. She
readily agreed with all the new terms of service dictated by her young
mistress, finished her work there, swifter than usual and entered my door. She
would slam it hard behind her and take her usual place near the tea-table and
start bubbling out her stories amidst loud laughter and heavy breathing
alternately. Vasanti convinced me that she had befooled the young housewife
next to my door by making promises to come regularly, provided she could pay
for the medicines she should take religiously. A few chips of her pay in
advance would help them both. The “foolish girlish mistress “ paid her at once,
enough to purchase “Benadryl” which brought great relief to her hard coughing.
I enjoyed her talks. She was an interesting crook showing all the symptoms of a
woman of this progressive age. She could easily forbear with the cruder aspect
of life because she was a mistress in her own house here. She enjoyed liberty
of action and decision and could even command obedience from her old father.
She asked him to cook late so that they could enjoy hot food even at late hours
of the day. She would even ask her father to go for fishing on week-ends so
that they could enjoy a ‘Chattisgarh’ type of meal consisting of hot rice and fish
steamed in mustard and chillies. She agreed to work hard for all these
prospects of prosperity and luxury. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A considerably long
period of hard work made her sick again. The old man, being the father of this
unfortunate child suggested her, out of desperation, to stay back at home for
sometime, cook and eat well and allow him to go out for work. The ambitious
girl with her wounded dignity resented, “No, not by any means! Why should I
always be fettered to home? I shall earn money and be free. You better cook and
eat well at home and enjoy sound sleep under the quilt”. Jhanku was left
speechless, could argue no further with his progressive daughter. Quietly he
shed tears at his own disability and infirmity, though in the heart of his
heart he sincerely wished, if he could fulfil some of his daughter’s desires. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once I visited the
shaggy abode of Vasanti and old Jhanku under a tin-roof with an earthen floor,
behind the double-storyed bungalows of the ministers overlooking the lake.
Vasanti set up on her bamboo cot with kness near her chest. She was trying to
hold herself against the cruel coughing that shook her bony frame mercilessly.
On my opening the lid-like door of the box-like room a gush of fresh air
brought the usual smile on Vasanti’s tired face and she exclaimed in her
choking voice, “So, you are again put to trouble lady, and, therefore, have
come with some medicine and a little advice. Leave them near the earthen-
pitcher and make yourself comfortable madam. Never mind the darkness of the
room. I shall soon change it for an airy one and then invite you to lunch.” She
laughed aloud at her own humour but she could not continue further. Started
panting for breath. After a short pause, poor Vasahti tried to complete her
unfinished speech, “Let me earn a little more, then I shall take a room near
yours–that will save my walking all this distance. I too yearn for fresh air
and sunlight...” I interrupted with some rebukes, suggesting not to be so
adventurous. Paying little heed to my rising temper she gave me another smile
and started coughing. It was difficult to stand it longer and I was already on
my feet to walk out of the room. Vasanti beseeched me by the sign of her hands
to stay a little longer but Jhanku led me out in fresh air. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I was returning fast
towards home with old Jhanku at my heels, keeping pace with difficulty. As soon
as we were thirty yards away from Vasanti’s door, Jhanku in his diffident,
shaky voice cried out in his partially intelligible dialect, “Madam…can’t you …
get me some work?” It came as a surprise. I wasn’t ready for an immediate
answer. Yet, I replied in a faltering voice, “I shall try to do my best Jhanku,
as all honest men do but what can you do at this age and in your state of
health?” He almost sobbed, “That is the trouble madam, nobody takes me
seriously because I am old, I am poor! But the grand-old Saheb who is even
older than me is working perfectly all right at Rani Saheb’s bungalow. She is
kind enough to employ him for her household supervision.” Jhanku came all the way
pleading for himself. Ultimately, as we approached the Neem I felt it necessary
to pacify him by some kind of an assurance. I said, “It is a long way you<i> </i>have
to return Jhanku, Go home and look after Vasanti, I shall surely think over
your proposal.” He could read my eyes perhaps, he straightened up his bending
back and shouted. “That is what everybody says, to get rid of this helpless
man.” He raised his hands and bade good-bye. “Ram Ram madam, don’t worry. I
shall think over, the matter myself. Surely, I can’t see the wretched girl ruin
herself any further.” Jhanku turned his back and the whole body of the Neem
started shaking mysteriously. I noticed its behaviour but failed to read what
it indicated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next morning Vasanti
rushed in like a whirlwind and consequently panted audibly. She sat down on the
small patch of floor glittering with the warmth of the sun. I had an unfinished
kettle of hot tea on my table. I offered her a glassful of it but didn’t have
the heart to tease her by offering a sheet of the morning paper in my hand.
After she settled down well I asked the cause of her unexpected visit. She
sipped the tea very quietly. Felt comforted and then reported that her old boy
was missing from home. It came like a blow to me. My inner-self shrinked within
and made me feel very small. I faltered when I tried to give her hope and
courage. I realised that I had taken Jhanku’s request too lightly last evening.
Had I played my role more seriously he wouldn’t have left home in humiliation
and desolation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vasanti broke out in
tears, after a long silence. In between her sobs she said, “I couldn’t earn
enough money to feed him well or give him more comfort. What shall I do now
madam!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our tribesmen never pardon a
worthless woman like me, who brings no prosperity to the family. With my ill
health I am really more of a liability….at last….my father also left me alone
to see my own end.” Vasanti’s sobbing was something unusual, almost unreal to
me. The image of Vasanti was very different from what was before me. Tears were
rolling down her hollow cheeks–the sense of insecurity and uselessness brought
a total change in her character. I couldn’t help giving her a bit of a hint,
“Why don’t you enquire at Rani Saheb’s place? I believe she employs the
tribesmen in her household. Jhanku must have joined there, wasn’t he keen to
work?” The logic impressed her immensely and she left me immediately leaving
her glass unwashed. Left to myself I suffered more because in solitariness I
sensed, like many others, the irresponsible idiot in me as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vasanti returned in the
afternoon with news, though not very exact. Jhanku had approached the leader of
his tribe, sheltered by Rani Saheb. He was asked to accompany the group of his
kinsfolk who left the same night for the forest areas owned by the Rani for the
felling of the trees. Having received this much of news about her father,
Vasanti felt happy for a moment but after realizing the uncertainty of his
return she became grim again. I myself felt helpless at her despair. She was
planning something very quietly. Suddenly tears welled up in her twinkling eyes
and in order to put up a bold face she uttered an abusive name for God the
Almighty, collected herself and left me in embarrassment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The six days of the
following week crept away slowly. Vasanti tried to be regular in her routine
work. She could be seen on her rounds but no more in her gay and colourful
clothes nor in her usual speed. During those few dusky days often when I opened
the gloss window of the inner verandah, I found Vasanti relaxing alone under
the affectionate shadow of the Neem. Sometimes she spent the whole afternoon
under that solitary tree, the only friend in the pensive hours, resting her
tired head between the two skinny-palms, lost in her own world of dreams. The
entire officers’ colony remained unconcerned about this strange woman’s woes
and worries. The Neem only would start fanning her with its thousand leaves,
and it would gently shower its affections through the worn leaves and flowers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the seventh day
Vasanti did not turn up at all. On an inquiry in the neighbourhood where she
worked, it was confirmed that she had not been seen even sitting under the tree
behind. My anxiety rose higher. I could wait no more after the mid-day sun
crossed the Neem. Something was growing upon my heart, it was the deep sense of
guilt perhaps! The afternoons around the Malwa valley of Madhya Pradesh are
usually warm during all seasons not to make a walk very comfortable. I
perspired, yet walked fast under the mental agony I suffered from and reached
Vasanti’s room half of the time I usually took. Absentmindedly I threw open the
lid-like door without giving a knock. But lo and see! Vasanti holding old
father in both her arms, was laughing and sobbing at the same time like a mad
woman. It was pretty difficult to make out at first sight that the bruised
lump, scratched all over the body, was old Jhanku. The way he groaned in pain
and chuckled at the pleasure of the reunion with his daughter resembled more
with the growing of a buffalo separated from its calf. It was hard to realize
what feelings I actually had at that moment. Vasanti became aware of my
presence at the door. She released her father from the tight caress on the mat
and moved towards me. Now she started narrating the story in half amusement and
half pity for her foolish father. It ran thus–“Look, there lies the old tiger,
unable to stand. But you should know madam, that he could walk all this
distance from Sohagpur back home, all alone, without food or even a drink! How
did he dare, I do not know! And why did he have to walk? because he was
penniless. But how was he left alone, you ask?” Jhanku tried to interrupt
ineffectively. Vasanti giggled and resumed her story after calling him a name
in her own delect–“He couldn’t get into the train along with his
companions–poor, poor, old boy! How did he live, you know madam? He carried the
load for others and earned some money to fill his belly and waited for some
train to return but the rascals of railway sahibs would not let him board the
train without a ticket. He had nothing left in his pocket, where could he
purchase a ticket from? And now he has come home walking all the way, in that
wretched condition...see...”. She lifted high Jhanku’s torn feet and swollen
legs. Jhanku felt humiliated and ashamed at the treatmeant of his daugnter,
collected himself up with effort and came tottering near me. In a husky voice
he whispered very confidentially. “Madam, I am a good-for-nothing fellow. I
would not go out any more. I would enjoy the sun and the moon under our Neem
and watch my Vasanti running about the bungalows till she breathes her last one
day”–a painful smile stopped his speech. I had no word to console him because I
lacked the courage of repeating the meaningless promises any more. I said “Ram
Ram Jhanku, take rest” and took leave with the satisfaction that Vasanti was
not alone after all. I reached the friendly Neem. It proudly held its head high
and shivered with joy that Jhanku, forsaken by man, returned at last to nature.
Here he would find undeterred peace and protection. The oasis of the wearied
life of Vasanti and her father could never be grabbed away by man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

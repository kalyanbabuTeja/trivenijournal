knew Rajaji for the last fifty-two years from the time he came in contact with
Gandhiji and joined the Satyagraha movement. He had just shifted from his
native town of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Salem</st1:City></st1:place>
and established himself as an advocate in the Madras High Court. He was a rising
lawyer, who, if he had continued in the profession, would have been a great
advocate and a jurist. But the loss to the legal profession was an invaluable
gain to the nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were afterwards colleagues in the Working Committee for years. Whenever the
committee met in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>,
though the arrangements were made for the stay of Rajaji and Vallabhbhai at
Anand <span class=SpellE>Bhawan</span>, they preferred to stay with me in <span
class=SpellE>Swaraj</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhawan</span>. These two great

before he took part in the Satyagraha movement, was in politics a follower of
Tilak. He was an extremist, the ultra-­radical of these days. But his main
activity there was in the social field. Though born in an orthodox Brahmin
family, he did not believe in untouchability or the caste system. He also did
not observe the rites and ceremonies of the Hindu religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Congress session in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Gaya</span></st1:place></st1:City> in 1922, presided over by <span

leadership, <span class=SpellE>Das</span>, <span class=SpellE>Motilal</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Vithalbhai</span>, stood for change in the Congress
programme laid down by Gandhiji, in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of council-entry,
as against <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>, Rajendra <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>
and myself who stood for no change. Jawaharlal had not made up his mind yet.
Our spokesman at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Gaya</span></st1:City></st1:place>
was Rajaji. We carried the day. <span class=SpellE>Chittaranjan</span> <span

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
his first brilliant performance, there have been ups and downs in the political
life of Rajaji. When in 1924 Gandhiji was released from jail on account of his
illness, he put an end to the controversy between the pro-changers and the no-changers.
Rajaji then took to constructive work and <span class=SpellE>organised</span> <span
class=SpellE>Khadi</span> and village work and lived in an Ashram.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

first set-back in the Congress was when he said that the Congress must <span
class=SpellE>recognise</span> <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in principle. This was greatly misunderstood at the time. What Rajaji meant
came out clearly, when in 1943, after he was released, Gandhiji met Jinnah at
the instance of Rajaji. At the very first meeting when Gandhiji mentioned <span
class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span> name, Jinnah denounced him in such terms that, as
Gandhiji said afterwards, he felt like abandoning the talks with Jinnah. Jinnah
understood the meaning of Rajaji, about the acceptance of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> in
theory by the Congress, better than his critics in the Congress. His idea was
as proposed by Gandhiji, which was rejected by Jinnah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the differences he had with Gandhiji and his colleagues of the Working
Committee did not make any change in the high opinion about <span class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span>
great qualities, of the head and the heart. Gandhiji once called him his
‘Conscience-keeper.’ It was, therefore, not surprising that as soon as <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s freedom was in the <span class=GramE>offing,</span>
Rajaji was called to be the Governor of Bengal and little afterwards to be the
first Governor-General of free <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
during the course of the interim Government. Jawaharlal wanted him to be the
first <span class=SpellE>Rashtrapati</span> of Free India. But that was not to
be. The choice of the people, for the highest position in the state, fell upon
another great patriot and man of learning, Rajendra <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>.
Afterwards Jawaharlal called him to join the Central Cabinet as Minister
without portfolio, and after the death of <span class=SpellE>Sardar</span>, as
the Home Minister. But, however great may have been Jawaharlal’s opinion about
Rajaji, it was not possible for these two great men to pull on together in the
Cabinet for long. Rajaji soon resigned. He never took the public into
confidence about the cause of his resignation. But those who knew the two men
understood the gulf that divided them. It was in their respective upbringing,
character and outlook on life that separated them, whatever their opinion of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>each
others’ merits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rajaji
was chosen as a leader of the Congress Party after the first General Election
in Free India in 1952 and became the Chief Minister of United Madras. The
Congress had failed to secure a majority in the Assembly. Prakasam, the state
leader of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>K.
M. P. P., had come to an understanding with the Communist Party to form a
Coalition Government, which commanded a majority in the Assembly. But
Congressmen have always been reluctant to part with power. Therefore, the
Congress Party in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
and at the Centre conceived the plan, to ask the Governor not to call the
leader of the Coalition, but to call Rajaji, the leader of the party which had
failed to secure a majority in the Assembly, to form the Government. A pliant
Governor, Sri <span class=SpellE>Prakash</span>, obliged the Congress Party, to
which he himself belonged. He called Rajaji to form the Government. Rajaji, who
had not contested the election, was nominated by the Governor to the upper
house as a literary person, as if his literary abilities were discovered then
for the first time. As soon as Rajaji took office, he announced that he would
dissolve the Assembly if he did not command the majority. Soon there were
defections from other parties, and the Congress had the requisite majority.
However, <span class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span> Chief <span class=SpellE>Ministership</span>
did not last long. Rajaji had accepted to be the Chief Minister on the clear
understanding that the Centre would support him. This support was not
forthcoming, when Rajaji was obliged to resign on the issue of introducing
craft work in primary schools. In this he was right and his opponents were
entirely wrong. Rajaji also lost the goodwill of the members of the Assembly,
by directing that no legislator should approach the officers, except through
the Chief Minister or the Ministers concerned. This episode, of the mode of
forming a minority, paved the way to defections, which in after years have
plagued Indian politics and made ‘politician’ a by-word of contempt. It also
opened the way for the Governors to exercise their ‘discretion’ in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of the ruling party in the formation of ministries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However,
this did not end <span class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span> political career. He always
took keen interest in the affairs of his country. At the advanced age of
eighty, he formed a new party, as he thought that the Congress was not properly
handling the affairs of the country and there was a tendency towards the rule
of one person, by which the freedom of the citizen and his initiative would be
lost. He wanted to call the new party the Conservative Party of India. But his
companions thought that the word “Conservative” would denote in these days “reaction”
in the public mind. The new party was therefore, called the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
Party. It stands for democracy, the freedom of the individual and his unfettered
initiative. It also stands for “the rule of law” and “the due </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>process
of law.” Rajaji was a liberal in politics, liberal in the best connotation of
that term. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever
cause Rajaji took up, he brought to it his earnestness, determination and
indomitable will. It is true that he often advocated lost causes, as in the
case of his scheme or reform in education or prohibition or opposition to
artificial methods of birth-control. He was never enthused by sentiments and
passions. He was preeminently the intellectual. His forensic skill was
unmatched. It was always difficult to argue with him. He would overwhelm his
opponents not only by logical arguments, but bring to his aid simile, metaphor,
fable and anecdote. But by these means, he could not always convince his
opponents. In the case of Gandhiji, it was different. He would not try to
defeat his opponent in argument but convince him by the clear communication of
his stand and his sincere conviction. Unbeatable as Rajaji was in argument, he
had also the capacity of reducing his critics to silence by one sentence. Mrs.
Gandhi, as the Prime Minister, once <span class=SpellE>criticised</span>
Rajaji. His reply was <span class=GramE>“ I</span> first met <span

accomplishments were great. He was a prolific writer, not only in his
mother-tongue Tamil but also in English. He wrote books on religion, philosophy
and politics. But he did not forget the children. He wrote for them too. His
learning was as massive and solid as that of the old <span class=SpellE>pandits</span>,
bereft of their orthodoxy. He may be said to be the modern <span class=SpellE>Bhishma</span>
<span class=SpellE>Pitamaha</span>, who had eaten nobody’s salt. He was not
subservient to anybody, except to the truth he saw at the time. It may be no

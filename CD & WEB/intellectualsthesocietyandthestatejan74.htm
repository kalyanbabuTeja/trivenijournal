is a phrase of Percy Bysshe Shelley, which has almost become a cliche in our
time, describing the poet as “the un-acknowledged legislator of mankind.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
fact that Shelley felt constrained to define the writer’s position in this
manner was due to his apperception of the rights of a sensitive private
individual against the contempt of society and the then growing encroachment of
the State on the freedom of the individual. As everyone knows, Shelley himself
had been expelled from Oxford and was so much despised for his dangerous
thoughts in 19th century England that he spent the best part of his life on the
continent of Europe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

poem “The Revolt of Islam” sums up fairly clearly the position of a free spirit
of the period of the industrial revolution, when the English middle class achieved
supreme power in the home country and a good deal of influence abroad through
the expansion of the British Empire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
essence of Shelley’s gospel is that, though the writer serves as the conscience
of humanity, precisely because he utters the deepest truths on its behalf, and
thus appeals to the hearts and minds of men, the State, as the expression of
organised society, always tends to inhibit the poet’s felt realisations, to
choke his voice in the name of the establishment and a conformist orthodoxy,
and to suppress criticism, because, it says: “Those who are not with us are
against us.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
poignancy of Shelley’s struggle lies in the fact that he was an intellectual,
who grew up in the midst of a comparatively free, liberal, middle class and not
under a dictatorship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

italic'>conflict </span>between the State and writer arises even in the so-called
democratic States, it is inevitable under the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>dictatorships. </span>There are quite a few <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>obvious </span>reasons for the natural emergence of this conflict in almost
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>all </span>known societies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>First of all, the laws of society
are made by ordinary men for ordinary men. And the poet, generally being the
more sensitive and weaker, but extraordinary creature, who plumbs into the
wells of loneliness and brings up unsuspected truths, is not despised and
feared. He will say the most outrageous things, in words which describe
feelings, emotions and thoughts felt by him as well as by other people but
which he alone has the courage to say openly. In so far as he thus shows up the
hypocrisies of other people, he is not a very pleasant fellow to contend with.
And, furthermore, because he reiterates his faith in the real life as against
the shame, subterfuges and shibboleths of the existing order, against rigid
dogmas, pompous of stuffed up hardened ‘strong’ individuals, from the point of
view of the tentative, the weak and humble folk, his priggish insistence is
unwelcome to those who would rather not face the truth not known to them, the
complex inner truth of literature which even the poet himself may not be able
to explain because it comes from the deeps inside him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the second place, it is true of
all organised States which have so far been known in history, that “power
corrupts and absolute </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>power corrupts absolutely”, and that all
governments are, at their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>best, bad governments, from the very
nature of their control, by politicians who must maintain themselves in power
somehow or the other. In this context, the law-givers, from the author of the <i>Arthasastra</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>to Machiavelli, left no doubt
whatever about what feudal princely regimes ought to do to keep the people
down. The whole tradition of Roman Law, on which are based most of the modern
systems of jurisprudence, rests on the foundations of the principle of “rendering
unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s”, without showing much obligation on
the part of Caesar to render unto people the things that are the people’s. And,
in the development of the modern capitalist State, into Fascism on the one hand
and Stalinist tyranny on the other, whatever pretences may be made in the name
of the people, the power State has grown more and more omnivorous and
comprehensive in its control of thoughts, and thus of the thinker, who is, from
the very nature of his being, <i>different</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'> </span>from others, perverse, if you like, but certainly relentless in
the pursuit of reality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

produced by all those complex factors, and generated by the various cold and
hot wars, the long arm of the state has tightened control on the press, and

</span>works between nations and nations. Thus <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>truthful </span>utterance finds difficulty in being expressed. And the
men of truth are either brought up by privilege and money, or <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>by </span>those who own the means of mass
communication, so that they speak half-truths, or quarter-truths, or are put on
the shelf as safe men and women, knights or prize-winners or members of the
upper houses of the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

camp, in the intolerance generated by fanatical sectional, orthodox minds,
obsessed by the rightness of their own dogmatic religions, condemning others
for differences <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of opinion based on
caste or race or colour. In recent years, we have seen various States denying

of the intellectual advance which has been made <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>by </span>humanity is through the free thoughts of the freest minds of
every particular age. And, though the State has seemed always to win in the
immediate present, it always earned enough obloquy after the event. Nobody
condemns Socrates for his loose <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>talk, </span>but
everyone resents those who made him drink the hemlock; hardly anyone has a good
word for those who killed Galileo; and there are few, even among the Fascists

intellectual tends to be justified by posterity, for what was once supposed to

in which metaphor and imagery dominate, where nothing is literal, and where the

modern State are mostly based on several antediluvian and obscurantist
hypotheses, relevant to societies with quite different economic and social
relations and moralities other than those we ourselves need, these laws are
often not binding up ordinary individuals. They must come under constant
criticism in a democracy, so that they can be reformed and brought up-to-date
to meet the contingencies of an evolving humanity, where the breakthrough
between the imagination of men to men, for creating understanding and contact,
and for future psycho-social growth is important. The fact that a man’s hand
can be cut off in punishment for the crime of stealing, even today, or that a
hostile look in the eyes of a person can be punished with liquidation by a
dictator, or that a traveller has to give finger-prints on entering a country,
or an untouchable burnt for stealing some coins are all obsolete survivals of
the age of the witch-hunt, which cannot stand the test of intellectual scrutiny.
And as already in the 19th century, the most enlightened thinkers tended
towards the doctrine of the ultimate withering away of the State, as the only
civilised solution of the conflict between the individual and the State, all
steps which lead in that direction ought to be accepted as <i>minimum</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>starting points, in any new State
much as our own Indian socialist democracy with distinction. And, by this token,
the intellectual, who will be in the vanguard of this struggle to achieve the
intensest consciousness, should enjoy the greatest liberty, and not be judged
from the point of view of the Public Prosecutor, whose tests are generally
legalistic fictions and who cannot be expected to understand literary metaphor,
symbolism and fantasy, or the freer future built or new concepts of equality
and expansion of consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

States, have banned works which have been allowed to be published in several
countries or the world. The reason for these shameful actions often given is
that the Law of Obscenity which applied under foreign rule has not been
revised. But, beyond that lame excuse, is the fact that the standards from
which even people in our country often judge works to be obscene are outmoded
survivals of our feudal past, when the attitude towards sex was governed by the
fear of rape, torture and assault of invaders from outside. The resulting
subjugation of women, and the denial of the beauty of sexual relations, and of
tenderness between the male and the female, through arranged marriage to guard
virginity, has led to a national psychosis in which all frank talk of sex is
supposed to be obscene. The puritanism of the Christian Church has also
rigidified the obscurantist attitudes of the local orthodoxies. The recent
discussions about allowing “kissing” in films, if this is organic to the theme,
has shown that even the intelligentsia is being offered to justify the ban of
kissing in the country which produced the tenderness of the classical art of
Khajuraho and Konarak, and where Vatsyayana wrote the <i>Kama Sutra</i><span

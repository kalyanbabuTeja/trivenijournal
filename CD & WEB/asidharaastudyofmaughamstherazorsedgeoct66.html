values of life. In all his major novels he has his views to express, mostly in
the form of piercing sideglances on characters, events and situations, a view
of life to present, and a message to convey. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Maugham
started his obstinate questioning quite early in his life and developed
agnostic, if not atheistic, tendencies even as a school boy. In his <i>Of Human
Bondage </i>he devoted a full chapter to describe Philip’s loss of faith in
Christianity. That his hero’s loss of faith is an account of his own loss of
faith is attested by Maugham himself.<sup>1 </sup>But, the questioning spirit
of a Maugham does not end with his rejection of religion and the existence of
God. On the contrary, it leads him to a quest for a Philosophy of life which
will enable him to face the facts of life with equanimity, courage and good
humour. In fact, this appears to be the central theme of the most
autobiographical of all his novels, <i>Of Human Bondage. </i>Philip’s struggle
is not simply an attempt to get out of the clutches of his morbid affair with
Mildred. It is the universal desire of man to free himself from human bondage.
In <i>The Moon and Sixpence </i>the quest assumes a new shape: the struggle of
an artist to realise himself, ‘to become a creature of the moment, clear of all
ties.’ Maugham’s </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>search after a personal philosophy of life
becomes explicit in his <i>The Razor’s Edge. </i>Larry is not a synthesis of
three of Maugham’s characters, “the exquisite Erick, the Vedanta-teaching
Frith, both of <i>The Narrow Corner, </i>and the rebellious Edward of the
shortstory, <i>The Fall of Edward Barnard”</i>,</span><sup><span

Maugham himself has been troubled by the questions which Larry asked is

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Like Maugham, Larry is an orphan, shy, sensitive and observant, and, both of
them were troubled by the same questions: “Whether God is or God is not…to find
out why evil exists….Whether I have an immortal soul or whether when I die it
is the end”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

all his questions in Hindu philosophy: in the Hindu concept of the three fold
manifestation of the Absolute Reality, the doctrine of the ‘mysterious
neuter’,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Brahman, and the theory of
transmigration of souls. Here again (Maugham is presenting something which he
himself derived from Hindu philosophy. Except the trance, all the experiences
of Larry are the experiences of Maugham during his stay in India–especially in
the Ashram of Ramana Maharshi. These experiences which he recorded in <i>A
Writer’s Notebooks </i>are recounted in the novel almost verbatim. In short,
Maugham’s dramatic presentation of the conversation between Larry and himself
(the narrator is Mr. Maugham), is the author’s attempt to look at himself face
to face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

main reason for this universal disillusionment is man’s loss of faith in
everything including himself. The three thinkers’ most influential at the time,
Darwin, Marx and Freud (at least as they are commonly understood) robbed man of
all his glory–the first makes him a result of a blind biological accident, the
second shows that all his thoughts, behaviour, taste and culture, are simply
the product of the dialectic of matter, and the third literally traces
everything connected With man to sex, psychological factors and traumas.
Therefore, man is neither capable of real choice nor responsible for the
choices he makes. The best he can do is to take himself socially useful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

led to rapid industrialisation. Industrialisation, besides its boons, imposes a
dull pattern and a monotonous uniformity and a fixed routine on life. The way
of life it evolves is completely devoid of tradition and any kind of belief
whatever. It provides standardised comforts and a set of new values–quicker
production, time-saving devices and Utilitarian outlook. The creative activity
of man will be limited to particular patterns catering to popular conveniences.
These factors incapacitate people, partic</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

is born into the American society after the first war. He is placed in a social
setting where good life is equated with affluent living and rank in society.
Isabel, Larry’s lady love, Elliott, her socially eminent uncle, Mrs. Bradley,
her mother and the wife of Mr. Bradley, who was ‘the first secretary’ of Rome,
all believe in it. Larry, if he wants Isabel, must conform to the commendable
customs of his country, and he has every chance and opportunity waiting for
him. He will be a multi-millionaire if he simply accepts one of the many
offers. ‘Larry had a chance of getting in on the ground floor, and if he kept
his nose to the grindstone he might well be many times a millionaire by the

aware of its importance. It meant power, influence and social consequence. It
was the natural and obvious thing that man should earn it. That was his plain
life’s work”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

He does not escape like Maugham’s artist hero of <i>The Moon and Sixpence </i>into
the South Seas to be far away from this madding crowd. He faces the facts of
life. He keeps himself free from the “fret, fever and the disease of modern
life” by a process of spiritual levitation or non-attachment. He determines his
life ideal, the search after truth, leading to ultimate realisation. He
resolves and lives up to his resolution; chooses and sticks to his choice. He
embarks upon the most difficult of all tasks, as the title <i>The Razor’s Edge,
</i>suggests. In the words of the <i>Katha Upanishad </i>it is “sharp as the edge
of a razor and hard to cross, difficult to tread is that path (so) sages
declare”,</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The first proof of Larry’s detachment is his
attitude to Isabel. He never thinks of marrying her, nor does he flinch to give
her up when he realises that she wants ‘a square cut diamond and a sable coat’,
not him. He does not create an Occasion, for bouts of temperament and exchange
of abuse, common to lovers in such situations. He behaves with perfect
serenity, accepting everything with a smile. Having freed himself from the
shackles of material comforts and social respectability <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
2.0pt'>he continues his search after reality with an admirable resignation. He
travels light, continuously unburdening himself or </span>personal belongings
and attachments. He comes to grips with the established religion in the person
of a religious father. He is fed up with the Christian concept of Original Sin
and fails to cultivate faith in Christianity. This stage of his life is
wonderfully summed up by the Father. “You are a deeply religious man who does
not believe in God. God will seek you out. You’ll come back. Whether here or
elsewhere only God can tell”.<sup><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'> 10</span></sup>
From the Father he goes direct to India. After a series of strange experiences
which prepare him for the ordeal, he goes to the Ashram of Sri Ganesha at the
suggestion of one of his Indian friends. Having freed himself from all traces
of egoism and selfishness he enters into a trance “of the same order as the
mystics have had all over the World through all the centuries”.<sup><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'> 11</span></sup> The words in which he
describes his experience reminds us of the accounts of the enlightened. He
says: “I had a strange sensation, a tingling that arose in my feet and
travelled up my head, and I felt as though I were suddenly released from my
body and, as pure spirit, partook a loveliness I had never conceived. I had a
sense that a kn<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>owledge, more than human,
possessed me, so that everything that had been confused was clear, and
everything that had per</span>plexed me was explained”.<sup><span

Maugham has the <i>Katha Upanishad </i>in mind while writing <i>The Razor’s

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>However, this parallel should not be stretched too
far. Though Larry found answers to his doubts in Hindu philosophy he knows his
limitations. He quickly realises that Hinduism is not merely a philosophy and
religion, but a way of life, and these three aspects are inseparable. When
asked whether he believes in the doctrine of transmigration of souls as much as
the Hindus do, he says: </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Similarly, though Maugham was under the spell of Hinduism for sometime he felt
that it is no more than an “impressive fantasy”</span><sup><span

with him. But Hinduism, more than any other faith, helps him to face the facts
of life, and to evolve some values and also an attitude to life. It helps him
to realise that “the greatest ideal man can set before himself is
self-perfection”</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>21</span></sup><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, leading to
sane living. More than this, Hinduism gives him enough of faith and courage to
live up to it. As in the case of Larry, it seems to have played a significant
part in the formation of Maugham’s own view of life. Maugham said: “If I were
to say, in a few words, what I have learned from life, it is to regret nothing.
Many of the things which happen to us serve a purpose We cannot see at the
time. Many misfortunes have their compensations. Our business is right living.”</span><sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from facts which served as a basis to form a view of life, Maugham also seems
to have derived the necessary vital hint for the creation of Larry. Nachiketas
in the <i>Katha Upanishad </i>starts his enquiry after the ultimate reality
where he sees through the pretentious piety of his father, the mean motives
(love of fame, wealth etc.) behind his great sacrifices. Placing a really
intelligent and serious-minded young man in an affluent society Maugham is able
to show the futility of civilization, the mean motives behind the much-admired
social decency, the ideal of serving the greater community, prestige and high
life. He stresses the importance of spiritual progress along with material
prosperity and by implication suggests the importance of right living. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
the questions–how far is Maugham able to integrate the Hindu philosophical
thought into the tenor of his novel? and, does he make an artistic use of the
Upanishadic ideal?–force themselves upon us. The very fact that Maugham devoted
a separate chapter to Larry’s spiritual achievements, which could be skipped
without any violence to the artistic unity of the novel, shows that he failed
to make a creative use of the Hindu faith and the Upanishadic ideal. The
spiritual evolution of Larry is not shown through an artistic process or
medium, it is merely narrated. His spiritual attainments, and assimilation of
the Hindu faith, remain only a part of his make-up but not his whole being. He
can remain intellectually detached and may give up all his claims for his
belongings, but he cannot renounce the world as his Indian friend the Minister
of Finance did. Hinduism remains only as a view of life with him, but does not
become a way of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Therefore,
Maugham is successful only in stressing the importance of the Upanishadic
message and a sane attitude to life, but he does not show the need for them,
like Eliot, with that tremendous artistic immediacy and urgency. He fails to
make the society realise what it actually needs, but simply suggests. And,
instead of giving what he should give, he gives what it wants, and this he
gives with an obstinate defiance “For all the persons with whom I have been
concerned got what they wanted….And however superstitiously the highbrows carp,
we, the public in our heart of hearts all like a success story.”</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
This failure proceeds from Maugham’s incapacity to feel the need for a faith
and his want of higher artistic sensibility and creative imagination to make
one feel the need with immediacy. His talents enabled him to become a
successful author but not a first-rate artist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

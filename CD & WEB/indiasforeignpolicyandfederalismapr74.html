Indian attitude towards peace has been strongly influenced by Gandhian concepts
of non-violence in the first place and, secondly, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>by<i> </i></span>the directions of its foreign relations policy of the
late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru whose passion for peace was well-known
both within and outside the nation. The Gandhian theory and practice of
non-violence, however, furnished no sure guarantee in the concrete cases for
application that arose since the advent of independence. It was found in
practice impossible to apply the theory of non-violence as practised for the
achievement of freedom to the peaceful settlement <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>disputes and to the problems of peace-keeping. The principal
reason for this shortcoming was the difficulty of deciding in any given case
who was aggressor and who was the defender <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>legitimate interests. India’s experience in regard to
Kashmir, and later in regard to hostilities with China and with Pakistan
furnished therefore no guidance in its conduct of external affairs for
suggesting a sure way to peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s foreign policy was centered round the
idea of non-alignment, which he helped to develop and to which he adhered
unwaveringly throughout the tenure of his high office. The concept had some
obvious implications and assumptions such as the existence of political strife
between power blocs. The threat of violence was primarily posed by the
rivalries of two mutual hostile power blocs whose purpose was to strengthen
themselves each in his own fashion and with all available resources in order to
draw the uninvolved nations into the fold of their respective blocs. It was
believed that such alignment only raised the level of the cold war and made the
chances of attaining peace <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>still </span>more
remote. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
concrete shape was given to this concept in the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>early </span>fifties by the enunciation of Panch Sheel doctrine. This
happy result stemmed from the essential ingredient of amity between the two
large countries uninvolved, viz., India and China. It is no wonder that the
doctrine proved to be short-lived in its practical application owing to the
deterioration of the relations between the two countries towards the end of
fifties and the early sixties. It has now become clear that neither
non-alignment nor Panch Sheel can serve to abate, much less to remove, the
fundamental rivalries that have led to the continuous escalation or the balance
of terror between the principal protagonists of the cold war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the result, attention has in the last few years turned India to other possible
means of augmenting the chances of the preservation of peace. These are
concerned either with the idea of strengthening Public International Law or the
actual operation, with minor changes of the U. N. Charter or a deliberate and
extensive revision of that Charter so as to furnish the basis for a World
Government. In this context there is no great hope entertained of evolving a
Public International Law which would be a dependable guarantee of world peace.
The enunciation of such a Law would obviously imply the existence of a world
body capable of enacting it. A Law, in its formal sense, cannot in other words
be made available merely by an informal or a voluntary agreement among nations.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
regards the improvement and the more assured operation of the existing U. N.
Charter, perhaps with minor amendments, the recent record has shown that very
much depends on changing factors such as the strength and composition of the
General Assembly,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the Constitution of
the Security Council with its provisions for veto and calibre, personality and
prestige of the Secretary-General. It may be said without fear of contradiction
that the efforts of the U. N. for the preservation of peace have had only an
uncertain and partial success and that some problems of peace-keeping have
proved to be incapable of solution through formal means. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sometime
back a seminar was held at the India International Centre, New Delhi, on ‘World
Peace through World Law’. Here the study disclosed three dominant themes. In
the first place, there seemed to be a unanimity that the Clark-Sohn proposals
are the result of deep thinking and mature scholarship and are capable of serving
as a basis for any international endeavour towards establishing a peaceful
world. Secondly, most commentators fell that the world can effectively move towards
the goal of World Government set by the learned authors only if the outmoded
conceptions of state sovereignty and independence are radically revised. Thirdly,
while they viewed the proposals as a convenient working hypothesis and as a
reliable meeting point, they also pointed out that before any concerted attempt
is made towards putting them into effect the big powers must arrive at a
denominator in terms of a declaration of common goals. In other words it was
felt that the big powers must first iron out their differences at the political
plane so that a common base may be established for creative achievements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the meanwhile, thinking continues in regard to the evolution of effective
arrangements within the four corners of the existing U. N. Charter for the
avoidance of war, as for instance in regard to the constitution of an
International Force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Quincy Wright, a Visiting Professor of International Law at the Indian School
of International Studies, pointed out in his article that procedures of the
United Nations be further developed to assure an immediate cease-fire in case
of international hostilities, immediate U. N. intervention in civil strife if
there is danger that it will escalate into international hostilities, and
deliberate efforts to develop recommendations likely to result in agreement to
settle a dispute endangering international peace and security; and that
preparation for a peaceful world would be made by development of international
law adapting it to changing conditions, by extension of the jurisdiction of the
World Court to interpret that Law and facilitate peaceful settlement of
disputes and by establishment of observers and peace forces immediately available
to the United <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Nations<i> </i></span>for
maintaining its cease-fire orders and supporting its necessary interventions in
civil strife. With such developments the United Nations may influence the
peoples and governments to abstain from war, settle disputes, relax tensions,
disarm, and co-operate to advance human welfare and contentment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Should
these hopes be realised the world would have taken a very significant step
forward towards the preservation of peace through the existing United Nations
Charter. The official policy of the Government of India would seem to favour
this step forward and there is no evidence that officially they have given any
thought to the alternative of World Federalism as the only reliable guarantee
for peace. There has, however, been some unofficial discussion, although
fitfully and not in great depth, on this alternative at a symposium held 3-4,
years ago on “Organisation and future U.N.” One of the participants, a
journalist, expressed her view that as late Secretary-General Hammarskjold grew
in office he began to believe in the possibility of a World Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
as the U. N. grew stronger in numbers. Hammarlkjold saw that the smaller
countries were numerically in a position to outvote the bigger, as the Charter
of the U. N. was dedicated to the principle of political equality of its members,
that is, one vote for one nation. And that did not seem right. He argued that
the Big Powers with their superior military and economic strength cannot be
expected automatically to accept majority, verdicts. Nor could the great powers
be permitted to set them-selves above, or disregard the views of the majority.
Some kind of balance had to be struck, but where and how? This was the question
which was troubling Hammarskjold, before his death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
concept of the equality of nations, however, had to be preserved in principle.
As he put it almost lyrically: “There is a new situation today. You have to
recognise that you cannot dictate to other nations. It is more difficult to see
your brother in a slave or a master. It is easier to see him in somebody with
whom you have to live without giving or taking orders.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

entry of China into the Nuclear Club would seem to have shaken Indian
non-official opinion and would appear to have put a wet blanket on the hope
entertained that a World Federation would be within the limits of practical
politics, especially in view of the continuance of unfriendly relations between
India and China. It should be mentioned here that opinion has already been
split on the non-official side in regard to the necessity or desirability of
India becoming a nuclear power for offence in view of the threat posed by
China. The official Indian attitude has so far been against such a step, but it
is now wavering in the face of the supervisory powers in this respect sought to
be assigned to the Nuclear Club by the non-proliferation treaty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

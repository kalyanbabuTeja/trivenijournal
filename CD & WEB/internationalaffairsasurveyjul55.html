<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
last survey of international affairs was made just a few days before the
meeting of the Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung. The present survey is being
made a few days before the meeting of the four great powers at Geneva for what
have come to be known as “Summit talks”. This is the first time that the heads
of the U.S.A., U.S.S.R., Britain and France are meeting after the second world
war. Much is being expected of this meeting; and the attention of the whole
world is directed towards it. It may therefore be relevant to consider what the
factors are which have made this meeting possible and what effect it is likely
to produce on international affairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Geneva meeting may be best characterised as the meeting of parties fighting a
war for settling the terms of a cease-fire or a truce. Such a meeting takes
place when fighting results in a stalemate and when the parties recognise that
neither of them can gain its objectives by continuing the war. This is now the
position at which the parties to the cold war have arrived. This cold war has
been going on for the last ten years. It has brought notable accessions of
strength to either side. With<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the triumph
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>of Communism in China, the Communist side gained great
advantage and this had encouraged it to plan aggression in Korea </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
begin the Korean War. Meanwhile the anti-Communist side </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>led
by the United States organised the Marshall Aid Plan and succeeded in creating
and strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Organisation, which
brought under its control and direction the resources of the highly
industrialised states of Europe outside the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Communist fold. The
inclusion of West Germany in this organisation and its rearmament raised
controversial issues and the U.S.S.R. tried its best through diplomacy and
threats to prevent this inclusion and rearmament. But its efforts failed. West
Germany has become a fully sovereign State, a member of the N.A.T.O., and is to
raise an army of half a million as its share of the N.A.T.O.’s defence forces.
One of the reason why the U.S.S.R. has come to the conclusion that there should
be a truce in the cold war; is this failure of hers to prevent the rearmament
of Germany. Similarly in the Far East, Japan has become a military ally of the
United States. These are some of the crucial factors that have compelled the
U.S.S.R. to rethink about the whole strategy of the cold war and to conclude
that a victory against the West, with which Germany and Japan are allied, is not
easy of achievement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
more crucial than this is the realisation by both sides that a nuclear war–and
that is the only kind of war for which both sides have been making preparations
all these years–is sure to destroy both of them. That nuclear warfare would be
fatal to both, that in such a warfare there can be no question of a winning or
losing side, and that it will even bring about the destruction of the human
race itself, has been repeatedly stated by very many eminent persons all these
years. In spits of this the United States has gone on piling its stock of H.
Bombs. The U.S.S.R. also entered the field some years ago and its stockpile has
also been on the increase. It is only now that they have come to see that, as
the Soviet Disarmament proposal of May 10, 1955 put it, “Science and
Engineering have now produced the most destructive means of annihilating
people”, and not merely the annihilating of the rotten capitalist system. There
has been a similar change in the views of the American statesmen. Their
thinking now is different from that of Truman in the days of the Korean War
when he practically decided on using the atom bomb, and when he would have used
it but for the timely intervention of his British allies. One reason why in
those days the Americans did not consider atomic warfare with the same
seriousness as they do now, is their view that the U.S.S.R. had no atom bombs
and that it would take a long time for her to manufacture them. But the
situation has now completely changed. The Americans are aware now that Soviet
Russia has a stockpile of A and H bombs and also efficient plants for producing
more and more of them. Moreover the lead which America has in this matter is of
no practical significance. If the U.S.S.R. has enough bombs to destroy the
United States, there is no advantage for the latter in having three or four
times the number of bombs </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which the former possesses. Unlike
President Truman, President Eisenhower and his top advisers hold the view that
in consequence </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the advent of nuclear weapons, there is no
longer any alternative to peace. Both sides therefore have come to realise the
futility of relying on nuclear weapons for the realisation of the objectives of
their foreign policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another factor which has brought about a change in climate
of opinion–and this applies with greater force to U.S.S.R. than to the United
States–is the adverse effect which the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>abnormal
expenditure on armaments is producing on national economies. To divert the
manpower and the material resources of a country to the raising of military
forces and to the manufacture and accumulation of armaments beyond a certain
point causes immense suffering and misery. Even in advanced countries like
England where the standard of living is high, increasing expenditure on armaments
is not very popular as the masses do not like any lowering of the standard of
comfort to which they have become accustomed. This has been one of the points
of difference between the left wing of the British labour party led by Bevin
and the right wing led by Attlee. The situation is much worse in countries like
France. There has recently been a controversy as to whether the desire of the
Soviet statesmen to do something to relax the world tension (for which they
bear a large responsibility) is the outcome of the difficulties which they are
facing in the domestic economy in their country, especially in the field of
agriculture and the supply of food. Some of the Western statesmen have
expressed the view that it is this internal weakness and the opposition which
the Soviet authorities are called on to overcome from their own subjects, who
are not able to get an adequate supply of even the bare necessaries of life,
that is responsible for the conciliatory policy which they are now determined
to adopt. This of course has been denied by Soviet statesmen. They have been
repeating that they have taken to negotiation through a conference not because
of their weakness but of their strength. Our own Prime Minister expressed his
conviction that the West would be wrong to believe that Russia’s recent
conciliatory line stems from necessity imposed by internal weakness. All this
may appear to be academic, but the point to be noted is that the economy of
all, countries–and especially of the Communist ones–is severely strained as a
consequence of the increasing expenditure on armaments, and they are therefore
in a mood to negotiate for<i> </i>a ceasefire in the cold war. This also is the
explanation for the less aggressive attitude of China towards the United
States. China’s population is growing. The Communist government has embarked on
a policy of industrialisation and economic expansion in other directions. It is
therefore beyond her means to maintain an army of three to four<i> </i>millions
on a war footing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
fourth factor which is also responsible for the changed outlook, especially of
the Soviet statesmen, is the increasing self-confidence and self-assertion of
Communist China. Of course, China was never a satellite of the U.S.S.R. in the
sense that Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria etc., are satellites. But she is today
much stronger than what she was in 1949. At the Geneva Conference </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1ast
year Chou-En-Lai displayed a spirit of initiative which was somewhat unexpected
and this spirit is sure to grow stronger in the coming years. There is a strong
national spirit among the Chinese. This expressed itself in the past in the
form of a revolt against the West. Among the Western Powers which exploited her
when she was weak was Russia. The Chinese could not have forgotten this. There
is therefore no guarantee that the new government of China would continue to be
firmly tied to Soviet Russia. As one writer has put it, it might well be
tempted to play off the Soviet Union and the Western Powers against each other.
If that should become its policy the Soviet Union would find its freedom of
action reduced. It has not yet become its policy. But there is a possibility of
it. This also has had its own influence in altering the attitude of Soviet
statesmen towards, the cold war. A similar change is found in the United
States. Public opinion, which was extremely anti-Communistic all these years,
is slowly realising that it is impossible to destroy Communism either in China
or in Eastern Europe and that co-existence is the right kind of policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
factor which has played its part in the moves of the parties to the cold war to
talk of a ceasefire and a truce, is the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>effort of our Prime
Minister in that direction. The relaxation of world tensions and the promotion
of international understanding </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and goodwill have been among the most
cherished objectives of his foreign policy. It was this that prompted him to
keep India outside the two power blocks. It was not a passive neutrality that
he adopted. It was, as he often stated, a dynamic one. By keeping in close
touch with the governments in both the blocs, by his more intimate discussions
with the British statesmen as the head of the most important members of the
Commonwealth, and by the lead which he has been able to give to the neutral
nations in Asia and to the peoples of Africa, he has been able to shape world
public opinion in the direction of a policy of peace. It was a great triumph
for him to have brought round Chou-En-Lai to his point of view. Many might have
thought that, after the rebuff received by his government from China on the
question of Tibet, the</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>re could have been no understanding
between him and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chinese authorities. But he was not a
petty-minded politician. He realised the situation and made it a point to
establish more intimate relations with new China. And he has succeeded in t</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>his.
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>At the Bandung Conference China played as important a part
as India. Earlier than this he and the Chinese Foreign Minister issued the
famous Communique containing the five principles which ought to constitute the
basis of any country’s foreign policy in the world </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>today
and this sealed the bond of friendship between the two countries. It was with a
view to create a better international understanding that, after the Bandung
Conference, Pandit Nehru sent his personal ambassador, Sri V.K. Menon, to
Peking, to London, to Washington, and it was with the same objective that he
undertook his tour to Moscow, Warsaw and Belgrade. India is not a small power.
Though she has not a large army or navy or air force, she has moral power
behind her and it is this that has enabled Pandit Nehru to influence the course
of world politics. If the heads of the States which have been carrying on the
cold war for the last ten years are now willing to meet in Geneva, the credit
for bringing this about should to a great extent go to our Prime Minister.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is it about which talks will be held at the summit in Geneva? The conference
has no specific agenda. Moreover it is understood that it will sit for only a
few days. It is not therefore possible to discuss specific political issues and
settle them. Its main purpose will be to establish an atmosphere of mutual
confidence. It will have achieved a great deal if the heads of States leave it
with the conviction that every one is sincerely and wholeheartedly anxious to
bring about a truce to the cold war. It is necessary for the public not to
expect more than this from the conference. The issues that divide the two power
blocs are very many and highly complicated. Several of them cannot be settled
unless it be in a more representative conference. They can’t for instance solve
the problem of Germany unless they have by their side the representatives of
the two German States. They can’t solve the problem of Formosa unless they have
the representatives of the Chinese government. And these are only two of the
large number of problems which have created world tension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the general problems they may have to discuss are those relating to disarmament
and to spheres of influence. There is inter-connection between them.
Disarmament will have to concern itself with matters like a ban on nuclear
tests, peaceful uses of atomic energy, production of bombs by nations which are
not now producing them, the kind of persons that should constitute the
international inspection commission, and the use of Soviet Veto in the early
stages before nuclear weapons are absolutely prohibited. It is now felt that no
inspection commission will be able to prevent completely the concealment of the
manufacture of nuclear weapons. A certain amount of risk has to be faced in
this connection. Moreover there will not be any agreement on the manufacture
and use of nuclear weapons until there is a corresponding agreement on the use
of conventional armaments and their strength. The heads of States will have to
come to some understanding on these matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question of spheres of influence is equally important. If every nation honestly
adheres to the five principles as laid down in the joint Communiques issued by
Pandit Nehru and the Prime Ministers and heads of States of China, U.S.S.R.,
Poland, Yugoslavia etc., the question of spheres of influence may not appear to
be very important. But the point to be noted is that these five principles are
of such a general character that, when it comes to a question of their
application in any particular case, each party may interpret it in its own way.
It is like the dispute that arises under the same law between any two citizens
in a State. Both think that the law is in their favour. It is only because </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
the existence of recognised courts of justice that such disputes are peacefully
settled–the courts laying down the application of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>law
to the particular dispute that has arisen. In respect of the five principles
there is no such recognised court. Each party becomes a judge in its own cause.
And difficulties crop up. This is the reason why the disputes between nations
that may arise in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>their attempts at applying the five principles
do not have the character of legal and justiciable disputes. They are political
in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>their nature, and the only way in which they can be
prevented from becoming sources of war is by the powers at Geneva coming to
some understanding on their respective spheres of influence for the time being.
If there is a guarantee that the West won’t interfere in Europe beyond the
present boundaries of the non-Communist world and that the U.S.S.R. will not
interfere beyond its present sphere of influence; and similarly if there is a
guarantee that China will not extend its influence into S.E. Asia, and the U.S.
will not give any kind of help to nationalist China in the conquest of the
mainland, there will be a relaxation of world tension. It is general questions
like these that will be discussed at Geneva, and the Communiques issued will be
more or less similar to those joint statements issued from the capitals of
various countries which were recently visited by Pandit Nehru.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
event of importance in the period during the survey was the celebration of the
tenth anniversary of the United Nations Organisation at San Francisco. All the
sixty member nations participated in it and their representatives delivered
speeches on the part which it played and which it has to play in the peaceful
settlement of international disputes. It was remarkable that no one wanted to
scrap it, even though several referred to some of its failings. It was
significant that every one expressed the view that the world today cannot have
even that modicum of peace which it has, except through an organisation like
the U.N. Most of the speakers wanted that a more liberal policy should be
adopted in admitting new members. Very few were serious in expressing the need
for revising the Charter or removing the Veto power which five of the States
now possess. All this is another proof of the psychology of the people today.
We are living in a world full of difficulties and tensions. It is not possible
to put an end to all of them and create a perfect world. We can only make small
repairs here and there. It is better therefore to be satisfied with some kind
of patchwork than hankering after utopias and carrying on wars to establish
such utopias.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

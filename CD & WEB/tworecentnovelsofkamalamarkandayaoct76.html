<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>TWO RECENT
NOVELS OF KAMALA MARKANDAYA</span><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>DR S. KRISHNA SARMA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Kamala
<span class=SpellE>Markandaya</span> has an assured place in the field of post-Independence
Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span> writing, not only as a woman writer but
as a writer with a considerable range and talent. While her work is remarkable
for its conspicuous absence of any­thing specifically idiosyncratic in theme or
technique, perhaps this very absence constitutes the hallmark of Kamala <span
class=SpellE>Markandaya’s</span> writing. Another noteworthy feature of her
work is the <span class=SpellE>non­repetitive</span> nature of her themes.
Apart from distant resemblances and echoes from one novel to another in
character or situation, the broad lineaments of her themes vary from work to
work, ranging between rural and urban, personal and pseudo-mystical, racial and
local, and so on. Her most recent novels, <i>The Nowhere Man </i>and <i>Two
Virgins, </i>both published in 1973, show this diversity in theme and structure
and in artistic performance. The first is the story of an Indian immigrant in
England, and the second of an adolescent girl from an Indian village. But while
<i>The Nowhere Man </i>is forceful in narrative and is purposeful, <i>Two
Virgins </i>appears to fritter away its artistic opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>The Nowhere Man </i>is about an Indian settler in England
and the race conflict which comes from behind to almost overwhelm him. <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> was born in an
orthodox upper middle-class Indian family which was exposed to Western culture
and education through two generations, and he was entertaining dreams of a
loyal and fearless life under the old dispensation. But the suspici­ous and
tyrannical British overlord would not permit such a quiet and smooth life: the
times were troubled ones. So in a kind of despair <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> migrates to England to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
whatever dreams he may have had. There, he is permitted to work, buy property
and to raise a family. He is accepted without ado as <span class=SpellE>Mr</span>
<span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> of No. 5, quiet, unassuming, though a little
queer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Already
exposed to the Western cultural values, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> could easily adapt himself to the British modes of
life and thought, and though his wife <span class=SpellE>Vasantha</span>
persists in Indian ways of living, dressing and thinking, <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
brings up his children, <span class=SpellE>Laxman</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Seshu</span>, in British ways. Imbibing the ways of the land as
children do, they grow up with a healthy respect for British Constitution,
religion, language and British modes of <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Vasantha</span>, with her silk <span class=SpellE>sarees</span>
and her dreams of a joint family–­her two sons bringing their wives and living
on the two upper floors of the house while she and her husband would live on the
ground ­floor suggests the distance which <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> and his children have travelled away from the
Indian norms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
War brings disaster to <span class=SpellE>Vasantha’s</span> dreams: both the
boys enlist, like every other Briton, in the War. <span class=SpellE>Seshu</span>,
the younger, withdraws from the front and plies an ambulance in London–but death
finds him nonetheless, driving the ambulance, as surely as it might have on the
fields of France. <span class=SpellE>Laxman</span>, shrewder and farther
removed from his mother’s dreams, marries an English girl, thus escaping a
possible posting in France, and at the end of the War, joins the business house
of his father-in-law at Plymouth. Carrying the broken pieces of her dreams, <span
class=SpellE>Vasantha</span> too dies soon after, leaving <span class=SpellE>Mr</span>
<span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> forlorn and desolate. As her ashes are
merged and drawn into the waters of the English river, it looks as though the
last-physical-shreds of <span class=SpellE>Indianness</span> that had clung to <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> are absorbed into Englishness. His <span
class=SpellE>neighbours</span>, particularly <span class=SpellE>Mrs</span>
Fletcher of No.6, look upon this quiet and eccentric Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
as indeed one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sometime
after his wife’s death, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> strikes a
friendship with Mrs. Pickering, another frustrate soul, past middle age. These
two <span class=SpellE>destitutes</span> find empathy and solace in each other’s
company, and drift into a companionable fellowship. It doesn’t seem odd at all
that they set up house together as man and wife, respecting each other’s
individual quirks of temperament. They even take some tenants by renting out a
part of the house, thus adding to their financial resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
central issue of the novel comes into focus with the arrival at this time, on
the scene, of Fred Fletcher, the son of <span class=SpellE>Mrs</span> Fletcher.
She had despaired of his ever turning out well and had sent him off to
Australia. But now he has returned, burdened with a family which he cannot
support. Accidentally coming across an anti-immigrant campaign in London, Fred
is fired with a fanatic zeal, and forms a one-man anti-Black league in his
locality, and adopts Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> as his particular
target. He sets afoot a regular campaign against Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
and tries his best to discredit him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mr.
<span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> is perturbed, and with all his passivity, he
does react on a psychological level. (It is perhaps this which prompts him to
put on the unaccustomed Indian dress one evening to assert his individuality.)
Nevertheless, he survives the entire smear campaign of Fred, including the
excruciating ‘tarring and feathering,’ without a protest. Even though he knows
that Fred was his tormentor, he does not care to report him to the police, and
refuses to discuss him with Mrs. Fletcher. But this passivity and his <span
class=SpellE>unfighting</span> attitude only infuriate Fred further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
<span class=GramE>he shows symptoms of leprosy, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
is</span> convinced that it is his duty–a duty he owed to the society–to warn the
tenants about this and evict them. Mrs. Pickering tries to soft-pedal the
attempt, but knowing the ineffectuality of her efforts, he visits his tenants
in person and, unabashed, explains the reasons for the proposed eviction. The
tenants resent not so much the crude attempt of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
as their need to uproot themselves, particularly as the housing problem is so
acute. Fred is quick to exploit the situation, and giving the eviction of
tenants a racial bias, he tries to whip up the antagonism of the <span
class=SpellE>neighbourhood</span>. This is not very successful, as illustrated
by the skeptical remarks of the bar-tender across the street. Unable to rouse
the <span class=SpellE>neighbourhood</span>, Fred in despair tries to burn down
No.5. This leads to his own death sooner than that of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
his intended victim, for, operating in secrecy, Fred is hidden from everybody
gathered there, and is charred to death–“hoist with his own petard,” as it were–while
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> is rescued by the police Sergeant. But
he too dies, from delayed shock perhaps, or as a result of shock on the top of
extreme weakness following the attack of pneumonia. But he lives on after being
rescued from the burning house long enough to thank the police Sergeant and to
look around smiling–long enough to vindicate his stance. It is a triumph of his
attitude to England, and a defeat for the senseless and irrational antagonism
of the likes of Fred. In the end <span class=SpellE>Laxman</span> comes round
to accept his father’s ways of thinking yet another proof of the soundness of
the principle that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> life exemplified: an
unostenta­tious and complete yet <span class=SpellE>unservile</span>
acceptances of <span class=SpellE>Britishness</span> and identification with
the land of adoption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> has accepted Britain, the people among
whom he founded his house too have accepted him: <span class=SpellE>Mrs</span>
Fletcher has accepted him on grounds of Christian ethics; Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Radcliffe’s</span> acceptance is on a more personal plane: he was
seeking human companionship away from the upstart set <span class=SpellE>favoured</span>
by his wife, and Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> with his passivity and
self-sufficiency, was a refreshing experience for him, so that for once we find
a doctor going in search of his patient. Mrs. Pickering’s acceptance of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> is complete. The way she fills the vacancy in the
life of <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>, she could be a reincarnate <span
class=SpellE>Vasantha</span>–only more completely British. In fact she seems to
be closer to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> than <span class=SpellE>Vasantha</span>,
who had always carried a piece of India in her heart and had never agreed to
root herself in Britain. (The fact that <span class=SpellE>Vasantha’s</span>
dream of a joint family fructifies in a different shape, to include the
tenants, in the reign of Mrs. Pickering is a possible pointer.) Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> exemplifies the basic Indian <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>catholicism</span></span> in its broadest sense, which absorbs and
accommodates and shapes itself to new situations. Mrs. Pickering, Mrs. Fletcher,
Dr. <span class=SpellE>Radcliffe</span>, the bar tender, etc., represent the
acceptance of the immigrants by the British, on different planes. And Fred
Fletcher clearly belongs to that absolute minority, whether it is among the
native Britons or the restless and numerous <span class=SpellE>coloured</span>
immigrants, who tend to disrupt the harmony of the race relations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
narration is effected mostly through Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
mind reminiscing. He begins to unfold events for himself after learning of his
leprosy from the doctor. His life in India before his emigration is unfolded to
Mrs. Pickering while he is in bed with pneumonia. It is difficult to see how
the narrative in India helps the scaffolding of the novel. We learn of young <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> cultural alienation, we learn of the factors
contributing to his emigration, and we learn of the ‘atrocities’ of the British
officials. In all this we see Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> as an
embodiment of passivity. The two occasions when <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span>
“acted” were when he returned the medal awarded to him, and when he reacted
violently as the police officer lifts the skirt of young <span class=SpellE>Vasantha</span>
with his cane. His life in England is as much a study in passivity, and that
which is clear enough in the British part of the narrative need not be <span
class=SpellE>laboured</span> through 55 out of 312 pages being devoted to his
life in India. Was the writer merely <span class=SpellE>polarising</span> the
character of <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> into the colonial past, or
using this to work out some other contrasts? Beyond a couple of instances the
life of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> in England is more or less
explicit and has no need of a remoter foundation. Is the writer recounting the
brutalities of<i> </i>the British in India just for the purpose of documentation?
Perhaps the appeal to the sensational and anthropological interests in the
overseas reader is too strong a temptation to resist: and sensing the current
popularity of immigrant writing, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Markandaya</span> too
was probably trying to exploit the market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Perhaps
that explains the title of the book too, <span class=SpellE>modelled</span>
obviously on Ralph Ellison’s <i>The Invisible Man. </i>But unlike Ellison’s
work, <i>The Nowhere Man </i>does not <span class=SpellE>dramatise</span> the ‘<span
class=SpellE>nowhereness</span>’ of the central character. There are weaknesses
in the plot too: while it is easy to accept the death of <span class=SpellE>Seshu</span>
in a bomb raid, and while the narrative located in India is altogether
plausible, though not indispensable. It is not easy to see why <span
class=SpellE>Vasantha</span> should be eliminated, through consumption, and why
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> should be made to suffer <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>from </span>leprosy. These are too
fortuitous to be plausible­ they do not possess that artistic inevitability,
and show the writer’s helplessness in manipulating the events more
artistically. One wonders, if only for a moment, how the story would have run
if <span class=SpellE>Vasantha</span> had not died, or how Fred would have
reacted if Mr. <span class=SpellE>Srini­vas</span> hadn’t had leprosy and wasn’t
obliged to turn out his tenants!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
spite of these faults, the novel is readable. Though it belongs to the
immigrant writing of the recent times, it helps the reader to come to a set of
conclusions different <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>from </span>those
drawn from the other novels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><i>Two Virgins</i> </span>is
a story of adolescence and growth to maturity in an Indian village of two
sisters, <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> and <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> the more beautiful though the more gullible
of the two tastes of sophistication <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>from
</span>her school mistress Miss Mendoza, and starts dreaming of a career <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>herself. When Mr. Gupta’s film
unit camps in the village, <span class=SpellE>Lalitha’s</span> dreams take a
definite shape, and she succumbs to the irresistible temptation. She disappears
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>from </span>the village and goes after
her dream, only to return pregnant. Her parents take her back to the city,
confront Mr. Gupta with his foul play and get him to meet the expenses <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>an abortion. But after the
operation <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> disappears, irrevocably this time,
choosing the glitter of the city life to that of the village.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=SpellE>Saroja</span> the younger and shrewder of the two sisters is the
central conscience through which the narrative is unfolded. She does not pass
through any direct experience: much of her experience is vicarious; she
observes, infers, assumes and puzzles, and very little is told her by way of
information. Her only sources of knowledge are <span class=SpellE>Jaya</span>
her classmate, <span class=SpellE>Manikkam</span> the milkman’s wife and <span
class=SpellE>Chingleput</span> the sweet vendor. It is from these, and of
course from the experiences of <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span>, that <span
class=SpellE>Saroja</span> gleans all her wisdom. She is shown growing from a
young girl just starting to put on the ‘<span class=SpellE>davani</span>’
(over-garment or half-<span class=SpellE>saree</span>) over her blouse to hide
her sprouting breasts into a full-blown woman towards the end of the novel
passing, vicariously, through the excruciating experiences of sex, seduction,
motherhood, abortion, and the snares of the city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
<span class=SpellE>polarisation</span> between the vain, pretty, butterfly-like
character chasing the pleasures of life and getting caught in the snares of
superficiality, and the sober and less pretty but more dependable characters
tending to be more shrewd and judicious in similar circumstances, is perhaps
older than Jane Austen. Such contrasts are not infrequent in modern fiction
too. But what purpose is <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> serving in the
education of <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span>?–as an object lesson? It is not
improbable, as <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span> possesses a number of
characteristics common with her sister. <span class=GramE>Curiosity in sex, for
one thing.</span> Again, her initial response to <span class=SpellE>Devraj’s</span>
overtures is similar to that of <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> to Mr. Gupta,
though artless and less deliberate. But what does the disappearance of <span
class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> after the abortion signify? Are we to assume that
an abortion might remove the growing <span class=SpellE>foetus</span> from a
womb but cannot restore the lost virginity? Is that the reason why <span
class=SpellE>Saroja</span> refuses to oblige the ardent <span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span>
at the end of the novel?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=GramE>If that is so, if virginity once lost is lost forever, why then the
emphasis on that aspect in the title of the book?</span> Or is the novelist
de-emphasizing the traditional values of virginity? The domestic debates (pp.
l76-179 and pp. 200-202) appear to indicate a positive stance of the writer
with regard to pre-marital sex, abortion and unmarried motherhood. The debate
is quite topical and the ideas progressive, and would probably please a section
of the reading public in this year of Grace when the world is celebrating
International Women’s Year. But then, why is <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span>
made to react so violently when <span class=SpellE>Devraj</span> touches her
(p. 245) on their last visit to <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Gupta’s house, and
reject <span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span>, more soberly though, at the end?
After all, <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span> loves children: she suffers when <span
class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> gets rid of the unwanted child, and she hates the
society–“the beastly tamer” of such violent passions–for this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While
the <span class=SpellE>ardour</span> of <span class=SpellE>Devraj</span> for <span
class=SpellE>Saroja</span> has been carefully prepared for step by step, as it
were, the reader is not prepared, even by a hint, for the final incident
involving <span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span> and <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span> is perhaps the most negative character
(even more than <span class=SpellE>Manikkam</span>) in the novel. And when the
narrative opens with an account of <span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span>, the
reader is misled into expecting that <span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span> would
figure prominently in the tale to follow. Barring the occasions when <span
class=SpellE>Saroja</span> went on her bicycle to buy sweets from him or when
she was shown his anatomy without embarrassment to either-because it was “ordinary
and natural” (p. 43) – he never enters the narrative even edgewise. So the
final scene appears rather crude, inartistic and indeed unwarranted. It only
shows an unwillingness of the author to let go an opportunity of referring to sex.
One is in the danger of being called prudish for saying so. Yet in the works of
some other writers where sex is used freely, as in Updike or Murdock, the
writer is seen trying to integrate it into whatever scheme of values he is <span
class=SpellE>endeavouring</span> to uphold. There is no such artistic
integration here. <span class=SpellE>Saroja</span> rejects the way of life and
values chosen and pursued by <span class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> and accept the
traditional values upheld by Aunt <span class=SpellE>Alamelu</span>. The final
encounter does not add to this impression. For the rest the novel looks more
like an exercise in genteel sensationalism, and there appears to be no
co-ordination between the title and the theme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> is described (on the blurb of the book) as
rebelling against and breaking away from “the constrictions of village life,”
giving the impression that village life as such is ‘constricting.’ <span
class=SpellE>Saroja</span> too has been surrounded by the same atmosphere, same
life and values, but she never felt cooped up: on the contrary, after her
experiences in the city, she was only too eager to return to the green fields,
spaces and the buffalo and so on. She is completely at home in this world, as <span
class=SpellE>Lalitha</span> could never be. Obviously it is <span class=SpellE>Lalitha’s</span>
temperament which was impatient for the surface glitter of city life and
sophistication, and ‘restraints’ or ‘freedoms’ of rural life, or even the
traditional values <span class=SpellE>practised</span> by the middle class
households, have had no major impact on the progress of action or in the
shaping of the events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
intense <span class=SpellE>generalisation</span> the author indulges in, on the
level of time and locale and moral codes suggests that it could be typical
experience that is being narrated or recorded. The author knows that such is
not the case, and yet encourages the non-Indian reader to see the usual
so-called “world-wide” phenomenon operating in the locale the author had
chosen. If only she had cared to individualize the characters she might have
shown the tale for what it <span class=GramE>is,</span> a local,
inconsequential tale with a moral at the end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Moreover,
the novelist seems to be equally unsure of her language. Was she writing this
for the non-Indian reader? If so, many native terms like ‘<span class=SpellE>davani</span>’
(p. 129) and ‘tope’ ( p. 167) would not mean anything, and may, like “Mysore <span
class=SpellE><i>pak</i></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>”<i> </i></span>(p.
83) –­but, “Bombay <span class=SpellE><i>hulva</i></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>”<i> </i></span>(p. 102) – (with its queer <span
class=SpellE>italicising</span>), easily confuse the reader. Is it addressed to
the Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span> reader? We notice then that
characters like Aunt <span class=SpellE>Alamelu</span> and <span class=SpellE>Amma</span>
not only speak in English (a necessity in an Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span>
novel), but they use such English idioms and <span class=SpellE>cliches</span>
as would he beyond the normal comprehension of tradition-ridden and illiterate
village women (‘basilisk’, p. 47; ‘<span class=SpellE>chokra</span>’, p 58; and
some conceptual usages that figure in their conversation; pp. 94, 136, 158,
180).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus,
despite certain topicality of the theme, the novel fails to convince on the
artistic plane, and it lacks authenticity of expression and character.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>The other novel, <i>The Nowhere Man,</i><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>is more forceful, and brings a fresh outlook
to the immigrant problem. In addition, the few faults in the construction could
be glossed over because basically the novel is a grim comedy. <i>Two Virgins </i>fails
where one would expect it normally to succeed, and throws up the weaknesses in
the artistry of the writer. Surely one could expect a better performance from a
writer in her eighth book!</p>

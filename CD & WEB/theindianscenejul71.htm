<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the last three months the Indian Scene was dominated by the inhuman tragedy
enacted by the military junta of Pakistan in Bangla Desh and the large influx
of refugees which it brought into the country. What started as an internal
problem of Pakistan has become much more of an internal problem for India and
so far the Government has not been able to find an effective solution for it. A
situation is developing in which, unless the Government is prepared to take
some unilateral action of a drastic character, it will have to reconcile itself
to living with the problem as it did all these twenty-three years when faced by
an identical problem. The influx of refugees from Pakistan is not a new
phenomenon, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the influx today brings consequences of a most serious character. It is not
only sudden but also unprecedented in scale. In the early days of April it was
only fifty thousand but gradually it increased and it stands at nearly seven
millions today. There is nothing to indicate that it will stop at this figure.
It is now more than clear that it is the deliberate policy of the Pakistan
Government to utilise the present opportunity to expel from Bangla Desh all the
Hindus–numbering ten millions–and those Muslims who are in active sympathy with
the cause of autonomy and independence. It will not be a surprise if in another
four or five months the number of refugees swells to twelve millions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is sure in the first place to bring economic ruin to India. She is a poor
country struggling to bring about some kind of economic growth. She is already
faced with the presence of twenty million unemployed of whom two millions
belong to the educated categories. There is no doubt whatever that her economy
will be completely disrupted if she has to provide continuous relief to the
millions of refugees now flowing from Pakistan. It is estimated that each
refugee costs two rupees a day. There are as yet no signs of other countries or
international agencies coming to the rescue of India on a substantial scale.
She alone has to bear the brunt of the burden.</span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
this is not the most serious consequence arising from the refugee influx. More
serious are the administrative and political consequences. In the sensitive
State of West Bengal it has led to the intensification of the problem of law
and order which has already been acute there. Administration has completely
broken down. An elected ministry found impossible to cope with this situation
and resigned. The state has come under President’s rule. Now that the
Government has decided on dispersing the refugees among other states similar
situations are sure to arise in them. The Naxalites have been a source of
trouble in West Bengal for several years. They are now in a position to secure
a large number of recruits from the refugees and their capacity to foment
disorder and violence and to strengthen the revolutionary forces will increase.
It is also possible that the influx of Muslim refugees into Assam, Tripura, and
Manipur will upset the balance between Hindus and Muslims and become a source
of communal tension. We should also note that among the refugees there are
several Pakistani spies and saboteurs. Some Indian politicians have already
been found to be in league with them. They will serve as fifth columnists and
pose a threat to the security of the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only solution to this problem which has brought such serious consequences in
its train is to send back the refugees to Bangla Desh. Is the Government<i> </i>in
a position to do this? So far there is nothing to indicate that the Government
is in such a position. Let us see how it has looked at the problems all these
months and on what lines it is thinking of solving it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Government
has been telling the public that the stay of the refugees is a temporary one
and that it is determined to send them back. Till recently it told the public
that within six months this could be achieved. But now the Prime Minister and
the other persons occupying responsible positions have stopped all reference to
a time limit. They are now saying that though the refugees will be sent back
they will not be sent back to be butchered by the Pakistani armies. The
implication of this view is that it is only when Yahya Khan’s military regime
comes to an end and a democratic and secular government guaranteeing equal
rights of citizenship to both Muslims and Hindus comes into existence that they
will be sent back. It is only then that the refugees will be willing to return.
The question therefore is whether in the foreseeable future there is any
likelihood of the military regime coming to an end in Bangla Desh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
does not look so. Pakistan is from the military point of view much stronger
today than she was when the civil war began in the last week of March. The army
which then stood at 40,000 is now 1.00,000 strong. Besides these regulars there
ate the para-military troops numbering 80,000. More than 10,000 Chinese
well-trained in guerilla warfare are helping them. More Chinese will come if
the situation demands it. It is no doubt true that freedom-fighters have been
putting up a heroic fight but there is no possibility of an untrained and
unarmed people continuing the fight for long. All those who could have supplied
leadership to them–lawyers, doctors, teachers, and other professionals among
the intellectuals have fled to India. Those who remained have </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>been
murdered There is very little territory under the effective control of the
Bangla Desh Government and it is not in a position </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
co-ordinate the activities of the freedom-fighters in different regions. In
this situation there is no near prospect of the military regime collapsing and
of its being replaced by a democratic regime which can inspire confidence among
the refugees and make them willing to return to their homes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has all along been a part of the belief of the Government of India that through
diplomacy it will be able to induce some of the world powers to bring pressure
on the Government of Yahya Khan to restore democratic rule in Bangla Desh. It
was with this view that it sent emissaries to various foreign countries but
these have returned practically with empty hands. Other countries are prepared
to extend relief to some extent to the refugees on humanitarian grounds but
very few of them have undertaken to bring any political pressure on the
Government of Pakistan, the kind of pressure advocated by India. It is true
that as our emissaries are never tired of repeating, the governments abroad
have a better understanding of the situation in Bangla Desh and a better
appreciation of India’s stand in relation to it, especially of the restraint
she chose to impose on herself. But one of them is prepared to go further than
this. What is needed to set things right in Bangla Desh is not understanding
and appreciation but action which will compel Pakistan to abandon its policy of
deliberate genocide and come to a political settlement with Mujibur Rehman and
his Awami League. No government has so far taken action in this direction. On
the other hand very many of them continue to give economic and military aid to
Pakistan’s military Government. All of them agree that what is needed is a
political settlement but no one is prepared to take any measures to bring it
about. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is nothing surprising in this. The world is dominated
by the super-powers–the United States and the U. S. S. R. and most of the other
countries are their satellites. Neither of the super-powers is in favour of the
breakup of Pakistan or of its becoming politically and militarily weak. It is a
part of their political creed that in the sub-continent a balance should be
maintained between India and Pakistan. This is the reason why all along they
have been extending economic and military aid to Pakistan and they do not want
to stop it because they are afraid that such a policy would strengthen India
and raise her to the status of a great power and enable her to play a
significant role in international politics. This is why even after assurances
have been given to our external affairs minister, the United States has been
sending economic and military aid to Pakistan. U. S. S. R. also has not
modified her policy in this respect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
should have noted that this has always been the policy of the so-called great
powers in the history of modern world–of England, France, Germany, etc., in the
past–and of U.S.A., U.S.S.R. and China today. They are great because they have
the military, the economic and the political strength to create tensions where
they do not already exist or intensify them where they exist. They have never
been found interested in easing them. If tensions do not exist they will have
no role to play. Korea, Indo-China and West Asia have become the areas of
tension mainly because of the policies of<i> </i>the two great powers of today.
Tension between India and Pakistan is welcome to them. It supplies the
nourishing food which they always want. There is no basis for the naïve belief
to which the Government of India is a victim that they will, through her
diplomatic persuasion, do something effective to bring out the right kind of
political settlement in Bangla Desh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Muslim powers in the world are behind Pakistan. Some of them like Saudi
Arabia have extended substantial economic aid to her. Iran and Turkey are her
allies in the CENTO. Some of the military aid which America wants to give to
Pakistan is being routed through these countries. In spite of the determined
efforts of the Indian delegates, the Afro-Asian Unity Conference recently held
was not prepared to condemn Pakistan’s policies. The attitude of Indonesia and
Malaysia continues to be pro-Pakistan.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not only in respect of individual countries that the diplomacy of India has
failed but also in its attempt to involve the U. N. O. in the matter. The
International Organisation should have taken action to put a stop to genocide
under the articles of its Charter. But nothing of the sort happened. Even
U-Thant, the Secretary-General, has not thought it appropriate to take any
initia</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:

has not been stirred. All that it is prepared to do is to extend some </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is because Yahya Khan knows that India is completely isolated and that he will
continue to get aid from other powers that he emboldened himself to announce
the kind of political settlemenf for which he is prepared. He is determined to
continue martial law. A new Constitution will not be framed as previously
announced by the elected National Assembly but by a committee of experts
nominated by him. The Awami Leaguers elected to the Assembly will not be
allowed to take their seats. By-elections will be held to fill their places.
Even then it is not known what kind of Civilian Government will be finally set
up. It is however clear that it won’t be the kind of democratic and secular
government which will induce the refugees to return. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
then is the way out for India? She has only two alternatives. One is to
reconcile herself to the present situation, absorb the millions of refugees and
rehabilitate them whatever be its cost in economic, administrative and
political terms. The other is to take unilateral action of a drastic character
irrespective of world opinion and the attitude of the great powers and create
the democratic and secular government which will inspire sufficient confidence
among the refugees and induce them to return. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first of these alternatives will amount to a confession of her weakness and be
inconsistent with her self-respect. The people of the country will lose all
confidence in the present Government and it will further strengthen the view
that India has no independent foreign policy of her own, and that the so-called
policy of non-alignment is really one of alignment with both the great powers.
No section of the public in the country–the debates in Parliament have shown
this–will support the Government if it chooses to follow the first alternative.
Such a course becomes all the more ludicrous when Government thinks that by
sending millions of refugees into India, Pakistan has committed an act of
aggression against her. No country keeps quiet when it is subject to aggression
by a neighbour. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

analysis makes clear that the only sound policy for the Government is to accept
the second alternative and put it into effect. This is what Shri Jaya Prakash
Narayan advises the Government to do. He is no war-monger and if there is any
one sincere and real lover of peace, it is he and no other. After five weeks of
visits to all the important world capitals he has come to the conclusion: “Let
this be clearly understood in this country that the great powers are all
anxious to preserve the <i>status quo </i>in terms of the balance of power
already established in the world. Some of them are particularly keen to
preserve the balance in South Asia which has been created by them through a
deliberate policy of neutralising India by bolstering up Pakistan.” He said he
found no evidence anywhere that anyone was prepared to pull the chestnuts out
of the fire for us and that all the political, social and economic burdens
should be borne by India alone. He advocated the immediate recognition of<i> </i>Bangla
Desh by India and felt that if India did so some other countries would follow
her. He emphasized the need for unilateral action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
similar view was expressed by Sri J. B. Kripalani. He even went a step further
and said,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“If neither the U. N. nor the
big powers intervene, will India allow her national life to be disorganised by
the action of Pakistan without the latter firing a shot? Even if India has to
go down it is better to have fought and lost than never to have fought for
causes we cherish and the nation we love. Let us realise that we are already at
war with Pakistan in which it is the aggressor.” It is only when there is a </span><span

war that the great powers will actively interest themselves in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>finding

not a war-monger. He is a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi and one who understands
best his philosophy of <i>Ahimsa</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

some of their recent utterances the Prime Minister, the Minister for External
Affairs, the Defence Minister and several other persons occupying responsible
positions seem to share views similar to those of Jaya Prakash and Kripalani.
Addressing an All-India Congress Seva Dal camp on June 29, the Prime Minister
said </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>that India could not regard the developments in Bangla Desh
as an internal problem of Pakistan, irrespective of what the world’s comity of
nations thought. She explained that even big powers were afraid that if they
extended support to the freedom-fighters of Bangla Desh they might have to face
similar situations in their countries and said that whatever might be their
attitude we must find a solution ourselves for the problem of refugees and that
at an early date. This is a clear recognition; though a little belated of the
need for unilateral action. Both Swaran Singh and Jagjivan Ram expressed
similar views. Dinesh Singh, a former minister of external affairs, warned the
Government that a situation might be forced on India to go to war, according to
the time chosen by Pakistan. He asked</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

allowed to happen?” He further observed that Pakistan must be taught that
settling issues militarily was not always a paying proposition.</span><span

is thus clear that something like military intervention is absolutely necessary
if a real democratic government is to be established in Bangla Desh and if the
problem of refugees with which we are faced is to be solved. It is for the
Government to decide what form this military intervention should take. It may
take initially the form of training and arming the able-bodied refugees and
sending them to Bangla Desh to carry on the war against Pakistani forces. If
this fails other steps may become necessary. In all this the co-operation of
the intellectuals of Bangla Desh now in India should be enlisted. Everything should
be done through their </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

students of public affairs have frequently pointed out that defections are the
outcome of the low standard of political morality prevailing in the country.
People hanker after power not because they want to use it for promoting
people’s welfare but because it enables them to get rich or become influential
at the expense of the public. If as members of one party they are unable to
realise their selfish objectives they defect to some other party which enables
them to get what they want. They have no scruples in a matter like this, though
they know too well that all this brings about instability and an increase in
public expenditure. To satisfy the defectors and keep them under control the
number of ministerships, deputy ministerships and other political offices is
unnecessarily increased or sinecure jobs are created involving a wastage of
public funds. This is what democratic politics means in almost every state and
though several measures have been proposed to put a stop to defections nothing
has so far been done to give legislative shape to them. A Bill has now been
prepared and it may be placed before Parliament but it is not thorough-going
enough to put a stop to the evil. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
phenomenon of defections is only one aspect of the wide-spread corruption which
prevails in the country in all departments of public and private life. The
Vigilance Commissions have drawn attention to this. Debates on this have taken
place in Parliament and State Legislatures. These have revealed that Chief
Ministers, Central Ministers, officials entrusted with the management of public
sector industries, highly placed officials in Railways and other undertakings
are all involved in cases of corruption. But no one has so far been able to
suggest ways and means for eradicating or even mitigating it. Some of the
banking institutions have recently been affected by it and this, unless checked
in the bud, is sure to produce worse evils. It is against this wider background
of corruption that the phenomenon of defections should be considered.

from defections the political instability in states is due to the intrigues of
the party in power at the Centre. It is against </span><span style='font-size:

forming governments in states. Wielding as it does a large amount of economic
and social power and holding as it does very many strings of patronage, it is
in a position to topple state governments which are coalitionist in character
and in which it has no share. It is this that has been responsible for the fall
of ministries in U. P. and Bihar to a great extent. Its influence has also been
felt in Gujarat and elsewhere. In the old despotic regimes ambitious persons
who wanted to become kings, sultans and nawabs kept on intriguing against those
in authority. But intrigues today are better organised and better financed.
They are therefore more effective. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have a federal system of government and if it is to work satisfactorily the
Centre should interfere as little as possible in state affairs. It is then only
that states will enjoy real autonomy. It is unfortunate that the Rajamannar
Committee, which speaks so eloquently of the need for granting more powers and
more autonomy to states, has not considered this aspect. Whatever autonomy the
Constitution gives to a state will cease to be real if the Centre has power to
make and unmake ministries. It will mean one-party government over the whole
country. Federalism ceased to function in the Nehru Era when the same party
ruled at the Centre and the States. In countries like Soviet Russia which are
federal in theory, a unitary system is what is functioning in practice because
of the dominance of the one Communist party One party-system–whether its basis
is theory or practice–is inconsistent with federalism. This is how the
advocates of State autonomy should look at the attempts of the party in power
at the Centre to topple governments in states.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

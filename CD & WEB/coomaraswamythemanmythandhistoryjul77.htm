biographical “curiosity” in his avowed intention to be “nothing”. And yet this

spiritual man, keenly aware of an that is implied in Plotinus’ “Flight of the

those who knew him as a student remarked on a nature combining superiority with
remoteness: “He is head and shoulders above his fellows both literally and
figuratively,” wrote the Wycliffe College class report; while Coomaraswamy
shunned social activity at the University of London to a degree that made a
fellow student reflect, “Perhaps he could say with Erasmus that he was least
alone when most alone; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nunquam minus solus

we met him for the first time at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in February,
1946, where he was giving a lecture called “The Conception of Immortality in
Buddhism”, the effect was that of beholding a rare personage of commanding
authority step in from a distant past whose wisdom he embodied along with a
searing vision of the foibles underlying this modern civilization which he had
intruded upon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the Singam volume we mentioned certain peculiar similarities between the Doctor
and Rene Guenon, whom we met later that same year in Cairo, and how the two men
in reality personified complementary poles of a single function. Our first
encounter, with the French metaphysician was a particularly disconcerting
experience, as this austere yet benevolent figure was two-fold more ungraspable
and remote than we had found Coomaraswamy himself: the Rene Guenon whose
writings we had avidly been assimilating was to all appearances quite simply
not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>there. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

tirelessly proclaimed the doctrine of the “two selves” or “minds” <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>(duo sunt in homine), </i>and certainly both
he and Guenon had their human side. Not only was the Doctor’s erudition on a
purely human plane staggering in its combination of scope, depth, and
universality, with a literary style to match, but he was also a skilled
polemicist, a brilliant conversationalist and a man of unfailing generosity
towards aspiring students and all who turned to him for help through
correspondence–just to mention several examples. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Guenon lacked in breadth the other’s erudition, he appeared to come on the
scene with an inborn knowledge of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>metaphysical
and cosmological principles, and it was this vision of fundamental truths which
gave the ultimate polarization to Coomaraswamy’s own learning. It also had the
unfortunate drawback of making Guenon somewhat slipshod in scholarship; his
certitude about principles lent a false sense of security on the factual level,
where a little research would have sufficed to protect him from the barbs of orientalists
who, if incognizant of metaphysical and spiritual truths, had at least done
their homework. It is here that Coomaraswamy’s erudition more than once came to
the other’s rescue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Where
Guenon was uncannily well documented on the human plane was in the realm of the
occult in all its ramifications: he seemed to have antennae reaching everywhere.
He, too, had a ready pen for polemics, and he, too, was painstaking in his
correspondence; for the rest, he was a devoted family man. Yet such was his anonymity
that an admirer of his writings was dumbfounded to discover upon his death that
the venerable next-door neighbour whom she had known for years as Sheikh Abdel
Wahed Yahya was in reality Rene Guenon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

least important thing about Guenon is his personality,” wrote Coomaraswamy. “The
fact is that he has the invisibility that is proper to the complete
philosopher: our teleology can only be fulfilled when we really become no one.”
As for himself, the Doctor insisted: “I must explain that I am not at al
interested in biographical matter relating to myself and that I consider the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>modern </i>practice of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>publishing details about lives and personalities of<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>well known men is nothing but a vulgar catering
to illegitimate curiosity...All this is not a matter of ‘modesty’ but one of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principle</i>”–a principle that left him indifferent
to the copyright of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>his own works,
concerning which he once told us: “I shall feel happy if my writings have really
been of help to four or five people...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“principle”, as we shall see, went very far. The individual human plane for
both these men was virtually valueless, being for them equitable with the world
of phenomena, impermanence and change. It belonged to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Myth of the Eternal Return, </i>Mircea
Eliade demonstrates how ancient man saw Reality as an unending recurrence of<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>archetypal paradigms played out<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>in the cosmos; history for traditional
humanity was identified with accident, suffering, punishment for sin (namely,
transgression from the archetypal norms), and in general, incongruity and
meaninglessness. Coomaraswamy went a step farther; for him <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>as theorist </i>“history” in the measure possible surely existed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
need not read far in his works to catch the refrain: “there is no ‘I’ that acts
or inherits” <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>(Samyutta-Nikaya); </i>“our Ego
in fact is nothing but a name for what is really only a sequence of observed
behaviours”; “things that are not immutable, are not at all” (St. Augustine); “what
we call our ‘consciousness’ is nothing but a process”; “the kingdom of heaven
is for none but the thoroughly dead” (Eckhart); “no man hath ascended up to
heaven, but he that came down from heaven” (St. John); “man’s last end is to be
‘as free as the Godhead in its non-existence’.” (Eckhart) Now these and similar
statements are elliptical ways of expressing the discontinuity between the
Divine Essence and its created accidents. But as Frithjof Schuon stipulates,
there is not only the Transcendent Essence, there is also the Immanent
Substance which runs continuously throughout the various levels of Reality and
planes of Being, otherwise there could be no manifestation at all, nor any
worlds. Coomaraswamy in fact knew this, as is proven in the answer he gave to a
question we put to him on why the Absolute manifests: “Not that the One is two,”
he replied, citing Hermes, “but that these two are one.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yet
in practice he expounded an utter dichotomy between temporal individuality and
the Immortal Self: “An immortality of ‘this man, so-and-so’ is inconceivable
... However strange and repugnant the denial of the reality of individuality
may be ...the truth is that neither the whole nor any part of the composite psycho-physical
personality is my Self ... Throughout the Bible, the word ‘soul’ <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>(nefes, psyche, anima) </i>refers to that
psycho-physical animal life that returns to the dust when ‘the spirit returns to
God who gave it’, when we ‘give up the [Holy] Ghost’.” Were this to be taken to
the letter, then the bodily translation of such as Enoch and Elias, Christ and
the Virgin Mary into Heaven would have been inconceivable, not to mention the dogma
of the resurrection of the body.” Schuon makes what should be the obvious
point, that souls in Paradise do not lose their identities: while the Buddha,
Krishna and Christ are all manifestations of the one Logos, they do not for
that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in divinis </i>lose their separate
historical selfhoods as the Buddha, Krishna and Christ. Man, after all,
according to scripture was created deiform. And here again Coomaraswamy proves
by a passage in his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hinduism</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Buddhism</i>
that he understands this perspective, where he says that the saved are in a
state of “distinction without difference” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bhedabheda</i>)
or what Eckhart means by “fused but not confused.” The Absolute is not only
unique, it is also infinite. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
returning to history: so intent was Coomaraswamy on demonstrating the
pre-eminent reality of mythological truths over purely historical facts that he
could be led to write, for example, in his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Rigveda as Land-Nama-Bok: </i>“Now, so far as I know, it has never been
propounded by any scholar, however historically minded, that the voyage of
Manu, or for that matter, Noah’s represents the legendary memory of an
historical migration,”–when in truth if no scholar has propounded this, which
is not actually the case, it is because the self-evident needs no propounding!
Or again: “That Exodus is a creation myth, rather than an historical event is,
of course, the Qabbalistic point of view,”–when in fact for the Qabbalah the
one interpretation in nowise excludes the other, and this is even confirmed by
Coomaraswamy himself, where he writes beautifully elsewhere of Myth as “the penultimate
truth, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of which all experience is the
temporal reflection</i>” (italics ours). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since
the Buddha, Krishna, and Christ have been mentioned, it is interesting to see
what the Doctor maintains about their historicity. The life of the first, he
says in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gotama the Buddha, </i>“can be
regarded as historical or simply as a myth in which the nature and acts of the
Vedic deities Agni and Indra have been more or less plausibly euhemerized...The
writer is inclined to the mythical interpretation.” The reference to the second
comes in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hinduism and Buddhism </i>where
he speaks of “the pseudo-historical Krishna and Arjuna,” which “are to be
identified with the mythical Agni and Indra.” Lastly, he writes to a Harvard
professor in a letter dated July 10, 1942: “I am not convinced of the
historicity of either Christ or Buddha.” When we brought up this latter point
to Rama Coomaraswamy, he replied, “My father was much too intelligent not to
believe in the historical Jesus, and he would have explained the remark in this
letter as being a reaction from fighting all his life against the prevailing
tendency to humanize everything sacred and to belitte mythology as nothing more
than the superstitions of primitive peoples.” In his appreciation of Guenon, for
example, entitled “Eastern Wisdom and Western Knowledge,” the Doctor wrote: “For
the Hindu, the events of the Rigveda are, however, dateless, and the Krishna
Lila ‘not an historical event’; and the reliance of Christianity upon
supposedly historical ‘facts’ seems to be its greatest weakness.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the special issue of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Etudes Traditionnelles
</i>dedicated to Rene Guenon that appeared in 1951, the year of his death, Schuon
contributed an article called “L’Oeuvrel” (“The Work”), where he wrote: “If on
the doctrinal plane the Guenonian work has a stamp of unicity, it may not be
useless to point out that this is owing not to a more or less ‘prophetic’
nature–a supposition that is excluded, and which Guenon himself had already
rejected beforehand–but to an exceptional cyclical conjuncture whose temporal
aspect is this ‘end of a world’ in which we live, and whose spatial aspect is–by
the same token–the forced convergence of civilizations.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now
the characteristics of this latter-day society are individualism, libertinism,
narcissism, relativism, and in general, “divorce from any principle,” to use
Coomaraswamy’s own words for it. He and Guenon accordingly had the providential
role to remind the world once again, “in a way that may be ignored but cannot be
refuted” as the former puts it, of first principles, and to restore the sense
of the Absolute. And this they did with an uncompromising rigour, meticulous in
its precision, that baffles minds untrained to think in certitudes. Guenon’s
metaphysical exposition is so crystalline and geometric, so mathematically
abstract and devoid of almost any human element, that Schuon once used the image
to describe this phenomenon as practically that of “an eye without a body,”
namely, principle divorced from any psychic substance–to reverse the metaphor
cited just above. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yet
alchemically speaking, the reading of these two authors (not to mention Schuon,
who is a whole other dimension again, the psychic sphere being fully integrated
with all the rest) work just the necessary therapeutic corrective to minds
corrupted by the intellectual anarchy of “our sentimental generation” (Coomaraswamy);
and though these writings are capable of engendering metaphysical pretension and
spiritual pride in persons of little understanding, nevertheless for the
serious and receptive reader they can open a vista onto the Sacred which
overwhelms all else and reinstates him with a true hierarchy of values. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mention was made of prophecy, we will at the risk of misunderstandings venture
a few observations on the subject. While it is true that we live in a time when
prophets no longer walk the earth, all the major religions notwithstanding
teach that certain central prophetical functions attaching to them must remanifest
at the end of time, and surely this can operate in varying degrees and
modalities. Moreover, a prophetic functions like that of Melchizedek or Elias
which is timeless will by definition always be present–even if not able to
descend in prophetic form. We see no satisfactory way to resolve those
undeniable ambiguities marginally attaching to the otherwise exceptional witness
of the two men under study save by proposing that they both, while not of
prophetic substance, did nonetheless vehicle elements of a prophetic message,
being spokesmen for what Leo Schaya calls the Eliatic current. “Spokesmen” is
the correct word for it, as theirs was an active role, the intensity of their
intellectual powers betokening none of that psychic passivity which goes with
mere mediumship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the same time, the fact that they were almost “obsessed” with the compulsion
never to say anything on their own goes with Philo’s definition of a prophet as
being someone who “speaks nothing of his own”. They must have felt they had a
calling which was disproportionate to what they considered were the limits of
their human capacities, which would explain this reticence to talk about
themselves, as also their insistence on the discontinuity between the “merely”
human plane and the Supernal Truth. Something approaching a scission in their
two natures or selves might account for the way in which they relativized even
the concept of human salvation, that of the individual soul: “Paradise is still
but a prison,” Guenon would say, citing a Sufic adage more striking for its
Semitic hyperbole than for its spiritual propriety. Had they been fully
integrated prophets, not only would this have been disproportionate considering
the function for which they were born, it also would have prevented them from
plunging into the academic and occult milieus which they had to know inside and
out in order to accomplish the testimony it was theirs to deliver. And had they
been simply geniuses in metaphysics and mythology, then how to reconcile this
with that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other </i>dimension, which is
not just of our century, especially when Coomaraswamy insisted with St. Paul
that “God has never nor anywhere left himself without a witness,” albeit in a
world that will not be persuaded–as he concords with St. Luke – “though one rose
from the dead”? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

considerations brought up in this paper remind us by analogy of the two
witnesses “clothed in sackcloth” as described in the Apocalypse (Ch. XI), who
are traditionally associated with Enoch and Elias. The sackcloth could refer to
the impoverishment of the human receptacles in their veil of anonymity, this
anonymity that struck Schuon to write of Guenon in the article already cited: “The
man seemed unaware of his genius, just as inversely, the genius seemed unaware
of the man,” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

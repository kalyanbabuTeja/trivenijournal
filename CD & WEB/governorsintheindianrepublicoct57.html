<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
position of the Governor of a State in the Indian polity has been a subject of
much controversy almost since the inception of the office. There are some who
adopt the language of ridicule and sarcasm and others of bitter criticism.
Different opinions have been expressed on the office of the Governor. Certain
individuals and parties advocate total abolition of the Governorship. As early
as 1947, Principal Sreeman Narain Agarwal stated that “there is no necessity
for a Governor” and the P. S. P. holds a similar view today. There are some who
stand for the retention of the Governor’s office, but advocate certain changes;
and others are satisfied with the present constitutional position of the
Governor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
suggestion for the abolition of the post of the Governor is primarily based on
economic considerations. Under the new Constitution, a Governor is paid Rs.
5,500 per mensem. In addition to this he is paid an allowance of Rs. 1,600 on
appointment, to purchase clothes; Rs. 70,000 at the time of appointment, for
furnishing the Raj Bhavan; and Rs. 4,92,900 per annum, to meet the expenses
over his residence, tours etc. All this is considered to be avoidable
expenditure. The force of the argument lies in the fact that so much amount is
spent on an individual whose presence is not required and that the
administration does not suffer by his absence. Under the new Constitution the
Governor is a nominal executive and so it is argued that it is not right to
spend such large sums over an individual whose business is to say ‘yes’ to what
the Cabinet says. It was said of the French Presidency that it was “an office
with the sole virtue of impotence. Its incumbent must neither act nor think.”
The same is said to be the case with a Governor. Sri Sri Prakasa when he was
the Governor of Madras once remarked, “Nobody cares for Governors. While
Governors under the British regime said ‘yes’ or ‘no’ with authority, in the present
set-up of constitutional Governorship, what can poor Governors say?” In a more
pungent tone Sri J. B. Kripalani remarked, “After the advent </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
democracy, the one person most ridiculous is the Governor. He has no power to
govern his own actions. Any speech he has to make anywhere has to be approved
by his Chief Minister...What are the functions of the Governor then? These
include opening of girls’ schools, hotels, cinemas and sometimes even sweetmeat
shops.” As the Governor’s post is thus a costly superfluity, the sooner it is
abolished the better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are others who stand for the retention of the Governor’s post, but advocate
certain changes in its nature. Serious objection is raised against the present
system of choice of the Governor. The method of nomination is the very negation
of democracy and deprives the people of the democratic freedom of
self-expression. Elections are considered as the life breath of democracy and
their absence its demise. The upholders of this view take their inspiration from
the system that prevails in the U. S. A. The Governor of a State in the U. S.
A. is elected by the people of the State. It is further argued that the
appointment of the Governor by the President of India cuts short the autonomy
of the States and goes against the principle of State autonomy. On this ground
it is further pointed out that the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Governor of a State
must belong to that State. A more </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>considerate view about
the appointment of the Governor is that the President of India should appoint
the person that is elected by the Legislature of the State. This method will
have the double advantage of introducing the democratic procedure, while
preserving the bond of unity between the Centre and the States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the attack on the Governorship is primarily based on economic grounds, an odd
suggestion is made for honorary Governors by Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya,
ex-Governor of Madhya Pradesh. Today in every branch of administration there
are honorary officers in responsible posts. In local administration, the
Chairman of a Municipality is not paid. In judicial administration, there are
honorary magistrates. The President of a Co-operative Bank or Co-operative
Stores holds an honorary post. In all these cases public spirit and integrity
count more than monetary considerations and those occupying the honorary posts
have established a noble tradition in public service and honesty. The system of
honorary Governors may also prove a success, if men of integrity and public
spirit are chosen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
study of the proposals for a change in the position of the Governor shows that
they are unsound in theory and unworkable in practice. The economic factor
looms large in the criticism levelled against the Governor. Sound political
conclusions can hardly be drawn by judging institutions in terms of rupees and
naya paise. If monetary considerations alone are to be the guide in determining
political institutions, democracy itself has to be given up, for of all systems
of government it is the costliest. India’s first General Election cost Rs.
10,40,00,000. Every member of Parliament is paid Rs. 40 per day when the
Parliament is in session besides the travelling allowances. Compared with such
expenditure, the salary of a Governor, Rs. 5,500, pales into </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>insignificance.
In fact the Governors of several States have </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>voluntarily cut
their salaries and Mr. C. M. Trivedi, ex-Governor of Andhra Pradesh, was
drawing only Rs. 1,530 per mensem. However, in a country like India, where
there is devastating poverty, it would be a sound economic principle to fix the
maximum salary of an individual at Rs. 1,000 per mensem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
critics of the Governor who describe him as a figure-head view that office with
a jaundiced eye. Viewed in the right perspective, the Governor, far from being
a “sleeping partner”, acts as a balance wheel of the State Government. Under
the new Constitution he is a factor to be reckoned in administrative,
legislative and financial matters. All executive action of the Government of a
State is to be conducted in the name of the Governor. He appoints the Chief
Minister, and other Ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister. He is
empowered to lay down rules for the convenient transaction of business and for
the allocation of business among Ministers. It is the duty of the Chief
Minister to furnish to the Governor all information relating to administration
and proposals for legislation. According to the letter of the Constitution the
Governor is vested with supreme legislative powers. He has a right to address
the legislature and send messages to it. He possesses the triple legislative
powers of assent, dissent and reservation of bills. Any bill can be entered in
the statute book only on receipt of his assent. In financial matters also the
powers of the Governor are worthy of note. He causes the Annual Financial
Statement showing the receipts and expendi</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ture to be placed
before the legislature of the State. Every </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>demand for a grant
must be made only on his recommendation. Like any other Head of a State, the
Governor has the privilege to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions
of punishments. Above all, he occupies a unique position as a co-ordinating
agency between the Centre and the States. The Governor under the British rule
was a benevolent despot and the Governor of today is the constitutional Head of
the State. Today he is not expected to override the Ministers, but as the
highest dignitary in the State, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he can advise and
admonish the Cabinet. He can exercise influence, though not power. As Gandhiji
remarked, the Governors will be in a position to exercise “all-pervading moral
influence.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
working of the Constitution during the last seven years has proved the
significance of the Governor in the administration of a State. In times of
political instability the Governor acted as a great stabilising factor. Certain
States like the Punjab and Kerala have become problem States and the smooth
working of Government in those States has depended on the ability and tact of
the Governor. Today a problematic position has arisen by the formation of a
Communist Government in Kerala, and it is the ability and resourcefulness of
the Governor that go a long way in promoting understanding and harmony between
the State Government and the Centre. The fact that the wise counsels and wide
experience of Sri C. M. Trivedi contributed not a little to maintaining smooth
administration in the infant State of Andhra, is another instance to prove that
the Governor is not an ornamental figure-head. So on pragmatic considerations,
if not for any other reason, the retention of the Governorship has justifica</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Under
the parliamentary system of Government there is need for a nominal executive,
because the tenure of the real executive is not fixed. With the fall of the
Cabinet a vacuum will be created in the administrative field, in the absence of
the Governor. It is he who maintains continuity in administration and enables a
smooth change-over from the fall of one Cabinet to the establishment of
another. Due to this reason, in every country having the parliamentary system,
a nominal executive which provides stability for the Government, has been
established. The Governors in Australia and the Lieutenant Governors in Canada
are illustrative of this fact. There is no parliamentary federation without a
nominal executive corresponding to the Governor in an Indian State. Is it wise
to abolish an institution which is of a universal nature?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
need for a permanent executive like the Governor, is all the more necessary in
a parliamentary democracy having the multi-party system. Cabinet instability is
inescapable under the multi- or poly-party system, as is evident from the
history of France and some of the States in India like the Punjab, Kerala,
Andhra and Orissa. In view of the large size of the country and diverse interests
of the people, India may have in future the multi- party system. So there is a <i>prima
facie </i>need for an officer having experience and commanding popular respect,
to maintain continuity in administration. Moreover a high and experienced
dignitary is necessary in a parliamentary system of Government to form the
Cabinet. The formation of the Cabinet is “a work of great time, great labour
and great responsibility.” What Disraeli said a century ago holds good even
today. Under the two-party system, the choice of Ministers is made in a rather
mechanical way. But when no party commands an over-all majority in the
legislature, a man of great courage, tact and imagination is necessary for the
formation of a stable Cabinet. This can be well illustrated from what happened
in the Madras State in 1952 when the Congress party in the legislature faced
the formidable opposition of the United democratic Front led by the veteran
leader, the late Sri T. Prakasam. The choice of Sri C. Rajagopalachari as Chief
Minister by Sri Sri Prakasa, the then Governor of Madras, averted parliamentary
anarchy in the Madras State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Several
of the suggestions made for a change in the nature of the Governorship are
unsound in principle. One such is the proposal to have an elected Governor. Those
that make this proposal are led a way by the system that prevails in the U. S.
A. It would be inappropriate to imitate the American system, for while the U.
S. A. has a non-parliamentary executive, India has adopted the parliamentary
type. In the former the States have adopted the type of ‘strong’ Governor. In
some States even the budget is prepared by the Governor and in legislation “he
is hardly second to the legislature itself.” Quite different is the case in
India. The Governor of a State in India is expected to act on the advice of the
Council of Ministers. It would be sheer waste of money if the method of
election is adopted for the choice of a nominal executive. Politically also the
principle of election may prove injurious, for an elected Governor may become a
rival to the Cabinet. So the principle of election in the case of the Governor
will be economically a waste and politically it may prove dangerous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Constitution does not prevent the President of India from appointing a person
of a State as the Governor of<i> </i>that State. However, during the last
half-a-dozen years of the working of the Constitution, a very healthy
convention has been set up, of the appointment of a person belonging to one
State as the Governor of another State. This procedure helps a great deal in
preventing localism and promoting inter-state understanding. Moreover, the
Governor must establish a name for his detached and impartial outlook and this
will be possible only when an outsider is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
appointment of the Governor by the President is further criticised as an
encroachment on State autonomy. It is no exaggeration to say that arguments
like these are based on parochial considerations and ignore the wider interests
of the country. Localism and provincialism which led to disunity and division
in the country, have been the root causes for India’s enslavement in the past.
So the makers of the Indian Constitution took great care to curtail narrow
provincialism and preserve the unity of the country. It was with this object
that India was made a co-operative and not a competitive federation. Moreover,
in every country, due to the growth of international tensions, the trend is
towards vesting more and more powers in the Central Government and all
proposals for greater State autonomy go against the time spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

economic argument in the case of the Governor has taken curious turns and an
odd proposal like the appointment of honorary Governors, is made. The
protagonists of this view fail to realise that no responsible post can be
efficiently managed by an honorary officer. This was realised long ago in all
countries and consequently the system of payment to members of parliament came
into existence. The analogy of the Municipal Chairman is misleading for local
administration does not involve heavy responsibilities. But even in that
limited sphere, the need is felt for the appointment of a paid officer called
the Commissioner. So the idea of appointing honorary Governors is not
practicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

erroneous view about the Governor is that the pomp and pageantry connected with
his post will be an anomaly under the socialist pattern of society. A correct
understanding of the concept of equality requires a sense of proportion.
Equality has never been understood in any country to mean complete identity,
and even in Soviet Russia, the Head of the State does not live in the same way
as a factory labourer or a peasant. Moreover, with the growing international
contact and the visits of foreign dignitaries, the maintenance of an establishment
befitting the dignity of the Head of a State is indispensable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

abolition of the Governor’s post will necessitate the appointment of another
officer of a similar nature. What is taken away by the right hand has to be
replaced by the left. The storm of argumentation that raged in Britain over the
abolition of monarchy has calmed down, for the abolition will not make Britain
any more democratic than she is today. Nor will it result in any appreciable
saving of resources. Similar considerations lend support to the retention of
the Governor of a State in India. Though the present expenditure over the
Governor is inconsequential, any possible reduction in it should be welcome in
a poor country like India. While the dignity and status of the Governor have to
be maintained, pomp and splendour have to be severely cut down. Under the
socialist pattern of society, there should be no officer in the style of the
Grand Mughal. The maintenance of expensive establishments at different places
for the stay of the Governor during the different seasons, the expenditure over
addresses of welcome, and all kinds of pomp and pageantry, have to be
curtailed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

post of the Governor should not be an avenue for the party in power to favour
its own party men. The dignity and honour of the Head of the State can be
retained only when persons of high character, great mental calibre and
meritorious service are appointed. The Governor’s post should not be converted
into a coveted job for party men or an asylum for those defeated in elections.
It should be occupied by those who have earned a name for integrity and public
service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

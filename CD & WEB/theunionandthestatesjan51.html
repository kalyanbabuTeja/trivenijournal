the esteemed Editor of <i>Triveni </i>asked me to contribute an article on the
relations between the Union Centre and the State Units under our new
Constitution, I agreed to do so, though I realised that there may not be much
to say on the subject which had not already been said by many others. Our
Constitution is, an elaborate and complicated document, and education of the
public on its salient provisions cannot be said to be complete when only a
theoretical exposition of the bases of those relations has been attempted. The
progress of any country under a Constitution, even under a Constitution which
is a written and rigid one, cannot in actual practice be hamstringed by constitutional
provisions, however elaborately worded. Its practical working is bound to be
influenced by various developments, which arise from time to time in the course
of that working and which would help to clarify the wording of its provisions
or impart some special significance to them. The interpretation of disputed
points by the Supreme Court and the High Courts when references are made to
them would help further to extend their meaning and import. A national
emergency or an economic crisis may give a new complexion to the Centre-State
relations and give them a new shape. These possibilities need not be ruled out;
even a ready-made, rigid Constitution grows, or should grow, if it is to be an
instrument for national progress, as the American Constitution has been
growing. No constitution will be worth the paper on which it is written unless
it contains within itself the seeds for self-growth or self-liberalisation, and
after all any Constitution is made for the people and to subserve their need</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
Constitution can, on the whole, be described as being a Federal one, because
its predominant characteristic is the division of powers between the Union and
the States, though the separation of powers between the Legislature, the
Executive and the Judiciary is not clear-cut as it is in some other Federal
Constitutions. It has further been noted that our Constitution is a cross
between the British and the American Constitutions. While we have a President,
who is<i> </i>the Head of the State and in whom all authority in the State is
theoretically concentrated, it does not provide for his direct election by the
people, as under the American Constitution, nor can he function as the
undisputed Executive Head. It provides on the other hand for the Cabinet system
of Government of the British type. The President is elected by an indirect
process, the members of the Union Parliament and the members of the Legislative
Assemblies in the States sitting together, in accordance with the method of
proportional representation by single transferable vote, and holds office for
five years. He is not, like the American President, the sole authority to
select his Cabinet nor does he directly govern the country. In the discharge of
his day-to-day functions, he is merely the constitutional Head of the State,
acting on the advice of a Council of Ministers, of which the leader and head is
Prime Minister, who is the person commanding the largest measure of support in
Parliament. But at the same time, there are vested in him certain emergency
powers which he exercises in his discretion. Those powers are theoretically so
wide that he can apparently transform himself into a virtual autocrat. But then
the Constitution provides that the period for which any proclamation of an
emergency made by him shall be in force will not be more than two months.
During the pendency of the Proclamation, Parliament can enact legislation even
in respect of subjects in the States List, and he can issue directions to any
State in regard to the manner in which the Executive power is to be exercised.
As a measure of the principle inherent in it, it may also be mentioned that in
the discharge of its obligation for national Defence the Union is charged with
the duty of protecting the States against </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>external aggression and
internal disturbances and the Executive authority of the Union extends over all
the Union territory in this </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>respect. Despite all this, for any
deliberate misuse of his power involving a violation of the Constitution, the
President can be impeached by Parliament in the same way as the U.S. President
can be. Since in his election, members of the State legislatures have a direct
part, his position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Union Ministry is one of peculiar
importance. But that does not affect the constitutional position of the Union
Ministry of the day, as the repository of Executive authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Based
as it is on the Federal principle, the legislative powers under the new
Constitution are divided between the Union and the State Legislatures. The
Union List consisting of 97 items, among which are Defence, Foreign Affairs,
Communications, Currency and Exchange, Citizenship, Atomic Energy and others
which are generally of common concern to the whole country. Parliament’s
legislative authority is supreme and unquestionable in respect of the items in
the Union List. The Constitution also contains a State List of 66 items, among
which are included many of the subjects which have traditionally been classed
under the term “nation-building” subjects, in respect of which the State
Legislatures are the legislative authority. Besides these two lists, there is
also a Concurrent List of 47 subjects, in regard to which both Parliament and
the State Legislature have jurisdiction to make laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
was only natural in the context, in regard to the last mentioned list, a law
passed by Parliament will have precedence over the law by the State
Legislature, for, if there is a State and also a Federal law on the same
subject, the latter will prevail and the former will become repugnant to the
extent that it is opposed to the Federal law. At the same time the Federal
ideal is also enshrined, and preserved in the provision which lays down that if
two States together request the Union Government to legislate on any particular
subject included in the States List, Parliament can pass a law on that subject,
which would become applicable not only to those States but to any other State
also if the Government of the latter so desire. A contrary </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>process
is also envisaged by which a State law on a concurrent subject </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>will
take precedence over a subsequent Federal law on the same subject, if the State
Government have reserved it for the signification of the President’s assent and
if the latter signified his assent to it. The conclusion which these provisions
point to are: (1) that Parliament’s legislative authority extends throughout
the Union in respect of the list of Union subjects; (2) that in regard to any
subject in the concurrent List, laws passed by the Union Parliament have
invariably priority over laws passed by the State Legislatures except in
prescribed exceptions; and that (3) even in regard to the subjects in the State
List. Parliament has the right to legislate, if a request is made to that
effect by two States. The general tendency of the Constitution to bring into
existence a strong Central authority which could override State rights in some
emergencies is reflected in their legislative as much as in the Executive
sphere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further
evidence of this proneness to establish a strong Centre is contained in the
provision that in respect of any matters not specifically<i> </i>incorporated
in any of the three lists of legislative subjects, the right of legislation,
vests in the Union. In other words the residuary power under our Constitution
rests, as in the Canadian Constitution in the Centre. In actual practice, when
the State and the Union Lists are fairly exhaustive and comprehensive, it is of
little consequence where technically the residuary power rests. The fact that
the Constitution-framers had displayed a predilection to make the Union
Parliament the residuary in respect of legislative authority, is an indication
that they were determined deliberately to reverse the decentralisation process
and the principle of provincial autonomy, which was the cardinal characteristic
of the Montagu-Chelmsford Act of 1919 and more so of the Government of India
Act of 1935. This reversal is not a fortuitous circumstance, it is a deliberate
matter of policy, intended to circumvent the danger of centrifugal forces that
were dominating our political life prior to Angust 1947, asserting themselves.
It is also of interest to note here that the Union of India is intended to be
an indissoluble union, and the States have no right of secession. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
Parliament’s legislative supremacy is undisputed in respect of those items
which are included in the Union List, the President shares with it its
functions, in that he is vested with authority to promulgate Ordinances which
have the effect of law. This power is exercisable only when Parliament is not
in session and when an emergency calls for urgent action. An Ordinance issued
by the President will have to be placed before Parliament, as soon as possible,
for approval. In any case it ceases to operate at the end of six weeks from the
date of meeting of Parliament, or earlier if the two Houses so determine. The
Ordinance-making powers of the President do not hamstring to any real extent
the principle of Parliamentary supremacy; they are intended solely to cover an
admittedly extraordinary situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The division between the spheres of the Union and
State legislatures in respect of legislation does not in practice mean a
complete and clear-cut division of legislative functions between the State and
the Federal Governments, as in the American Constitution. We have already seen
that a connecting bridge between them is provided by the Concurrent List in
regard to which both the Union and State legislatures can make laws. Thus we
have Central measures of legislation, such as the Preventive Detention Act, the
Industrial Finance Corporation Bill, the Road Transport legislation, the
proposed measure to abolish and penalise untouchability and so on, though some
of these subjects are included in the States List.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
has been said on the division of legislative power is significant as a
revelation of the tendency in our Constitution to combine the Federal and
Unitary principles. The fact that the State Units’ autonomy is subject to the
basic consideration that national interests will be paramount, is underlined by
the powers vesting in the President pertaining to the proclamation of an
emergency and preventing a breakdown of the Constitution. These emergency
powers, which apparently give the President unlimited control over the
administration of the States, need not, however, be regarded as either normal
or as intended to justify wanton encroachment into the States’ sphere. An
emergency is not something intangible, and a Proclamation about its existence
or of a breakdown of the Constitution in any State cannot be made unless
certain conditions and elements are present. Thus no President would be
inclined to make use of them unless there is a clear, <i>prima facie </i>justification
for it, such as a grave, nationwide economic crisis, or the imminent outbreak
of war, or danger of widespread famine. Once a proclamation of an emergency is
issued it cannot be in operation for more than six months, though at the end of
that period it can be extended by an Act of Parliament for a further period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
“breakdown” provisions on the other hand can be set in motion only on the
recommendation of the Governor of the State concerned. This involves an even
more serious responsibility than the proclamation of an emergency, because it
results in a complete suspension of the constitutional channels of legislation
and enables the President to carry on the administration on his own
responsibility, as the abolition of the Legislature is inter-related to and
means the abolition of the Ministry also. As a proclamation, of a breakdown is
a serious matter, it imposes a correspondingly greater responsibility on the
President to act cautiously and with the utmost circumspection before taking a
decision. It is only a President who is autocratic-minded that can throw all
caution to the winds. The spirit of the Constitution would have to be accorded
the greatest possible consideration in this respect, and it is the essence of
that spirit that these provisions can be resorted to only when there is a clear
threat that the administrative machinery of the State is collapsing completely.
The fundamental point to remember is that what is constitutionally valid may
not always be legally sound or politically expedient. The President, who
attempts to resort to any of his emergency powers without the backing of his
own Ministry or the legislature in the state will be committing a
constitutional and political blunder. He will lay hims</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>elf open to impeachment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
inter-dependence between the Centre and the States is in no other respect more
patently and strikingly evident than in that of financial relations. The
division of financial resources between the two parts of the Union has been so
devised that the Centre would collect most of the direct taxes and distribute
their proceeds, either wholly or in part, to the States. The Centre is thus in
a position to exercise an effective control over the functioning of the States,
which depend to a large extent on the financial allocations from tax proceeds
and the other grants-in-aid and loans that the former makes. Direct taxes like
the Income-tax, Death Duties, Export Duties and some Excise Duties are among
the most important income yielding resources which are leviable by the Centre.
Besides, for various other purposes, such as the grow-more-food campaign at
present, educational expansion, agricultural and industrial research and
construction of irrigational and hydro-electric projects, road development and
so on, the States will be indebted to the Centre for assistance rendered. This
inter-dependence is a definite advantage in the sense that nation-building,
prosperity-promoting activities that are undertaken by the States as an
integral part of their constitutional responsibilities would be assured of a
continuity and adequacy of financial support. At the same time, by reason of
the fact that Central supervision and control over the development works
executed by the States is thereby ensured, uniformity in the progress of the
Units will be facilitated. The importance of uniform economic progress and
development throughout the Union is so patent as to be undeniable; and in a
country wherein considerable diversity in conditions exists, due to historical,
geographical and other causes, it can be promoted only by the kind of
supervisory control that can be exercised by a benevolent Centre. It is also
beneficial in the sense that in respect of the levy of a tax like the
Sales-tax, for instance, uniformity in the methods of its levy and
administration and avoidance of the danger of its proving an impediment to free
inter-State commerce, will be practicable only by such Central action under the
constitutional provisions. It may be mentioned here that trade, commerce and
economic intercourse among the various Units of the Federation are to be free,
subject only to such restriction as may be imposed by Parliament and the State
legislatures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Constitution provides for the appointment by the President of a Finance
Commission, which will be representative of both the Central and State
Governments, and which will review from time to time the financial relations
and the allocation of financial resources between the two sets of Governments.
The appointment of a commission of this character is of paramount significance,
because of the principle it enshrines of their inter-relationship in a matter
in which close partnership between them is essential. In the same way as, for
administrative convenience, territorial division is rendered necessary,
financial requirements call for as much integration as </span><span

dependence of State Governments on the Union Government for financial
allocations and grants may seem a detraction from the autonomy of the former.
But circumstanced and conditioned as we are in this country. What the
Constitution provides for is the best arrangement and the most beneficial. In
any case, there cannot be political and administrative interdependence between
the Union Government and the States and financial independence of the one from
the other. It is both unthinkable and impracticable, though a warning is
admittedly necessary that it would not conduce to administrative efficiency the
Central Government were to utilise the financial provisions of the Constitution
to convert the States into glorified District Boards, dependent on it for the
wherewithal to carry through nation-building activities. This is not by any
means the intention of the Constitution framers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the judicial sphere, the relations between the Centre and the States are again
very close. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial body in the Union, and it
is a Court of Appeal from the High Courts in the States as well as a defender
of the constitutional rights of either Government and of the Fundamental Rights
of the citizens and an interpreter of the Constitution. The judges of the Supreme
Court as well as of the High Courts are appointed by the President, the only
difference being that, in the appointment of Supreme Court Judges, he should
consult the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court, and of the High Courts, as he
deems necessary. The Supreme Court, by virtue of its all-India jurisdiction,
will naturally have a great say in the preservation, and even extension,
through its powers of interpretation, of the constitutional and fundamental
rights of the citizens. It can be a powerful deterrent to any state or the
Central Government committing an unconstitutional act or acting in
contravention of the Constitutional provisions, and as between the Centre and
the States and between the States <i>inter se, </i>it can settle
constitutional, jurisdictional and other disputes. It can thus cement the
solidarity and bring about co-ordination between the two Governments, provided
it builds up high traditions as the Supreme Courts in other Federal Unions have
done. The Supreme Court has also an advisory function in that the President may
refer to it any question of law or fact which he considers to be of sufficient
public importance to make it expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme
Court thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the sphere of administration, as in others, the tendency to unitariness and
integration is perceptibly evident in the Constitution. In respect of important
common subjects on which the Union Government can legislate, that Government
has its own administrative machinery which functions throughout the Union territory.
Thus Income-tax, Central Excise, Posts and Telegraphs, Customs, Railways and
Central Public Works, are all administered by the Union Government directly
through its own officials. But in a number of other subjects, such as, for
instance, the enforcement of economic policies which affect the lives of the
people intimately, implementation of labour legislation, and especially in
respect of legislation bearing on the Concurrent subjects, the Union Government
inevitably has to depend on the administrative machinery in the States. The
Central Government can issue necessary directives to the States Governments to
produce that result, and the latter have to carry out those directives. In
practice, this ensures smoothness in administration and also economy in
expenditure of public revenues and further promotes co-ordination between the
Centre and the States. This last-mentioned factor is of the utmost
significance, since co-ordination between the two Governments in respect of
policies on all-India matters and their execution is essential for stable and
sustained progress and is in the interests of uniformity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Additionally,
as has been pointed out already, during a period of emergency or in case of a
threat of breakdown of the Constitution in any State, leading to the assumption
of Executive authority in the State concerned by the Union President, the Union
Government’s writ will automatically run throughout the State or the States
affected. In such circumstances the Executive officials of the State will function
directly under the orders of the President, though this will undoubtedly be
limited to the currency of the state of emergency. What it however, serves to
emphasise is that the administrative spheres of the Union and the States do
overlap and that our Constitution contemplates that in certain circumstances,
and in particular when vital national interests are at stake, there should be
no irreconcilable conflict of jurisdiction or division of loyalties impeding
co-ordinated direction and action. Every Unit is specifically called upon to
exercise its Executive power “to ensure compliance with the laws made by
Parliament.” So long as this provision and other Central powers are not
exploited to the detriment of the Units, they are a sign of healthy centralisation
and should be welcomed. It is a world-wide trend and is clearly envisageable in
the U.S.A., Australian and other Constitutions, and is, therefore, not peculiar
to India. We have only accorded recognition to a tendency which is recognised
as inevitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The survey of the relations between the Units and
the Centre under India’s new Constitution leads irresistibly to the conclusion
that there has been a definite reversal of the process of provincial autonomy
which was becoming progressively more pronounced between the Minto-Morley
Reforms of 1909 and the Government of India Act of 1935. It was a reaction
fundamentally against the fissiparous and disintegrating tendencies that the
Muslim League agitation had set in motion. It is, however, not a tendency which
we need deplore. It represents an imperative need of the hour; it is a
concession to historical facts; and it is a reflection of the political
experience which the working of other Federal Constitutions in the world
teaches us. A cardinal element of that experience is the imparting of
increasingly greater strength to the Federal Government’s elbows. The whole
arrangement of the relations between the Centre and the Units under the
Constitution is based on political convenience and on the geographical, historical
and physiographical conditions obtaining in the country; and it will be found
on close examination that the whole structure represents an integrated whole,
in which each part has a place of its own. The requirements of national
Defence, national security, the complicated economic problems of grave national
import and the need for uniformity in labour legislation and other factors have
given a fillip to this tendency in other countries. If we have accorded
recognition to it in the Constitution, it is an indication of the fact that our
Constitution-framers have learnt the lessons or history and have successfully
circumvented the need for experimenting with the trial and error method. While
structurally, India’s Constitution is a Federation, it can be made to function
in cases of emergency as a unitary one, all authority emanating from a central
source. On the whole this constitutes the strongest point in its favour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Admittedly
too much centralisation of political authority in a Central Government, whose territorial
jurisdiction extends over a vast country like India with its diverse local
problems and diversities in progress, language, manners and customs, has its
own disadvantages. We cannot overlook the fact that such a process can destroy
local initiative and impede the speedy implementation of administrative
policies which directly benefit the common man, apart from such nationally
important activities as Defence, Communications and Foreign Policy. One potent
evil that emerges out of this aggravating tendency to centralisation and
against which a note of warning must be struck is what is known as delegated
legislation, which amounts to vesting the permanent bureaucracy with power to
manipulate parliamentary legislation to public detriment under the rule-making
powers implicit in such legislation. On the other hand, as a set-off against
these disadvantages, must be placed the benefits of centralised executive and
administrative responsibilities, about which mention has been made in the above
paragraphs. As I pointed out at the outset, time and circumstance will play a
large part in bringing about an adjustment and striking a balance between Union
and State powers, and constitutional amendments are not debarred in order to
promote desirable modifications therein. As things stand at present what our
Constitution-makers have achieved is a striking demonstration of their
appreciation of the needs of our country in the critical times through which we
are passing. Everything in the direction of promoting the kind of desirable and
essential changes referred to in response to the time-spirit will depend
hereafter on the vigour and energy with which our national democracy will
function in the years to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

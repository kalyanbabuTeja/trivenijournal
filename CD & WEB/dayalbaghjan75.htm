has completed sixty years of its distinctive existence on Basant Day–16th
February, 1975. During this long period it has received high praise for various
accomplishments which are regarded as miracles. For example, it has converted
“an ugly stretch of sandy waste where nothing but scrub and low vegetation
could grow into a modern colony provided with all necessary public institutions
and comforts and conveniences of life” such as piped water, good roads, a
telephone system, banking, insurance and medical services, first-rate
educational institutions and ‘green belt.’ It now produces almost all the
vegetables, rice and wheat, that the colonists need. Major Yeats-Brown called
it a colony of work-a-day mystics because work and worship go there together,
and work with worship is capable of perpetual invigoration. It was considered
to be the precursor of a new civilization, God-centred, industrious, educative,
egalitarian and socialist. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was thrilled with the
socialist pattern of life in it. As His Holiness Mehtaji Maharaj the present
Leader, has pointed out, “Neither does wealth flow here, nor does anybody
starve here; neither are there big palaces and mansions, nor are there any
dilapidated huts here; neither is anyone great or big here, nor anyone small or
insignificant; and if anybody here is honoured more than others, it is he who
works better or more than others. Dayalbagh belongs to every resident, while no
resident has any kind of property in anything here ... This small place, where
there is almost no illiterate person and where nobody leads a life of laziness
and indolence, is neither a village nor a town and both a village and town.” It
is this glowing picture of peaceful and serene corporate life as lived in
Dayalbagh which inspired Panditji to exclaim, “As a matter of fact countries
advance not on account of their size but by the manner its people lead their
lives and by the character they posses and by the skill of their hands and
intelligence to do things. If India would make progress, it would do so because
such people live here (in Dayalbagh) and not because thirty-six crores of
people live in this country.” No less eloquent and striking were the tributes
of homage paid by eminent persons like Paul Brunton</span><span

</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

that the chorus of praise by distinguished visitors usually touches the fringe
of life there and seldom penetrates to its heart which is free universal and
full of the divine light, the divine power and the divine love.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a multi-dimensional, dynamic colony of industrious cultivated seekers of
truth imbued with a sense of social purpose. Established in 1915 with a meagre
sum of Rs. 5,000 and with the planting of five trees in the vicinity of Agra
city, it has an amazing record of growth. It is a living example of what the
redemptive power of religion could achieve in transforming this dismal world
into the wonderful place it ought to be. Dayalbagh teaches, to repeat an
oft-quoted phrase of its august Founder, neither world-lines nor
otherworldliness, but better-worldliness. His Holiness </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sababji
Maharaj, the Founder of Dayalbagh, explained once what He was aiming at: “We

duty and do his duty. We </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

laid down four important principles which are found among members of a healthy
community: Wisdom, temperance, courage and justice. It seems to me that these
are found, by and large, among the residents of Dayalbagh, who breathe the
atmosphere of an ennobling and unifying religious culture, and they possess in
addition another sterling quality–loyalty. It is desirable to evolve supermen
who try to combine in them the salient features of the four fundamental classes
of humanity: Irresistible yearning for God-realisation found in a true Brahmin,
readiness to sacrifice one’s life for one’s country found in a true Kshatriya,
tendency to spend one’s wealth for common weal found in a Vaisya and passion
for rendering ungrudging service to fellowmen manifest in a Sudra. Dayalbagh is
striving to realise this ideal. It has stood for “the unity of India
discouraging the diversities that exist in our country.” This is proper
because, as Devarshi Narada puts it, “There is no distinction due to caste,
complexion, learning, affluence, occupation, etc., among devotees of God”
(Bhakti Sutra 72). The social structure of this colony may be summed up by the
simple formula, <i>Aris-Demo</i>, aristocracy of the Spirit and democracy of
individuals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Religion has been judged not only by its attitude towards God but by what it

is the headquarters of Radhasoami Faith and Satsang, which has branches
throughout India as well as in some places in Great Britain and the United
States. Soamiji Maharaj founded Radhasoami Faith in 1861 for the benefit or
Adhikaris with this proclamation, “On observing that the Jivas have been
undergoing extreme suffering and have been subjected to delusion, the Supreme
Being Almighty Lord Radhasoami has assumed the form of the Sant Satguru and
manifested Himself on this earth for their redemption, and through Supreme
Grace He explains the secret of the Original Abode and teaches the method <span

feed and perish, but like a drop <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>eternity
to merge with the Ocean of Immortality, Love and Bliss”.* The theist is intrigued

intended <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>be the surrender of
one’s ego <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>Divine Will. The
social worker is happy to find the principle of equality vigorously followed
here. It is noteworthy that the principle is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

emerges logically from the basic tenet of the faith: Fatherhood <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>God and brotherhood of man.
Dayalbagh encourages wholesome traditions and discourages wasteful and barren
practices. Marriages are celebrated in a simple way, free of pomp and
extravagance. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Not </span>more than
twenty-five guests are normally invited to a marriage dinner. The rich follow
this convention as rigidly as the not-so-rich. Nothing is wasted, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>not </span>even a withered leaf. Withered
leaves are swept into compost pits. The drainage system in Dayalbagh is so
designed that water never collects at any place even on the rainiest day and i<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>s </span>channelled into farms. “Waste nothing,”
is one of the messages <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the
Guru Maharaj. The educationist who asks with the poet T. S. Eliot, “Where is
the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in
information?” is happy <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>find
that Intellect sharpens and wisdom blooms in the portals of Dayalbagh colleges,
which are well-known for their quality of teaching, character building and
capacity <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>instil Love of God
which is the beginning of wisdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

red-brick gateway near its Town Hall, one notices a marble plaque with the
inscription ‘Radhasoami Central Satsang.’ As one proceeds along the neat, well-swept
tarred road lined with tall neem and other trees, one’s attention is drawn <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>the stately red and white building
of R. E. I. College <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>his
right, the administrative building of<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>Women’s
Training College in front and the spires <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of
</span>Technical College across play fields and tennis courts, to his left.
Nearby stands the Prayer Hall. This seems to be the focus of the Colony. Here
pre-dawn and post-sunset congregational prayers are offered daily right through
the year. Who is not stirred by the strains of <i>Mangalacharan (Radhasoami nom
jo gave so yee tare...) </i>floating melodiously from a thousand mouths before
day-break? The <i>Mangalacharan </i>is followed by hymns in praise of the power
and glory of Merciful Radhasoami, His infinite grace in assuming Human Form and
the heroism associated with the soul’s ascent to His Abode of Bliss. The
evening prayer goes more or less on the same lines, an</span><span

in Satsang is naturally beyond the comprehension of even an astute Yeats-Brown.
Saints tell us that ambrosia rains there. In philosophical terms Satsang is synonymous
with the projection of the Satguru’s personality which is <i>Satchidananda-Prakasa
</i>into the expectant Sadhak’s earth-nature so that the latter is liberated
out of ego and lifted up slowly and steadily into Infinity and Universality.
Around the Satsang Hall is a ring of well-planned <i>mohallas </i>or wards–Swetnagar,
Vidyutnagar, Karyaviranagar, Premnagar, Dayalnagar and Sominagar. There are
green fields surrounding the <i>mohallas, </i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

here the brief description of the daily round of agricultural activities in
Dayalbagh from Alumni Journal of the Roorkee University: <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

at 3-30 a. m. when he goes to the Satsang where all the residents congregate
for their morning religious service. After the service all able-bodied persons
reach the fields before dawn and work there till it is time to go to their
offices or workshops. Nowhere in the world can one see a light like this where community
work is done in the real sense of social service. One can see a
vice-chancellor, a high court judge, a chief engineer, a professor, a doctor, a
lawyer, an accounts officer, a business executive, a factory worker, a peon, a sweeper
and others of all ages working shoulder to shoulder for the common good.
Likewise women also take full part in the field work daily. This agricultural
activity has let an example of how a community competently led can to a large
extent solve its food problem.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

aura of the living Satguru,** who acts spontaneously under the impulse of the
Supreme Father, it is proper to know His identity. Just as a high tension cable
is not an ordinary copper wire, the Satguru is no ordinary human being. He
appears to be human but anyone whose ‘third eye’ <i>(diya chokshu, chashme baatin)

creation. His long protecting hand can reach any point in the space-time
continuum or the intangible regions beyond it. He protects His followers from
Hell fires and leads them away from delusions and temptations of <i>Kal </i>and
<i>Karma. </i>He is the Ocean of Mercy without any motive <i>(ahetuka daya sindhuhu).

</i>If one keeps company with the Satguru, one tends to become perfect as the
latter is perfect. The Satguru is the true friend of man for whose redemption
He assumes Human Form out of sheer compassion. The Free Spirit outside the cosmic
prison deliberately enters the prison to liberate souls shackled to mind and matter

pace-setter in many important fields. The man in the street now talks of rapid
Industrialisation and of the significance of small-scale industries to remove
unemployment and to increase the per capita income of our countrymen. Dayalbagh
started model industries, purely <i>swadeshi </i>Industries, as early as 1917
with the same objectives. Everybody now expatiates on the need for properly
trained engineers to process new Industries and to expand the existing ones.
Technical College in Dayalbagh has been one of the very few institutions set up
in the twenties to train our young men for setting up and running industries.
The Education Commission headed by Dr Kothari stated in their report in 1968
that “the destiny of India is being shaped in her classrooms.” Dayalbagh gave
this message fifty years ago placing proper accent on vocational training and
women’s education. Mr. E. Molony, Commissioner of Agra, recorded on October 27,
1917, “The three points which struck me as distinctive and praiseworthy were
(a) the attempt to educate girls, (b) the attempt to keep education in touch
with realities of life by the workshop and (c) the absence of caste
difficulties.” There are three excellent colleges in Dayalbagh: R. E. I. Degree
College, imparting instruction with field experience in the Faculties of
Science, Agriculture and Commerce, Women’s Training College providing graduate
and post-graduate courses in arts and education introducing work experience and
vocational training as integral parts of curricula and Engineering College offering
courses in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at the Degree level. Recently
the Government of Uttar Pradesh awarded a trophy to Women’s Training College
recognising it as a centre of excellence. Learning is the way of civilised
living and W. T. C. initiated a number of programmes in continuing education to
meet the needs of married women in Agra. There is a school of comparative
religion here. The credit for drafting and vigorously implementing the first
Five-Year Plan of economic development in India goes to Dayalbagh. Radhasoami
Satsang Sabha launched in 1937 a Five-Year Plan with the purpose of raising the
annual outturn of Dayalbagh manufactures from 7½ lakhs to a crore of rupees.
The target was achieved slightly ahead of schedule. The fulfilment of the Sabha’s
Plan was a saga of unusual distinction as it enlisted the services of almost
all members of the community in what was regarded by them as a <i>rare yagna. </i>R.
E. I. Dairy was perhaps the first dairy in Asia to have been equipped with
modern scientific appliances. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Adviser to the Government of India, remarked during his visit to the dairy in
1945: “India indeed is a land of surprises. Possibly the greatest surprise
which I personally have experienced is to find myself in such a fine and
well-equipped dairy which is comparable in technique with any in the world,
whilst as regards its surroundings, it surpasses any that I have seen in a
professional career which included the whole of England and Australia. He
added, “With such an example, surely it is within the capacity of India to
follow it and so far as the dairy industry is concerned to lift itself from the
present slough of despond.” Further, our country has been trying hard to attain
self-sufficiency in foodgrains. Having anticipated food scarcity and having
decided to attain self-sufficiency in foodgrains in 1941, Dayalbagh workers,
acting on the guidelines of self-help and self-reliance, levelled the mounds
around Dayalbagh, weeded <i>kans, </i>dug out <i>sarkandas </i>(deep-rooted
scrub) and brought more than a thousand acres of stubborn glebe under the
plough. Their objective was achieved within two decades. It thus appears that
Dayalbagh does the right thing at the right time exercising forethought and
India trudges behind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

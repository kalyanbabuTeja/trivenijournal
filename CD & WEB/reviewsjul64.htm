revelation of the personality of the writer. If the writer happens to be

teacher, in which he had earned an enviable reputation and achieved a
remarkable success at a comparatively young age of 37, to join the Servants of
India Society, so that he might devote himself entirely to the service of his
country. By the sheer weight of his character and talents, he came to playa
prominent part in historic events, <span class=GramE>came</span> into contact
with important men in high office or position in public life, and maintained
friendly relations with them. For over forty years, from 1905 in which he
applied for membership of the Servants of India Society, till almost his death

Aiyar had declared “Mr. Sastri is our greatest letter-writer. I have had
letters from almost all of our great Indians. I don't think any other can write

public career, of the great patriot and statesman, extending over more than
forty years, beginning with his letter to Gokhale in 1905, seeking admission to
The Servants of India Society, and ending with the letter from his deathbed in

psycho-spiritual life of man. The author combines simplicity with lucidity thus
making difficult and abstruse subjects fundamentally fall in line with the
modern mystical trend in religious and philosophical thought. It is most
significant to note that modern man, who otherwise resents any mention of religion,
can be persuaded to respond sympathetically to religious experience through the
doorway of modern science and the investigations of modern psychology. Swami <span

possible, and without causation no consideration of anything is possible….These
three are the ultimate categories to which all the phenomena of the world can
be reduced….Yet they are not of an objective existence, but are merely the
subjective forms of the intellect. In other words, they exist only in the mind,
making up its structure and covering up all the outer phenomena.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

above passage indicates the limitations of the thought-process. Thought always
moves between two points. Time and Space are the two points of the mind–and
causation is indeed the movement between these two points. Time and Space are
not two different things. They are a pair always found together. To postulate
the one, is to bring into existence the other, for, thought is unable to
function except in<i> </i>the field of duality. And so, non-dual experience can
never be comprehended by a thought-process, however subtle it may be. Since all
true spiritual experiences are non-dual in nature they can be known only in the
transcending of the thought-process. This has been the main teaching of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Ramana</span> <span class=SpellE>Maharshi</span>, and Swami <span
class=SpellE>Rajeswarananda</span> has expounded the teaching of the <span
class=SpellE>Maharshi</span> in a very simple and yet clear manner. It is
interesting to note how the approach of Vedanta is becoming more and more
acceptable to the scientifically trained intellect of today. It was <span

religion which can be acceptable to modern man. <span class=GramE>The present

bear traces of either artificiality or inventiveness for the sake of mere

particularly confined to the District of <span class=SpellE>Thanjavur</span>,
than even types answering the description of a short-story. Still what a

first of these stories transports us from day-dreaming into a world of bare
realism. The unbridgeable hiatus between status on the one hand and social
inferiority on the other, cannot be better brought home than in the way a
luscious jack-fruit decides the fates of two little boys of tender age, who
having been what they were, felt unable to draw the line demarcating the haves
from the have-nots, at any rate so far as their instincts led them to taste the
fruit. If proud adversity also can occasionally retaliate at insolence offered
for no reason, it only justifies the episode where a woman of no consequence
was cut to the quick by the grudgingly delivered jack-fruit by one whom she had
no reason to respect, especially after what had taken place, painfully
reminding her of her lower rank in society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

between these two, there are eight other stories of varying lengths, most of which
convey to us graphically all the disconcerting situations life abounds in, for
those who cannot but share such experiences, with no small personal sacrifices,
in a very rapidly-changing world. Two of them, the one concerning an actor of
the street-drama and the other a peasant, respecting time-<span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
traditions of loyalty to masters, and to the soil which rewarded him for honest
<span class=SpellE>labour</span>, preserve for us in no ordinary degree some of
the highlights of racy narration and analysis of human character in all its
intricacies. The suspense, maintained to the last, in the story of the artist’s
wife, till the revelation of her identity, proves without doubt the deftness
and power of it sustaining interest in a story, not commonly found in many
writers, whose vain purpose is to provide surprises at every turn in order to
rivet the readers entire attention on their capacity to hold them in their
grip. The other story of the farmer easily makes the reader throw back his
imagination to bygone times, when plenty and different values influenced our
rural economy, now, alas, never to return. The contrast of the present, painted
by the author, is convincing enough to demonstrate what a heritage of
simplicity and ordered life we have lost, with our new-born ideas and regular
plans for progress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

convincing arguments that the word <span class=SpellE>Yakshas</span> has
relationship with the word <span class=SpellE>Jekkulu</span> in Telugu and <span

election of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span> to the <span

over as Plato’s dream come true. The ancient Greek philosopher looked forward
to the day when philosophers would become kings and kings philosophers; But he
might not have imagined that a Sovereign Democratic Republic would ever vote a
philosopher of world stature to its <span class=SpellE>presidentship</span>.
The point that <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan’s</span> political ideals are
more broad-based and more advanced than those of Plato, or any other
philosopher for that matter, is effectively made out by the editor in his
detailed and well-written preface to this compilation which is a reprint of
articles originally published in the special number of “The Andhra <span
class=SpellE>Jyoti</span>” celebrating the assumption of office by the new
President. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan’s</span> flair for exposition, and
genius for reconciliation, the magic web of his eloquence, the gift of vivid
phrase and the happy expression as a writer, and his enviable mastery of the
English language, are <span class=SpellE>succintly</span> described before the
editor, an avowed agnostic, sums him up as a democrat for with Socialist
leanings, as a humanist who uses the philosopher’s idiom for the promotion of
human welfare. Dr. K. <span class=SpellE>Satchidanandamurti</span> surveys the
progress of his thought by a rapid reference to all his works <span
class=SpellE>uptodate</span>. His role as a philosopher, commentator and
idealist is discussed by Messrs. M. V. N. Swami, I. S. R. L. <span

respectively. The article contributed by the present writer views him as a
bridge-builder, between the East and the West, between the ancient and the
modern, between philosophy and politics and between Man and Man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boat man! You said one day to me that you would row me across the river; but you’ve postponed my departure and evaded my requests.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I’m tired of waiting and the flame of hope you’ve kindled is burning me. Oh, will you not row me today?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This boat is lazy lying on the water-line tied with a rope to the bamboo. The bamboo is tired of the rope’s embrace and longs for the freedom of its loneliness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boatman, why don’t you unite the knot and grant freedom to the bamboo?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a horse, shut up in a stable for long, neights and frets for a ride in the open, this boat, awakened from lazy sleep by passing winds, sways to and fro to rush on the river in its course of floating freedom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all wait for your decision of grace. Boatman, and from after off I hear the call of the sea to the river and the boat’s call to you!</P>

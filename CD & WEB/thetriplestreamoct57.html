<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the institutions which have come into being in the wake of the re-organisation
of the States in India, the Zonal Councils occupy a position of great
significance. The grouping of the States on the basis of contiguity and common
interests was well-conceived, though it was felt in influential quarters that
Mysore ought to have come into the Southern Zone and not the Western. Even this
slight incongruity may not be of much practical importance, for the
representatives of Mysore are being specially invited to the meetings of the
Southern Zone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the decision was taken to re-shape the States on a linguistic basis, some leading
thinkers in different parts of India entertained a genuine fear that the
already existing fissiparous tendencies might be accelerated, and ultimately
endanger the unity of India. That unity had been achieved after a mighty
effort, and, with the exception of Pakistan, the entire sub-continent became a
distinct political unit, placed in a position of great influence in
international affairs. Without aspiring for it, India has in fact won the
leadership of Asia. Her name and that of her Prime Minister are held in the
highest esteem, wherever the value of international peace and goodwill is
cherished. But within the borders of India, the division into linguistic States
unleashed undesirable forces, though the basic concept behind the division was
sound from the administrative and cultural points of view. The Zonal Councils
were proposed as convenient links between the Union and the States. They were
not administrative bodies with Services of their own; their decisions were not
binding on the individual States within the Zone. But the leading
administrators in the States were to meet periodically under the Chairmanship </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
the Home Minister of the Union, and, through a friendly interchange of views,
arrive at solutions of outstanding problems like inter-State trade and
commerce, distribution of river waters, sharing of certain Services, and some
vexed questions relating to border areas and linguistic minorities. The habit
of consultation and arriving at agreement by mutual consent is an extremely
valuable factor in the growth of democracy. Even if no agreement is reached,
the exchange of views between the representatives of the States will lessen the
range and intensity of the divergences of view. In a few years, the elements
that make for harmony will prevail as against those that promote discord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
one stage it was hoped that neighbouring States like Bihar and Bengal, Madras
and Kerala would come together and form single constitutional units. But the
cordial atmosphere created by the joint statement of the Chief Ministers of
Bengal and Bihar was not sustained, and the two leaders were unable to obtain
the consent of the legislators and common citizens of their respective States.
Perhaps the effort to bring together the people of two or three States within
the ambit of a single State, while they preferred to retain their local
autonomy, was a little premature. But what could not be achieved through the
operation of law may become feasible through the activities of the Zonal
Councils. And even if dreams like that of Dakshin Pradesh and Prachya Pradesh
are not realised, the Zonal Councils will at least have softened the acerbities
of linguistic feuds by promoting harmonious relations between the peoples of
the Zone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The Governors<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
time to time suggestions are thrown out by well-meaning people regarding the
position and functions of the Governors of Indian States. While the
Constitution of India defines the powers of the Governor as Head of the State,
those powers have to be exercised on the advice of his Council of Ministers.
The Ministers are responsible to the Legislature, whereas the Governor holds
his office at the pleasure of the President who appoints him on the
recommendation of the Union Government. The party in power at the Centre has
the deciding voice in the appointment, transfer and recall of the Governors of
the States. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister, however, are the persons
primarily concerned. The Governors functioning since the achievement of
Independence are tending to be mere figure-heads in whose name the
administration is carried on and laws and executive orders are promulgated.
Their social and ceremonial activities appear to be of greater importance than
their work as the constitutional Heads of the States. It is only when the normal
powers of the Legislature are withdrawn, or a new Ministry is to be formed,
that the Governor functions as an active political entity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this is common knowledge. But what is not so commonly realised is that, very
often, the Governor is an elder statesman who is in a position to advise and
warn his Ministers and act as a representative of the President. To argue that,
in Independent India, we ought to dispense with an officer of this type merely
because he does not normally exercise political power, is to miss the meaning
of the provisions of the Constitution relating to the governance of the States.
The State, like the Union, must have a titular Head who will uphold the dignity
of the State and represent it at important public functions. He must draw unto
himself the affection and the respect of the citizens of the State,
irrespective of their party affiliations. During his term of office, he ceases,
like the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly or the Chairman of the Legislative
Council, to be a party man, even though, like those dignitaries, he might owe
his position to the chiefs of a party. The Governor is also the admitted leader
of society, particularly in the Capital, and takes precedence of the Ministers
and the Judges. As in England, the presence of the Monarch eliminates all rival
claims to the first place in society, so too does the presence of the Governor
in the Indian States. It is sometimes contended that the Indian tax-payer is
being called upon to pay a heavy price for these ‘airy nothings’. But as Sri
Lingamurty rightly points out in his article in the present number of
‘Triveni’, democracy is in any case costly, and the money spent on the
Governors and their establishments is negligible compared with the huge
expenditure incurred by the State during elections or the amounts consumed by
the salaries and allowances of the legislators. It is possible to minimise the
pomp and splendour of the Governor’s office, but even here economy should not
be carried too far so as to rob the Head of the State of the dignity due to his
position. Processions like the Dasara procession in Mysore need not be
eliminated, as there is ample evidence to prove that the citizens are delighted
to witness these external shows which symbolise the greatness of the State.
There is something to be said in favour of sentiment, as certain festivities
cherished through the centuries have acquired a historic and cultural value.
Government and administration are essentially prosaic. An occasional influx of
poetry and colour will mean greater happiness all round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
one wonders why our Governors have ceased to be referred to as ‘His
Excellency.’ If this form of address is preserved in the case of Ambassadors,
why was it given up in the case of Governors? India has not discarded all
titles, and if ‘Bharat Ratnas’ and ‘Padma Vibhushans’ are created year after
year, why should we shy at the adoption of a perfectly innocuous appellation of
‘Excellency?’ After all, the Governor is the Head of the State, and it is but
right that he should be addressed or referred to in a manner befitting his
position. The cult of simplicity is being carried too far, at the expense of
the proprieties of a cultured life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

life of the Sage of Dakshineswar is of absorbing interest to seekers of Light

been unfolded with skill and devotion. The original sources are mainly in
Bengali and any fresh attempt to convey the charm of Sri Ramakrishna’s personality
can be successful only if a knowledge of these sources is availed of. In
Telugu, as in all Indian languages, there is a large number of high-class
publications dealing with the life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, the Holy
Mother, and Sri Vivekananda. These have enabled the people of Andhra to sense
the glory of the message of the Saint and of those who were exceedingly dear to
him. The latest of such biographies is the one by Sri Chirantanananda Swami.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Quest of the Eternal, through study and contemplation, and personal contact
with some of the leading lights of the Ramakrishna Mutt and Mission. He was
closely associated with the Mission for several years in Madras and Calcutta.
He is too young to have known Sri Ramakrishna or Sri Vivekananda in the flesh,
but he is a disciple of Sri Vijnanananda Swami, a direct disciple of Sri
Ramakrishna and for some time President of the Mutt and Mission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sanskrit, Swamiji brings to his task very valuable gifts of narration and
description. Added to these is the gift of a sweet, flowing yet dignified
style. His Telugu prose is of surpassing beauty. To Swamiji, Sri Ramakrishna is
a godly man rather than an Avatar of God. It is the human aspect which appeals

days seem distant, but they were days of hope and vaulting conceit and they
remain in the timelessness of the mind. The salt Satyagraha had passed into
history. To me, who was thinking only of an inner disturbance, the <st1:Street

the street of adventure, giving to that part of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName

steps of the Young Men’s Indian Association, stood outside a room, and scrawled
my name on a scrap of paper. I went in, with trepidation but with an air of
assurance, and on light feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had seen Ramakoti somewhere in <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Mount
  Road</st1:address></st1:Street>, with some detachment. A friend pointed him
out to me as the Editor of ‘Triveni’. So unlike John Morley or W. E. Henley, I
thought, and so unobtrusive. I had seen ‘Triveni’ but today I was meeting its
Editor, and it seemed a moment on which somebody’s destiny depended. He would
be kind, but would he have the pleasure of discovering me, I who was so
well-known to <span class=GramE>myself</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was considerate. Inside me the small ego was struggling, like that of Frank
Harris hawking his early stuff in Fleet Street; outwardly I was shy and
wide-eyed. He said kind things, something about the <span class=SpellE>reciness</span>
of the writing. But first I had to get the article typed out. I ran to the
nearest typist, passing the taxidermist’s animals, dictated the article word by
word, and delivered it on tiptoe next day. It was only when the article was
published that I <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that the writing had been
too racy, a tumble of similes and metaphors, racing beyond the point of no
return. In writing about <span class=SpellE>Masefield</span>, I had been affected
by his ‘Reynard the Fox’. With twenty-five neatly printed reprints, in red
cover, I felt I was a writer. <span class=GramE>First article, first
impression, twenty-five copies.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

did not know how to reappear before Ramakoti now. He might ask me to write on
another poet–not <span class=SpellE>Drinkwater</span>! I wanted to be the
Macaulay of his ‘Edinburgh Review’, writing long, spacious articles, with
Macaulay’s swaggering sententiousness, with history as the background. One day,
I met Ramakoti in a tram. He called me to his bench. He spoke like a friend and
said what has remained memorable to me and what I tell young men, with
variations. “It is good to write with imagination, even excessive imagination,
when one is young,” he observed. “That means there is something there. If there
is no ferment at this age, nothing will emerge later.” Casually, he asked me if
I had read ‘Yenki Patalu’.<sup>1</sup> I had; it had been exciting; but I
remembered none of the songs. Could I translate them? I could, I said; only, I
wanted the book. He sent me the book next day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
read the songs, hummed them to myself, and felt they could not be translated.
But I had said I would translate them, and I must. That night, the humming went
into my head. One song was translated, then another; they tumbled into rhyme
and shape, the rhythm corresponding nearly to the original rhythm. Exhaustion
overtook me. I left the manuscript next day at ‘Triveni’ office, not daring to
know the Editor’s opinion of a night’s exhilaration. I forgot the article and
was spending delightful days, chasing dreams in <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Cubbon</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType>,
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City>. A
letter came from Ramakoti saying that the article was ‘exceedingly well
written’ and that he was happy and proud he had discovered me. <span
class=GramE>Restrained commendation, but as good as a Nobel Prize for me then.</span>
The letter was affectionate and consoling. “Life is greater than <span
class=GramE>service</span>,” it said, referring to my rejection by the Medical
Board for a highly important competitive examination. That saying has been a
prize; life is above all service, even the highest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

marginal comment on the manuscript, I have not forgotten–“Too much antithesis.”

the editing. Today the commentary part is not acceptable to me. I could improve

was something to a student of law, which was an ass and not yet the engaging
perplexity it was later to become. I lived in the Y. M. I. A., I was a
‘Triveni’ young man and in 1931-32 it seemed eternity lay before me. There’s
was no urge to write, except for poetry which was reserved for English
publishers. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City>
and study were exciting. Ramakoti encouraged me to be an Edward Fitzgerald. I
translated several Telugu poems but would not produce them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was early in 1932 a literary controversy, typical of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> intellectualism of those days, which
had a start from me. Two well known professors of English opposed in the
Academic Council <span class=SpellE>Satyamurthi’s</span> proposal for the
selection of <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani’s</span> ‘<span class=SpellE>Murugan</span>’
as a text-book for the B. A. classes. There was derision for Indian writing in
English. What had it produced except rhetoric-mongering? I wrote a long letter
in irritation on ‘Indo-Anglicans and Rhetoric-Mongering’, which was published
in ‘The Hindu’. I made it rhetorical and derided the pedantic negativism of
professors, and what had they been teaching? <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Sparks</st1:place></st1:City> flew for some weeks. The controversy
was interesting for me, for nobody questioned the standard of my rhetoric, and <span
class=SpellE>Saranathan</span>, one of the two professors, praised it. On my
way back from Bangalore, Ramakoti gave me <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani’s</span>
new novel ‘<span class=SpellE>Kandan</span>’ for review, making it plain that
he had declined to give the book to others and the <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
of reviewing it belonged to me. <span class=GramE>I had read <span
class=SpellE>Venkataramani’s</span> ‘Paper Boats’ and liked it.</span> <span
class=GramE>But a novel?</span> Throughout the night, I had not a wink of sleep
in the railway compartment. I was too eager to read the book I was to review.
When I returned after the summer vacation, I was greeted enthusiastically for
the review, which had yet to be published. It was dazing, when Venkataramani,
meeting me for the first time, recalled Coleridge and praised the review also.
He must have been a conceited young man in his time, I thought. The review was
more a review of the English novel as it was at the time, and ‘<span
class=SpellE>Kandan</span>’ to me was a medium of what seemed the strange,
simile-studded English of Venkataramani.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was a year of friendships and <span class=GramE>discoveries,</span> and for me
the golden age of ‘Triveni’. I was now informal and confiding with Ramakoti. He
had been vague with his gestures of joy and despair; he emerged like a <span
class=SpellE>Boticelli</span> portrait. Behind his softness, the dissolution of
individuality, I saw the strength of steel, the core that would not dissolve.
He had unchangeable ideas about the get-up of ‘Triveni’, the paper on which it
was to be printed and the advertisements which must be accepted or rejected.
Proof reading was a refined passion, like an engraver’s art, the test of<i> </i>perfection.
This could be appreciated by me only slowly by the elaboration of experience.
At that time I was incapable of such analysis, incapable of understanding the
nature and extent of his sacrifice. I only felt the impact of <span
class=SpellE>sunniness</span>, and the <span class=SpellE>sunniness</span> of
one who knew good writing and to whom editing was an art. His excisions were
delicate surgery. He was a <span class=SpellE>pruner</span>, a gardener with
other men’s words, thinking more of the garden than his own </span><span

South Indian sculpture, young men and old men, some <span class=SpellE>Hogarthian</span>.
Mrs. Besant’s statue, the St. Paul’s like dome, the gallery of portraits of
greatness, the book-shop where theosophy and palmistry jostled with Georgian
poetry, the marathon ‘<span class=SpellE>kalakshepams</span>’ on Sundays, and
the genial secretary, who seemed to be unaware of what was going on round him!
The restaurant, dingy and noisy, broke up into literary round-tables with an
occasional Johnsonian rumble. The coffee was famous for its freshness and kick,
and sweets were served stingily like manna. Between ‘Triveni’ office and the
restaurant, one might meet varying incarnations of belles-lettres, among
lawyers with punctured gowns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>far-away look, an assistant editor of ‘Triveni’,
with an outstanding story to his credit, which I had read. He seemed to stare,
with time enough. When he spoke of his forthcoming collection of poems, I
pitied the situation. By then, poetry meant melancholy to me; happiness lay
with prose. But he looked dedicated, doomed, and was later to make me think of
our generation as the doomed generation. His mind was fascinating like a fairy
castle which had to be scaled. I reviewed his book. For me reviewing was a
sibylline task, in which the reviewer had to weigh the chances of perfection
and immortality. <span class=SpellE>Isvaran’s</span> friendship was useful for
prosaic work too, when I was entangled in a private war of words on behalf of
Madras reviewers against <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span> bards. It was my
effort to drop gentleness and assume a Byronic ferocity befitting an ‘atheist,
socialist and vegetarian’, as I described my convictions of the time. Isvaran
was less contemporaneous, living within himself, in the drudgery of an inner
devotion, and his daemon, as I called it in commemoration of Goethe and Faust,
had to be roused. He too was to be a perfectionist in editing and later to edit
the ‘Short Story’, a model of that art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dropped in occasionally, gnome-like, kindly-looking, wise with <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>, his eyes glittering with fun, his solemnly
delivered similes contrasting with his effortless quips. I was not sure, that a
person with such orthodox looks should write good English prose. Writing to me
was either good prose or good poetry–and prose was intolerable for whole
seasons–and if any Indian attempted it, he must look like a Tagore or at least
like the <span class=SpellE>Chettur</span> Brothers. Venkataramani broke down
my resistance. He talked as he wrote, in cascades of similes. From him I learnt
that creativeness is sympathy. He was the antithesis of his environment but the
environment was essential for his integrity. I called him, in days when I did
not comprehend the importance of environment, ‘a lily in the mud of <span

He chattered endlessly, pontifically, but with humility. His book ‘Persons and

purposefulness of his writing and even the punctuation seemed to be affected by
high seriousness. Except for classics, I assumed the authority of Coleridge
towards books, though I cared as little for Coleridge as for <span

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I had expected A. D. <span
class=SpellE>Mani</span> to be a frosty, old professor from the way he had
reviewed <span class=SpellE>Isvaran’s</span> first book, on Venkataramani, and <span
class=SpellE>patronisingly</span> asked people to watch ‘the coming man’. From
the moment I saw him in the reading-room, elusively swimming in and out of
sight, smiling to himself, I knew it must be <span class=SpellE>Mani</span>.
His slippery walk and furtive, searching looks frightened me but there was no
avoiding him. He was chummy from the first meeting. From then I have been
‘Philip’ to him and he ‘Jimmy’ to me, after two writers of the day. His world
was the world of <span class=SpellE>Wodehouse</span> and Edgar Wallace.
Throughout the years we have remained warm-hearted friends in the profession,
except for a brief period on the Press Commission. We go about as old ‘Triveni’
boys, even claim that we started journalism from the gutters of the Armenian
Street. We discussed, and mostly dismissed, the journalists of the day,
competing vigorously in our conceit. It never occurred to us that we would
after some years be presidents of the two all-India organisations of the
profession. </span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

R. Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> must have been a French
academician and an authority on the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in
Europe, from the hefty manner in which he had written about Joan of Arc. His
humility and his young looks, when I was introduced to him by Isvaran, over the
noise of a ‘<span class=SpellE>kalakshepam</span>’ in the auditorium, were a
surprise. He seemed too eclectic in his tastes, tolerant in his criticism. He
was generous and reviewed my ‘Triveni’ article on ‘Modernists, Imagists and
Futurists’, recalling the unusualness of expression, in-one of the many
weeklies for which he wrote. I find that, after an enormous output, he is among
the Mandarins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were several others who, dropped in occasionally bridging <span class=SpellE>rumours</span>
of other literary worlds. From his tours, Ramakoti returned and talked of <span
class=SpellE>Phadke</span>, <span class=SpellE>Gokak</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Masti</span>, Madame Sophia <span class=SpellE>Wadia</span> and
literary circles and reputations in Bombay which were dim to us. Now and then,
we had Marco <span class=SpellE>Polos</span> like <span class=SpellE>Nilkan</span>
<span class=SpellE>Perumal</span>, art-critics like G. <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span>,
whose suave personality I had to engage one day single-handed and with nervous
enthusiasm, in the absence of Ramakoti. There were ‘<span class=SpellE>kalakshepams</span>’,
<span class=SpellE>Chidambara</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhagavathar</span>
completing the Ramayana twice, talks on culture, debates, oratory and nonsense,
and all the while Isvaran, whom Venkataramani would rag for slavery to the
printer’s devil, and Ramakoti, on the prowl for talent. I am not sure of the
sequence, nor am I sure that it was all as solemn as it seems now. The days
were hilarious, cold or sunny, troubled, crowded, but not dull. We were an
elite, not a clique. It was a club without rules. One day <span class=SpellE>Khasa</span>
dropped in, from a hospital, recovering from near-to-<span class=SpellE>deathness</span>
after a <span class=SpellE>lathi</span>-charge, a martyr and a figure of
interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Life
seemed larger than any service and Ramakoti was the centre of the universe. I
was in a world of books, and journalism was far below literature. The
newspapers were within my daily study, feasts of jargon and lawless syntax. I
wrote little, content to dream of writing classics. One day Ramakoti wrote in
exhausted despair an article ‘Bring Me Thy Failure’. I called it a lyric in
prose, though he would not concede it. It was the consummation of his <span
class=SpellE><i>sadhana</i></span><i>, </i>and it conveyed to me the essence of
the <i>Gita, </i>though I have cared little for that classic of ambiguity,
sought unsuccessfully to be annotated into faith. The article was a revelation
to me of the essence of a good editor’s sacrifice, how a writer has to be
ruthlessly subjected and reduced to ashes, so that an editor might rise from
them. I have seen editors selfishly project themselves and make their journals
advertisements of their self-esteem. I do not know if even <span class=SpellE>Massingham</span>
of the ‘Nation’ cared to set himself aside so gallantly as Ramakoti did to make
his journal express in its personality, which was his personality, the
many-sided singleness that can come only from the significance of many writers.
It was not safe for my conceit to live so close to a person of <span
class=SpellE>Ramakoti’s</span> severities. I could see how decisive were his
decisions, how imperious he could be in his tastes. He saved me from early
cynicism and from<i> </i>much else. But I was afraid of taking advantage of his
kindness, while loyalty, I thought, demanded that I should write for no other
editor. It explains the <span class=SpellE>meagreness</span> of my published
contributions in my most productive phase. The reading-room was my world; there
I could laze for hours, making a discovery of <span class=SpellE>Lucretius</span>
or carrying out, under Edith <span class=SpellE>Sitwell’s</span> influence,
experiments with verse texture to see its influence on rhythm. On some nights,
Ramakoti would call me to his room and ask me to talk. I had nothing to aid me
but a <span class=SpellE>gawk’s</span> <span class=SpellE>humour</span> to
decorate the trivial tales I could tell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

two political articles which swung me into journalism. The bitterness of
conviction was far away and dilettantism was an escape from life. After a long
measure of the dissipation of daily journalism, the old contempt for it has
returned. I might, it seems, be able to indulge in the ancient dream of writing
the whole of ‘Triveni’, the notes, the stories, the poems, the translations,
the book reviews. But Ramakoti is too good an editor to encourage such a parade
of perversion. And besides, in those days the whole of eternity lay before me
and there was the security of an unknown future. Now, it seems time is
shrinking, with life’s daily battle for integrity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

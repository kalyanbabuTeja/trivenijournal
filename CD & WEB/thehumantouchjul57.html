<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Krishna
Menon decided to retire from public life. After all it had been very tiring. He
deserved some rest now. ‘I shall sit down and write my story’, Menon seemed to
have thought. But to write one’s story one required, above everything else,
peace of mind and a quiet place. Can there be peace in a busy town? Not at all.
One should therefore escape from this wretched town and settle down in a quiet
corner. Menon had earned enough to live comfortably for the rest of his life;
and, as for family, he had none to look after. Although past sixty-one Krishna
Menon was still single and unmarried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
considering the pros and cons of every desirable place, he selected, in the
end, Kaladi, the birth place of Sri Sankara. Menon had a great admiration for
Sri Sankara. In fact Sankara was the only great person he cared for. And
Kaladi, the famous village, had a restful, languishing appearance, skirted, as
it lay, by lush green meadows on one side and the sleepy river on the other. It
was an ideal place to rest and ruminate. So thrilled by a new ardour of
impending authorship, Menon hastened to buy a bundle of writing paper, pencils
and a sharpener and left for Kaladi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
settled down in his study and pondered over the subject: How shall he begin his
story? Like the vague echoes of a Gurkha night watchman’s distant footsteps,
memories of a dim past reverberated in his mind. But they were confused and
none appeared to be clear-cut. He got up and went to the window and looked out.
Far away, the indistinct contours of the imposing ghats were visible, partly
merged with the clouds. How tiring it is to keep looking out, he thought.
Slowly he brought his eyes nearer home and looked over the fence at the
neighbour’s compound. Involuntarily his eyebrows twitched as they described
lines of disapproval on his forehead. Scattered all over the neighbor’s
compound were lying all sorts of articles made for children to play and create
noise with. A couple of drums, musical instruments, toys, whistles, a rubber
ball and a toy-house built of sand and flimsy wooden pieces. Evidently, Krishna
Menon ruefully thought, noisy children are about! That would be a nuisance
indeed! With noisy children around how can one obtain the necessary frame of
mind to sit and write? Gosh. It is going to be hell here. With a disturbed
feeling he went back and sat on his chair and kept sharpening his pencils.
While doing so his thoughts aimlessly wandered round the sharpener. Years ago,
while he was a small boy, Krishna Menon had longed for such a pencil sharpener.
But how many years it took to have that wish fulfilled! Strange, indeed; and he
sat writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About
writing, however, he had fixed ideas: His story should be lofty; the style
should be terse and crisp; and, above all, there should be nothing ‘small’
about that contents. So it was amazing for Krishna Menon to read what he had
already scribbled. It was in a style exactly opposite to Menon’s settled notions
of writing, and read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

earliest memory I have of my mother is a scene where she is giving me a bath. I
had scabies all over my body. Using some kind of a pulp made of the bark of
mango tree mother rubbed my body vigorously. The treatment was prescribed by a
local <i>vaidya; </i>curse be on him! I used to curse everybody and cry aloud
mustering all my vocal strength. Perhaps it was from this that a habit of
talking aloud developed in me in later years. I was reproached several times
for this habit. Why, I was even censured in court once by the learned Chief
Justice...!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Menon sat back on his chair, unbelieving...! Did he write that paragraph? “What
rubbish! What reminds me of these silly things now, anyway?” he seemed to ask
himself, un-believing and bewildered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was true. That was his earliest recollection of life. Trailing on this
memory came innumerable little, like incidents: His attachment towards the
neighbour’s pretty daughter, his own age; how they played, “Dad and Mum” etc.
Krishna Menon could not understand why he, a serious-minded man, should waste
time writing and ruminating over such trifles. Nonetheless he could not resist
the temptation to write in that strain. Will anybody read this rubbish? Will it
be interesting? What foolish things to write, Krishna Menon again thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
that very moment there came, from the adjoining compound, terrific shouts of a
boy and a girl. It was the spirited shouts emanating from the powerful lungs of
Kuttikrishnan and his sister who were till then held in bondage by their mother
to give them baths, but now released after bath. They came running, took drums
and whistles and musical instruments and started an orchestra of the most
infernal type. Krishna Menon got furious. Evidently, a man who came in search
of peace cannot be expected to compromise with that sort of hellish noise. He
called his servant and asked him in a loud tone of rebuke, audible to the
neighbour: ‘Look, what type of life exists there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at his window Krishna Menon overheard the conversation which offended him
considerably. ‘Imagine that woman’s cheek!’ he said to himself; ‘to say that I
cannot understand children, my foot! Wish she had seen what I have written
here!’ Trailing on this thought came various interesting little incidents of
his early childhood. There was an old man living near his house. My God, he was
the limit. He could not even think of children, let alone mixing with them. At
times, during play, their rubber ball used to bounce inadvertently into the old
man’s compound. He never had the decency to return the ball. Why not give a
thumb-nail-sketch of the old man? It will be interesting reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

went on and a full moon day came. Late at night Menon stood at his window
looking out. The night lay swooned in the lap of Nature, dressed in light and
shade. It was an enchanting sight to watch. Krishna Menon thought he saw two
figures moving in the neighbouring garden. They were talking in whispers, words
of love perhaps! He closed the window and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

a whole chapter on the episode. Readers relish that kind of stuff. What if the

thought...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

One day an old friend called on Krishna Menon. After the preliminary greetings
and enquiries etc., Krishna Menon showed him, with a good deal of hesitation,
the finished part of his story. The friend read it in silence, looked up, and
with a puzzled expression on his face asked: ‘Did you write this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Don’t I think it good? My God! It is incredible that you can write so well. I
know you pretty well, don’t I? And I had never dreamed that you were capable of
writing with such human sympathy and understanding. Even after reading it I
find it difficult to imagine that you wrote it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

visit to Cochin and back took a couple of weeks and when Krishna Menon returned
to his house at Kaladi he found that the neighbour and his family had left.
Menon breathed a sigh of relief: ‘Thank God, now at least I can write in
peace,’ he thought and settled down again to write. But he noticed a curious
thing: Words refused to flow. ‘This must be because I have been out of touch
for the past couple of weeks,’ he thought and looked out of the window. Quiet
reigned there. The place was deserted. He tried again to write. After a good
deal of struggle Krishna Menon brought out something. On reading it he found that
it read like an affidavit! The human touch was lost. But where did it go, he
wondered! The eyebrows twitched and described lines on his forehead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

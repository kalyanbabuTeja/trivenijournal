<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The news that Abhimanyu had been slain </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spread all along the battle-front and filled</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pandava hearts with grief. A messenger</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sped to the camp behind the fighting lines</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where ladies of the royal households stayed</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And, unwillingly and in halting words,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conveyed it to them. Oh, alack the day!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who can describe, or in what words, the grief</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That over-powered wife and mother? Who</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">can bear to think of that resounding wail</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And outcry. Sashirekha, wedded wife</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the young prince, now widowed, in ecstacy</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of sorrow, dropped to earth. Subhadra, mother,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crying a cry that seemed to break the welkin</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rolled on the ground. "My son, my darling child,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And have I lost you? and how shall I live</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without you? Why, oh, why did you insist</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And go to battle? Could you not have proved</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That you were such a hero without dying?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would not the world have praised you? Was there not</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A million of men to fight instead?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh son, why did you from my womb take birth</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it were just to die so young and cast</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This helpless woman on a sea of sorrow?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why shall I, now that you have left me, bear</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This life on earth? Is Krishna uncle to you?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Father, the great Arjuna? and valorous</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bheema, your father’s elder brother own?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And are they younger uncles, Nakula.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And Sahadeva, of whose prowess all</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world speaks in such praise? When you were little</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of them took you in their hands and kissed you</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And as you grew played with you" How could they,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without revulsion, find it in their hearts</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To let you go to battle, there to die,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And they themselves, arms folded, stay behind?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If these could thus abandon you what bond</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of blood or kin or love is there on which.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Men may rely? My boy, my child, those valiant</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And mighty men who led our hordes to battle,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could not a single one of them break through</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The murderous formation that closed round</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A boy so young? How could they leave their prince</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unhelped, to die?–a young one who could live,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If left to live, of days at least some twenty</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thousand, and let him die and live themselves?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What valour strange was this that dreaded death</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or was it but a wisdom years had brought?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yudhishthira, renowned for still refusing</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To bear what is unseemly, did he too</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consent to let you go? Did he not say</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘The boy is far too young.’ ‘I’d rather not</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Send out my handsome nephew.’ ‘Tis too early.’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did not Krishna think of me and save</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His sister’s son? The dream of Arjuna,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That you should in your fame for valour be</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His peer, has now become a dream indeed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alas, what fruit is this of what great crime</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of mine which blackened some past life? Woe! Woe!"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As thus the mother cried aloud and moaned</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In grief unbearable, to soothe her came</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her elder brother whom one half the world,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revered as god descended to the earth, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At sight of him, grief in the mother’s heart</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Grew four-fold and again she wailed and cried</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And fell upon his feet and begged of him</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To give her back her son, "You surely knew</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was too young, you knew I loved him so.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did you leave him to be slain? You might</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forget what else so ever but not that he </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was your own sister’s son. How could you leave him</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus to be slain, a mere boy as if </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He were no more than just a stranger to you? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Krishna took Subhadra up and looked</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With eyes, from which the light had gone, upon her– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet in those eyes was pity infinite– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And said in accents calm yet sad: "My sister,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A man is sent to battle-field because</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is a hero; not for that he is</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Related thus or thus to them who lead.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You surely know this just as well as I.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who would win the good should risk such loss</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In life on earth. We have to bear this grief:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both you and I. What if he died so young?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So young he won a fame that comes to few</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In greater length of life. Your son died great.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the thing achieved if one should live</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years on top of years without a name</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like piling grass in bundle upon bundle </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until a stack is made to which at last</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A spark of fire is set to burn it down</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the cremation ground? Of such a life</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each day is worth no more than wisp of straw,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Empty and of no value. What does man</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gain by collecting days innumerable</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To throw into the jaws of death? Of them</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not one remains and all is wiped away.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No life is such a life. Oh sister mine,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Know you not that your son by fame for valour</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fills the four quarters of the world? Are you not</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proud that you bore the hero whom all men</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Praise as so worthy? What can a mother have</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than the privilege that her son grow great?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your son, oh sister, put the last fine touch</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With his puissance on the noble picture</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limned by the lives of all the Pandavas,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And like the crescent moon that shines atop</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mount of Kailas and completes it, he,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fame that even to their fame adds beauty,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stands in eternal glory. Think of it</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And learn to withstand grief."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While thus he spoke</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subhadra, stormed by gusts of memory</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of what her son had said or how he looked</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or stood, was tossed as if her heart would break,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her pain soared in a peak without control, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And suddenly she fainted and fell down</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Krishna’s feet unconscious. Krishna sat</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon the ground there where his sister fell</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And took her head on to his lap as in</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The days of old when he was small and she</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was smaller still. Alas, he thought, that this,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My sister, should have come on grief so hard</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To endure. She cannot bear this pain and be</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sound in her mind unless the root of it,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thought of self undue that makes excess</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alike of joy and sorrow, be removed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No words of mine by play upon the ear </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can bring peace in her being. So he led</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her soul along a path in realms of dream</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And thus she dreamt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was again a young</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And growing girl and wandered fancy-free</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the gardens round Dwaraka, her joy of being</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tinting each moment of the live-long day</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Golden with hope of what should come. Spring came</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bringing soft sprout and tender leaf and flower</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To tree and creeper and eke to maiden hearts;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And parrots flew across blue bits of sky</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Garlanding them; and pairs of turtle cooed</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In love; and keen the cuckoo raised its note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And that same spring brought Arjuna to her,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hero disguised in garb of ascetics,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Winter’s moon in mist. All easily</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He won her love and threw himself and her</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon a sea of joy and stretched his arms</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And murmured, "Come my love": and she, too happy</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could she but do his wish, gave up herself</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And closed in love embrace and floated out</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In depths of happiness immeasurable,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eyes shut. Some moments passed and then she wished</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To look upon her lover and oped her eyes</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And he who held her was not Arjuna</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But Abhimanyu. Startled, she released</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Herself from that embrace and forthwith lost</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the thought of what had occurred, and again</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hied on another dream. And now she was</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proud mother of her newly-born son</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Named Abhimanyu by his uncles all,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In hope and pride that he would make their line</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Illustrious for prowess. She held him close</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And looked upon his lips and eyes and curls</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With eyes that knew not how to cease and whelmed him</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With kisses and again she pressed him hard</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against her breast and with that joy full filled</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her heart and mind and soul; and that she might</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Be undisturbed in it she closed her eyes</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And drank it in her being. When she had</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sunk deep in that deep happiness she would</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">look on the child again and oped her eyes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seemed to her then that he who lay so little</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within her arms against her breast was not</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Child Abhimanyu but Arjuna’s self</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And thus the wonder child herseemed to speak:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"My beloved, know you not that for the war</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of Bharata we need two Arjunas,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One Arjuna to live and one to die?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And I whom you have borne am one, the other</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is he whom Kunti bore." Again Subhadra</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Started, and lost the thread of thought again,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And on again she wandered in her dream.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Along a path, she felt, not known to her</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She walked upon a time and from afar</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Descried three figures Coming up to her.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She looked and saw that they were Arjuna,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Krishna and Abhimanyu. Eagerly</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She walked to them and all three looked on her</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But did not know her. Wondering she moved</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Close to them thinking: Well, how mad I was</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To think my son was dead. He’s hale and strong.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When with this thought she tried to touch the sob.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figure changed and seemed like Arjuna</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And what had borne the shape of Arjuna</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Took Abhimanyu’s shape. Subhadra tried</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To touch this Abhimanyu and he changed</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And wore the form of Krishna and the one</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That had been Krishna in that moment seemed</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be her Abhimanyu. So the mother </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tried oft to touch her son and found that form</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To change and change and change, each of the three</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That stood before her taking on the shape</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of Abhimanyu, Arjuna or Krishna </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And still eluding grasp; till, tired of trying</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And puzzled deep at heart, she wished to speak</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To Krishna asking what this thing could mean</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And fell upon his feet and cried: "Help brother." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then ceased her roaming in the realms of dreams</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And she awoke to find him tending her</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His eyes so full of pity. What matters it</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If when we call on God we are awake</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or in a dream? He hears either cry </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And stretches out His arms of help and saves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subhadra, calmer now, lay with her head,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A child again, on her great brother’s lap;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And he, in tone of deep concern yet calm, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Said: "Sister, you were troubled in your dream."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her strength depleted by overwhelming grief, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subhadra could not part her lips in speech</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And lying motionless just where she was</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She looked on Krishna and allowed her mind</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To dwell upon him. Then she in her heart</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Saw that in truth this being whom she knew</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As brother Krishna was all other selves;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And in great sadness said: "Krishna, oh brother, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was the need for all this? When a girl</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You gave me dolls and changed them as you willed </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And I a girl cared not; is later life</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of no more moment than is childhood’s sport </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And is it right to give a son and take him</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At will as if a doll?" Her words were few</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And weak like drops of a remainder shower</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That might follow a storm; Krishna was moved</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deeply as if to weep himself but withstood</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The poignancy of his grief. As if</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tears suppressed had turned to dark wry smile,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He smiled a cheerless smile in agony</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And said: "Oh sister, if the mass of men </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who live in ignorance said what you say</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should not wonder. But when it is you</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That speak so or when it is Arjuna</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That turns his face from the embattled front,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From pity for his kinsmen and his friends,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is then I know not what to think of it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You care for two out of this host. Your husband</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cares for another two. And he, my brother</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bala, two others, and thus all for whom </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I care, for others still, and still those others</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For still two others. If all these should live</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because I love them or those whom I love</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would have them live, will anyone be left</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To fight for righteousness, the general good?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There could be no such thing as this great war</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And unstrung bows would clutter up the ground</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And good and bad live as each wills and cares</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And never finger raised to put down evil.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I love you sister; I love Arjuna;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I love the other Pandavas; I loved</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your son, my nephew; and believe me, dear,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sons of queen Gandhari are to me</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All worthy pity; and each single one</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of these long serried ranks is dear to me.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whom shall I keep alive, whom leave to die?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And if I shall not bear the thought that any </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should die at all where will righteousness stand?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Alas" Subhadra sighed and said: "My brother,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whose is the fault and whom is it you kill?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Krishna replied: "You know Subhadra how</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is. All this world is but a life</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not many or a myriad lives. One life</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Includes the life of all of us. And when,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that one life, a limb errs there is pain</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over all the limbs, even those that not offend;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And when for righteousness men have to fight</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And at deep need, even the best of men</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should die for it. My sister, if a house</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should be on fire would we not pour on it,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To save it, all the water we can get?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The water kept for drinking, aye, the little</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those small cups that we have used in worship</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And consecrated, no less than that store,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For we would save the house? The right should live</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If living should be worthy; and, that it may,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The nephew of the Generalissimo</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May have to die as does the meanest soldier.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This age is running, sister, to its end.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sense of right and wrong no longer lives</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within men’s hearts, and low and evil thought</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And impulse are parading brazenly,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like dark malignant spirits of the night</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Walking in light of day; and doubt and wonder</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If what is right is worthwhile have become</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Common, and all the law of decent living</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is abrogated quite. We have to stem</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The onward march of these battalions</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of darkness and, to do this, should give up</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some goodness from our lives, some conduct good,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some lives that we would rather keep; to vanquish</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is malignant and infernal, man</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should make a sacrifice of things that he</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Holds dear and even sacred. This, our race, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has laid up tons of evil and should now</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work out that evil by this suffering.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debt needs must be paid. The better life</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will pay it quicker. Grieve not, sister mine,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That Abhimanyu died. Remember rather</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That Arjuna is left. I saw the two</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fighting the mighty men opposed to them</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And, sister, truly as I looked on them </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wondered if for doing doughty deeds</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this great war, my brother Arjuna</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had taken on two bodies. For the two,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Father and son, did each the other excel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You bore that son that Arjuna might live.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Believe me, Arjuna is truly he</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The son you think you have lost. My nephew is</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And has not ceased to be. He is in me</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In whom are all the lives that ever were</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And are and will be to the end of time."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So spoke the brother and the sister heard</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wisdom spoken in those accents sad</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet calm, and felt the truth of them a little.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But could not quite accept, remembering</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The son that had been and no longer was</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Present to earthly eyes. Yet in her heart </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She glimpsed that Krishna whom the gods worshipped </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was sole refuge in sorrow as in joy</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those who live, and that the son who died</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lived in him yet; and in this thought lay still</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon that lap on which the universe</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plays while it lives and dying finds its peace.</P></DIR>

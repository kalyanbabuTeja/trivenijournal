style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>INDIA’S
foreign policy now centres round the problem, to be or not to be a member of
the Commonwealth. The left wing parties in India, viz., the Socialists and the
Communists want to secede from the Commonwealth, while the Congress party
headed by Pandit Nehru is inclined to continue in it, provided our independence
is not affected. Apart from the Communists, who consider Moscow as their
Capital and the red flag with the hammer and sickle as their banner, the other
parties in In</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dia agree on the basic idea of an independent
foreign policy. While the Socialists consider that “neutrality would become a
farce if India w</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ere to retain her tie with the British
Commonwealth,” the Congress is of the view that membership in the Commonwealth
may not be detrimental to our independence in foreign affairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
‘anti-Commonwealthists’ argue that “the acceptance of membership would spell
disaster politically, economically and culturally.” It is held that India’s
neutrality and independence in foreign affairs would be next to impossible,
for, any association with the Anglo-American bloc will embitter our relations
with Russia. Moreover membership in the Commonwealth will be inconsistent with
our republican aspirations. Economically India may gain little, for, Great
Britain battered and impoverished, is herself looking to other countries for
economic assistance. Above all India may find herself as a distant relative in
that family of nations, for we have no common kinship or heritage with the
other Dominions in the Commonwealth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
under present conditions many of these arguments lose much of their force, for
they are based on the old conceptions of Dominion Status. To think that any
relationship with Great Britain will be a restriction on our Purna Swaraj is
like the child’s fear of the shadow. As early as 1926 describing the nature of
the British Commonwealth, the Imperial Conference declared, “free institutions
are its life blood, free co-operation is its instrument.” The Statute of
Westminster (1931) made it still further clear that Dominion Status is
equivalent to complete independence. If the test of sovereignty is unrestricted
freedom in internal and external affairs, the Dominions are sovereign bodies.
The Dominion Parliaments have complete legislative freedom. They may past any
laws, even though they may be repugnant to the laws of the British Parliament.
They have right to regulate or cancel the judicial powers of the King. In
Australia the right of appeal to the Privy Council is restricted and in Canada
the right of appeal in criminal cases has been repealed by the Dominion
Parliament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
same measure of independence is enjoyed by the members of the Commonwealth in
external affairs also. The Dominions have their own ambassadors and diplomatic
agents in foreign countries. For example Canada, in February 1942, signed an
agreement with the U.S.S.R. providing for an exchange of representatives. Today
all the Dominions are independently represented in the UNO. A Dominion may
declare war or conclude peace, though according to convention such matters have
to be communicated to the Governments of other members of the Commonwealth.
Some are raising a cry in pious horror that by joining the Commonwealth India
will not be able to remain neutral and will be involved in international
complications, nay, will incur the enmity of the Russian bloc of Powers. But
recent events have proved that neutrality is consistent with membership of the
Commonwealth. Did not Eire remain neutral during World War II? Nothing can
prevent India from remaining neutral, if she choose so, in the event of any
international conflict.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
is it possible and desirable to remain neutral in this atomic age of global
warfare? By posing to remain neutral we may incur the displeasure of all, of
the Russian as well as the Anglo-American blocs. As Pandit Nehru remarked, “no
country could be completely isolated. Subject to our being completely
independent we should develop as many contacts as possible.” Membership in the
Commonwealth, it is said, will strain our relations with Russia and the U.S.A.
As long as India does not hold any aggressive designs and imperialistic
ambitions, there should be no cause for Russia to misjudge our foreign policy.
The view that India will lose the friendship of the U.S.A. does not hold water.
Canada has been a member of the Commonwealth and also an ally of the U.S.A. Nor
have the other Dominions incurred the enmity of America. In fact ever since the
American War of Independence, Great Britain herself has been on the most
amicable terms with the U.S.A. and any idea that Britain in the near future
will let down old friends likc America is a madman’s dream. The Anglo-American
bloc has come to stay. Membership in the Commonwealth, far from embittering the
remtions between India and the U.S.A., will make the latter realise that India
is not after Russian Communism. There can be hardly any two views on the fact
that under present conditions the country which can best help India is America.
Thus by being a member of the Commonwealth India can establish close bonds of
relationship with the Anglo-American countries without losing even a semblance
of her independence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question of the Crown acting as a link between India, which has determined to
become a Republic, and the other nations of the Commonwealth has raised much
headache among constitutional pandits. Many artificial devices have been
suggested to solve this problem. It is suggested to make the Commonwealth a
two-tier affair, compromising those who owe allegiance to the King and others
who do not. Another plan would provide links only between the Heads of States
and the British King. But is the retention of the Crown as a link between the
nations of the Commonwealth inevitable? In fact, the Commonwealth in the recent
past has been gaining stability and strength not by the presence of the King
but by a common danger facing them all. Their common interests and common
aspirations are really acting as the strongest link. The Imperial Conferences
during the last world war and the recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers’
Conference in London have proved that a common ideology acts as a more lasting
link between nations of the Commonwealth than the common Crown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>The policy of racial
discrimination shown by South Africa and Australia also looms large in
determining India’s attitude towards the Commonwealth. In the face of the South
African Government’s outrageous treatment of the Indians there and of the white
policy of Australia, should India remain in the Commonwealth? While every
democrat must agree that racial discrimination is a relic of barbarism and
Hitlerism, we need not be carried away by the vain sentiments of self-respect
and dignity. India may be able to fight successfully with racialism and other
evils from within rather than from without the Commonwealth. Moreover as India
gains more and more strength and stability and takes the leadership of Asia,
all ideas of racial superiority will vanish as mist before the rising sun. So
let not any false apprehensions about our self-respect and honour stand in the
way of India joining the Commonwealth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India’s
continuance in the Commonwealth will signify “the blending of the West and the
East in the lofty task of building a lasting peace on the foundations of
freedom, justice and economic prosperity.” But to have such a happy
consummation the Commonwealth must be based on the high principles of equality
and justice. This requires in the first place a common citizenship. People in
the different countries of the Commonwealth must have dual citizenship–of their
mother country and of the Commonwealth. To make the Commonwealth a close-knit
organisation, a Commonwealth Council of Ministers consisting of persons
belonging to the member nations of the Commonwealth, must be created. The
Council should be meeting frequently, preferably at the different capitals of
the member nations, to deal with international and Commonwealth affairs. Issues
can be better understood by personal contacts than by interchange of telegrams.
A joint Commonwealth Secretariat may be created in London to look after the
different issues concerned with the Commonwealth. Prof. H. J. Laski goes to the
extent of proposing “a common Dominion entrance into the Civil Service.” If
steps </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

is a form of Government where the citizens exercise the right to make political
decisions through the representatives chosen by them and responsible to them
through the process of free elections.” The expression ‘Democracy’ has gained
so much prestige that countries with widely different ideologies adopted the
said designation with varying qualifications, such as People’s Democracy, Basic
Democracy, Guided Democracy etc. To avoid the confusion in terminology, it
would be convenient to describe the Indian Democracy as “Constitutional
Democracy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stated, the following are its main features: (1) Federation with bias towards
the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>; (2) Division of powers–territorial and
functional; (3) Representative Government through adult franchise; (4)
Responsible Government through parliamentary executive (Cabinet system); (5)
Social control of economic power; (6) Social justice, that is, the right of the
under-privileged to the States’ protection against ruthless competition; (7)
The high <span class=GramE>concept</span> of rule of law in which social
justice and freedoms are inextricably integrated; (8) The conferment of power
of the higher judiciary to enforce fundamental rights, to maintain a just
balance between freedoms and social justice and to function as a balancing
wheel of federation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the said constitutional scheme the end and the means are equally important;
together they form one ideology. The basic assumption underlining the Constitution
is that the different parties seeking power <span class=SpellE>thereunder</span>
should accept its philosophy; they must believe in constitutional democracy,
free elections, fundamental rights, rule of law and social and economic
justice. If any party does not believe in any of the said concepts, it has no

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>destructive
forces and their elimination is <i>sine <span class=SpellE>quanon</span> </i>for
its success. The essential requisite for the flowering of democracy is the
cultivation of the people’s emotional attachment to the nation’s Constitution.
The Constitution of a country is its greatest unifying force. Power to amend it
is a constitutional device to maintain its stability. It can ordinarily be
exercised to solve unforeseen constitutional dead-locks. But for many reasons,
the Constitution is fast losing its sanctity. Constitutional commands ceased to
have any meaning. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

If power can </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>amend it, opposition can equally demand it.
Double standards cannot enhance its prestige. A stage has now been reached when
every power-group in the country asks for the amendment of the Constitution to
serve its purpose. Systematic and sustained attempt shall be made to <span
class=SpellE>instil</span> in our younger generation an emotional attachment to
our Constitution. Disrespect to the Constitution leads to the inevitable
deflation of the rule of law. <span class=SpellE>Agitational</span> approach to
solve problems is a new and dangerous trend. <span class=SpellE>Bundhs</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Gheraos</span> and other violent demonstrations have become the
order of the day. Discussion, persuasion and decision by majority votes are the
life-blood of democracy. Agitation and violence are antithetical to discussion
and majority decision. Democracy and violence cannot. <span class=GramE>stand</span>
together. Rule of law should become our way of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is an insidious attack on the federal structure of our country. It is said that
federation is not conducive to democracy and that it could successfully be worked
only in a unitary State. Federation helps democracy. It is indeed a modern
formula between <span class=SpellE>fractionalisation</span> which is
destructive of national solidarity and <span class=SpellE>centralisation</span>
which is destructive of local autonomy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

different parties came into power at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> and

remedy is not to decry federation but to strengthen it by evolving conventional
arrangements for mutual adjustment. The instruments designed to preserve it
have to be maintained at the highest level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

now practically one party was in power both in the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>

power in different State. Hereafter the emphasis must be more on co-operation than
on control, more on patriotism than on authoritarianism, more on health,
competition in common interests than on regimentation, more on service than on
power, more on </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next defect is the lack of strong party system. It is axiomatic that without
two or three strong parties, the experiment in democracy is doomed to failure.
There could not be such parties unless there is a democratic procedure within
the structure of individual parties. Absence of such procedure makes a party an
instrument of emotional leaders rather than the voice of a broad section of the
population holding similar political views. Each party should evolve some kind
of self-regulating machinery for enlisting persons, believing in the ideology
of the party, for preparing a list of such members and for preventing rigged up
elections in the name of consensus. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a systematic stilling of the voice of intellectuals at the party elections

remedied, the standard of the legislature cannot possibly be raised. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

struggle brought compulsive cohesion between different ideologies and the
common adherence to power continued the bond. Heroes of the national struggle
caught the nation’s eye. It has kept the party in the office for 20 years. The
concentration of economic and political power cleverly exercised, heralded the
danger of one-party Government. Its perpetuation would have been the end of
democracy in our country. The result of the new elections is that the pendulum
has swung to the other extreme. There is now one party with different
ideologies and coalitions of different parties with irreconcilable conflict of
ideologies. The nation is on the horns of a dilemma. The political scene is in
a fluid state. Paradoxically from this confusion the party system may evolve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

party should cleanse its stable. It shall only recruit members who believe in
its ideology and expel those who do not believe in it but only attracted to it
by the lure of power or profit or only roped in to support a particular
personality. The main reasons for defections are (1) lack of belief in the ideology
of the party; (2) corruption in its comprehensive sense; and (3) honest change
of ideology. Defection is a necessary evil. It cannot be washed away. It cannot
also be regulated by law. It is one of the processes by which <span
class=SpellE>crystallisation</span> of party system may be effected. It is the
only safety valve for misfits or the disillusioned ones to escape from the
unwanted party. Defections, with a few exceptions, will stop automatically with
the formation of parties based on definite ideologies or they can be controlled
thereafter by inter-party conventions. A defector may then only be accepted
subject to the condition that he resigns and gets elected on the recipient’s
ticket. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is more at the present juncture, democracy itself is in danger, and there is
urgent need to stop the rot. The entire party system is now in a fluid state.
Any false step may lead us to totalitarianism and all the sacrifices of the
pre-independent generation will go in vain. This is not the time for internal
squabbles or jockeying for positions. The true call for sacrifices,
statesmanship and patriotism. Broadly stated, there are two conflicting forces,
one democratic and the other authoritarian one–one for individual liberty
subject to social control and the other for <span class=SpellE>statism</span>.
These two forces may be <span class=SpellE>crystallised</span> into two
different parties. The best way–and it appears to me to be the only right
way–is to form coalitions at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> and the
States of parties with ideologies nearer to each other which enable them to
implement an agreed programme. Such coalitions will not only give stability to
our country during these difficult days but it will help in the building up<i> </i>of
a two-party system. Such parties by working together may find that there is
more in common between them than their difference and they may ultimately merge
in one party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are working democracy on an illiterate basis. Universal education is a distant
cry. But the political parties shall educate the rural electorate through mass
media on the fundamentals of different ideologies, instead of projecting the
images of personalities. That apart even the members of the legislature should
form study circles to equip themselves on the burning questions in the
different fields of legislative activity. In course of time, this will help not
only to raise the stature of the legislative assemblies and make them useful
instruments of national development, but it will also help the people to judge
the <span class=SpellE>calibre</span> of its representatives by their
performance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

category of independent members is not conducive to the development of party
system. They come to legislature with open mind; they upset party calculations;
if the margin of the majority party is slight they hold it to ransom. More
often as not they join the party in power. Sometimes they join the opposition.
Law should prohibit the candidature on an independent ticket. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pollutes the springs of elections. Candidates are selected, votes are given,
proportion of ministers is fixed on the basis of sub-castes. Members of small
castes are no where in the body politic. Indeed they have become second class
citizens. Law and social reform should join hands to exercise this evil spirit <span

been artificially inflated. It has thrown up divergent and conflicting views.
Language is a sensitive area and any further drift in this regard will affect
the unity of our country and our democratic processes. This problem cannot be
solved on party basis or on the foot of majority votes. This can only be
tackled by a high power committee of intellectuals on a non-party level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

be tackled at national level. Political power should acquire national outlook.
The entire energies of our nation should be <span class=SpellE>canaised</span>

right conduct. Corruption cannot be controlled if it is connived at the highest

following guide lines for the control of the powers of Governors: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Governor is a constitutional head and must function in terms of the
Constitution. He is not an agent of the Central Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Except in regard to matters specifically entrusted to his discretion, he must
discharge all his functions after taking the advice of the Ministry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

As a constitutional head in exercising his powers in the matter of appointment
and dismissal of the Ministry and the dissolution of the Council he should
follow the following conventions: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(a)
If a leader of the party has majority in the House, he should ask him to form
Ministry; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(b)
If no party has a majority but a coalition of the parties is formed and elected
a leader, he should call upon him to form a Ministry; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(c)
If no such coalition is formed, the leader of the largest group should be
called upon to form Ministry subject to the condition that he should get the
confidence of the legislature within the shortest possible time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(d)
If he fails he should be given an opportunity to the leader of any other party
who offers to form a Ministry. If all the attempts fail then only there is a
case for dissolution and new elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deserters shall wait till the next session is held in the usual course and then
move a no confidence motion in the Ministry. So too the discretionary powers of
the President in regard to the appointment of the Ministry, dismissal of the
Ministry and the dissolution of the Parliament should be governed by similar
conventions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

materialism is engulfing the young mind. Unless it is tempered by spiritualism,
it will lead to the deterioration of the values of life. Democracy cannot
function in the vacuum caused by atheism or <span class=SpellE>agnostism</span>.
There is a wrong impression that our Constitution is against religion. The
State no doubt has no religion, and religion has no place in the affairs of the
State. There is a constitutional declaration of the doctrine of tolerance, but
it enables the State to create the necessary secular<i> </i>conditions so that
every person in India has the freedom of conscience. All the great religions by
healthy competition should instill in the young minds the eternal truths.
Without this, democracy will not succeed, and it will give place to sheer
materialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have great faith in the institution of Democracy. The intellectual level of our
country is comparatively high. We have had experience in the working of
democratic institutions, for a long time. Let us work our democratic

Utopia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

quarter under review has been dominated by the formation of the Executive
Governments in the States and the Centre. While the States with secure
majorities of a single party, have taken the task somewhat leisurely, the
States like Pepsu, Madras and Travancore-Cochin have had exciting times. The
formation of the so-called United Fronts to prevent the Congress party from
forming the Government, wherever it had no majority, has been a noteworthy
feature. The practical-minded Kerala politicians solved the situation simply by
the Congress party which was in a forty per cent minority, winning over the
Travancore Tamil Congress and a few independents, and were able to establish a
stable, Government. In Pepsu a different picture emerged. The Congress party in
a minority was hastily allowed to form the Government depending on the support
of uncertainty elements who promptly crossed the floor, and on the day of the
Rajapramukh’s address, a walk out by thirty-two out of the Sixty members showed
the precarious situation. The Cabinet which took office on 19th March, was kept
alive till 20th April when the Chief Minister resigned and a new Chief was
sworn in. In Madras elaborate preparations had been made, to forestall a
Congress Ministry being formed, by the astute rebel leader of the K. M. P.
party at Madras who by a marriage of convenience with the Communist party and a
number of other small groups had got ready to make a bid for leadership of the
Government. The Governor following constitutional procedure, in the absence of
any single party having a majority, called on the leader of the largest </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>single
group to form a council of ministers. This was the signal for a series of
actions, which did not enhance the fitness for </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>constitutional
methods of the frustrated opposition. Interrupting the Governor just as he was
about to address the joint Houses of the Madras Legislature, making a statement
and staging a walk out by a good proportion of the members, an unusual scene
was created. In spite of a motion of disapproval which was moved by the Leader
and withdrawn after discussion, out of certain consideration for seniority, the
practice of walk out has persisted Walk out has also been practised in Pepsu, Bengal,
Hyderabad and other State Legislative Assemblies. The General Elections have
introduced into the sober atmosphere of our country’s legislative chambers a
new element, clamant, confident, assertive, and somewhat reckless. Following
British example it has been the old custom to conduct political discussions of
questions of a controversial nature with decorum and restraint; but everywhere
now we find an extreme sense of self-righteousness and intolerance of opposing
points of view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

acceptance of the leadership of the Congress party and the executive headship
by our sage elder Sri Rajagopalachari has given satisfaction to the general
public of Madras State and opens a new era of stable and efficient governance
of the State. He has already signalised his re-entry into political activity by
his able conduct of Rayalaseema famine relief, and his leadership of the
country by adopting decontrol of foodgrains. On the introduction of the budget,
the Leader has caused another departure by initiating a motion asking a vote of
confidence, which after four days of debate was passed by a comfortable
majority of the Lower House on 3rd July. But it has not been all plain sailing.
The Opposition has taken full opportunity to arraign the Congress
administration of the last five years. Rajaji has, ever since his assumption of
office as Chief Minister, made an open declaration that Communist ideology and
methods will be treated as public enemy No. I, and both earlier and during the
debate on the vote of confidence, explained fully his views. Speaking on May 9
in the Madras Legislative Assembly, Rajaji explained the technique of the
Opposition in the following words: “But what is the policy on the other side?
Every difficulty of the country, every discontent in the country, every
complaint must be taken up, interpreted in the language of
opposition...expanded, exaggerated, repeated, added to and rolled on and made
to grow like a snow-ball so that the Government may get a bad name. They want
industrialisation on the one hand and on the other cottage industries. They
complain of the poor man derived of land in one place, and in another they urge
that the land must be taken away from its holder and nationalised. Every kind
of contradictory satisfaction to every kind of discontented man–that is the
technique of Communism in India...Do not lay traps for the people...By all
means work for Socialism. By all means put Socialism before the country if you
like. But in trying to capture Parliamentary backing for your policy do not
tell stories, exagge</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rate or go and work up discontent, do not
entrap people...The </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>programme of exploitation of every
grievance in the world brought together in speeches and writings, pictures and
photographs, cannot be promoted without the Government defending the people
against it.” Rajaji with his inside knowledge of this technique, acquired
during his two years’ custody of the Central Home Affairs Ministry, has proved
a little too astute and the Communist opposition is naturally a little angry
with him for re-entry into active politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

spite of our Prime Minister’s wish to infuse fresh blood, and to draw fresh and
vital people as a result of the General Elections, many of the States with
comfortable Congress majorities have put back in places of power and leadership
the old war-horses, trusted and tried leaders of the people–B. C. Roy in
Bengal, Pandit Pant in U. P., Pandit Shukla in Madhya Pradesh, Bhimsen Sachar
in the Panjab; and in Assam, Orissa and Bombay changes have been a minimum. The
debates in the House of the People have taken on new levels of acerbity and
cleavages in points of view are getting more sharp. The debate on Kashmir while
Home Affairs were discussed, and the Prime Minister’s intervention in the
Budget debate were marked by interruptions and hot exchanges, where certain
members reached new limits of extravagance in the expression of their
differences. New life and young life have their own disadvantages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>On 17th March the Prime Minister laid the first
steps for a factory at Bulsar to manufacture dyes and pharmaceutical products,
like sulpha drugs and folic acid. This 20-crore scheme will raise a new
township and create a valuable industry. In Bombay on 19th March the then
Minister of State for food, Mr. Tirumala Rao, laid the foundation for a cold
storage plant for quick freezing, at a cost of twelve lakhs, capable of
processing five tons of fish within eight hours. The new mint at Alipore near
Calcutta is house in a fifty acre colony, and is capable of going into
production in eight months, processing two lakh coins a day, and is equipped to
strike medals and tokens. A Commission on Secondary Education was to be set up
and it has been announced on 6th July that the Vice-Chancellor of Madras
University has been appointed Chairman of the Commission, which is evidently
meant to do for school education what the Radhakrishnan Commission tried to do
for University education. Steps are under way for a Telecommunications Training
Centre at Jubbulpore, for a high altitude research station and the world’s
highest meteorological observatory on Nanga Parbat. On 29th March was announced
the organisation of a Bharat Seva Samaj to co-ordinate all social services
under the auspices of the Planning Commission; and on July 4th misgivings were
expressed in the Budget debate as to this organisation being a Government move
to monopolise an important line of activity; the Prime Minister cleared
misgivings and assured members that it would be open to all individuals in the
country to join and work in the Bharat Sevak Sangha. On 3rd April, the
establishment at Delhi of an All-India Medical Institute for higher training
was foreshadowed. New Zealand for its share of the Colombo Plan was
contributing a million sterling for this institute and appropriately Mr. Watts,
the representative of New Zealand, laid the foundation stone. The expert
committee for this purpose will have Dr. A. Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar as
Chairman. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mr. Munshi inaugurated on 18th April a cattle
breeding centre at Hessarghatta, 16 miles from Bangalore, as an important step
to improve the quality of Indian cattle. On 7th May was inaugurated at Delhi a
community project workers’ conference lasting seven days. Pandit Nehru spoke
feelingly as follows, addressing Development Commissioners: “If you think it is
your business to sit in a big office and issue orders you are no good for this
job... Whether it be a Development Commissioner or administrator, he must take
a spade and dig. No man connected with this scheme will be effective if he
merely sits in an office.” The training included visits to Faridabad, Nilokheri
and Etawah. Another step of importance is the scheme announced on 15th June of
the expansion of Madras harbour at a cost of six crores; provision will be made
for holding nine to eleven ships at a time; two more berths are to be provided.
Since then, it was announced on 6th July that a crore and a half would be
expended in the first year. A hundred University students did a remarkable
project as a vacation work in road-building in Himachal Pradesh. On 2nd was
announced the starting of a new hospital in Bombay solely for industrial
workers, the first of its kind in the country. The celebration of the Zamindari
abolition in U. P. on 1st July was a unique phenomenon. This hundred and fifty
year old institution ended at a stroke. Twenty-lakh Zamindari estates passed
into the State’s control, a hundred and fifty-five crores of compensation is
involved. The estates will bring nine crores to the U. P. exchequer.</p>

arrest and release of Mr. Mistri, Deputy Editor of <i>Blitz</i>, caught the
Executive napping. The supreme court held that Article 22 (2) of the
Constitution had been contravened. The appointment of Syed Fazl Ali, a Supreme
Court judge, on retirement as Governor of Orissa has been another action
capable of misunderstanding. If the impartiality of the highest Judiciary is to
be left impaired, they must not be tempted by favours by the Executive; any
hobnobbing of the Judiciary with the Executive will go against a fundamental
axiom, viz, not only should justice be done but it must also appear to have
been done. A noteworthy event was the four day music festival in honour of
Vishnu Digambar. The President inaugurating the festival pointed out how the
great artist had no peer in devotional music; he was a great mystic who
revitalised Indian music. Another event of increasing significance is the
progress of Acharya Vinoba Bhave’s Bhudan Yajna. As he has pointed out, this
voluntary gift of land is the only workable alternative to Communism, which
having no soul, is alien to Indian genius. Shanker Rao Deo has resigned
Congress Secretaryship in order to devote himself to Sarvodaya Samaj work and
help in the realisation of Bhudan movement. Targets have been fixed for the
various States and the movement gains apace. One of the subjects that roused
very violent feelings has been the redistribution of the Railway Zones, in the
North-Eastern and Eastern Zone. A token strike was staged in Calcutta on 7th
May, when the Transport System came to a standstill for eleven hours, to
express sympathy with the railway workers affected by the Zonal re-arrangement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

great educationist, one of the three greatest in the history of educational
theory and practice, ranks with Froebel and Pestalazzi as the great emancipator

children, she discovered special methods of sense-training in childhood which,
when applied to normal children, produced astonishing results and ended in her
becoming a world-famous educator. Possessing a winning personality, with
queenlike grace and dignity, Madame Montessori was a remarkable genius, whose
memory will remain as long as children need education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

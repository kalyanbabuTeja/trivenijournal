mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>ALL experience is organised, is real. There is not
just a blur of phenomena, but things separate themselves out into a spatial
world. In the same way feelings are organised, they come to a point in the ego,
they have stability and radiate out and have broad drives and homogeneities.”
So writes Christopher Caudwell in his famous book, <i>Illusion and Reality</i>.
History reveals the chronicled experiences of man in his struggle for security.
The struggle has not ceased. Every moment of breathing is a moment of anxiety
for man who is still ignorant of the triumph of death. After living anxious
days in company with beasts he made weapons of war for defence and offence. His
war was with the inhabitants of the jungle, waged not with knowledge of that
ego, but with a permanent wish to assuage the pains of hunger and thirst. Man
evolved and changed; he left the primeval caves to build universities. He
studied the laws of economics, ownership of land and conditions regulating
labour. He felt war is a necessity and that peace could prevail when swords
flashed out of their scabbards. He had poets to teach wisdom, but that wisdom
never percolated through the iniquitous terrains of the human heart. Poets got
wild. In the West and in the East, the children of Cain, self-taught and
self-possessed, appeared to tar the conscience of society. Man no more remained
an individual. He belonged to a State or a Society. So the angry poets too
belonged to a Society. They too had to spend days of anxiety and they could
have no audience to hear love-lyrics and chamber music. In England Mr. T. S.
Eliot brought to the well-meaning public a collection of his own ideas–poems in
form–teaching that history betrays and poets too have a liberty to legislate
for the progress of man. Eliot was a spiritual growth of a generation which
steeped itself in multi-political ideals and destructive science. He never
cared to give constructive ideas; he criticised; he warned of impending perils.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>W. H. Auden in no surprise saw in the awakening a
new gloom. Nature has given Auden a special strength to laugh at humanity:
tearing it to shreds but without molesting its conscience. After the War of
1939, the conscience of humanity, especially the conscience of the society of
the nations in the West, was in an etherised condition, corpse-like, dreadful,
which this brilliant poet, more a psychologist, a student of Freud, could never
hope to molest. He gazes on it in a moment of tense anxiety. The poet in him
desires to be of another world while the thinker, the curious seeker in him
wants to break from society and watch “The Age of Anxiety.” He is anxious to
know of the elusive travels of human emotions. But for him emotions have a
meeting point. They differ to unite, they fight for peace, they struggle for
sustenence, and they lie for rising. They have no extinction. With the flow of
time emotions are born with an ever-present doom. To Maurice Cranston Auden
said: “In the war years, a poet had to be other-wordly. At any rate, I did.
There was just nothing to say about the chaos of this world. All that could be
said had been said. There was no point in my saying it again, a little more
hysterically.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Auden calls the poem <i>A Baroque Eclogue</i>. In
the Prologue are presented four people: Quant, a clerk in a shipping office,
Malin, a medical intelligence officer in the Canadian Air Force, Emble who
“hoped to read in all those faces the answer to his own disquiet,” and Rosetta,
a New York department store worker noted for her capacity in making money
though possessed of “a sensible horror of being poor.” The place is, first a
Third Avenue Bar, then a Manhattan apartment. The time is an All Souls’ Night
during the War. The experiences of these three men and one woman have some
significance to Auden which he does not sever and show.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>RAJAJI occupies the most eminent position in our
country today as the first Indian Governor-General of Free India, and by virtue
of intrinsic personal qualities, he has won the respect and affection of
millions in this country and abroad. The biography of such a distinguished
person is therefore most opportune. The author, who has made a name as a writer
of biographical sketches, makes no claim to give us an authorised biography,
nor even a well-documented one. He desires to give a ‘black and white sketch’
and claims to write without bias of any kind. Though fully alive to the
limitations of material at his disposal, the author does not ‘want some facts
about him to lose their freshness’ and he has therefore ‘become bold to record
them in a timely volume such as this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Rajaji’s early life, till he began to take a
prominent part about 1917 with the advent of Gandhiji in Indian political life,
are very briefly dealt with and occupy no more than about 30 pages of the book.
There is little information of his scholastic period, which was brilliant, or
of his legal career, which was certainly distinguished, considering that he had
come to occupy a front rank in a District Headquarters town even before he was
forty. Rajaji’s collaboration with Gandhiji and his Congress work are also but
briefly sketched. Rajaji’s Premiership at Madras, the parting of ways (in
1942), the ‘cliques’ working against him and the still more recent events in
his life as Governor of West Bengal and as Governor-General occupy more than
half of the book. There are concluding chapters dealing with the contrast
between Gandhiji and Rajaji, with Rajaji’s ideas and with Rajaji as the artiste.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In spite of a certain straightforwardness and
raciness in phrasing and style, we are bound to say that the book is very
uneven both in regard to quality and quantity. It is to be regretted, of
course, that the author, on his own showing, has not had occasion to come into
intimate contact with the subject of his biography, nor has he had the benefit
of getting materials for the biography from those who had: he seems to have
relied more on stray cuttings of speeches from newspapers. The result is that
the earlier struggles, the sustained and patient effort, of trial, of
misunderstanding and even frustration which Rajaji passed through and which are
indeed responsible for his hold on the respect and affections of his
countrymen–these receive very perfunctory treatment; and what Rajaji has
achieved in the limelight, particularly his doings and going out and coming in
as Governor or Governor-General, occupy more space in the narration. It is
doubtless hard to gather, and give shape and proper expression to his days of
effort and travail, but the significance of a life such as Rajaji’s is lost if
such material which forms the background is not given due prominence. Further,
in spite of the author’s diligence in compiling the facts more well-known, a
few slips<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lined up with Deshabandhu Das (p. 32), whereas he was a no-changer and in the
other camp; the Congress at Gaya did not decide in favour of Council-entry as
mentioned by the author (p. 32); the Swarajist Party did not just fade out on
the death of Das, as suggested by the author (p. 33); it was not in 1929 but in
1930 that there was Civil Disobedience, the salt satyagraha in which Rajaji
took part; (p. 37); Rajaji did not seek to introduce Hindi in the Primary
Classes (p. 50), but at the post-primary stage; Gandhiji during the days of his
Madras visit in 1946 did not spend a good deal of his time to compose the
differences between the rival groups in the Congress camp (p. 103), etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The book would have gained greatly by a thorough
revision and would have been free from slipshod sentences and school-boy
errors: “Rajaji is the one Indian preferred to remain in the laps of the gods
(p. 34)”; “I was pointed out to a plot of land (p. 11)”; “They (pamphlets)
strike me of the enormous capacity of Rajaji…(p. 34)”. “(A Professor) developed
a partical liking for him (p. 11)”; “books published for good purpose (p. 37)”;
“it was alright (p. 46)”. Mr. Perumal repeats the old story about Gandhiji
speaking of Cripps’ proposals as a post-dated cheque <i>on a crashing bank</i>,
where, of course, the last phrase was a mischievous addition later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In spite o£ these lapses, the author has the gift
of the good sketch-writer, of seizing on the essentials and hitting off in a
few deft strokes the outlines of a vivid picture. This, for instance, is very
neat: “Rajaji is no orator to be sure. His speeches are not enthusiastic
outbursts but calm personal conversations with large audiences” (p. 131) and
the author has heard him but once! “He is firm-willed, steady, and knows his
path as clearly as an eminent seafarer knows his route.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Yoga-asanas, deep-breathing exercises, etc., as handed down from ancient days,
conducive to the maintenance of sound health, is in need of no special pleasing
at this time of day, There has been a great revival of interest in the theory
and practice of Yogic exercises, and valuable pioneering work and propaganda
have been done by numerous individuals and institutions all over India. The
author of this book, a Russian by birth, and a society lady, got interested in
Yoga, and underwent a course of instruction in the Yoga-shala at Mysore. She
proved to be an apt pupil, and not only benefited greatly by going through the
dietetic disciplines imposed on her and the exercises taught to her, but
conducted a school in China and taught others as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kundalini and general rules on exercises, diet and hygiene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Reading the book, one is tempted to ask the
question that was put to the author in China: “Why is it that Indians are so
poorly built, weak, and sickly, if Yoga practices result in a healthy,
proportioned body with a strong power of resistance?” The author goes on to
say, “To this I had to answer that although India was the cradle of Yoga, very
few people there practice it.” Not a comforting remark by any means. One hopes
that with our new-found Independence something would be done to popularise the
practice of Yogic physical culture to the extent it is safe and feasible. But
then, one must remember that many of those who have the ordering of these
things still belong to an older generation and look upon all this as ‘nonsense’
even as the husband of the author did. For instance, the claims made by the
very Yoga-shala at Mysore, from which the author of this book took her
instructions, was not recognised by an expert committee of the Mysore
University itself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Dora were chums from childhood. On no account would they remain apart from
each other. Dora was an English greyhound, his ancestors hailing from the great
metropolis of London and hence his name. But Jolly was an antelope of the wild
forests of Orissa. Dora was thoroughly carnivorous and Jolly an austere
vegetarian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Jolly lavished all her affection on Dora. Dora came
round at last as if through Jolly’s caressings and began walking slowly. But on
the advent of spring and floral wealth, the two pals played about and ran like
mad in the direction of the southwind to discover as it were, the mysterious
world whence this stream of delight came flooding. As he ran Dora appeared like
a thread straightened on the ground, with his limbs hardly to be distinguished
from his body. But Jolly’s race was a veritable Paris dance. Her legs seemed to
float over the surface of the ground. She was simply dancing in the air.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Zamindar was intensely fond of the two animals. When after the day’s heavy
work, he came out for a stroll on the extensive lawn in front of his office,
these two creatures amused him with their sweet company and sportive movements.
As the master trotted on, Jolly rubbed her long neck against his legs and
licked his hands. If ever Dora remained behind, he came swiftly running ahead,
prostrated before his master, waving his tail submissively. Sometimes he found
his way in between his two legs and thus slackened his walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other dogs appeared with a greedy look at Jolly, she squeezed herself with fear
and took shelter by her master’s side. Then, Dora would come forward, readily
prepared to fight when his kinsfolk would meekly retire, with tails tucked in
between their legs. For they were nut unaware of Dora’s supreme strength. His
sense of prestige was definitely superior to that of ordinary stray dogs. He
would not stoop to the unchivalrous act of chasing a fugitive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

blades of grass from the garden when Jolly came in slow steps and gently
presented her mouth before </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

in his easy chair in the veranda the Zamindar watched the sportive movements of
his pets and his care-worn heart filled with joy. The Zamindar was a man of
up-to-date ideas, pleasant and polite in his manners. He appeared as a pure
Swadeshi, with a <i>Punjabi </i>and <i>Chaddar </i>before his countrymen and as
a perfectly Europeanised Indian before foreigners. European officers of rank
would come during holidays for <i>shikar </i>in the jungles of his estate, for
whom his generous hospitality was ever open. A well-equipped guest house had
been specially erected for the purpose. He was equally hospitable towards his
educated and respectable tenants, who never failed to receive befitting treatment
from him. Notwithstanding this, the opinion of the public in general did not go
in his favour. He was degraded and irreligious according to the orthodox, and
he was accused by others as a reckless and extravagant oppressor. Above all,
his close contact with Europeans and his adoption of some of their customs
impaired his many virtues. In fact his food and dress were greatly influenced
by European habits and he lacked the moderation necessary in this respect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

D.I.G. of Police, an old friend, had sent word that he was coming during the
ensuing Christmas for a <i>shikar </i>excursion with his wife and children. So
the guest house was kept tip-top and tents were pitched in the forest four days
ahead of their arrival. Men were sent to Cuttack to purchase the necessary
articles. The servants and officials of the Zamindar were all up with work.
Nobody had even a moment’s respite, and showers of abuse from everyone poured
on the Zamindar, behind his back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

place for <i>shikar </i>was about fourteen miles away from the Zamindar’s
house. There was scarcely any human habitation in the neighbourhood. <i>Khansamas
</i>and servants had left in advance with articles of food and other things.
The guests, the Zamindar, the D. I. G.’s two hunting dogs and the Zamindar’s
Dora and Jolly went in a motor car after them. It was apparently unnecessary to
take Jolly along with them, But Dora would be of great help during <i>shikar </i>and
she was taken only to keep him in good cheer. For he would always seek to run
back to her whenever he got an opportunity. As a matter of course, the little
mistress’s consent was also obtained for their removal. She had strictly
ordered her father that her two playmates might not be detained for more than
three days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

five days passed quickly amidst the mirth and jollity of merry Christmas. In

luncheon, the Zamindar and the D.I.G. started for the <i>shikar. </i>For the
last four days the ladies had dances and songs. This day they were not in a
mood to accompany the men. The servants were almost worn out with the few days’
toil, even though they had not killed a kitten. However, some two or three of
them had to accompany the <i>shikaris.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

missed aim once or twice at birds, it became wellnigh impossible to attempt on
them any more. To give the birds time to come back and sit again, the <i>shikaris
</i>entered the adjoining forest. They wandered about for some time but to no
purpose. The servants were sent out in quest of prey. But who knows whether
they sat gossipping or lighted their <i>cheroots </i>or prepared tobacco powder
with their thumbs pressing on palms? The two friends stealthily and cautiously
searched jungle after jungle. And all unawares, they had come to a distance of
four miles away from the camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day was at its end. The sun had hidden itself behind the nearest hill. But its
crimson streaks were diffused across the western sky, unnoticed by the <i>shikaris.
</i>For they were greedily seeking to see red blood in the body of some living
animal. A huge dark cloud appeared over the eastern horizon. With their eyes
fixed on the ground what concern had they with the sky? The servants saw the
impending danger and set out in search of their masters. It would have been
hard to find them even in broad daylight amidst that thick forest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

two friends were lost in the darkness. They turned back only when the cool
breeze of the approaching rain blew in a gust. Clouds were gathering thicker
and darker around. It was impossible to cover four miles and reach the tent
before the rains set in. Helpless as they were, they started a double march,
with the rifles on their shoulders. Now they could not realise the happy mood
of a <i>shikari </i>chasing a terrified deer. The storm came upon them with all
its fury. It was dark all around and the whirlwind caused a cry of havoc in the
jungles. They traced their way back with much caution and difficulty. Sodden to
the marrowbone, and panting for breath, they entered the tent at last. It was
eight o’clock in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been no arrangement for the dinner. Not a bird was shot. It had been
settled, moreover, that they would leave the place on the morrow; for there had
been little doubt getting a prey. The Zamindar’s home was about fourteen miles
away from the camp. Was it at all possible in this howling storm and rain to
get food from such a distance? The motor-track must have been quite inaccessible
with rain water. There was no place near by where suitable food for the Sahib
and the Zamindar could be available. For meat they must have to fast that
night. And the danger and hardship undergone this day! Everybody grew impatient
as to what should be done. Before starting in quest of prey the Zamindar had
made some arrangement about the meat for the dinner. But the Sahib had
dissuaded him and assured him that they would not fail to get some sort of
prey. But what was to be done now? For nothing the Zamindar made the poor
servants the target of his anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Zamindar’s man approached her and she did not stir. For she was sure that her
mother was at her side. Her innocent look went to the Zamindar’s heart and he

of killing the animal himself. His mind would never be at rest had he not
killed any day. He was known to have possessed reputation as the destroyer of
many human lives in the Great War. In the absence of <i>shikar </i>he would at
least kill some of his own fowls to keep his brain cool. Admiring this habit of
her husband the Memsahib would say proudly that once he was about to cut his

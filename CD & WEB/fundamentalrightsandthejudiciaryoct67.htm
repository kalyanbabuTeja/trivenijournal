<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
recent Supreme Court judgement declaring that Parliament is not competent to
take away or abridge the Fundamental Rights by means of a constitutional
amendment gives added importance and a new stature to these rights. For,
whereas other parts of the Constitution can be amended by Parliament by the
procedure prescribed by the Constitution itself, the Fundamental Rights are
immune from such changes. The idea apparently is that when sovereign people of
India framed the Constitution, they delegated various powers to various organs
of Government–the executive, legislature and the judiciary. But there was a
certain part of their sovereignty which the people reserved for themselves, and
this part was their Fundamental Rights. And if the sovereign in their wisdom
refused to surrender their Fundamental Rights, how can Parliament, which is but
a creation of the Constitution, venture to abridge or take away those rights?
The right, thus, acquires a status above the Constitution, above Parliament and
above the Government. Together with these rights go the provisions for their
enforcement. In fact the right to move the appropriate court for the
enforcement of these rights is itself fundamental right and hence is
sacrosanct. Procedure, thus, and not only<i> </i>the substance of the rights,
is important, and if procedure is vital and sacrosanct, the role of the
judiciary becomes vital and sacrosanct, Mr. Justice William O. Douglas of the
Supreme Court of the United States of America, succinctly put it thus: “The
vitality of civil rights depends as much on respect for procedure as it does in
recognition of substantive rights. Legal history shows, I think, that man’s
struggle to be free is in large degree a struggle to be free of oppressive
procedures–the right to be free from torture, The right to know the charge and
have a fair opportunity to defend, the right to have a system of laws that is
not a pitfall for the innocent.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
could not agree more with Justice Douglas, for I cannot conceive of any
emergent situation in which the liberty of the individual must be fettered to
an extent that the proper procedure has to be discarded. It is true that the
powers of the Executive and the Legislature are augmented during a period of
‘Emergency’ and the Constitution provides that the Executive and the
Legislature in the interests of the security of the State may cross the
frontiers and occupy some judicial territory and may even administer it till the
‘Emergency’ continues and ask the Judiciary to restrain its hands and turn away
its face. But in a Democratic State–unless the civil law is completely
suspended and Martial Law takes its place–there is no moment (whatever the
‘Emergency’ may be) when the Judiciary cedes any of its own territory to the
Executive or the Legislature in such a manner that it loses its right to
inspect it if not to reclaim or re-occupy it. Its light is eclipsed but not
extinguished and if necessary it can remove the black curtain that covers its
rays. Its jurisdiction is never ousted from its own sphere though voluntarily,
by a self-imposed restraint, it may not claim jurisdiction. The basic
conception is that the structure of democracy is based on three pillars and
they must be of equal size if the roof is not to topple down. You cannot knock
out or cut to a shorter size anyone of these pillars, for this is bound to
endanger the whole structure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the ‘Emergency’ is of such a character that the security of the State demands
the establishment of Martial law then all the three branches of Government go
together and none of them gets an advantage over the other. But so long as the
civil power remains in control the supremacy of the Judiciary in its own sphere
cannot be restricted and there is nothing to stop it from asserting itself if
it wants to do so. It is the option of the Judiciary to see or to close its
eyes, to hear or to plug its ears and to speak or to seal its lips. As far as I
could read the provisions of the Constitution and the Defence of India Act.
1962, they certainly do not bar the Courts of Law from deciding whether this
Act is a void piece of legislation or not and once the Act is found to be void,
none of its provisions which seek to fetter the hands of Courts to give relief
to those who have been denied their Fundmental Rights can be enforced for they
are part of a dead legislation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is another approach to the question which leads to the same conclusion. The
juristic conception of the functions and duties of a Judiciary are not merely
to adjudicate and interpret the words of the Statute. The Judiciary is also the
defender of the Constitution and has to function as a bulwark of the personal
freedom against the encroachments made either by the Executive or the
Legislature. The Fundamental Rights embodied in the Constitution cannot be
permitted to be restricted except for the most compelling reasons in a grave
‘Emergency’. Even in an ‘Emergency’ though it may not be open to a person
deprived of his liberty to advance the plea that he is being denied his
Fundamental Rights but his inability to do so cannot be advanced as a licence
or justification for the Legislature to enact a law which does not give the
citizen even the minimum human safeguards but hands him over completely to the
Executive authority without a chance of even knowing the charge or opening his
lips if only to say that a mistake has been committed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again
it does not bar the Supreme Court or the High Court to exercise its own
inherent and constitutional right to make the validity of the Act a justiciable
issue and pronounce its opinion even if it hesitates to give relief. No act of
legislature can compel it to exercise this restraint. The reason is that the
Court has also to act as a symbol of the ideal of Liberty under the law. The
esteem, the affection which the people of a democratic state give to the
Judiciary, the faith which they have in its independence and detachment may be
endangered to a certain extent if the people find that even in the face of the
gravest injustice the Judiciary has been made powerless to give them relief.
The Judiciary must stand on the highest pedestal and should not step down from
it. It is necessary that the people in a democratic state should look upon the
Courts as the last Haven of Refuge against all winds of injustice for otherwise
the weak and the outnumbered will never be able to resist the strong oppressors
and the rule of law will give place to the rule of might. The written words of
the Statute should, therefore, be interpreted in the framework of the
‘Unwritten Law’ which consists of those principles which give a meaning to the
democratic state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whenever
the question of interpreting the statutes comes up, there are always two
approaches and the Judges are frequently divided in their opinions because of
this difference of approach. These two approaches may be called the
Conservative approach and the Liberal approach. Even today in the Supreme Court
of America this division is well-marked and out of the nine judges, four are in
the Liberal group, three are in the Conservative group and two may be called
non-aligned. That is the reason why in many of the major decisions of policy
given by that Court recently there is a deviation of 5 to 4 or 6 to 3 with the
Liberal group mostly giving the majority decision. I will now try to give these
two approaches to the best of my ability. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
conservative approach is that the Courts should interpret the enactments as an
expression of the will of the people, and therefore, it should not be opposed
even if it is glaringly unjust. It is of the opinion that any opposition to the
written words of the Statute amounts to usurping the functions of the
Legislature and to try to interpret it in the background of certain principles
and then lay down policies is an encroachment on the legislative sphere and in
effect amounts to new legislation. It reconciles itself to this position by
holding (in the words of Justice Frankfurter, who may be said to be the
spokesman of the Conservative group in the Supreme Court of America): “There is
not under our Constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief and
relief for victims of unfair apportionment must come through an aroused popular
conscience that sears the conscience of the People’s Representatives.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It,
therefore, advocates the doctrine of ‘Judicial restraint’, for, according to
this group, Courts should not enter the ‘political thicket’. It may be
pertinent to observe here that Justice Frankfurter seems to have much greater
faith in the conscience of the People’s Representatives than many of us in this
country. It should also be remembered that when there is a scramble for power
between various political groups, the group in power can safely victimise its
political rivals in the name of ‘Emergency’ and that too for a long time. In
such a situation a citizen does not lose his liberty and accidentally through
misfortune but it becomes part of a plan. Let me make myself clear. I am not
saying, that such a thing is happening. I am only saying that if the
conservative view prevails such a thing is possible and as a citizen of this
country I would feel very unhappy if on an interpretation of the law of the
land it is held that the Legislature has been given this absolute power and the
Judiciary has no other option but to console the sufferers that you can only
secure relief through political upheavel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
will now give the Liberal view. The base for this view is to be found in the
words of Justice Hugo Black in an a appeal filed by the United States Communist
Party against their compulsory registration under the Subversive Activities
Control Act. He observed: “The framers of the Bill of Rights knew that free
speech might be the friend of change and revolution. But they also knew that it
is always the deadliest enemy of tyranny. They believed that the ultimate
happiness and security of a nation lies in its ability to explore, to change,
to grow and ceaselessly to adapt itself to new knowledge born of enquiry free
from any kind of governmental control over the mind and spirit of man. Our
constitutional freedoms must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner or
later they will be denied to the ideas we cherish.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1958 the Supreme Court of America was called upon to review a Statute which gave
the Congress the power to deprive a native-born American of citizenship for
voting in a foreign election. Justice Frankfurter delivering the majority
judgment justified the measure on the ground that there was a ‘Rational Nexus’
between the Statute and the foreign policy of the Government. The minority
judgment was delivered by Justice Hugo Black and he observed: “The notion that
citizenship can be snatched away whenever such deprivation bears some ‘Rational
Nexus’ to the implementation of power granted to Congress by the Constitution
is a dangerous and frightening proposition.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Liberal view, therefore, holds the Fundamental Rights to be of paramount
importance and does not hesitate to lay down principles of interpretation to
protect these rights. It is a matter for gratification that the Supreme Court
of India has adhered to the Liberal view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is a beautifully got-up token of remembrance of a poet and reformer of social
life, whom many actually worshipped for his poetic efflorescence as much as for
his deep thinking on man and life. He belonged to the trio, of whom the other
two worthy names are of <span class=SpellE>Vallathol</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayana</span>
Menon and <span class=SpellE>Ullur</span> <span class=SpellE>Parameswara</span>
Aiyar. But unlike the other two, <span class=SpellE>Kumaran</span> <span
class=SpellE>Asan</span> happened to be more than an original poet, having
rebelled against outmoded literary conventions of the age. Born on 12th April
1873, he died very young in 1924, under very tragic circumstances of a drowning
accident. He was associated with the widely known <span class=SpellE>Narayana</span>
Guru in his youth, and hence bid fair to outdo him also in his own zeal for
reforming the society of Kerala with its decadent caste restrictions of a
bygone period. His poetry in Malayalam struck many of his ardent admirers as
something to­ equal some of the reputed writers’ immortal works in Sanskrit and
English literatures. The occasion of his birth centenary has enabled the
emergence of a volume containing not only tributes to his memory from the pens
of contemporary writers of his, but also of important men and women in other <span
class=GramE>sister</span> literatures as Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada,
Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu. Some of the persons have contributed to this volume
articles on subjects other than about <span class=SpellE>Kumaran</span> <span
class=SpellE>Asan</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
contents are arranged under four parts, each one con­tributing to the general
heading of ‘Poetry and Renaissance’. Thus the first part supplies matter upon
great playwrights and poets of the past such as Shakespeare in English,
Schiller in German, <span class=SpellE>Pushkin</span> in Russian, <span
class=SpellE>Petofi</span> in Hungarian, Walt Whitman in American. The second
part contains general themes such as Macaulay’s ‘vociferous logic’, Tagore’s
surfeit of songs in Bengali, <span class=SpellE>Iqbal’s</span> revolutionary
thought, Bharati’s awakening of the Tamil spirit, etc., from some of the
present day columnists such as Mulk Raj Anand, Dr K. R. Srinivasa <span
class=SpellE>Aiyengar</span>, <span class=SpellE>Smt</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Prema</span> <span class=SpellE>Nandakumar</span> and D. <span
class=SpellE>Anjaneyulu</span>. The third part is full of serious discussions
of the merits of <span class=SpellE>Kumaran</span> <span class=SpellE>Asan’s</span>
genius and expression with adequate samples of his longer poems translated into
English from many a reputed critic and <span class=SpellE><i>Rasika</i></span><i>
</i>of Kerala. The last part brims over with accounts of contemporaries of <span
class=SpellE>Kumaran</span> <span class=SpellE>Asan</span> in the other

class=SpellE>Jayakantan</span> is a name much in the eye of the Tamil-reading
public for sometime now. He is a writer with a number of novels and short
stories to his credit. His winning the Sahitya <span class=SpellE>Akademi</span>
Award for the best novel of the year 1972 has provided an additional incentive
to the widening circle of his admirers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Having
no scholastic education worth mentioning, his education in the school of life has
enabled him to learn more of life and train himself as a creative writer of
fiction. “A foster-child of the Communist Party” as he labels himself, he has
been closely connected with the activities of the Communists in Tamil <span
class=SpellE>Nad</span> and has had experiences both as an editor and a speaker
in their ranks. Yet he has retained a rare combination of enthusiasm for fresh
ideas and a healthy restraint sufficient to guide him in revolv­ing within <span
class=GramE>himself</span> the pros and cons of everything that challenges
settled notions in the prevailing society of his times. The most <span
class=SpellE>cherishable</span> consequence of such an unusual power of
reasoning is his balanced mind – perhaps also uncommon with writers with a
slant for extreme leftist ideas in politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The

articles, which appeared in “<span class=SpellE>Tughlak</span>” (a fortnightly)
done by <span class=GramE>an</span> university Professor, Sri M. S.
Venkataramani, who evinces a legiti­mate appreciation of <span class=SpellE>Jayakantan’s</span>
writings and his unconventional life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
volume is not an autobiography, but a collection of reminiscences of the
writer, <span class=SpellE>Jayakantan</span>, who claims that his writings as a
creative artist never got influenced by the <span class=SpellE>colour</span> of
his political leanings. It is still necessary to draw the special attention of
the readers to the refreshing views upon the allied topics of Communalism and
Social Reform that receive a thought-­provoking interpretation at his hands.
They are the results of the writer’s own reflections upon problems that have
struck him as peculiar to our country’s impeded progress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
traces, in this narrative, his own confidence in some of his convictions. May
be such a trait can occasionally betray one into an egoistic mood. Still the
antidote lies in <span class=GramE>his own</span> confession: “I write about my
perception <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of<i> </i></span>what goes
around. I did not have the obstinacy to contend that my perception is the
correct one.” Such an introspective attitude would naturally lead the reader to
consider his words with sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
book, no doubt, gives one an inner look into what other­wise would gain the
reputation of a false self-evaluation by a writer of himself. Perhaps, it would
be premature too on our part to imagine that his views would resist future
challenges to his career, when we know that he is just only on the wrong side
of forty years and has a more fruitful period before him for reflections and
clarifications of life and political matters.</p>

are regions where stone is available in abundance and regions where no stone is

clay-culture. In Bengal, stone is very scarce and hence <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
belongs to clay-culture.; this truth applies not only to the art of
architecture but also to that of sculpture. Sculpture, <span class=SpellE>moulded</span>

photographs, taken by the author himself, of the temple <span class=SpellE>terracottas</span>
found in the various places of <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>. The
scholarly text which contains the histori­cal details, the artistic traditions
and conventions, analyses of the techniques and styles, denotes that the
author, <span class=SpellE>Pradosh</span> <span class=SpellE>Dasgupta</span>,
is more than a mere sculptor. He travelled extensively as well as intensively
in obscure corners of the unknown villages of <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
for years together for the sake of producing the present volume; he underwent
numerous hardships in his <span class=SpellE>endeavours</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>About
the origins of the <span class=SpellE>terrcotta</span> art in Bengal, the
author states, “Nobody knows where the first chapter of Bengal terracotta may
be opened. Although through the excavations and other stray evidences the
earliest Bengal terracotta may be dated as far back as the proto-historic
times, there is no gainsaying the fact that no trace of its development is
available with us until we come to the <span class=SpellE>Maurya-Sunga</span>
period. The unfortunate hiatus in the Indian history of art that exists even
today between <span class=SpellE>Mohanjodaro</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Maurya</span>
period (300 B. C.) is a headache to many of our art historians and
archaeologists.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Both
brick-making and clay-sculpture or terracotta, in one sense, belong to the art
of pottery. Pottery is the oldest plastic art in the world. Clay-<span
class=SpellE>modelling</span> preceded stone-carving. Bengal’s original
sculpture was terracotta, no doubt. But it lost its continu­ous current during
the historical periods reigned by many a ruler both Hindu and Muslim. According
to the author, “The most profuse and rich period of the history of Bengal
terracotta art, however, culminated during the 17th and the 18th centuries, A.
D. Thus, we find that this art flourished most under the Muslim rulers during
the age of the imperial <span class=SpellE>Mughals</span>.” Thus, we find that
the maturity, if not the origin, of Bengal terracotta art is comparatively
recent whereas the maturity of stone-sculpture goes to the remote past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Strange it is to
find that the Bengal temple <span class=SpellE>terracottas</span> depict also
the human figures of foreigners! In those days the Portuguese atrocities were
prevalent in parts of Bengal and thus the Bengal terracotta artists could not
resist their temptation of recording in their art the scenes which they saw
around them, or heard of them. The Portuguese hunting wild animals, riding in
chariots, love-making with local women, etc., are some of the subjects to which
they gave form in <span class=SpellE>terracottas</span>, in a synthetic style
of realism and imagination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the reign of <span
class=SpellE>Alivardi</span> Khan in Bengal in the 18th century, the <span
class=SpellE>Marhatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Bargis</span> entered Bengal
and were active in committing many atrocities in many parts of the country. Some
of the <span class=SpellE>terracottas</span> depict such <span class=SpellE>seenes</span>
too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the art of
terracotta there are numerous styles according to the regions where they were
produced. Thus, we have the <span class=SpellE>Vishnupur</span> Style, the <span
class=SpellE>Burdwan</span> Style, the <span class=SpellE>Murshidabad</span>
Style, the <span class=SpellE>Birbhum</span> Style, the <span class=SpellE>Hughly</span>
Style, etc. Each style has got its own rhythm, balance and proportion; each
style is conspicuous by display of its own mannerism and treatment. In some
styles, the realistic representation is more prominent while in others
imaginary delineation. However, those terracotta artists were able to display
their dexterity in whatever they touched. Many of those artists were, in fact,
illiterate rustic artisans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The author has
provided, in this volume, with a detailed technical information, the <i>modus
operandi, </i>as to how the <span class=SpellE>terracottas</span> are prepared.
He has classified the types of clay with which the <span class=SpellE>terracottas</span>
are executed, the methods of carving and <span class=SpellE>modelling</span>,
the types of the craftsmen who create them, the drying of the clay plaques and,
eventually, baking them in kilns. These craftsmen did belong to the lower
strata of the society. These craftsmen were extant till the last century when
still alive was the custom of building temples in Bengal. But in the present
century these craftsmen became extinct with the advancement of industrial
civilization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The volume
“Temple Terracotta of Bengal” is a remarkable volume of both enlightenment and
entertainment–enlightenment from the scholarly text and entertainment from the
fascinating illustrations. A part from these, there are short notes relating to
each illustration. In the end of the text there is given an extensive glossary
which helps the reader, especially the foreign reader, to understand the native
words. There is added also a bibliography. Printing and get up are well done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The volume under
review is a revolutionary attempt and approach to the study of human values.
The author does not accept the current theories–Humanist and Philosophical. The
view that values are objective, absolute and intrinsic is refuted as going
against the facts of human experience. “Value is always a feeling or organic
experience, and as such it only can derive from, or lead to, opposite value
experiences. Thus the qualitative gain that the humanists are stressing is
never possible in view to experiences. The only possible progress is the
deplored quantitative one. The learning and knowledge have left as traces of
the equal gains and losses of value experiences can be endlessly rich. Also the
inner values as quantitative satisfaction, potentials like the love, interest
or morals can be endlessly rich and are the most needed psychic capital. But
such value potentials are created by the accumulation of their opposites, needs
or non-satisfactions and restrictions always felt as disvalues.” (P. 489)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>It is difficult
for the traditionalist and theists to accept the theory of values as set forth
by the author. The Indian dialectician has a rational retort to those who
uphold the relativity of values. To deny the objective validity of values,
e.g., truth, beauty, goodness, etc., would <i>lead to the admission of one
truth, namely, the truth of the denial of values. </i>The author has harnessed
all possible resources to argue his thesis with documents in a critical manner
confronting the formidable rival popular views. The book carries references <span
class=SpellE>chapterwise</span> and has an useful index. The style of the book
is easy and flowing and is highly informing in its contents. Chapters II, IX

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Coming from the
pen of a professor, profoundly conversant with the theories of literary
criticism in Sanskrit and English, the twenty-six essays in this book written
in an elegant style have many lights upon the main tenets of criticism in
Sanskrit. Many of the essays spotlight some points that were not given their
due place, and clear some outstanding misunderstandings. The view that Sanskrit
writers are deficient in synthetic outlook is rightly rebutted. The opinion
that joy of creation and joy of appreciation are both Rasas though in different
senses is upheld. The learned professor avers that the most important contribution
of Sanskrit criticism is <span class=SpellE>Alamkara</span>. It stands for the
principle of beauty; and <span class=SpellE>Alam­kara</span> and Rasa are the
two magnetic poles in Sanskrit criticism. Purification theory of <span
class=SpellE>Bhatta</span> <span class=SpellE>Touta</span> reminds us of the
theory of <span class=SpellE>Katharsis</span>. <span class=SpellE>Abhinavagupta</span>
stretched <span class=SpellE>Anandavardhana’s</span> theory, the author says,
to needless length amid academic hair-<span class=SpellE>splittings</span>. In
the original unrestricted sense of Rasa it could be <span class=SpellE>Vyangya</span>
only from a whole work. That we do not come across identification of <span
class=SpellE>Rasananda</span> and <span class=SpellE>Mokshananda</span> in the <span
class=SpellE><i>Dhvanyaloka</i></span><i> </i>is a fact. Drawbacks in <span
class=SpellE>Abhinavagupta’s</span> views are pointed out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
class=SpellE>Mahima</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhatta’s</span> view that too
much importance need not be attached to mechanical symmetry in <span
class=SpellE>metre</span>, which sounds quite modern, is herein brought to our
notice. That the essential secret of poetic process so ably expounded by T. S.
Eliot today was not unknown to ancient literary criticism is explained at
length. In all these essays views of our literary critics are correlated with
those of the occidental. We commend this book to all students of literary
criticism.</p>

Quarter Centenary Tribute): </i>Edited by <span class=SpellE>Asloob</span>

<span class=SpellE>Aligarh</span> Muslim University, <span class=SpellE>Aligarh</span>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Ever since T. S.
Eliot placed John Donne at the head of the poets of unified sensibility. John <span
class=SpellE>Donne</span> has become the doyen of the modern poets. He became a
“must” for aspiring poets and an inevitable item on the syllabi of all
universities in the East and West. His poetic reputation had grown by leaps and
bounds and reached such colossal proportions that it all appeared to be ridicu­lously
exaggerated praise. A revision had become necessary and in the process of
revaluation of some of the angularities of Donne criti­cism are cured. The quarter
centenary celebration of John Donne gave an opportunity for many to turn to
Donne in the light of recent criticism and appraise him afresh. In <span
class=SpellE>Aligarh</span> Muslim University of India members of the English
Department applied themselves to the study of Donne to make an objective study
of him on the occasion. They invited contribution from a few scholars from
other universities too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The volume, by
any standard, is a very welcome addition to the library of Donne criticism. The
contributors to the volume deserve a rich need of praise for their
thorough-going scholarship and balanced views.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the first
essay, ‘John Donne in his age’, Prof B. K. <span class=SpellE>Kalia</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Kurukshetra</span> University makes a thorough study of Donne’s
contemporary reputation. He traces how he rose from the level of a mere coterie
poet to that of a poet of greater importance. The author has successfully
contradicted Miss <span class=SpellE>Rosemund</span> <span class=SpellE>Tuve’s</span>
contention that this view of Donne as a rebel is a modern imposition. He also
succeeds in showing how unreal and untenable is the distinction we very often
draw between the rake and the priest, John Donne and Dean Donne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the next
essay, “Some aspects of Donne’s love poetry with specific reference to the <span
class=SpellE>Relique</span>”, Z. A. <span class=SpellE>Usmani</span> brings out
the greatness of Donne’s love poetry, especially the poem ‘<span class=SpellE>Relique</span>’,
which he analyses in detail He concludes by saying that the poem itself is a
relic discovered and recognized in the timeless present that unites the miracle
that has been and the miracle that might have been. Prof. <span class=SpellE>Iqbal</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ahamad’s</span> essay, ‘Woman in Donne’s love poetry,’ makes
an interesting reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The three
essays, ‘Donne’s verse letters’ by <span class=SpellE>Masoodul</span> <span
class=SpellE>Hasan</span>, ‘Donne’s <span class=SpellE>epithalamic</span>
verse’ by M. K. Lodi and ‘Pope’s adaptations of Donne’s satires’ by <span
class=SpellE>Jafar</span> <span class=SpellE>Zaki</span>, throw much light on
the little known aspects of Donne’s poetry. They make a fresh reading. <span
class=SpellE>Harish</span> <span class=SpellE>Raizada</span> makes an attempt
to assess the satirical genius of John Donne on the basis of a study of the
entire love poetry of <span class=SpellE>Donne</span>. Prof. A. A. <span
class=SpellE>Ansari</span> studies Donne’s divine poems in his paper. “Two
modes of utterance in Donne’s divine poems”, while Prof. <span class=SpellE>Nareshchandra</span>
and Prof. P. K. <span class=SpellE>Ghosh</span> assess the merits of Donne as
preacher and writer of prose. They convincingly show that even as a preacher
Donne won a distinction for himself and became a model for others to follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Competent” is

in terms of modern thought. The authors approach the Aphorisms for the light
they give to seekers of God-realisation and they do not hesitate to go beyond
the strict sense of the <i>sutras. </i>They draw upon the commentaries of <span

the writings of Swami Vivekananda and also from other scriptural texts of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the comment
on 1.33 calling for “friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy,
delight in the virtuous and indifference toward the wicked”, the authors add:
“Our proper approach toward our fellow human beings is summed up in one of the
first of the Hindu monastic vows: ‘The flies seek honey. I will shun the habit
of the flies and follow that of the bees. I will refrain from finding faults in
others and look only for the good which is in them’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In an
interesting aside while discussing the concept of <span class=SpellE>Ishwara</span>
in <span class=SpellE>Patanjala</span> Sutras, it is pointed out: “After
liberation man is one with Brahman. But he can never become one with <span
class=SpellE>Ishwara</span>. Indeed, the desire to become <span class=SpellE>Ishwara</span>,
the Ruler of the universe, would be the most insane of all egotistical desires

Lucifer.”</p>

book giving brief accounts of some of the important spiritual personalities in
India who have helped to shape the country’s evolution of general consciousness
in the diverse spheres of life. There is <span class=SpellE>Purandaradasa</span>
who initiated the movement of the minstrels of God in Karnataka and whose <span
class=SpellE><i>vachanas</i></span><i> (bon <span class=SpellE>mots</span>) </i>are
still on the lips of the common man, bridging the gulf between Heaven and
Earth, pointing out the foibles of man and the glory of God. Kabir who lauded
the Divine in its impersonal form, worked for a unity of the many approaches to
God and established the Bhakti cult in a powerful way in the North, comes next.
Then follow <span class=SpellE>Tulsidas</span> of <i>Rama <span class=SpellE>Charita</span>
<span class=SpellE>Manas</span> </i>fame and the example set by him for instant
conversion of the human personality into the spiritual; Saint <span
class=SpellE>Tyagaraja</span> who showed the possibility of <span class=SpellE>realising</span>
the Divine through music and began a new age and style of music in South India;
Sri <span class=SpellE>Raghavendraswamy</span> who took <span class=SpellE>Samadhi</span>
over three hundred years ago but still continues –in <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>
of his assurance – to guide and help humanity with the dynamics of his presence
at the <span class=SpellE>Mantralaya</span>; Sri Ramakrishna <span
class=SpellE>Paramahamsa</span> who inaugurated the Indian Renaissance and
demonstrated in his own life the fundamental unity of religions and made
spiritual life accessible to the ordinary man; <span class=SpellE>Sai</span>
Baba of <span class=SpellE>Shiridi</span> who shocked the orthodox and
self-complacent minds of the society by his bizarre ways and brought about a
striking change in the mentality of an increasingly materialist generation; Sri
<span class=SpellE>Ramana</span> <span class=SpellE>Maharshi</span> who revived
the ideal of the ancient Upanishads and sent a wave of spirituality vibrating
throughout the world; and lastly Satya <span class=SpellE>Sai</span> Baba who
is quite a phenomenon baffling both modern science and hidebound orthodoxy,
working for the uplift of the masses in a spiritual dimension. A satisfying
book which, we hope, will be followed by another dealing with personalities
that have not found mention in this collection though they have played an
important part in the spiritual development of India.</p>

invaluable lessons for the conduct in life for man and woman. It is therefore
no fresh thought on the part of the author of the present compilation of
enduring sayings from the text of <span class=SpellE>Valmiki’s</span> immortal
poem, to have gathered many of the precepts contained in the verses and
presented them with their English translations. Further, his own explanatory
notes on the value of the moral injunctions add considerably to the purpose of
the publication. Thus, we have here nearly 263 precepts contained in verses
which</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>form more than the exact number
of the sayings, because of the precepts sometimes getting elaborated in more
than one verse in the text itself. But actually more such useful guides can be
availed of if we discern often in suggestive thoughts for our cultural
awakening from many more contexts in the narration of the story.</p>

certainly gains much by the introduction from the author, whose sense of values
of our philosophical and cultural background is reflected in more than one
aspect of life which he has classified for his comments. He has dealt with <span

of human existence. When he deals with Maya for instance, he has recourse to <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The outpourings
of the <span class=SpellE>Alvars</span> of South India, numbering to nearly
4000 verses, occupy an important place in the corpus of devotional literature
in Tamil. Several of the <span class=SpellE>Alvars</span> were gifted poets
soaked in the noblest literary traditions of the <span class=SpellE>Sangam</span>
age of Tamil <span class=SpellE>Iiterature</span>. But as attempts to make a
literary assess­ment of their poetry is frowned upon by the orthodox, the works
of the <span class=SpellE>Alvars</span> are known mainly for their devotional
and mystic content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>In the galaxy of
<span class=SpellE>Alvars</span>, <span class=SpellE>Nammalvar</span> is
venerated as the super-mystic of South Indian <span class=SpellE>Vaishnavism</span>.
His four works, viz., <span class=SpellE><i>Tiruviruttam</i></span><i>, <span
class=SpellE>Tiruvasirivam</span>, <span class=SpellE>Periya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Tiruvantadi</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Tiruvoymozhi</i></span><i>
</i>are considered as the Tamil counterparts of the four Vedas. The last-named
work, in particular, contains the essence of <span class=SpellE>Vaishnava</span>
philosophy. Later <span class=SpellE>Acharyas</span> of this religion extracted
most of their metaphysical concepts from this ‘Sacred Word’. The work is
unsurpassed in mystic literature for its spiritual depths and <span
class=SpellE>fervour</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The late Prof.
Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span> was a life-long interpreter into
English of the beauties of Tamil literature and has, in the pre­sent work,
undertaken the difficult task of introducing <span class=SpellE>Nammalvar</span>
to the non-<span class=SpellE>Tamilian</span> public. As there is very little
to write about the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>‘life’ of the <span
class=SpellE>Alvar</span>, the author has rightly concentrated his efforts on
an analysis of the saint’s philosophy and his approach to God. Copious
translations from the verses of the <span class=SpellE>Alvar</span> have been
furnished to drive home his approach as a mystic and a poet rather than as a
formal philosopher. The last chapter of this excellent monograph has been
devoted to a careful examination of the poetry of <span class=SpellE>Nammalvar</span>.
The printing is elegant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Fictional
writing in Tamil has increased in recent decades. While the short story has a
bit slackened in its speed, the novel has gained greater momentum in fulfilling
the craving of readers. Every writer has to his or her credit a novel of at
least three hundred pages of closely-packed, suspense-sustaining matter with
the addi­tional attraction of the sex-appeal as almost the main interest of its
theme. It is, therefore, first a relief to find a writer departing from the
usual rut for keeping up<i> </i>the story-interest but take to some change in
ordering the stuff in his own way. The author of the present volume is not new
to the field, as he has already made a name for his contributions to it. He has
here chosen the Hindu joint family as the chief source for his inspiration and
woven round a family some of the constant <span class=SpellE>bickerings</span>
and domestic <span class=SpellE>inadjustabilities</span> among its members.
Still, the technique he has adopted is fresh in the manner of the narration. It
is all in the first person with frequent flashbacks for incidents and details
which give a naturalness to the picture of a person in sensitive and reflective
moods concerning events of a past that furnishes all the strength to the main
story’s career.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Realism <i>in <span

of the art revealed in this novel. There is very little of liveliness or deep
urges stirred. The homeliness of many of the dialogues add the same naturalness
to the entire concept of a Hindu family in conservative setting and in their
social <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. The plot means nothing to the
writer<i> </i>as he more often revels in the psycho-analysis of the characters.
Yet one cannot escape a feeling sometimes of drag, especially when the same
kind of mental reactions and re-reactions get described in minutiae. How one
wishes there were something more in the novel to retain long in thought after
closing the pages of the book!</p>

Abercrombie’s remark that poetry is speaking painting and painting is dumb
poetry. There is an admirable use of imagery which adds concreteness and charm
to the poet’s vision of truth. Depression and despair, the stock in trade of
prose-poets, are replaced by a refreshing note of optimism ring­ing
unmistakably all through. “This darkness will vanish. A new dawn shall break”
assures the poet who believes that “the best is yet to be”. Different periods
of the day from dawn to midnight are selected as symbols for the varying phases
of the poetic spirit which voyages on many strange tides of feeling and

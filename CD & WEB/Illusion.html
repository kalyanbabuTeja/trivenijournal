<P ALIGN="CENTER">I</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">When man comes down from his heavenly home</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">On earth through the cloudy screen,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He still half dreams of his starry flowers</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And his moon-faced fairy queen:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A dear little light and a queer little dark,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And a smile and a cry between.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And his screen gets thicker and thicker here;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Less bright do his dreams now come;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His stars are his grapes and his acid-drops,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His moon is his little drum:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A sweet little prattle, a sweet little lisp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And a tumble completes his sum.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">III</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And the screen gets thicker and thicker still,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And he starts with his waxing weight;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His stars are his playing marbles now,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His moon is his rimless slate;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And he rubs his eyes, and looks to the skies,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All the world to penetrate.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">IV</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">No more does he dream of his garden now:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">New glories appear on the field;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His stars are his gleaming arrow-heads,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His moon is his trusty shield.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">O the glorious flood of his full warm blood, </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That even to gods would not yield!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">V</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And a new-heaven dream fills his pulsing heart,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And he leads a new fairy home:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His stars are her bright enchanting eyes,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His moon is his rich honeycomb;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And launching his boat on the wide sea afloat, </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He sails out thro' splash and foam.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">VI</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Ah, the screen is thickest before him now– </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He has learnt to lie and hate;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His stars are his sparkling gold-dust stored,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His moon is his silver plate;– </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A good deal of pride, and a step go-wide,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And a pose like a deity great.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">VI</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">But lo!<I> </I>he has verged to his sunset-land,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And at last there breaks the spell:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His stars are now his rosary-beads,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His moon is his temple bell; </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And he sees again with a twin-edged pain</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His dreams of heaven and hell!</P><P ALIGN="center"><A HREF="CONTENTSsep1929.htm"><IMG SRC="Image245.jpg" BORDER=0 WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=48></A></P></BODY>

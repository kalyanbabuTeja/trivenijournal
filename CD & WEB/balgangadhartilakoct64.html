<span class=SpellE>Gangadhar</span> Tilak, a man of an indomitable energy and a
new vision, was born in <st1:place w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place> in 1856,
of the caste of <span class=SpellE>Chitpavan</span> Brahmins, who had ruled
over <span class=SpellE>Shivaji’s</span> empire. He was born thirty-eight years
after the final British conquest of Maratha power. He was a scholar of the
first rank, educator, <span class=GramE>journalist</span> and first among the
leaders of new <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Tilak learned of the values of <span class=SpellE><i>Bharatdharma</i></span><i>
</i>as a child in his home at <span class=SpellE>Ratnagiri</span>. His father
was an educator and he carefully tutored the boy in Sanskrit and Mathematics,
and his mother helped to mould his firm character and to teach him the values
of his classical heritage. From both parents he learned a healthy veneration
for spiritual values, and he learned that he shared the history of the
Marathas, that he was heir to a glorious martial tradition. His religious or
spiritual orientation, the product of his family’s devoutness, was apparent in
his later writings, as when he wrote, ‘The greatest virtue of man is to be
filled with wonder and devotion by anything in the animate and inanimate
creation that suggests inherent divinity.<sup>1 </sup>He also made continuous
reference to the great Shivaji and the history of his Maratha people, <span
class=GramE>the</span> fiery tradition of their independence, their war against
the Mogul Empire to restore <i>Swaraj </i>and to save the <i>Dharma. </i>The
Maratha people had not forgotten that they had been free, that <i>Swaraj </i>had
been their birth-right. From his childhood, he inherited a vision of a new <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> arising,
firmly based on the spirit and traditions of her civilization and her past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tilak
had an English education, but he was far less <span class=SpellE>denationalised</span>
than most students of his generation, for he specialized in Mathematics and
Sanskrit, and, if anything, his education brought him closer to the sources of
his heritage. When he studied law, he concentrated on classical Indian Law,
reading nearly all the great books of law and legal commentaries in Sanskrit.
His study of Sanskrit was a life-long occupation and he was <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
as one of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
leading Sanskrit scholars. Relying upon his knowledge of this ancient language
and his mathematical training, he wrote <i>Orion, Studies in</i> <i>the
Antiquity of the Vedas, </i>in which he explored the thesis that the <i>Rig Veda
</i>was composed as early as 4500 B. C., basing his evidence on astronomical
calculations from the Sanskrit texts. This work gained him recognition in the
Western world for his scholarship in Oriental studies. His second great book
was again on the <i>Vedas, <span class=GramE>The</span> Arctic Home of the
Vedas, </i>in which, relying upon astronomical and geological data, he argued
that the Aryans probably originally lived in the far northern reaches of the
Asiatic continent. This book is credited as being one of the most original and
unusual works in Sanskrit scholarship. The <i>Vedic Chronology </i>was a
posthumously published volume of his notes and further researches. His greatest
wo<i>rk </i>was the <i>Gita-<span class=SpellE>Rahasya</span>, </i>a
philosophical inquiry into the secret of the teaching of the <i>Gita, </i>the
holiest book of <span class=SpellE><i>Aryadharma</i></span><i>. </i>In this
volume he reinterpreted the <i>Gita </i>in its classical sense, restoring the
proper emphasis to the philosophy of action, <i>Karma-Yoga, </i>and his is
considered one of the outstanding studies of the <i>Gita </i>in modern Indian
literature. The <i>Gita-<span class=SpellE>Rahasya</span> </i>assured <span
class=SpellE>Tilak’s</span> place among the greatest of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
scholars and philosophers. His classical studies enabled him to recapture the
spirit of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
classical philosophy of life. In his heart of hearts he always remained a
humble student of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
greatness. Even after he had become the foremost political leader of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, he often said that he wished he could
devote his life to teaching Mathematics, and pursuing his scholarly researches
into the wisdom of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
ancient civilization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
after the completion of his university education, Tilak embarked upon his
mission in life. As he was deeply interested in education and public service
from his young age, he resolved to dedicate his life to the cause of
reorientation of Indian education and drastic social and political reforms. In
these ventures he was joined by his best friends, G. G. <span class=SpellE>Agarkar</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Chiplunkar</span>. All of them wanted, as N. C. <span
class=SpellE>Kelkar</span> has written, ‘the nation to know itself and its past
glories, so that it may have….confidence in its own strength, and capacity to
adapt itself wisely and well to the new surroundings, without losing its
individuality’.<sup> 2</sup> Hence, Tilak, assisted by his friends, started the
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">New</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">English</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
in 1880. The institution was such an immediate success that they founded the <span
class=SpellE>Deccan</span> Education Society in <st1:City w:st="on">Poona</st1:City>,
and the next year started the famous <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Fergusson</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
Simultaneously, they began editing and publishing two newspapers, the <span
class=SpellE><i>Kesari</i></span><i>, </i>a Marathi-language <span class=GramE>Weekly</span>,
and <i>The <span class=SpellE>Mahratta</span>, </i>its English-language
counterpart. All these young men dedicated themselves, their lives and their
fortunes to popular education through their schools and through their
newspapers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
soon a sharp difference arose between Tilak and his friends over the question
of social reform. As a result, Tilak could not remain for long associated with
the <span class=SpellE>Deccan</span> Education Society, and he, ultimately
parted with his co-workers. It was finally decided at the end of 1890 that
Tilak should purchase the <span class=SpellE><i>Kesari</i></span><i> </i>and <i>The
<span class=SpellE>Mahratta</span> </i>and devote himself to journalism, while <span
class=SpellE>Agarkar</span> and other social workers would have a free hand in
the <span class=SpellE>Deccan</span> Education Society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
an editor, Tilak was unsurpassed. The <span class=SpellE><i>Kesari</i></span><i>
</i>and <i>The <span class=SpellE>Mahratta</span>, </i>under his guidance, were
always tremendously influential and came to be financially successful. His
sincerity and unflinching sense of dedication led him to champion the causes of
his people against any and all who would be unjust, autocratic or
opportunistic. As editor of the <span class=SpellE><i>Kesari</i></span><i>, </i>Tilak
became the awakener of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Lion of Maharashtra, <span class=GramE>the</span> most influential Indian
newspaper editor of his day. It was as editor that Tilak began his three great
battles–against the Westernizing social reformers, against the inert spirit of
orthodoxy, and against the <i>British Raj. </i>It was as editor that he became
a leader of the new forces in the Indian National Congress and the Indian
nation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> first reaction was to
the Western civilization’s system of values. He rejected the ideology of those
intellectuals who based their programme of social and political action almost
entirely on the philosophy of life of nineteenth century <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>.
These intellectuals were truly more the products of Western civilization than
Indian. Tilak, unlike them, was not prepared to reject <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s own
philosophy of life in order to imitate the philosophy of the British. He <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> that the social order in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> needed a
drastic reform, but instead of judging Indian social practices by the standards
of the West, he interpreted them and looked for their reform from Indian
standards. Aurobindo <span class=SpellE>Ghose</span> exemplified this new
approach in writing, ‘Change of forms there may and will be, but the novel
formation must be a new self-expression, a self-creation developed from within;
it must be characteristic of the spirit and not <span class=SpellE>servilely</span>
borrowed from the embodiments of an alien nature’.<sup>3</sup> Tilak knew that
there must be change, but also he knew that a philosophy must guide the
remaking of India, and that the crucial question for India’s future was whether
that guide, that philosophy, would be Western or Indian in inspiration, He
wrote, ‘It is difficult to see the way in darkness without light or in a thick
jungle without a guide’. And he rejected the rationalism and <span
class=SpellE>scepticism</span> of Western philosophy, when he remarked that
‘mere common sense without faith in religion is of no avail in searching for
the truth’. In the era of the religious and philosophical renaissance of <span
class=SpellE><i>Bharatdharma</i></span>, Tilak sought the guidance of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s own
philosophy. Undoubtedly, his initial motive was not to rediscover a theory of
social and political action but rather to find a satisfying personal philosophy
of life. In his private life, he attempted to rediscover and reapply the Indian
philosophy of life. And his achievements in private and public life gave him a
basis for building up a new theory of political action, obligation and
ordering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
first task was to look behind the atrophied forms of religious orthodoxy and
custom, to find the values that had built the Indian civilization. Tilak <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> that ‘the edifice of Hindu religion was not
based on a fragile ground like custom. Had it been so, it would have been <span
class=SpellE>levelled</span> to the ground very long ago. It has lasted so long
because it is founded on everlasting <span class=GramE>Truth,</span> and
eternal and pure doctrines relating to the Supreme Being’.<sup> 4</sup> This
truth was not <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> by the Westernized
intellectuals, in their obsession with the remaking of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> according
to their own image. But, on the contrary, Tilak started with a faith in the
spiritual purpose of human life, which the ancient Indian philoso</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>p</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hy
taught. And he regarded spiritual good as the basis of social good. He wrote:
‘The structure of faith collapses with and the collapse of faith in the
existence of the soul. The doctrine of soul-<span class=SpellE>lessness</span>
removed the need for faith. But when faith thus ceased to be an organic force
binding society together, society was bound to be disrupted and individuals
living in a community were sure to find their own different paths to happiness.
The ties which bind society in one harmonious organization would be snapped, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
no other binding principle would take their place. Moral </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ties
would loosen, and people would fall from good moral standards.</span><sup><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
His personal life was based on this ‘structure of faith’ and the moral
purposefulness provided by this foundation remained with him throughout his
life. No creed that doubted the existence of the soul or the spiritual purpose
of human life could inspire Tilak or his people; thus the rediscovery of faith
as the ‘organic binding force’ was the first principle in his emerging
philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the idea of spiritual rediscovery Tilak, like Aurobindo <span class=SpellE>Ghose</span>
and others, developed a personal philosophy of life, firmly based on the
knowledge that ‘the individual and the Supreme Soul are one’, and that the
‘ultimate goal of the soul is liberation’. He explored the wisdom of the Real
and the relative worlds, the meaning of creation, and the moral working out of
the cosmic evolution towards liberation. From this foundation he understood the
purpose of life, to live in accord with <i>dharma, </i>the integrating
principle of the cosmic order. As Aurobindo <span class=SpellE>Ghose</span>
wrote of the Indian philosophy of life, ‘The idea of <i>dharma </i>is, next to
the idea of the Infinite, its major chord; <i>dharma, </i>next to spirit, is
its foundation of life’.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Once these principles
were accepted, Western rationalism and <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>,
materialism and utilitarianism could hold little appeal. It was from this basic
understanding that he began his criticism of the <span class=SpellE>Westernizers</span>
who would destroy this wisdom and these values. It taught them to love and
respect, not the forms of atrophied orthodoxy, but rather the spirit of the
total Indian philosophy, the way of life and wisdom of life of the Indian
civilization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wrong, for as Tilak reminded them, ‘How can a man be proud of the greatness of

the extremist measures of these social reformers. But the very fact that he was
educated and that he refrained from joining the reformers indicted him as a
defender of orthodoxy in the eyes of the extremists. He was condemned by the
extremists as a reactionary, as the spokesman for backwardness. Nothing could
be farther from the truth. He earnestly hoped to see of the evils of the Indian
social system removed, the entire system reformed, and to this end he brought
forward his own concrete proposals for improving social conditions. He was a
staunch advocate of progress. At the same time, he relentlessly fought against

class=SpellE>Malbari</span>, <span class=SpellE>Agarkar</span> and the others,
was two fold. First, without a full appreciation of the values that had been
preserved and transmitted by the social system, these men were willing to
discard virtually everything, to remake India almost totally in the image of
the West, and to base Indian social forms on the values they had learned from
their Western education. To Tilak, it was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>folly, it was criminal,
to banish everything created by India’s civilization because Indian values and
Indian religion did not coincide with the nineteenth century European notions
of materialism, rationalism and utilitarianism. He knew their obsession was
contrary to common sense and good practice. He once wrote: ‘….a number of our
educated men began to accept uncritically the materialistic doctrines of the
Westerners. Thus we have the pathetic situation of the new generation making on
their minds a carbon copy of the gross materialism of the West’. <sup>7</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he went on to remind the social reformers that ‘our present downfall is due not
to Hindu religion but to the fact that we have absolutely forsaken religion.’
Second, since the reformers could not inspire mass popular support for their
imitative social reform p</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the state, the alien state of the British rule, to effect social change. From <span

impose any kind of reform would be to make that reform itself immoral. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to <span class=SpellE>Tilak’s</span> mind, must grow from within the people.
Since he accepted this proposition as true, it logically followed that attempts
to coerce the community to accept them were absurd. Reform, according to him,
would have to be based upon the value system of the people and not on the
values taught to the Westernized few in an alien system of education. The
answer lay, he believed, in popular education which must be initiated with an
understanding of the classical values and must proceed to recreate the vitality
of those values in the forms of social order. Since the classical values were
thoroughly intermixed with popular religion, he believed that ‘religious
education will first and foremost engage our attention.’ In this way a new spirit
will be born in India. India need not copy from some other civilization when
the can rely on the spirit of her past greatness. As D. V. <span class=SpellE>Athalye</span>
has written ‘The difference was this, that while <span class=SpellE>Ranade</span>
was prepared, if convenient, to coquette with religious sanction to social
order, Tilak insisted that there should be no divorce between the two’.<sup> 8</sup>

he wanted genuine reform and not simple imitation of Western life and manners,
and because he believed that such reform must come from the people themselves
and not from a foreign government, Tilak was led to advocate two causes which
were to become his life’s work. First, he fought to reawaken India to her past
and to base her future greatness on her past glories. Second, knowing well that
real progress can only be made by a self-governing people, knowing that moral
progress can only be made through moral and democratic decisions, knowing,
therefore, that <i>Swaraj </i>or self-rule was the prerequisite of real social,
political, economic, cultural and spiritual progress, Tilak began to think in
terms of the restoration of <i>Swaraj. </i>The social reformers were prepared
to <span class=SpellE>criticise</span> almost everything Indian, to imitate the
West in the name of improvement, and to rely upon the power of a foreign
government to bring about this improvement. They were convinced that only by
social reform would they earn political reform; that, therefore, social reform
must precede political reform. Tilak argued just the contrary way, that
political reform must precede social reform; for it is only popular
self-government that is moral government, that it is only moral government that
can create moral social change; and, therefore, self-rule is necessary</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and

more realistic and founded on solid moral values, he could perceive more
clearly the root causes of the Indian social evils than did his social reform
opponents. He felt that it was not simply the forms and practices of Indian
society which had to be changed if meaningful social reforms were to be brought
about. He sensed that abusive social practices were the direct outgrowth of the
‘spirit of orthodoxy’ which filled the forms of social order and inertly
resisted change. This spirit had resulted from a thousand years of instability,
defeat, foreign <span class=SpellE>overlordship</span>, defensiveness and
inflexibility. Therefore, effective reform, Tilak believed, must ultimately
depend upon a reawakening of the true, vital, life-affirming spirit of the
Indian people and civilization. Instead of <span class=SpellE>criticising</span>
social form as the great evil, he began his battle with the atrophied spirit of
orthodoxy while still engaged in his battle with the Westernized reformers. He
wrote: ‘…..just as old and orthodox opinions (and their holders the <span

reformers’ are also </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

and <span class=SpellE>Pandits</span> do not know the new circumstances whereas
the newly educated class of reformers are ignorant of the traditions and the

traditions and philosophies must be imparted to the newly educated classes, and
the <span class=SpellE>Pandits</span> and <span class=SpellE>Sastries</span>
must be given information about the newly changed and changing circumstances.’<sup>

new generation who could understand them and bring about the necessary rebirth

in all its worst manifestations, defeatism and fatalism, the loss of the ideal
of harmonious social cooperation, of courage and of self-respect–in a word, the
dynamics of the classical philosophy of life had been perverted into negation
and passivity. This spirit, Tilak believed, was harmful to India’s progress,
and it was with this spirit that he did battle. Atrophied orthodoxy had no
religious justification. Its spirit was in part the perversion and negation of
the world and of the classical concept of the <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>

people. As his chief colleague, N. C. <span class=SpellE>Kelkar</span>, wrote,

instrumental in popularizing two great festivals, one to <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span>,
the Hindu deity of learning and <span class=SpellE>propitiousness</span>, and
the other, a festival to revive the memory and glory of Shivaji, the liberator
of Maharashtra, and the restorer of <i>Swaraj </i>through his fight with the
Mogul Empire. He especially <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span> the dynamic
spirit of Shivaji. He wrote, ‘It is the spirit which actuated Shivaji in his
doings that is held forth as the proper ideal to be kept constantly in the view
of the rising generation’. To keep this spirit in constant view, Tilak worked
ceaselessly to reach the people and to educate them through the festivals.

National Congress, hoping that it would be instrumental in further uniting the
nation and in securing political reforms. He held a post in the Congress as
early as 1892, as secretary of the Bombay Provincial Conference. At the same
time, he actively participated in public affairs, holding public office on
several occasions. In 1894, he was elected a Fellow of the Bombay University,
and next year he held a post in the Poona Municipality. For two years he was a
member of the Bombay Legislative Council, but, he called the completely
circumscribed powers and the work of this body a ‘huge joke’. He did not seek
public office because he desired a political or governmental career but rather because
it was one means, among several, which he chose to utilize to further the
causes in which he strongly believed. But he soon realized that holding public
office was one of the least effective ways of promoting his ends, and, more

fighting spirit was <span class=SpellE>antagonised</span> by the predominant
Congress attitude of pleading for reform and passing mild resolutions of
protest against the abuses of the <i>administration. </i>The Congress was not
coming to grips with the real problems of the people. In 1896, he publicly
announced his disagreement with the policies of the Congress in writing, ‘For
the last twelve years we have been shouting hoarse, desiring that the
government should hear us. But our shouting has no more affected the government
than the sound of a gnat. Our rulers disbelieve our statements, or profess to
do so. Let us now try to force our grievances into their ears by strong
constitutional means. We must give the best political education possible to the
ignorant villagers. We must meet them on terms of equality, teach them their
rights and show how to fight constitutionally. Then only will the government
realize that to despise the Congress is to despise the Indian Nation. Then only
will the efforts of the Congress leaders be crowned with success. Such a work
will require a large body of able and single-minded workers, to whom politics
would not mean some holiday recreation but an every-day duty to be performed

facilities proved inadequate. He established a free kitchen, and did everything

Those who lacked foresight began to fear him. When, in the tense atmosphere of
famine and plague-racked Poona, a young man assassinated Rand, the British
official in charge of plague relief, many of those who feared him were quick to
blame Tilak for the death, although he had no knowledge of the incident.
Nevertheless, he was convicted and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. This
was not to be <span class=SpellE>Tilak’s</span> last imprisonment. For two
decades he was persecuted by the British Indian Government because they saw in
him the greatest challenge to their rule over the Indian Empire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

round the concept of <i>Swaraj, </i>self-rule for India. As early as 1895, he
had begun to preach the necessity for <i>Swaraj. </i>He came to realize that
self-rule must precede meaningful social reform, that the only enduring basis
for national unity and national self-respect must be national self-rule, In
1895, he had reminded the people that Shivaji had recreated <i>Swaraj </i>as
the necessary foundation of social and political freedom and progress and
morality. His historical and philosophic frame of reference is clearly set out
in his writing, ‘One who is a wee bit introduced to history knows what is <i>Swarajya

action would alone accomplish the national <i>dharma. </i>In order that India
solve her own destiny, the first essential, as in the case of the awakening of
India, was the call for action, for a new spirit of courage and self-sacrifice.
Only a pride in history and the values of India’s own civilization could
inspire men to the task ahead. Tilak movingly wrote, ‘To succeed in any

and the Nationalists presented the nation with a three-fold programme for
effective, practical, political action. The three principles were boycott, <span

they were designed for use in Bengal, as the most effective way to bring the
British administrators to their senses over the issue of the partition. But it
was soon decided, however, that the entire nation could well cooperate with
Bengal in following this threefold programme and thus increase tremendously the
pressure on the British. And it was further taught that the great wrong, the
significant evil, was not alone that an alien <span class=SpellE><i>raj</i></span><i>
</i>had partitioned the province of Bengal, but actually that Bengal was only a
symbol, that an alien <span class=SpellE><i>raj</i></span><i> </i>ruled

initially involved the refusal of the people to purchase British-manufactured
goods. It was started as a measure designed to bring economic pressure on the
British business interests both in India and abroad. If British business could
be moved, then the business could be counted on to move the British <span
class=SpellE><i>raj</i></span><i>. </i>But soon the boycott movement took on
far more significant aspects than merely economic pressure. The Nationalists
saw that the whole superstructure of the British Indian administration, that
the British system of rule over India, was based upon the willing, or at least
unthinking, cooperation of the Indian people. Tilak was one of the first to
discern this, and he realized that boycott could be expanded to the point of
jeopardizing the foundation of the whole British administrative machinery in
India. In a speech at Poona, as early as 1902, he urged, ‘You must realize that
you are a great factor in the power with which the administration in India is
conducted. You are yourselves the useful lubricants which enable the gigantic
machinery to work so smoothly. Though downtrodden and neglected, you must be
conscious of your power of making the administration impossible if you but
choose to make it so. It is you who manage the railroad and the telegraph, it
is you who make settlements and collect revenues, it is in fact you who do
everything for the administration though in a subordinate </span><span

lit the night sky, and the people turned to local Indian production of <span

first great impetus to industrial development in India. Local Indian production

national education. Tilak had long before realized that the Western education
started by Lord <span class=SpellE>Macaulay</span> and pursued in all the
Government-supported schools was ruinous to the future health and well-being of
the nation. The younger generations were being educated away from not only
their families and the great majority of the Indian people, but also away from
the value system of India’s civilization. Government-supported Western
education uprooted the youths from their ties to the past and made them Indians
in name only. Hence such a system of Western education was repulsive to Tilak
and the Nationalists. They pleaded for the establishment of national schools
and colleges throughout the country to provide inexpensive and wholesome
education <span class=SpellE>emphasising</span> the new spirit of self-help and
self-reliance which young people could not expect to receive in the

education was presented to the country by Tilak and the Nationalists and was

The programme began primarily as an economic weapon but quickly its political
importance was realized and became predominant. The impetus behind the
programme was initially a reaction to the partitioning of Bengal, but it soon
developed an all-India momentum. The first reason for its use was to induce the
government to reunify Bengal, but it soon became a programme for national
reawakening and national liberation–Swaraj. Thus, an economic programme became
a political programme; a locally <span class=SpellE>centred</span> agitation

evolved into the cause of gaining India’s self-determination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and movement led by Tilak and the Nationalists. Tilak realized that <i>Swaraj, </i>the
goal of all efforts, was a moral national necessity. He held that the
attainment of <i>Swaraj </i>would be a great victory for Indian nationalism. He
gave to Indians the <i>mantra: Swaraj </i>is the birth-right of Indians (at the
<span class=SpellE>Lucknow</span> Congress of 1916). He defined <i>Swaraj </i>as
‘people’s rule instead of that of bureaucracy’. This was the essence of <span
class=SpellE>Tilak’s</span> argument with the social reformers when they sought
to have the British Government legislate and enforce social reform measures.
Tilak held that unless the people supported the reforms, in effect, unless the
people exercised self-rule to legislate and enforce the reforms, the reforms
were not only meaningless but also undemocratic and without moral significance.
And for pushing his ideal of <i>Swaraj </i>forward, he started Home Rule
Leagues in 1916 with the cooperation of Mrs. Annie <span class=SpellE>Besant</span>,
which soon became so popular that the Government had to adopt severe repressive
measures. But he went on undeterred with the propaganda of Home Rule throughout
the country. He intended that a bill should be introduced in the British
Parliament </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>for Indian Home Rule, by the good offices of the
Labour leaders, although he could not be successful in the attempt. However,
the fact that Tilak began his Home Rule agitation in the year 1916 is an

referred to the example of the American Congress and said that the Government
of India should keep in its hands similar powers to exercise them through an
impartial council. Although in his speeches and writings Tilak mostly stated
that <i>Swaraj </i>did not imply the negation and severance of ultimate British
sovereignty, we have every reason to believe that in his heart of hearts he
always wanted complete independence. He once said that ‘there could be no such
thing as partial <i>Swaraj’</i>. Self-rule under <span class=SpellE><i>Dharmarajya</i></span><i>
</i>either existed fully or did not exist at all. Partial <i>Swaraj </i>was a
contradiction in terms. Only the Westernized few who could not understand this

as also the patriotic <span class=SpellE>fervour</span> of the Bengal

of altruistic violence, Tilak never preached political murder; nor did he ever
incite anybody to commit murder as a political means. A realist in politics
though he was, he never taught the <span class=SpellE>omnicompetence</span> of
force as <span class=SpellE>Machiavelli</span> or <span class=SpellE>Treitschke</span>
did. His realism taught him to act in the political universe in such a way,
that his opponents could not take advantage of him. Only by passive resistance
and democratic means, he taught, could the united action of the people prove
powerful enough to bring about the non-violent revolution that was <i>Swaraj. </i>Boycott
and <span class=SpellE>Swadeshi</span> were, in effect, the precursors of the
later non-cooperation movement. The passive resistance taught by him and the
Nationalists was the precursor to non-violent civil disobedience. Tilak clearly
foresaw that violence would be wasteful, and that it would ultimately be
ineffectual. Being a realist, he <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> that ‘the
military strength of the Government is enormous and a single machinegun

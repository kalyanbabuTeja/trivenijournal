<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>CHANGING events outside have been demanding of me an
answer to the question whether literature is related to politics in any form of
obligation. I have procrastinated and not faced the question squarely. Rather
have I rationalised with myself saying that both of them after all belonged and
owed allegiance to the wholeness of life and therefore they need not be viewed
in juxtaposition to each other. To confess, I have been a little naive at it
and thus effected an escape for myself from a situation which threatened to be
overwhelming. In my philosophisation I rendered the question, as it were, void
of validity to myself. But that was self-delusion. The reality and duality will
not get shut out and I realise that the question is urgent and imperative. It
has to be solved and resolved in one’s being in order to be able to participate
fruitfully in either literary or political activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have known wars and they have been total wars. The next, if and when it comes,
will have to be a global one in the full sense of the word. It will touch all
and each and none shall have leave to feel unaffected and unconcerned. Thus the
politics that regulate and govern human affairs and lead them on to the
destinies that be are not to be considered as the special concern of some
technically trained and skilled </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>parliamentarians or
diplomats. It is no more to be taken to as a career and vocation for the ones
specially gifted or selected. It should be the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>care and
concern of all in order that mankind be one family and the world one home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
politics covers all and literature, too, embraces the whole span of life. The
two cannot be relegated to any special and separate compartments, each to each,
and thus kept apart. No, they are bound to have a direct bearing on each other,
the two being not any specialised proclivities touching this or that sector
alone of life to the exclusion of the rest. Anyone is free to write, likewise
is he free to go ahead and get elected. In fact langauge belongs to all, so
also progress. All of us want to express ourselves and each one of us hopes to
get on top of the other. Thus both literature and politics irretrievably
appertain to the man in whole, the man in common. To be a man is enough to entitle
him to have a say in both. Both shall thrive on the common man and therefore
both shall have to serve him also. To go astray from him is to go wrong both in
literature as well as in politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
that they are so close and allied to each other we have to find what relation
should exist between the two if they are to be true to themselves and at the
same time complement each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
know the variation in the perspectives that they hold respectively to
themselves and the difference in emphasis that they bring to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bear
on life. To literature a man is essential as he is. It is his being that
matters there, not his belongings. To literature man is the end, not </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
means. In politics it is rather the other way round. There the man comes
second, he is valued in reference to what he holds or represents. His
possessions come first and the man is assessed in their context. How much he
holds of power, influence, money or commodity; how many he commands or
represents, in terms of members to a party, association or affiliation–that is
what is important to politics. Not the man who feels and thinks, but rather the
man that votes and does. It is not intrinsic </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>value but
rather market value that would be relevant there. Man </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would
be adjudged not against virtue but against goods. To politics, man is never the
end, he is but a means. Each is, therefore, held useful or otherwise in the
measure that he becomes or does not become an effective and convenient means to
achieve the end. Man is therefore justified in politics only to the extent he
sub-serves the state or the party. End being the State and means the men; and
the end justifying the means, all those who do not justify themselves in view
of that end <i>i.e., </i>the State, render themselves superfluous. They are
allowed to shift as best they may, or they may even be done away with as a
security or economy measure. For ought it matters little to politics. Pledged
to gain the end, politics need not halt at the means. They are always out to
fight and get victory which must in the nature of things mean the wiping out of
the obstacle, the adversary, the opponent, the enemy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Each,
of course, will have to learn to be and live for all. That “All” to the man of
religion is God; to the man of ethics it is the Good; to the man of art it is
Beauty and Harmony; and to the man of politics it is the State Sovereign. Now
State is not an abstraction like the rest. The abstract does not impose on the
personality of the individual. Far from being abstract the State is so very
tangible. It can consume the man, fetter him, and commit him to death. With
that dirge in hand the State demands and exacts absolute and implicit
conformity to what are called its regulations and rules. It tends to becomes in
its sheer composition so much of a compact totality as to leave little space to
a person to develop personality. It promulgates law to enforce uniformity. It
stifles difference and steam-rolls opinion to suit its solid sanctity.
Politics, while trying to make each live for all, so patterns the living as to
limit it to those who constitute the state in themselves. For the rest it means
no life, and not infrequently means slow death. It is politics that creates the
incessant and evergrowing problem of personl liberty. That problem takes
innumerable forms such as minority problem, or conflicting and competing claims
of different groups, classes and organisations. Politics can at best hobnob
with them and in resolving one problem it can succeed only in creating two
others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
politics have definitely and flagrantly failed us. The wars, ever recurring and
always threatening, are a monumental testimony to the utterness of that
failure. And it was bound to happen in as much as politics leave out the other
half, and the major half, of the whole truth, that is ‘each for all and all for
each’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
I feel that politics may come to literature for the needful correction. To
literature ideals as obstructions do not matter at all. God, to exist, will
have to reside in man and express Himself through personal behaviours, or else,
for literature, He will remain non-existent. Likewise for other conceptual
obstructions literature has little use and lesser reverence. The ‘Good’ of the
moralist, the ‘Beautiful’ of the aesthete, the defied Society of the Socialist
and the State Sovereign of the politician–all these are entities wholly
irrelevant, almost fictitious, to literature. They have no way, no power, no
panic over the man who has to create. Every one of these big idealistic
concepts will have to climb down, split up and lose itself in the eachness of
the man and then come out through the texture of reciprocal behaviours in order
to acquire meaning and validity to literature. For aught else, they in
themselves, are to be allowed no sanction and absolutely no sanctity whatever.
The man will be the end and everything else the means. And these means would be
justified only in the measure that they serve him. Literature will have all
such concepts as arrogate to themselves a collective absolutism and commit no
transgressions against him. Man shall stay inviolate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
we must achieve harmony in human relationship and bring about peace amongst us
we have to evolve in a manner as makes the one live for many and many for the
one. All organisms that denote group or collective life should have in turn to
serve their component parts. An organisation should bring out and unfold the
wholeness of man rather than coerce him into being its soulless part. Unless
the “All” spreads out and pervades each one of us there will be no peace
brought into mutual intercourse, nor co-ordination or co-operation, and the
tension will continue and grow ever more to multiply problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which emphasizes the eachness of all, and preserves to us diverse uniquenesses,
can alone give to politics the requisite corrective. Otherwise politics will
never know how to come out of the vicious circle that their exclusivisms have

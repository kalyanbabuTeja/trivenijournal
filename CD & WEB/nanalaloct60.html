<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nanalal,
born in the last quarter of the nineteenth century during the full flush of the
Indian Renaissance, was the son of <span class=SpellE>Kavishvar</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dalpatram</span> who had been himself acknowledged as one of two
outstanding poets of his age and universally <span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
as the triumphant leader of the social and cultural <span class=SpellE>awakenment</span>
of Gujarat through popular channels of poetry current in his time. But while <span
class=SpellE>Dalpatram</span> had primarily worked as a realist of everyday
life, carrying a predominantly socio-educational appeal and gently taming the
crude <span class=GramE>instincts</span> of his age with a winning poetic
genius, Nanalal was a born idealist who dreamed of transforming the mental life
of his people under the light of a poetic vision, touched by the <span
class=SpellE>splendour</span> and glory of the new Renascent Spirit of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
received the best education available in his time, he started his career -a
Master of Arts -as an important figure in the educational sphere, destined to
rise in eminence, till he was placed in charge of the Educational Department of
<span class=SpellE>Saurashtra</span> during the early </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>years
of the present century. And his poetic genius, too, was flowering with equal
potency at this time, alongside of his general advancement in life; and before
he had hardly attained the prime of his youth, he had positively won the heart
of the new generation by his splendid lyrics, his rapturous songs and idylls,
as also by his captivating lyrical romance, <span class=SpellE><i>Vasantotsava</i></span><i>,
</i>the Festival of Springtide. In this first adventure of his creative
imagination, the poet sought to portray the efflorescence of the human spirit
in its primal loveliness against the background of a blossoming Nature–a
striking phenomenon which was to leave its indelible impress over the entire
current of <span class=SpellE>Nanalal’s</span> later evolution as an idealist
of the romantic world. In this connection, it becomes highly significant that,
as the young poet entered the memorable first session of the Gujarati Sahitya <span
class=SpellE>Parishad</span>, held in <span class=SpellE>Ahmedabad</span> in
1905 under the <span class=SpellE>presidentship</span> of Gujarat’s greatest
savant, <span class=SpellE>Govardhanram</span>, he was spontaneously acclaimed
in a rousing reception by another celebrated poet of Gujarat, <span
class=SpellE>Kavi</span> <span class=SpellE>Kanta</span>, as “the Full Moon
rising over the firmament of Gujarati literature, overflowing the soul of man
with the nectar of perennial life”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the years that followed, Nanalal fully justified this appellation by
establishing himself as indisputably the foremost savant of Gujarati
literature, the unrivalled poet-laureate who won his recognition by the
instinctive affirmation of his people. In work after work, his growing genius
poured itself, fed by the choicest creative inspiration of the Renascent Age in
<st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>, and impelled by an irresistible urge
to rouse the new generation with the light and power of a stirring vision.
Essentially, however, Nanalal was a supreme lyrist and, as such, he took up the
traditional dance-lyric of <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place> to tune it
to the finest melodies by infusing new lilt and glamour, new sentiment and
beauty, into an old indigenous pattern, thus lending a fresh lease of life to
the typical idyll of his race. It was particularly through the creation of this
eminently aesthetic pattern, amalgamating the elements of poetic beauty,
musical cadence and the subtle rhythm of an accompanying dance movement into a
richer and more vitalized mould of surpassing romantic expression-the <i>Rasa</i>-that
Nanalal won his first laurels in Gujarati poetry in a lightning sweep, while he
was still in the springtide of his youth. But, though he applied his creative
genius to the handling of a variety of lyrical forms and scored <span
class=SpellE>honours</span> in almost every field of romantic poetry, his most
important achievement during the first two decades of the present century was
to initiate a new form of romantic drama based on the free pattern of an
Impassioned Rhythmic Style, the <span class=SpellE>Dolanshaili</span>, an
unique achievement of Nanalal which stands like lone star shedding its
brilliance from a distance over the entire arena of poetic melody and rhythm in
Gujarati literature. It was a characteristic pattern, capable of giving facile
expression to the lofty ideas and aspirations that constituted the content of
the poet’s mellow idealism, as it infiltrated the layers of his growing
dramatic world. Quite appropriately has it been called the Gujarati counterpart
of the English Blank Verse–that grand poetic medium which was initiated and
handled with such absolute power and dignity by <span class=SpellE>Marlowe</span>,
which was perfected and naturalized by Shakespeare to respond to the subtle
nuances of human cadence in his variegated dramatic world, and which was finally
elevated to the highest pitch of sublimity and grandeur by Milton in the
twilight of England’s Renaissance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was with delightful gratification that Gujarat, having fully emerged into the
light of the New Revival, viewed her darling poet pursuing this new pattern
with the inherent confidence of a master, moving through plays like <i>‘<span
class=SpellE>Indukumar</span>’ </i>(in Three Parts completed over twenty
years), <i>‘<span class=SpellE>Jahangir</span> and <span class=SpellE>Nurjahan</span>’,
‘<span class=SpellE>Premkunja</span>’ </i>and the bewitching romance <i>‘<span
class=SpellE>Usha</span>’ </i>to embody his aesthetic vision of life in all its
loveliness and glory, while illuminating, at the same time, the deeper tones of
its higher creative urge in the treatment of divers aspects of emotional
integration and dedicational <span class=SpellE>fervour</span>, so impressively
discussed in the fulsome masterpieces of this new romantic drama. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
it is no wonder that our poet, a true Visionary of Love and Beauty, should have
consistently handled, at the crest of his glory in Gujarati literature, the
vital forces of human attachment, their discords and harmonies, their conflicts
and ripe unities, with such perfect ease and charm, creating a dramatic world
of his own that imaged the complete spiritual synthesis of man. However, it
must be remembered that, although the fervent poetic inspiration of Nanalal has
a flow which is perennially fresh, it yet naturally seeks its wider outlet in
the hallowed communion of an enlightened wedded life that succeeds in <span
class=SpellE>galvanising</span> the flickering currents of romantic passion
into the serene beatitude of an elevated love. In songs and lyrics, in idylls
and serenades and odes, in poetic romances or lyrical dramas, this is the
natural direction of the forward progression of <span class=SpellE>Nanalal’s</span>
genius, but it does not stop there. From the ecstasy and glamour of aesthetic
vision he steadily advances towards a pitch of creative sublimation that
absorbs the fascination of romance into the transcendental urge of man’s soul
to meet the universal soul. <span class=GramE>From this viewpoint.</span> <span
class=SpellE><i>Jaya-Jayant</i></span>, the crowning lyrical drama of Nanalal,
stands at the <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of the poet’s work, indicating
the inevitable direction of its </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>future movement.
Portraying with a subtle melody the process of creative sublimation of love
against the background of deep human yearni</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ngs, it emerges
ultimately as the noble testament of the spiritual realization of life

broadened the cultural and literary horizon of <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>,
its direct heir, <span class=SpellE><i>Jaya-Jayant</i></span><i>, </i>rose over
her aesthetic and spiritual firmament to deliver its sublime message from the
beyond to the flowering human soul. Ever since its appearance in 1914, it has
remained an epoch-making work of Gujarati literature, transcending the
limitations of a purely literary masterpiece to take its rightful place as the
spiritual testament of the Gujarati people. And it continues to be the
mainspring of abiding inspiration towards a higher idealism to the renascent
mind of <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
these years, while he was bringing out, one after another, imaginative
masterpieces of a largely romantic character, with a marked idealistic bias,
the poet was getting more and more interested in the vast cultural aspects of
ancient Indian history and legend, and in their legacy as developed in later
times. Having been a master of Sanskrit and Persian studies moreover, he
dreamed of presenting a vision of cultural synthesis uniting the best in Hindu
and Muslim traditions and relating this to the living background of present-day
Indian Civilisation through an amalgamation of the finest and most universal
elements in both. This the poet eventually accomplished in his two impressive
Mogul dramas, <span class=SpellE><i>Shahanshah</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Akbarshah</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Jahangir</i></span><i>
and <span class=SpellE>Nurjahan</span>, </i>although his dream to complete the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless,
the mental horizon of the poet was expanding with unbounded zest to embrace the
potential realities of ancient Indian heritage in religion and culture, and it
found its fruition in a number of plays which bear a high cultural impact, such
as <span class=SpellE><i>Rajarshi</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Bharat</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Sanghamitra</span> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Harshadeva</i></span><i>.
</i>The peak of this glorious vision is reached in the dramatic saga of <span
class=SpellE><i>Vishvagita</i></span><i>, </i>a unique masterpiece offering a
panoramic view of ancient Indian life with a clear emphasis on its abiding
cultural content. And it is no less striking as an extraordinary phenomenon of
the literary world, shattering as it does in one breath all the three dramatic
unities enunciated by Aristotle pieces, and yet creating a panoramic drama with
an innate spiritual unity of its own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

strength, unfortunately a shadow came that went to eclipse the poet’s
personality in <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place> and elsewhere. In the
first tide of Mahatma Gandhi’s nationwide influence, and at the call of the
Supreme Leader, he had relinquished, in the flash of an instant inspiration,
the lucrative and comfortable position as the head of the Educational
Department of <span class=SpellE>Saurashtra</span>, to join the patriotic
movement, soon becoming the friend and lieutenant of the Mahatma at <span
class=SpellE>Ahmedabad</span> in the sphere of the cultural and educational
renovation of the nation. But before much time had elapsed, a clash came
between the two outstanding figures of <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>,
owing to reasons which are still obscure to the literary world. Be that as it
may, the poet, recoiling from the political field, withdrew himself to dedicate
his life entirely to his muse, in the seclusion of a savant’s retreat. And,
although the political bias which he was to develop during the process was
never totally eliminated from his mind, he would not turn his face to past <span
class=SpellE>honours</span> or look forward to fresh comforts, but continued to
live an undaunted soul, a rock amidst shifting sands, for the rest of his life.
Indifferent to social response or public recognition, he dedicated all his
energies to the expansion of his creative vision, leading the austere life of a
seer through a relentless struggle for existence, throughout this period of
growing maturity in literary genius. The surpassing fruition of this lone <span
class=SpellE>endeavour</span> found its expression in the eventual realisation
of the poet’s lifelong dream, the completion of his great epic poem in twelve
books, <span class=SpellE><i>Kurukshetra</i></span><i>,</i> over a period of
fifteen years of strenuous creative activity. After the appearance of <span
class=SpellE><i>Sarasvartichandra</i></span> of <span class=SpellE>Govardhanram</span>
half a century ago, it was another great epoch-making event in the history of
Gujarati literature and was duly celebrated as such by all <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>,
following closely upon the enthusiastic celebration of the poet’s Diamond
Jubilee in 1937. Nanalal had thus fulfilled the poetic mission of his life,
moving towards the summit of epic sublimity in his interpretation of the great
cataclysm that took of place on the battle-fields of Mahabharata, taking the
roots of human civilization in the course of its fratricidal conflict, but
leading eventually to a serene reconstruction of human society on sounder cultural
values. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

yet this tremendous literary activity had not exhausted the founts of the
poet’s creative inspiration. Passing through a new efflorescence of vision, the
invigorated genius of the poet set out<i> </i>in a vast imaginative saga, <span

is true that the dreamy fabric of this monumental saga has not taken concrete
shape as the reality of today, but, even so, many of its indications are ripe
with the potential developments of the future. It is a characteristic product

even this did not complete the cathedral of the poet’s lifelong creative work.

years after the poet’s death, saw the light of the day, on a memorable
occasion, by the hand of our beloved leader, <span class=SpellE>Shree</span>
Jawaharlal Nehru. A work of titanic proportions, had it been completed, it
would have probably dwarfed all other masterpieces of Gujarati literature by
its majesty and vastness, and might have taken its rightful place among the
immortal epics of the world’s literature. But, even as it stands, it erects a
splendid arch of that sovereign dome of Indian Culture which <span

by reintegrating the scattered sparks of light in the heart of the nation. And
it replenishes it with the inexhaustible springs of his dynamic inspiration to
stand, for future times, a beacon of eternal light. To a poet of such majestic

Poetry, find their natural counterpart in the regulated pattern of implicit
loveliness in which are cast the matchless odes and lyrics that are the

of <span class=SpellE>Tenyson’s</span> direct influence over him in the matters

unconsciously, through Tennyson, he was related to the very fountain springs of

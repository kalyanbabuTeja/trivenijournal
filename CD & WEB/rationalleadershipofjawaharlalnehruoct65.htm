<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>The world has witnessed on its
stage many a great life with different characteristics. At every stage of human
history, we find great men, with different virtues, powers and capacities,
participating in the great play of human development. In spite of their vast
differences, all of them influence the masses and leave their impact, great or
small, on the human race. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>Although the great men differ in
their outlook, as also in the force of their actions, they set the wheel of
human history moving onward. And the world is not so much concerned with their
differences, as with their thoughts and activities. Such persons, although
their number is insignificant, are needed in every society and in every period
of human advancement, because without them good traditions cannot be built up
and history cannot be shaped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
human society, there are two types of people (1) the people whom we call great
men or great personalities, and (2) the ordinary human beings. The first <span
class=GramE>kind of persons are</span> born with some mission in their life.
With the force of their character, they come forward, influence the common
people and soon become an asset to human society. These are the persons whom we
call leaders. <span class=GramE>The second type of people, who form the great
majority, look forward to the guidance of persons, under the first category.</span>
According to Max Weber of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
leadership can be divided into three categories (1) Traditional, (2)
Legal-Rational and (3) </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

leadership mostly depends upon faith in ancient </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>culture and old
belief and traditions. It is exhibited in all spheres of social life and state
actions. This kind of leadership may accept slight modifications in the
existing social structure, but on the whole it attempts to maintain the <i>status
quo. </i>It is not in favour of radical changes and quick reversals in the
established set-up. In fact, ancientness is the main-stay of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rational
leadership stands for a rational and scientific outlook in life. It is mostly
exhibited through the State power. This kind of leadership pays due respect to
the past culture, but its main concern is with gradual change for the better in
every sphere of social and political life. It tries to bring about the desired
changes </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third and most influential type of leadership is the charismatic leadership.
This kind of leadership is based on a divine vision. Charismatic leadership
mostly depends upon the spiritual force, found in the character of the leader.
It is the most effective kind of leadership. We can easily distinguish such a
leader from the ordinary human beings. A charismatic leader has a wonderful
divine force within him and is able to revolutionise the entire social and
political order of the day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
find two great personalities in the history of modern <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, whom we
can conveniently count in the third category of leadership. They are Mahatma
Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Both of them were extra-ordinary human
beings, with a magnetic power to influence the people. They were international
figures. They not only guided the Indian people, but they also influenced the
peoples of other countries by their great human qualities. Their impact on the
minds of almost all the peoples of the world was decisive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
divide leadership yet from a different standard. This division is mainly
confined to the third type of leadership. We thus divide charismatic leadership
into– (l) rational and (2) spiritual or supernatural. Accordingly, some leaders
are rational-cum-idealist in their approach to human affairs and some are
idealist-cum-spiritual in their attitude towards life. Under the first category
we include the names of Lokmanya Tilak and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and under the
second category we can include the names of Mahatma Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave. We
can easily mark out the difference between these two types of leadership by
observing and analysing the different ideas and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and
Jawaharlal Nehru. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiritual
leadership is supernatural and metaphysical, while rational leadership is
earthly or physical. Spiritual leadership is founded on religion and divine
power. The spiritual leader sees God even in the smallest atom and, as such, he
ponders over all </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>human problems from a metaphysical standpoint.
Gandhiji’s life was moulded in a religious matrix, while Nehru’s personality
was shaped by his scientific outlook and by his belief in the value of this
life only. Nehru was sceptical about the truth that life here-after also
exists. Gandhiji interpreted every human or natural happening from a religious
angle, but Nehru was a scientist and so he tried to find an explanation of
every human or natural occurrence in science. We can mark out this difference
in their approaches by reading the words of Pandit Nehru himself, which he
wrote in his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Autobiography about the earthquake in <st1:place

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“During
my tour in the earthquake area I read with a great shock Gandhi’s statement to
the effect that the earthquake had been a punishment for the sin of
untouchability. This was a staggering remark and I welcomed and wholly agreed
with Rabindranath Tagore’s answer to it. Anything more opposed to the
scientific outlook it would be difficult to imagine.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

second example of disagreement between their outlooks can be found when Mahatma
Gandhi decided to withdraw the non-cooperation movement and Nehru was not in
favour of the withdrawal. Nehru writes in his Autobiography: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(Gandhi) was practically entitled to treat his Ashram inmates in any manner he
liked. They had taken all kinds of pledges and accepted a certain regime, but
the Congress could not do so. I had not done so. Why should we be tossed hither
and thither for what seems to be metaphysical and mystical reasons in which I
was not interested?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Gandhi used to do all his work through inspiration of God. He thought that
everything in this world happened at the will of God. But Nehru’s outlook was
fully practical. He neither believed in any metaphysical force, nor did he
preach. Gandhiji’s actions were guided by his inner voice, but Nehru’s approach
was quite rational or intellectual. The aim of Gandhi’s life was
self-realization and deliverance of soul, but Nehru was concerned with the
problems of this life. Gandhi was more concerned with the means than with the
end, while to Nehru both means and end were equally important. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhi’s
leadership was based on the principles of sacrifice or self-abnegation and <i>Ahimsa,
</i>but Nehru’s leadership was found on belief in material prosperity. Although
both wanted to reform the lot of the poverty-stricken people of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, they
differed in their methods: Gandhiji asked the people to cut their desires, lead
a simple life and to cherish the old ideals of simplicity and contentment.
Nehru had no faith in this philosophy. On the contrary, he always </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>worked
for the material advancement of the people. Nehru could </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not
digest the Gandhian ideals of simplicity and self-realization. He (Nehru) felt
that such a philosophy could not be profitable to the people at large from the
viewpoint of their social and economic development, although he was not against
those persons who wanted to practise it in their personal lives. Gandhiji’s
approach was entirely individualistic. He wanted that every individual should
produce for himself what he needs in life, and that he (individual) should be
self-sufficient and self-dependent. But Nehru believed in collective production
of things and in heavy industrialisation of the country. In short, Gandhi did not
attach as much importance to the material advancement of man as to his
spiritual development. But Nehru wanted to remodel Indian society on the
western pattern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a spiritual leader, Gandhiji believed in cleanliness of mind and body, but he
was no adorer of physical beauty. He thought that physical beauty had nothing
to do with spiritual beauty. What he wanted in life was not earthly beauty, but
the purity of heart and mind. His own life was an example of it. For purity of
thought and actions, he believed that one should practise celibacy and avoid
the use of rich food and spices. Gandhiji was the symbol of life-long
renunciation and dedication. Many Indians differed with him; many rejected his
quaint ideas about continence, complete pacifism and nature cure. But all
respected his sincerity, wisdom and passion for truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nehru’s
leadership, on the other hand, was quite practical and his ideals could be
easily followed by everyone. His ways were quite familiar to the people. He was
a great lover of beauty. The rose in his button-hole was a symbol of his great
attraction for beauty. He had a passion for good food and good clothes. He had
no idea of a simple life, nor did he like to lead the life of an ascetic.
Although Nehru had great respect for the ideals of Gandhiji, he believed that
they could not be easily practised by the common people. Strictly speaking, he
considered them impracticable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

short, spiritual leadership is a thing for adoration only. It leads towards
purification of soul and is a way towards deliverance. It touches the human
heart and ennobles the soul. But rational </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of scientific
leadership studies the conditions of the people and tries to bring about
necessary social, political and economic reforms in the existing set up of
society. Hence, the ways of Pandit Nehru can be followed by a large number of
people, while those of Mahatma Gandhi can be adopted only by a very few
persons. But both Gandhi and Nehru were great in their own spheres. Gandhi
helped <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> to see the
beauty and greatness of her own soul, while Nehru helped the people of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and of
the world to understand the basic needs of their life and work for their
fulfilment. Gandhi prepared the design of the picture of life on which Nehru
tried to erect the building. Although the world seems to be more apt to follow
the rational and scientific leadership, the importance of spiritual leadership
cannot be denied. Both types of leadership are required for building up a
healthy society. Our country has to coordinate both the philosophies with a
view to practising the principle of world peace and enriching human life. In
fact, the progress of humanity depends upon the coordination of these two
leaderships.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;

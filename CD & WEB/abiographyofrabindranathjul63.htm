Tagore has been a great deal in our minds for more than a year now on account
of the celebrations connected with the centenary of his birth. There has been
much talking and writing about him in the same connection, and a good part of
it by people who had some personal knowledge of the poet, and <span
class=SpellE>therfore</span> of value as helping to understand the man and his
work. Of great value in this sense is the book on the poet’s life written by
Sri K. R. <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> writes well. The
English of the book is very good. The writer was in an <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">English</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for some time and has a flair for language. He worked in <span class=SpellE>Shantiniketan</span>
for some years and has married a grand-daughter of the poet. He has known the
members of the poet’s household and persons who worked in close contact with
him over the years. These advantages have been of use because he admired the
poet and thus had a mind that could benefit by what he saw and heard. <span
class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> also has that rare thing which is called
judgment. He does not allow his admiration for the poet to blind him to sides
in the poet’s nature which <span class=GramE>seem</span> to diminish his
stature. The book is, therefore, taken altogether, a very good statement of the
significance of the life and the work of the poet prepared by a friendly hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
introduction describes the atmosphere of the life of <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>
at the time of the poet’s birth (1861). The language is somewhat and the
statement that the British Queen had been Empress of India is incorrect. <span
class=GramE>(<span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> is aware of this as appears
from the statement later on, page 67, that Queen Victoria was proclaimed
Empress of India in 1877).</span> Much of the disapproval of British ways
expressed in this part is post- <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>
in tone. <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> says that a remarkable factor is
that many Indians shared the faith of the Englishmen who believed that <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> would for ever be a possession of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
explains it by the miserable condition through which the country had passed
just previously. The diagnosis may be correct, but it is not correct to say
that any Indian liked the helpless condition of the nation, The great mutiny of
1857 was proof to the contrary and the fact that it had to be quelled
ruthlessly indicates clearly how widespread was the dissatisfaction felt by
sections of the population, Ram Mohan Roy and <span class=SpellE>Devendranath</span>
Tagore were themselves representatives of the spirit of independence. They
lived in their time and made the best of the conditions. Ram Mohan Roy
prospered materially and initiated the reform, in many directions which are now
accepted as a matter of course. The Tagore household prospered even better and <span
class=SpellE>Devendranath’s</span> section of it followed in Ram Mohan’s
footsteps in reform. Many of the features is the life of the Tagore household
seem correct to us because contact with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> has changed our outlook.
Loss of freedom, of course, injured the country but contact with modern
civilisation did us good. Rabindranath himself is in large measure a product of
this contact. His spirit raged against the country’s political dependence but
at the same time grew in width and height in consequence of the experience that
flowed directly from this dependence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Kripalani’s</span> description of
<span class=SpellE>Rabindranath’s</span> boyhood follows the line familiar to
lovers of Tagore from his books of reminiscence and the published letters. The
description of the days of adolescence gives some new material. Tagore’s <span
class=GramE>friendship with <span class=SpellE>Nalini</span> and with his
sister-in-law <span class=SpellE>Kadambari</span> <span class=SpellE>Devi</span>,
and one of the Scott girls in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
are</span> shown as having <span class=SpellE>coloured</span> the poet’s
thought and feeling in a manner not previously widely known. The <span
class=SpellE>freindship</span> with <span class=SpellE>Nalini</span>, it is
clear, was so far as the poet was concerned at least, <span class=GramE>untouched</span>
by any sex feeling. The girl was more than the mature than the boy. This is
perhaps so in all such instances. Similarly the relationship between <span
class=SpellE>Kadambari</span> <span class=SpellE>Devi</span> and the young poet
was for both of them a friendship of the souls. In this case too the young
woman was more mature than the young man. Something similar should have been
the relationship between the poet’s and the daughter of the Scott family. These
friendships touched the poet’s sensitive soul deeply, gave him new insights and
inspired intense. They helped him to blossom into poetry in a way that <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>relationships like those in other lives
centering round physical experience never possibly can.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Last year in
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> I was
present when some friends talked of a Bengali writer having suggested that the
love between Rabindra­nath and <span class=SpellE>Kadambari</span> <span
class=SpellE>Devi</span> was not so innocent and of some controversy in the
language journals in Bengali on this subject. Those who raise such talk and
those who engage in it must ask them­selves what it is they are after. We are
familiar with talk of this kind about western poets, one great writer’s unhappy
married life being explained as due to his impotence, another great writer’s
sister having loved the brother as a lover, and a great poet having betrayed
his intimate friend by having relations with that friend’s wife. To read the
quantity of stuff written on these topics is to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the wisdom of the ancient Indian who would write no biography. We do these
great shades wrong in treating them as still mortal and offering them this
disrespect; their majesty should teach us to behave better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Regarding
the poem addressed to a picture, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> is
certain that the picture was that of <span class=SpellE>Kadambari</span> <span
class=SpellE>Devi</span> and not the poet’s wife. Having read all that he says
on this subject, I am still not sure that this was the case. The memory of <span
class=SpellE>Hecate</span> might have started the poem but that of the wife
seems to have mingled with it as the poem grew.</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> is somewhat
amused at the thought of the poet having married an unlettered little girl from
the country, with so old-fashioned a name as <span class=SpellE>Bhavatarani</span>.
The writing in this context is like that of some fully <span class=SpellE>westernised</span>
person unaware of the meaning of the name and of the thousands of marriages
that take place in this manner in this country and are nevertheless in a large
number of cases happy. I am afraid that in his desire to be thoroughly modern
our author has accepted western notions a little his too fully. By his own
account, <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath’s</span> married life was quite happy:
the husband absent on a journey felt one night that he left the body and went
back to his home to kiss his wife and wrote to her of this; the wife grew to be
mistress of affairs in her home and could, after death, ask her husband through
a <span class=SpellE>planchet</span>, “Are you still as foolish as before”,
referring to his unreasonable objections to her carrying utensils and
provisions on journeys. Is such intense feeling or ease in relationship <span
class=SpellE>realised</span> by husbands and wives in many cases in marriages
based on love at first or later si<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt'>ght? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Similarly, when he talks of the hurry in which the
poet married off his daughters, Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> is
thinking too much of what he would have approved and too little of the anxiety
of a father who had to find for his two motherless daughters places where he
could feel they would be looked after. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani’s</span> ideas on
the development of Rabindranath as writer are on the whole sound. If there is
any defect in them it is that of seeming to accept all the work as right.
“Nature’s Revenge” as a play must appear as not sufficiently high class work to
any <span class=SpellE>unbiassed</span> view. The poem on fanatic Hindus having
killed a Salvation Army preacher must appear unnecessarily ferocious in
forgetting that most Hindus would have been on the poet’s side and not on the
side of the murderous gang. Leaving aside such cases, one agrees with the
author in his appreciation of several sections of the work of the poet. The
study of <span class=SpellE>Chitrangada</span> (the play published with the
name ‘<span class=SpellE>Chitra</span>’ in English) and of the short stories
are instances. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Our author has devoted some attention to what the
poet called ‘<span class=SpellE>Jeevana</span> <span class=SpellE>Devata</span>’.
Here too, though aware of Indian thought, Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>
tends to accept the western line. The universal <span class=GramE>spirit,</span>
or God (whatever term is employed to embody the concept of the ultimate) is
after all a pure abstraction, he says, adding in the same context that even
ordinary men have at times been aware of two selves within them. Ordinary men
aware of two selves within them would in all probability cease to come under
that category. And is the universal spirit more an abstraction than the selves
within? Tagore could feel the one abstraction working on the other abstraction
and could speak of the two as concrete experience. This in truth is what gives
value and significance to all his work both in literature and in other fields.
As he said in the <span class=SpellE>Hibbert</span> Lectures, the ultimate may
be impersonal but on that account to deny the validity of the experience of it
as person is unsound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The thing to remember in following Tagore in such
poetry or discussion is that he inherited ways of thought and feeling and expression
which had been current since the Vedas took shape. “You have no form, no shape,
no weapons, <span class=GramE>no</span> locale and yet for the sake of your
devotees you wear a personal form,” so said the Agama. God is impersonal but
equally he is personal. Equally, again, he is many other things that we do not
know. <span class=GramE>So said Ramakrishna <span class=SpellE>Paramahamsa</span>.</span>
<span class=SpellE>Brahmo</span> by birth, Rabindranath avoided the use of the
orthodox phraseology but the experience or the substance of the expression was
not different. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similar
remarks apply with reference to Tagore’s belief in God. Young people who think
that to be modern they should be septic, asked him if he was certain that God
existed. He said he felt so when he had expressed himself well in some poetry.
What is God? Is he a highly magnified human personality, dwelling in a place
called heaven and ruling the world from there? If so, no living person can see
him as he sees another living person. But if God is conceived as the soul of
our soul and the mind of our mind as Tagore <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
Him and described Him, God is constantly present. Tagore spoke in his
reminiscences of the young people of the days of his youth, affecting atheism,
in imitation of their teachers from the West. Atheism is not new in Indian
thought.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems new to many of us because
we are out of touch with that thought. There is much that is unsound in Indian
thought, but much in it is sound. Indians who know the thought of the West do
well to make use of it, but they can make the best use of it only if they
become aware of their Indian heritage in all these dimensions. That is not to
say that all of us should have a full knowledge of all that India has said on
these subjects. The suggestion is only that we should accept the guidance of
competent people and get some knowledge of what our forbears thought in these
matters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> seems to
make too much of what he calls Tagore’s unpopularity with our people. There are
and were, of course, sections of people who did not think much of his work, but
there was no lack, either, of people who noted the work and praised the poet.
His song in praise of India won applause when he was still young and work of
years not much later so pleased the great <span class=SpellE>Bankim</span> <span
class=SpellE>Chandra</span> <span class=SpellE>Chatterji</span> that he
resigned in the young poet’s <span class=SpellE>favour</span>, at a festivity, a
garland brought for him by <span class=SpellE>Romesh</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandra</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>. What is popularity? Praise by the many?
Judgment of one competent person, Shakespeare suggested, is more important in
such matters than the opinion of a houseful of people not so competent. Tagore
was a social critic even as he was a poet or story-teller and as a social
critic he hurt the self-love of men of another view or those who thought that
they should defend what he <span class=SpellE>criticised</span>. That does not
imply that he was not popular. Such opposition as there was to his ideas was
due partly to his stand in politics. But taken all in all, his writing always
commanded the respect and attention of sufficiently large sections of the
population in his Province. An influential journal like the <i>Modern Review</i>,
representing enlightened opinion, gave the poet in the country a place almost
comparable to that won for him in the world by the award of the Nobel Prize.</p>

is much interesting information in the book about the reaction of English and
other Western writers to the work of Tagore. Tagore, as the only poet in Asia
to whom the Nobel Prize has been awarded, must, of course, be accepted as a
writer of special significance; but in accepting this fact, we should not
forget an award of this kind does not make a poet one single inch taller than
he is. If by some chance the award had not been made, the poet’s altitude would
not have been a single inch less. The prize spotlighted the height, but the
height would be there even if spotlighted. Many circumstances conspired to bring
the award this Indian poet. It was good that they did so; for the world had to
accept his eminence as a writer, if it was to attend to the message he
proceeded to give it. To the poet himself the award was a happy incident in a
life quite eventful even without it. As a crown, not made of thorns, which
said, “this is the man,” it was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>required in the
interests of the world’s welfare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> gives a
fairly good account of all that Tagore did in furthering the feeling that the
world is one. The poet in this matter was indeed much in advance of his time. A
poet is poet precisely because he senses many things that are not obvious to
the non-poet. His soul is sensitive and he quivers at things which do not
disturb the peace of other men. Goethe, we are told, sensed the great disaster
of the Lisbon earthquake the day before it occurred. Tagore sensed the first
world war years before it came. He died, in the middle of the second world war,
crying himself hoarse about the crisis in civilization, and his undying hope
that the East would find the way of life that the West, in pursuit of modern
civilization seemed to have forgotten. Being sensitive, a poet tends to be
individualist. He is prepared to lead men, but when they do not follow him, he
stands aside and lets them pass. The world is too much with us and neither the
Western countries, in their struggle for dominance or self-preservation, nor
India, in her strife with England for recovering independence, could strictly
follow the guidance offered by the poet. But large numbers of people in all the
countries of the world <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that Tagore was a
messenger of world unity and peace and that his words should be attended to by
the nations both of the East and the West. </p>

number of incidents brought together by Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>
are great interest as showing that the great poet was also a very human person.
His letter to the Governor’s Secretary regarding <span class=SpellE>Jyotishchandra</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ghosh</span> (page 261-2), his outburst in a meeting of the
Poetry Society (page 282) in an American City and his reaction to the courtesy
and attention of Dictator Mussolini (page 327) are instances. Sri <span
class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> refers to the difference that arose between poet
and <span class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span> in regard to the idea of universal
spinning under the programme of non-co-operation. Most people feel puzzled to
think that two such men should have had differences. Both loved the country;
both were men with high ideas. Why should they have differed? But they had to,
when one was thinking of action and the other was thinking of the ideal. To the
man of action something is better than nothing. The man of ideals will have the
whole or nothing. The man of action will make the best of the material he has.
The man of ideals will wait to change the material. We, who hold both Gandhiji
and Tagore in reverence, are sorry that they did not agree. If we remember that
the difference was not about principles or final results but about procedure,
we shall feel definitely less sorry. We shall feel even less sorry if we
remember that whereas Gandhiji proposed non-co-operation with evil, the
programme came to be called non-co-operation for short, and this was expanded
to mean non-co-operation with the West, and the poet was unhappy about this
non-co-operation. Non-co-operation with evil was something that Tagore himself <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> and had dreamt of and preached all his life. A
similar unnecessary difference arose when it was thought, quite wrongly, that
Gandhiji made light of Ram Mohan </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<span class=SpellE>Kripalani’s</span> book reminds us that there are people who
attached great importance to Tagore’s physical appearance. It’s good that he
had that appearance and that it attracted people to him and gave them aesthetic
satisfaction. But this again is, for the poet or prophet, adventitious. Another
man of equally lofty conceptions might have a less attractive face. That would
not lower the value of the conceptions. Gandhiji did not attract by his
physical appearance, but he had a smile that charmed, and eyes through which
his soul shone on people. Men who met the Mahatma </span><span

but would, no doubt, concede that a person may be a poet without writing a lot
by way of poetry. The man who said that a cow is a poem of pity proved that he
was a poet. If he had not taken to action which was poetry, he might have
indulged in words that were poetry. Much the same reflection covers Sri <span
class=SpellE>Kripalani’s</span> observation that in Tagore’s later life the
prophet overshadowed the poet. A prophet cannot be much of a prophet if he is
not a poet. It is poetry that gives content to prophecy. He who wrote the
poetry of the earlier years brought out the prophecy from the same self in
later years. It is almost </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

is sad to think that in his old age the poet had to earn money for his
educational work by training troops of actors and presenting shows in big
cities. We were a dependent nation then and Government would not think of
helping this man who had set himself up definitely as a critic of their ways.
But why did not our people help him? By people, I do not mean the average person
in the street and the village, but the educated and the well-to-do who knew the
importance of the work he was doing and the sacrifice which he had made for the
nation. The year of the centenary has been full of eulogy of the man and his
work. The programmes <span class=SpellE>organised</span> in a hundred places

quite follow his meaning. This idiom in English is, I believe, employed to
indicate some defect, but the quality which made Tagore different from these
other great men was a good quality of his own. It is not good even for the
average person to be somebody else. How then can it be good for a great man to
be like another great man? Even common men are not repeated in creation. As
Goethe said of the way in which lives are lived, if God had had another plan he
would have made another man. They err who say that the poet never wrote poor
stuff, never said a wrong word, never did a wrong thing; but they err too who
think that his height is less because he was not a perfect being. Their age
threw up Tagore as he was and Gandhi as he was, Tolstoy as he was and Balzac as
he was, and the world has to be grateful that it was granted these men such as
they were. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span> makes in the
course of the book some general observations and statements in passing which
seem to require re-examination. One of such statements is that in the first
half of the last century the Upanishads were unknown to the Hindus in general.
If Hindus in general means Hindus who had received English education, it may be
true to some extent, but to Hindus in general who know Sanskrit, the Upanishads
have always been familiar texts and to those who did not know Sanskrit their
meaning has been made familiar by corresponding wisdom in their mother tongue.
Another such statement is that we Indians have a lopsided view of life. A
detail that requires verification is the statement that <span class=SpellE>Ahalya</span>,
turned to stone, remained in that form for centuries <span class=SpellE>beore</span>
Rama released her. About Tagore’s faith in transmigration, <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>
says that he believed that the human consciousness has evolved out of several
sub-layers of consciousness and that their memory survives in highly sensitive
minds. One should like to know the authority for this statement. In another
place he says that Tagore knew of Tolstoy and Tolstoy was perhaps not even
aware of Tagore, and adds that if Tagore and Gandhi could understand each
other, despite their great differences, the Russian and the Indian would no
doubt have done the same and even better. The suggestion that the Russian would
have understood the Indian better than the Indian did the Indian, is difficult
to follow. Fortunately, says Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>, in one
place, Tagore was not a philosopher. Is that statement correct? The essays in <span
class=SpellE>Sadhana</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Hibbert</span> Lectures
issued in the form of a book with the title “The Religion of Man” are, in all
the senses of the word, philosophy. What is more, they are philosophy spoken
from experience and realisation. How can any man live, let alone be a poet,
without a philosophy, and if he states the basis of his life and poetry in
words as Tagore did, how can he escape being a philosopher as well as a poet?
And in any case why is it fortunate to be no philosopher? ‘Tagore loved his
country and his people,’ says Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>, “but
made no secret of the fact that he admired the British character more than the
Indian. This his compatriots never forgave him; for this history will <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> him.” With great respect to the author, I submit
that the authority for the statement that Tagore admired the British character,
more than the Indian, should have been cited and that the lumping of all
Tagore’s compatriots into one, and the anticipation of the verdict of history
for something not established are both unsound. Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani’s</span>
statement that Tagore’s renunciation of his knighthood, to voice his people’s
anguish which fear had hushed in every other breast, is equally unsound. For
there certainly were many voices raised against the inhumanity of <span
class=SpellE>Jallianwala</span> massacre. Gandhi’s was a one-track mind, says
Sri <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>. This seems to be a <span class=SpellE>favourite</span>
phrase these days, but what does the phrase mean? Is it more true of Gandhiji
than of Tagore? The music of Western adulation, says our author, had become
sweeter than the music of rain to Tagore. We, of a later generation, with our
eyes still on the West, for the a appreciation which will give us prestige,
should be able to understand why Tagore gave value to the words of praise which
were showered on him in his tours in the West. Adulation seems hardly the word
for the context. </p>

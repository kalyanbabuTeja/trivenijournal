“Alienation” is a condition in which man’s own powers appear as self-subsistent
forces or entities controlling his actions. It is the projection of the social
forces of man on to an arbitrary external power. Marx pleads for the
recognition by man of his natural qualities and rehabilitation of himself as a
social being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Surplus value is the value of the <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, which
should go to the <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> but which the employer
usurps. A commodity is simply crystallized <span class=SpellE>labour</span>.
The excess of market value of that commodity over the cost (<span class=SpellE>labour</span>
and other costs) is surplus value. The same idea was expressed by another
author in popular terms thus: “A wage worker sells his <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
power to a capitalist in two bits: One part of his working day, he spends to
earn wages; the other part he spends working for nothing but creating surplus value
for the capitalist.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The revolution comes out of “the womb of the capitalism”. It is possible only

misery or create misery and exploit the same to become dictators. It is more likely
that Marx did not mean by the expression “Dictatorship”, an autocratic rule but
<span class=SpellE>visualised</span> an institution which approximates to
democracy, as on his theory the toilers or the workers at the time of
revolution will be comprised of the overwhelming majority of the population. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was also a great man and he gave a twist to Marxism leading to results which
Marx never intended. Though Lenin theoretically accepted the principles of
Marxism and indeed propounded them with clarity in his earlier treatises, in
their application to his country’s problems, he departed from its fundamentals.
While Marx premised that a revolution presupposed the existence of a highly <span
class=SpellE>industrialised</span> society, Lenin introduced it in a
predominantly agricultural society. While Marx said that a revolution would be
possible only when the proletariat constituted an overwhelming majority of a
society, Lenin captured power when the Bolshevists were in minority. Indeed
when the last of the Czarists was dethroned in February 1917, Lenin was not in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> at all but in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Switzerland</st1:country-region>
from where he was smuggled into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by the German Kaiser. The great October Revolution had nothing whatsoever to do
with destruction of Czarists Monarchy. What had actually been destroyed was
only truly representative proletariat democratic Government that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> ever
had. In the only election that was held in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, just before Lenin’s
Bolshevists party seized power, the socialist parties emerged victorious and
the Communists were defeated. The seizure of power was a coup <span

spread over 20 years during which period he reared armies and built up administrative

result is that there is an unbridgeable gap between theory and practice. The
aim of communism is Stateless Society. But in fact, it has become a closed
society under the grip of a dictator or a group of dictators. While in theory
it <span class=SpellE>visualises</span> the situation when the people enjoy the
basic rights in the governance of the State itself, in practice the freedoms of
people are mercilessly suppressed. It seeks to usher in the utopia by pursuing
the totalitarian path and by suppressing freedoms which is a negation of
democracy. Whatever discussion is allowed and whatever processes of election to
particular institutions are adopted, every thing is done to order and under the
canopy of the policy laid down by the man or men at the top. A scrutiny of the
process of election to the Soviet of Union and the Soviet of Communities demonstrates
that the democratic forms are adopted, but the spirit is ignored. The voters
are asked to approve the names selected by the man in power and the high
percentage of votes polled reflects the conditioned mind of the servile
electorate. What authority thinks is good for the people, should be accepted as
good. The claim of communism to the <span class=SpellE>lable</span> of
democracy is based on a fallacy. It equates the people’s rule for the people,
with the rule of the despot which is presumed to be good for the people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is, therefore, clear that communism, as evolved in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, is nothing more than State
Capitalism and the entire life of the people is controlled through bureaucracy
and force. The elections that are staged in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> are not democratic elections
at all, for the two houses of the Supreme Soviet are filled by party nominees
selected by the top men without any contest. Indeed the Supreme Soviet only
records the policies settled and dictated by the party machine. It follows that
if Socialism means Communism, it cannot co-exist with democracy. They are
contradictory in terms. One stands for free elections and the other for
autocratic rule, one believes in a free and equal society and the other asserts
that an equal society can be ushered in only through the suppression of
freedoms. One believes in State ownership of the instruments of production and
distribution and the other in the individual right to property, subject to the
laws of social control. Both cannot co-exist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
the doctrinaire socialism asserts that socialism could be brought about through
real genuine democratic processes. In essence it is communal ownership of land
and capital by a democratic State. It aims at collective organisation of the
society. It may be described as State Socialism. State Socialism believes in
Parliamentary democracy and <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> of the means
of production and distribution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
only difference between Capitalism and State Socialism is that under the latter
the means of production are owned and managed by the State instead of the
private entrepreneurs. It has all the evils of capitalism without its good
points. In it there is greater scope for the exploitation of the weaker
sections of the community, and the voters. As the entire economic power is
drawn into the hands of the political bosses and the committed bureaucracy
controlled by them it will finally end in one-party system. It will help to
manipulate the electorate through power, purse, patronage and propaganda. A
point of time will come when autocratic power will be exercised through
democratic processes; the forms will be maintained and the spirit will lose
their freedoms. Indeed the workers will be in a worse position than under a private
employer in an advanced country. As the State becomes the sole employer, and
the sole capitalist, the workers will be at its mercy and the Trade Unions will
become its agents <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> only to compel the
obedience of the workers on its terms. To use the terminology of Marx, the
State takes the surplus value created by the working class and peasants. Though
theoretically State Socialism and democracy can co-exist, in practice and in the
process democracy, as understood in political science, will cease to exist.
Some of the modern eminent thinkers like <span class=SpellE>Milovan</span> <span

Socialism”, Bertrand Russell, <span class=GramE>Lord</span> Atlee. R. H. S.
Crossman, William H. Hobson, <span class=SpellE>Anatole</span> Stab, Andrew <span
class=SpellE>Sakharov</span> expressed themselves practically against
Authoritative State Socialism. It is <span class=GramE>manifest</span> that ‘State

a pragmatic concept of ‘Democratic Socialism’ also has been evolved in
political science, which properly implemented harmonizes the doctrine of
socialism and democracy, without depriving either of its fundamental
principles. The Socialist democracy in <st1:place w:st="on">Western Europe</st1:place>
particularly in Scandinavian countries on the basis of experience gained, have
given up <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> and State ownership of the means
of production (Land and Capital) and accepted mixed or dual economy as a means
to achieve the new social order. They coined new slogans to define their aims: <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sweden</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
objective is “a house for the people”, Danes’ “The greatest possible happiness
for the greatest number of people”, Norwegians’ “Security regardless of individual
success’. The principle of allocation between the public and private <span

lack of finance or know-how, in the public sector and the rest in the private

private sector to the extent necessary to <span class=SpellE>subserve</span>

is a social and political movement striving to bring about a new and better

objective of every <span class=GramE>democratic party</span> in the 20th
century. But if socialism is defined from the perspective of the means to
achieve the desired end, there is conflict between democracy and communism.
Socialism of the Communist countries <span class=GramE>lay</span> emphasis on
the State control of the means of production and distribution; whereas
democracies rely upon mixed economy and the rule of law reach the desired
social ends. In the authoritarian socialism of Communist countries, <span

ingredients of the Indian Constitution may be briefly stated thus: In the
political field it provides for a federation and Parliamentary democracy
subject to specified limitations; in the economic field for individual rights
subject to the laws of social control; in the social field, for social justice,
i.e., right of the backward and underprivileged people to the State’s
protection against the ruthless competition of life; in the legal field for
rule of law, in which the social and economic justice is inextricably
integrated and in the religious field the right to the freedom of conscience.
The combined effect of these ingredients may for convenience of reference be
described as a Welfare State. A Welfare State is a State where there is
prosperity, gainful employment, equality, freedom and social justice. The
Constitution directs the ushering in of such a State through democracy and rule
of law. Both the means and the end are important. Indeed the means and the end
are part of the Welfare State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be a conflict between the fundamental rights and the laws of social control

solve these conflicts. The judiciary has to decide both on the scope of the
fundamental rights, the permissible limits of the laws of social Control and to
decide also on the validity of laws creating statutory rights on the basis of
tests of legitimate encroachment on the said rights. Out of this conflict
evolves the new social order by the process of judicial adjustment and through
the rule of law. If the statutory rights have become crystallized and the State
would carry enforcement, they could be raised to the pedestal of fundamental
rights by suitable amendments to the Constitution. The new list of fundamental rights
would in their turn become subject to <span class=SpellE>justiciable</span>
laws of social control. By <span class=GramE>these continuous interaction</span>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Besant was born in 1847. Having lost her father at the age of five, she had to
face many difficulties in her life. She was married to a clergyman, at the age
of twenty, but very soon there grew up differences between her and her husband,
and she was ultimately forced to leave her husband’s home when, she was hardly
twenty-five. Events<i> </i>of her life changed for the better when she, in
association with Mr. Bradlaugh, showed herself to be a great organiser, a
writer and a great thinker. She came to India in 1893 as a member of the
Theosophical Society. She studied the conditions of life in India and was
deeply moved by certain social abuses. It was her deep conviction that India
would not be bettered socially, economically and politically unless there was a
revival of her ancient spiritual glory. She found, by a study of the history of
this country, that the glory of India in the past lay in the spiritual
atmosphere that prevailed then. The conception of the unity of spirit, in the
midst of the diversity of castes, disparity of religions, and educational and
economic inequalities, was the source of the fruitfulness of life in India in
the past. She felt that, If unless this spiritual life was revived, there would
be no revival of the glory of India and her salvation and along with it the
salvation of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Youth:</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> The future of a country, according to Mrs.
Besant lies in the education of her youth-men and women. The youth have to be
fostered with due attention to their spiritual moral culture. They must be
taught at home, and outside home scientific basis of moral precepts, with a
view to make them acquire an intelligent appreciation of the value of religion
and morality. She observed, in the first instance, even among the cultured
people of India, a cleavage between the English-knowing people and the pure
Sanskrit scholars. She felt that this cleavage should be made up by means of
the Sanskrit scholars learning English and English-knowing people learning
enough of Sanskrit to help </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>them to write and converse in Sanskrit.
The gulf between northern and southern Indians should be made up by the
universal learning of Hindi, already so widely spoken in India. It was Mrs.
Besant that saw the need for the education of women as well, so that they might
be competent to bear the responsibilities of wifehood and motherhood. Women
should be learned and cultured enough to make their homes the centres of
spirituality, embodying in themselves the tenderness and fidelity of Sita and
Savitri, the intellectual grandeur of Gargi and the all sacrificing
spirituality of Maitreyi. Woman, according to the Hindu ideal, is not the
competitor of man in all forms of public employment. Exceptional cases have, of
course, to be treated exceptionally. But the generality requires to be given
sound literary knowledge with knowledge of science sufficient for running the
home and the larger society under health, conditions. Besides, women need
music, drawing, painting and sewing and embroidery work to enjoy life in all
its fulness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the Depressed Classes: </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The next item of importance which
attracted the attention of Mrs. Besant in the Indian social life was the
existence of a mass of people known as the “depressed classes”. Like the
“submerged tenth” in England, they formed in India nearly a sixth of the
population. They formed a large class, ignorant, degraded, unclean in habits
and language and always on the verge of starvation. This community was prolific
but their children were ill-nourished and ill-kept and they were malformed and
subject to diseases which often times proved fatal. They consisted of the
original inhabitants, and hybrids of illegitimate offspring of the Aryans. They
were looked upon with scorn and were considered as untouchables. After the
advent of the British, and the spread of Christianity as the religion of the
rulers, and during the rule of the Muslims before the coming of the English,
they found social salvation by adopting Mohammedanism or Christianity, two
alien forms of religion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Besant felt that the abuse to which a sixth of the population was subjected was
one potent cause of the degradation and the loss of prestige of India. She felt
the need to establish schools for them in order to foster in them habits of
cleanliness, to make them intellectually enlightened, and to draw at the
germinal powers of their souls. She did much to teach the principle that the
educated upper classes were bound to raise them upto higher levels of physical,
intellectual and moral excellence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Care of Children: </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The children of today, to whatever caste
they belong, are the citizens of tomorrow. The king or whosoever takes the
place of the king, stands in relation to them their guardian who should give
them protection, safety and succour. A sorry feature of Indian social life is
that the boys and girls of poor parents are sent into the streets to beg and
support their lazy elders. Often times, destitute girls, unable to earn their
living by honest effort, are driven to sell their souls and bodies. The primary
duty of the society and their rulers is to take them out of the streets, and by
pure love and adequate training, to equip them to earn their living by pure and
honest means. It is not true religion merely to go to the temples and make
offerings the deity in the temple. It is genuine religion to wipe away tears of
the helpless and to make the world for them a happy place to live in. Mrs.
Besant did all she could for the uplift such children. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

care of Animals: </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She was as much concerned about the
animals as about the human beings. In India, in particular, the men and the
animals are friendly. The cattle are the dumb followers of their owners. This
harmony between the two orders of creation grows out of the religious feeling
that there is one consciousness pervading life in all its manifestations. The
bull that ploughs the field and the cow that yields the milk are treated in the
Indian countryside as the parents of the village population. But, in the towns,
many cruelties are inflicted on animals by way of forcing them to unnatural
exertion. Mrs. Besant encouraged the efforts of the societies for the
protection of cattle. Such societies prevented, by propaganda, the sale of cows
and calves for food and the over-loading of carts drawn by animals. The modern
features of cattle-shows and distribution of prizes to well-grown animals is
the outcome of the humanitarian work of such people as Mrs. Besant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Indian Character: </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs. Besant is a believer in the theory
that “Character is destiny”. In the past, the glory of India rested on the
character of the Aryans. Lofty spirituality, unbending rectitude, reverence to
God and a feeling of hospitality to the guests were the fundamental traits of the
Aryan character. Truth was the firm basis of their life and courage and
fearlessness naturally followed. With such basic character and with their
association with the English nation, India can build up again a glorious
future. According to Mrs. Besant, the future of India rested on three factors,
namely, religion, education and political relations with England and the rest
of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>In religion India has more to teach than to learn from
England. Hinduism is the religion of nearly seventy per cent of the population
while the remaining thirty per cent consisted of the Muslims, the Christians,
the Parsis, the Jains, the Sikhs etc. Hindu religion has always encouraged, to
the fullest, the freedom of the intellect. Though it is strict in its adherence
to its social polity, it is marvellously, broad in its ethical and
philosophical outlook. This outlook is responsible for the existence, side by
side, of so many creeds. After the advent of the British, Christian
missionaries found a favourable atmosphere in India for the propagation of
their faith. There was among the Indians the prevailing-consciousness that the
Christian religion was the creed of the powerful British rulers. This
consciousness along with the folly of Hinduism, in leaving a large mass of
people with practically no religion at all, gave an opportunity to the
Christian missionaries to carry on their propaganda. The helpless mass of the
people who were left out of the pale of Hinduism, the depressed classes, found
an easy refuge in Christianity which welcomed them into its fold. Having
embraced the religion of the rulers, they gained prestige in society as they
learnt from the Christians of England ways of decent living, though their
intellectual and ethical life remained the same as before. Theosophy sought to
counteract the danger of Christianity submerging Hinduism. It encouraged the
study of the fundamentals of each religion which revealed that all creeds are
basically the same. This revelation fostered in the minds of the Hindus not only
a spirit of religious tolerance but also confirmed their faith in the strength
of Hinduism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Education: </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs. Besant insisted on the spread of education
as a means of elevating the thought and conduct of the people of this country.
It was creditable that the British rulers gave to India the advantage of
education by establishing schools, colleges and universities. It was Lord
Macaulay that laid the foundations of Indian Education. But the defect of this
educational scheme was that it was unsympathetic. It never sought to understand
the tradition of the people and make it the basis of education. The main fault
of English education in India is that memory is encouraged to the exclusion of
the reasoning faculty. The system of education involves too many examinations,
the preparation for which means a lot of physical and mental strain. The Indian
student is naturally studious. What he needs is the stimulation of his play
instinct. To achieve this objective, greater emphasis is to be laid on physical
training, and cramming should be given up in preference to the development of
the faculty of reason. Another defect of the educational system is the high
cost of education. The rich and the idle alone can take advantage of the
educational institutions but the poor who are really industrious are shut out.
The award of scholarships is no remedy as it helps only a few. An all round
lowering of the cost of education is necessary to encourage the intellctuals
who are poor so that they may be enlightened and be helpful to the State in the
governance of the country. Mrs. Besant sensed the feeling among the people that
the cost of education was kept purposely high to shut out the intellectuals.
Therefore, was started, the Benaras Hindu College, which cut down the fees to
the minimum, provided a high standard of instruction, which improved the
faculty of reason, and encouraged physical activities so as to ensure all round
development. Thus she demonstrated in the Benaras Hindu College what she meant
by<i> </i>a sympathetic understanding of the problem of education in India. She
also emphasised the importance of technical education for improving the country
agriculturally and industrially. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Economics
and Politics: </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She condemned courageously the economic policy
of the British. They created famines artificially </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
exporting corn in the years of plenty and leaving the population of India to
starvation in the years of drought. The policy of the rulers of India, before
the advent of the British, was in perfect accord with the interests of the
people. They took care to store grain during the seasons of plenty and thus
provide against famine. The improved facilities for transport , combined with
the economic policies of the British rulers, were responsible for the famines.
She exposed the British Industrial policy as well. She pointed out how the
British had suppressed the industries of India deliberately, their policy of
importing cheap goods into the Indian Market. Indian cotton was exported to
Lancashire for the manufacture of cloth. The cheap price given to the raw
material impoverished Indian producer, while at the same time there was dearth
of new material for the indigenous manufacturers. The British imported goods
manufactured in their country and flooded the markets of India with them. The
result was, the industries of the country suffered heavily. Thus she showed the
defects of the British economic policy and demonstrated the need for the
Indianization of the Government so that Indians could keep a firm control over
the economics and politics of their country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
she exposed the lack of wisdom in accusing Theosophy as a revival of ancient
superstitions. Religion is often associated with superstition as smoke is a
necessary concomitant of fire. But to eliminate smoke we do not extinguish the
fire. We drive out smoke by fanning the fire into a blaze. So also Theosophy is
calculated to spread ‘knowledge which cuts away, scepticism on the one side,
and superstition on the other, with the sword of wisdom. The increased understanding
of all religions is the only way of dispelling the smoke of superstition.
Theosophy gets to the root of religion in general and uproots superstition. So
long as religion ruled the people of India, the people of India were virile,
wealthy and well versed in arts and crafts. Lofty and creative intelligence
gave to the country its literature and philosophy. Human thought rose to the
height of grandeur and the human spirit was sublime. Might of religion and
height of material prosperity went hand in hand. In the 18th century ‘the
droppings of India’s soil fed distant nations.’ Her fall in spirituality
resultd in her deterioration in the material sphere also. Spirituality was the
source of originality and inspiration. Theosophy only seeks to revive the ancient
spirituality of India with its creative intelligence. The fall of India came
about in three steps: Decline of spirituality, decline of creative
intelligence, and the consequent decline of material prosperity. Mrs. Besant
sought to remount the ancient glory first by a revival of pure spirituality,
then by a wisely chosen and well directed educational policy, and finally by
the revival of her material prosperity, which depends on technical education
leading to the improvement of agriculture and industries. The fundamental truth
of Hindu religion is the realisation of the oneness of the spirit. Out of this
realisation grows the wisdom that, in essence, all religions are identical in
their fundamentals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thus it was the work done by Mrs. Besant with reference to all the problems
connected with life in India that brought to the forefront, the glory of the
country in the past, accounted for that glory, and showed the way to build up a
New India, through a consciousness of the oneness of the spirit, and through an
education and selfless effort in the direction of India’s political<i> </i>freedom
and material prosperity. It was her conviction that the prosperity of the world
lay in the revival of the spiritual glory of India and her leadership of the
world, so as to ensure the establishment of the Kingdom of God on the earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

service in the Police department was really incongruous with my background.
When I had met my old school teacher in the street, and told him about my job,
he patted me on the shoulder, and, with a look of disbelief, exclaimed: “The
son of <span class=SpellE>Govind</span> <span class=SpellE>Shastri</span>
wearing a policeman’s uniform! What a joke!” And he had gone on to say:
“Society needs policemen. Law and order must be maintained. There must be
peace. And so there must be policemen. But why should the son of a <span
class=SpellE>Shastri</span> think of accepting a job in the Police department?
The very nature of a policeman’s duties is such that you have to be
hard-hearted. You have to arrest even your friends. You may have to put
hand-cuffs on people whom you respect. There is no room for softness or pity in
a policeman’s work. You have to be brutal and cruel when you are investigating
a crime and obtaining a confession. The policeman’s line is not for such as
you….” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

don’t you think that the Police department will improve, only if educated young
men enter it?” I ventured to argue with my old teacher. “You are wrong, sir, if
you imagine that I am going to be an ordinary constable, parading the street
with a baton in my hand, or standing in a square and controlling the traffic.
No, no. I am an officer. I have passed the training course. I am educated.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

educated you may be,” he shook his head as he stuck to his disapproval, “the
work of a policeman is such that there will come a time when you will have to
forget your education and culture, and behave like a heartless brute. At least,
you will have to countenance such brutality committed by men under you. It is
impossible for a Police officer to be always kind-hearted. He has to give up
all tenderness, all gentleness–even common humanity.” </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had then patted my shoulder again with affection and said: “But let that go.
You must excuse me for my plain speech, if I have hurt you. But I could not
help saying what I thought. I am delighted to know that you have a steady job
and you are on your way to settle down in life. God bless you, my dear boy. I
wish you all the best.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

old teacher was not the only person to express surprise when I became a Police
officer. Many of my friends thought that I could have done much better. The son
of a reputed <span class=SpellE>Shastri</span>, well versed in the Vedic lore,
and respected for his proficiency in the <span class=SpellE>Shastras</span> and
Sanskrit literature, had chosen to become a uniformed guardian of Law and
peace! This was apparently too incongruous to believe. Had my father been living,
he would certainly not have allowed me to enter the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName

I could do so only because I was free to do whatever I liked. I had no wish to
fall into the usual rut of collegiate education. I could not think of becoming
a lawyer or a doctor, since that would have taken several years, and I had no
money to spend on these courses. I did not have any talent or inclination for
business. My only asset was first class physical health and proficiency in all
sports. I might have tried my luck at becoming a film actor. But the president
of the physical instruction school which I attended advised me to enlist myself
in the Police department. “We have our own Government now,” he had said to me;
“the Police department needs educated young men like you. You will easily get a
scholarship.”….I had accepted his advice….I had completed the course at the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Police</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Training
  School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> with distinction, and I was now a Police

came occasions during the three years of my service when I had to admit that my
old teacher and my friends were right in warning me. I had to shed all softness
of the heart in investigating crimes and getting at the truth at the bottom. I
had to expose the misdeeds of men who went about as innocent, virtuous,
respectable citizens. My confidence in human goodness received cruel shocks,
and began to falter. I began to change, and to regret that I was no longer a
straightforward simple man who believed in the inherent goodness of people
around him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

yet, even my blunted mind revolted against the injustice of the way in which
this young girl <span class=SpellE>Bakula</span> was being treated. Was there
any sense in beating her, any sense in presuming that she was a criminal, and
lashing her with a butcher-like ferocity?….The constable cracked the leather
strap. The girl whimpered and cried. And as an officer in charge of the
investigation, I not only looked on but, in a way, encouraged and connived at
the shameful act of inhuman torture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been a theft at the Ambassador Hotel. The suite of a Princess had been
broken in, and the Princess’s jewels had been stolen. On receipt of the news of
this burglary, the wheels of our department had been set in motion. ‘<span
class=SpellE>Panchnama</span>’, depositions–all the usual formalities had been
gone through. We of the Police department adopt a method of elimination when we
set about investigating a crime. We first of all imagine all kinds of
possibilities, and proceed to eliminate them one by one and try to <span
class=GramE>arrive</span> at the most plausible explanation. This method,
besides being most logical, has proved to be the most practical, yielding
amazing results, solving the riddles of the most baffling crimes. Naturally the
Ambassador burglary was being tackled in this time-<span class=SpellE>honoured</span>
way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It often happens that our department cannot pin the
guilt on any particular individual. We have to let go all persons who are
arrested as suspects and put in the Police lock-up. Our investigations bear no
fruit, and we are faced with the honest admission that the mystery of the crime
cannot be solved. But we try to avoid such an admission, since the prestige of
the department is at stake. Then the only recourse left to us is to catch hold
of some one suspect and resort to the ‘third degree’. This method brings out a
confession, which is sometimes ultimately denied in the court. We have often to
deal with confirmed criminals, in whose case beating and torture is the only
way to make them speak out the truth. But in many cases we beat the wrong
person. We know this very well, and yet we have to do the beating in order to
preserve the prestige of the department. </p>

I watched <span class=SpellE>Bakula</span> lying on the floor in a helpless
huddle crying and ducking from the next lash of the whip, I could not help
thinking that we were tackling the wrong person...A <span class=SpellE>favourite</span>
presumption of the Police department is that no person is innocent unless his
innocence is proved and established beyond doubt, and that beating a suspect is
perfectly justified. This is evidently contrary to the common man’s belief that
a person who denies having anything to do with a crime must be treated as
innocent, and it is both unjust and inhuman to try to extort a confession from
him. But the Police learn by experience that no offender confesses his offence
unless he is compelled to do so, and that what applies to the tougher type of
offenders also applies to all other types of people, and, therefore, innocence
is, more often than not, a pretence...So the Police become used to forget all
the feelings of pity and mercy, and to employ violence when trying to elicit
information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

himself above all corruption. Wine, woman and money are the most corrupting

innocence was beyond any doubt. It was heartless to inflict any punishment on

and the Princess had </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

“My driver. <span class=GramE>My cook.</span> This is <span class=SpellE>Bakula</span>,
my chief maid.” The Princess had said, and at that very moment I had been
surprised by the girl’s uncommon beauty. I had even inwardly wondered at the
irony of Fate which had reduced to the state of a servant a girl who should
really have been the Princess. As <span class=SpellE>Bakula</span> was shoved
into the Police van along with the other servants and brought to the lock-up, I
could not help feeling sad that this charming young girl was about to be
interrogated. I would have set her free if that were possible. But 1 had to be
careful lest my superiors should blame me and the constables under me consider
my action queer. ‘May God protect <span class=GramE>her!</span>’<b>–</b>I<b> </b>had

indeed a wonderful place, where you could forget your earthly troubles. And the

regret or remorse. We ate our meal heartily, sat on our doorstep, watching

bounty of happiness for me and <span class=SpellE>Bakula</span>. What made me

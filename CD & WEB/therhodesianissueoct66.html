<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rhodesia
is one-third the size of India in territory, but has a population only of about
four million, out of which the vast majority are Africans with 117,000
Europeans, sometimes estimated at 127,000, and about 7,000 people of Asian or
Indian origin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rhodesia
presents a picture today of the type Kenya presented in the fifties. In Kenya,
although Indians owned some of the Hotels, yet no Indian was allowed to step
inside and of course, no African was allowed to pollute the atmosphere breathed
by the European. There were areas specially reserved for the European. Round
about Nairobi the Chief Koinage, whose son Mbiyn Koinage, is the Education
Minister in President Jono Kenyatta’s Cabinet, owned a farm which was taken
over by the Europeans as it grew a valuable coffee plantation. Each acre of
coffee gives a net income of £300 sterling or more. The lands in Kenya which
were the most fertile, namely the highlands, were reserved only for Europeans,
many of whom, like Colonel Grogan, who is still alive, and Lord Delaware, Lord
Mountbatten’s brother-in-law, were given this land, hundreds of thousands of
acres, at one penny an acre. This land is being bought by<i> </i>Africans on a
subsidy basis, the subsidy being provided as loan by the British Government.
The same order now prevails in Rhodesia. The greatest evils of the system of
Apartheid practised by Rhodesia’s Southern neighbour, South Africa, are to be
found in neighbouring Rhodesia. The world is pledged to the system of one man
one vote. As has happened in Kenya, the same evolution will, if necessary, take
place in Rhodesia. The principle of one man one vote will surely be successful.
But when? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>British
Government has agreed to apply economic and financial sanctions to Rhodesia
after the unilateral declaration of Independence by that country. I said at the
airport at Lusaka that if an exile Government sponsored by the Organisation for
African unity is established outside Rhodesia, we the Government </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
people of India will accord our recognition to it. The British High
Commissioner in Zambia told me at Lusaka that this was interference in the
internal affairs of the country but he wisely forbore to name the country. Was
it Rhodesia or was it Great Britain? In fact he proceeded to give the answer
himself when he referred to the war-time recognition of the French Liberation
movement headed by General de Gaulle in Great Britain. In fact, no one can be
prevented from opposing the Rhodesian Government’s whiteman policy just as no
one can be prevented from organising resistance to it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Seven
African nations have, since December 15, 1965 broken off diplomatic relations
with the U. K. But the tragedy of Rhodesia is that, although the masses are all
right, as witnessed by the three day strike of Africans in Salisbury, recently,
yet there is a lack of leadership at the top. Mr. Nkomo and the Reverend
Sithole are the leaders of Zapu and Zanu, the two African organisations
fighting for freedom in Rhodesia; but, alas! both the leaders are not only
detained but at loggerheads one with the other. This is tragic in the extreme.
When two years ago we met at the house of Mr. Tom Mboya, Minister for Economic
Co-ordination and Planning in Nairobi, I made an attempt to bring the two
leaders together, but without result. Since then, the two leaders have drifted
apart to such an extent, that one of the near relatives of the Reverend Sithole
wrote a letter to the Press, saying that his group was not even willing to hold
discussions with the other group. He used much stronger language. President
Kaunda of Zambia, which country received its freedom very recently, said to me:
“I would like the Africans of Rhodesia to burn their Kapingas (passes which
each African has to carry as a mark of his slavery) but not one has done this
so far.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few days later came the news of wholesale strikes in Salisbury. Ian Smith,
Prime Minister of Rhodesia, has issued a unilateral declaration of
independence. He is supported in this, covertly by both Portugese Mozambique,
Portugese Angola and South Africa. Most of the trade of Rhodesia is South
Africa orientated. Most of the trade in Zambia is either Salisbury orientated
or else London orientated. The copper from the Cooper Belt of Zambia owned
respectively by Mr. Oppenheimer of South Africa, and the American Selection
Trust, depends for its power supply on </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the Kariba Dam, whose
installations are in Rhodesia, while the lines go across Zambia. The copper
goes via the port of Beisa in Mozambique. British aircrafts have arrived in
Zambia to protect the Kariba Dam. How they can do so is the problem. President
Kaunda has asked for troops to protect the Dam because the entire economy of
Zambia depends upon the power supply from the Kariba Dam. The great Zambesi
river, along whose banks in the eighties Frank Harris is alleged to have made
his way to civilisation, divides Zambia from Rhodesia. The whole of Africa is
up in arms against Rhodesia. President Nyrere said to us in Dar-es-Salaam:</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
question is of transport. While the Railway to be built from Zambia to <i>Tanzania
</i>will take at least six years, the copper from Zambia has to be lifted. The
Americans and the British have offered to airlift this copper to the port of
Dar-es-Salaam if the port of Beira in Portugese Mozambique is closed to
Zambia.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

said: “It is right that alternative routes should be explored. But what
guarantee is there that once the British and the Americans come back they will
want to get out again?” And all of us </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>laughed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
situation in Africa is explosive. Tanzania and Ghana have broken relations with
Great Britain on the 15th of December 1965. Others may also do so. But none of
the countries near Zambia have any forces with which to fight the strong army
and air force of Rhodesia. Great Britain is naturally being blamed for having
sent troops, to the black countries like Aden and British Guiana, but not to
the country ruled by Whites, namely Rhodesia, on the principle that blood is
thicker than water. The sanctions have not had the effect on Rhodesia that was
anticipated, and Ian Smith boasts of this quite naturally. But the wise and
tolerant President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, has suggested another round of
talks at the Security Council, while the Emperor of Ethiopia has suggested
another meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa, soon after
the last meeting held there, on the 3rd of December, 1965. The situation in the
entire continent of Africa is heavily surcharged with ominous possibilities.
Only time can show the result which cannot but be inevitable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
British Prime Minister said the other day in the House of Commons: “The House
will also be aware that on the break-up of the Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland the bulk of the Federation Air Force went to Southern Rhodesia. In consequence,
“Zambia” (the new name for Nyasaland) feels herself at present without
effective means of defence. Her Majesty’s Government have, therefore, expressed
their willingness to meet President Kaunda’s request to fly into Zambia a
squadron of Javelin aircraft, complete with radar equipment, to be stationed at
Ndola, the ground equipment to be stationed at Lusaka, and a detachment of the
R. A. F. Regiment to be stationed at both airports, and probably at Livingstone
as well in order to ensure the protection of the aircraft and installations.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

H. M. S. Eagle is cruising off the Tanzanian coast. Mr. Wilson said that
President Kaunda had made a further request for a battalion of ground troops
but the result of the talks Mr. Bottomley had with President Kaunda are now
known. The offer has been accepted. Mr. Wilson made it clear that all these
forces sent to Zambia were for defensive purposes only. I do not recall that
the forces sent to Aden or to British Guiana were also merely for defensive purposes.
Mr. Wilson said further that although the power House at Kariba was on the
Rhodesian s</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ide, yet the power is supplied both to Zambia
and to Rhodesia. Be said he had given President Kaunda a guarantee that if </span><span

is cut off “We shall not stand idly by.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

House of Commons wanted its appreciation of the great patience and
statesmanship displayed by President Kaunda to be conveyed to him. President
Kaunda is a great man, a great leader, and forms, with President Kenyatta and
President Nyoere, a three-man team of leaders of whom we in Asia and they in
Africa are justly proud. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Speaker of Parliament at Lusaka gave us a reception. Although Plelident Kaunda
does not ordinarily go to these receptions, nevertheless he turned up at this
one with his wife, both of whom will be coming to India in the winter of 1966.
The delegates were justly proud of this honour done to them by President Kaunda
and his wife, but realised that it was an honour done to their country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

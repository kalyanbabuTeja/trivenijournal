style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third quarter of the year 1951 has been in many respects a momentous period for
the country. The two major events have been a higher tempo in the strained
relations with Pakistan and the turmoil in the Congress organisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the month of July, Pakistan leaders unleashed a tearing propaganda of hate and
worked up their people to a white heat of mass hysteria. The clenched fist was
adopted as the symbol; black-outs, drills of home-guards, defence measures on a
war footing, mass gatherings for preaching hate of the enemy, became the order
of the day in Pakistan. All the bigger towns and cities witnessed a series of
excited assemblies for the Jehad that they were proposing to embark upon. Side
by side the Prime Minister of Pakistan, with an eye to international
news-market, indulged in a series of letters exchanged with the Indian Prime
Minister, purporting to prove to the world the peace-loving intentions of
Pakistan and the unreasonable attitude of India according to the Pakistan point
of view. The letters make an interesting study and reveal the psychology of
Pakistan leadership. The main effort is to malign India and the Indian
Government before the eye of international opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
immediate cause of the fresh spate of hostile propaganda is given out to be the
massing of India’s military forces near the borders of Pakistan. But the
occasion for this step was similar prior action on part of Pakistan. This fact
is conveniently obscured. When Pandit Nehru asks for an unequivocal and
unconditional mutual declaration that in no circumstances would war be resorted
to, Mr. Liaqat ali Khan wants all his objectives to be gained as the prior
condition of a no war declaration. And the correspondence had to end
inconclusively. The only purpose gained by Pakistan was one more occasion to
create prejudice against India. International opinion on the Indo-Pakistan
differences has unfortunately shown itself inept, and the patent fact of Pakistan’s
aggression and unlawful occupation of a good part of Kashmir territory, though
judicially investigated and recorded by the U. N. Representative, Sir Owen
Dixon, is deliberately left out of account in assessing the situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
real reason for the intensified hostile preparations and threats of Pakistan in
July last would appear to be connected with the preparations for elections to
the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir and Dr. Frank Graham’s visit. Pakistan has
very strong objection to the crystallising of opinion in Kashmir and has made
screaming appeals to the Security Council of the U.N.O. to intervene. Dr. Frank
Graham, busy with a first-hand appraisal of the whole situation, obviously
declined to be deviated from his task. So by creating the excitement of the
whole populace of Pakistan against India, the leadership wanted to create in
the mind of the observer a strong impression of the need of Kashmir for
Pakistan’s prosperity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
manner in which India’s leadership tackled this explosive situation ought to
evoke the admiration of impartial observers, if there are any such available in
the modern world, where interested motives are allowed to dominate the outlook
to the detriment of calm judgment. The psychosis of fear and hatred, suspicion
and deliberate dishonesty, has polluted international morality to its very
bases. The Indian Prime Minister, in his masterly handling of the crisis, made
it clear to Pakiatan and to the world that his country would in no case indulge
in war, but firmly made it clear that if Indian territory, including Kashmir,
were attacked, it would be defended with all available strength. At the same
time the Prime Minister kept a cool control over the temper of the whole
country. The ardent communalists and rabid extremists were told off and normal
life went on uninterrupted in India. The Muslim community of India, who
represent a very considerable minority in the State, responded admirably and
have firmly stood by the Government, refusing to be made pawns in the Pakistan
game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Pakistan leadership has sought further to reinforce
their claim to Kashmir by making it appear to international opinion that the
river system of Pakistan is in danger of being depleted of its waters by
hostile action, if an unfriendly power were to be in control of Kashmir,
because the main rivers flow from there into Pakistan. This has been definitely
shown to be a geographical impossibility. Further, Mr. David Lilienthal, the
ex-chairman of the Tennesse Valley Authority, the biggest river project of the
world, has, after a recent visit of inspection, pointed out that over eighty
per cent of the waters of the Indus System are going to waste into the sea, and
that by constituting an international authority to organise joint control and
utilization of the waters, both the countries of Pakistan and India could meet
their maximum needs, without the prosperity of one country involving the
sacrifice of the prosperity of the other. The truth of the matter is not heeded
by Pakistan. What they want is one more argument, plausible to uninformed
opinion, to claim Kashmir as integral to its prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
reaction of Pakistan opinion to the successful progress of the elections to the
Kashmir Constituent Assembly has shown a new turn. Now they propose to ignore
it, having already exhausted themselves in excitement and futile condemnation.
The latest phase of the anti-Indian propaganda has turned on an imaginary
oppression of Muslims in India. The Pakistan Press recently has flooded their
country with stories of mass conversion and oppression; some newspapers
indulged in red banner headlines of their latest mare’s nest of a monster or
master plan for the conquest of Pakistan. “Blind mouths, the eager sheep look
on and are not fed.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
makes one feel sad for the future of humanity when a whole nation can descend
to the levels of feeding upon falsehoods and distortion of facts to gain
self-interest. The pathetic faith that what has paid profits in the past will
continue to be profitable in future is to<i> </i>be deplored; for one day the
world will wake up to the truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second major event of this quarter has been the churning up of the Congress
organisation. The secession of prominent old-timers like Acharya Kripalani, P.
C. Ghosh and T. Prakasam, set Pandit Nehru thinking seriously of the rot that
had overtaken the Congress organization. In the middle of July a session of the
A.I.C.C. was held at Bangalore with the avowed object of forging unity and
achieving unity in the Congress ranks. The facile readiness with which Pandit Nehru’s
Unity Resolution was passed and his report of four years of Cogress rule was
accepted, and the outlines of the programme for the future was adopted, gave a
false sense of security and solidarity. Soon after, Pandit Nehru, with his
well-known power of introspection and objective analysis, discovered that the
rank and file of Congressmen so readily accorded support to his moves with
mental reservations of their own. He had been feeling restless and dissatisfied
with the state of affairs in the Congress ever since the Nasik Congress. His
analysis showed that a shaking up was necessary. After demanding an overhaul of
the Congress Working Committee as a token of an inner shaking, and after the
obstinate refusal by the Congress President to yield to the demand, Pandit
Nehru administered a deliberate and well-timed shock to the Congress
organisation by resigning from the Working Committee. This had the desired
effect. The Congress Executive <i>en</i> <i>bloc </i>resigned, and the
President, stickler for principles that he was, found himself obliged to
resign. Pandit Nehru now found that the only logical course for him was to
assume formal leadership in addition to the actual leadership that he has been
exercising for some years. Ever since the memorable meeting of the A.I.C.C. in
August which conferred the Congress Presidentship on him, Pandit Nehru has been
bravely going about his task of cleaning up the Augean stables and improving
the moral tone and idealism of purpose of the Congress. His constitution of the
Congress Executive, the election board, the advisory committee, has all been in
the right direction. He has issued certain directives to the Pradesh Committees
with regard to welcoming the recent dissidents and with regard to selection of
candidates for the forthcoming elections. Four years of Congress rule in the
Centre and the States has shown that, while the top rank of leaders have been
absolutely devoted servants of the people with undoubted ability of a high
calibre, there has been no evidence of any superfluity of men of ability and
integrity among the various Pradesh leaders. It is in this context that the
directive of the President, that men of ability should be invited to stand on
the Congress ticket, gains significance. There is not the least doubt that this
is going to prove to be the acid test of the success of Pandit Nehru’s
endeavours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
many States the Pradesh Committees are already busy with selection of
candidates for the new elections. It is possible to glean how far the
directives of the idealist President are being implemented. In the South one
leading Pradesh Executive has already declared that among the applicants for
the Congress ticket there are more than sufficient men of integrity and ability
to fill every seat. The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee has already prepared
its list of candidates. It will be clear from a perusal of these lists that the
directive of the President is more honoured in the breach than in the
observance. All the previous group of worthy Congressmen who have been entrenched
in seats of power and influence with their loyal band of followers, have again
found themselves safely allotted to seats for the forthcoming elections.
Communalists and selfseekers who had gained central positions in the election
committees and executive of the Pradesh Congress have planned out everything to
suit their purposes. If Pandit Nehru is to achieve his objective of putting
fresh blood into the ranks of Congressmen that will enter the legislatures, he
must take courage in both hands, call for the various lists of selected
candidates and mercilessly prune them, deleting all elements who do not fulfill
standards and replacing them with the required number of eligible public men
with a record of service and unselfish pursuit of the common good. Otherwise
the worthy executive heads of Pradesh Committees will neutralize effectively
all efforts at purification of the rank and file by the great leader of the
nation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

recent decision of Mr. Rafi Ahmed Kidwai to rejoin the Congress is a welcome
sign of the appreciation of Pandit Nehru’s efforts. This is expected to lead to
several other returns to the Congress fold in the near future. The session of
the Congress being held at Delhi will doubtless provide the right opportunity
to the President to drive home his point of view and convert many Congressmen
to the need for placing the country before self. The transition from being in
the Opposition to the custody of power found most Congressmen not ready for the
positive tasks of nation-building. While during the struggle for </span><span

N. E. F. A. or the North-East Frontier Agency is little more than a name to many
in India and abroad. Many more have never heard of it. A 35,000 square mile
area ‘in the shape of a horse-shoe, surrounding Assam proper and having an
international border more than 800 miles long with Tibet and Burma,’ the N. E.
F. A. is an unknown world, ‘of beauty, vigour and awakening’ with a somewhat
mysterious system of administration. Only a fringe–about 5,000 out of the
35,000 square miles of verdant hills, charming dales and dense forests of the
North-Eastern frontiers of India beyond Assam–had an administration in any
sense of the term during the British regime. The Government of the day
contented themselves ‘by occasionally marching columns of troops through the
foot-hills to flourish the Union Jack. They did not always pass without
encountering stiff resistance.’ The policy was in part the outcome of a desire
to leave the tribals alone and in part because of the difficulty of access. The
area was nevertheless nominally administered by the Governor of Assam on behalf
of the Viceroy and there was a semi-military police force–the Assam Rifles–to
maintain law and order if the ‘tribesmen got too out of hand and raided each
other or people in the plains.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sixty odd tribes–the main tribes are well over fifteen in number and the rest,
their sub-divisions–on India’s North-Eastern Frontier, each with its own deity
and own dialect thus lived a life of splendid isolation until two years after
Independence. They were thus denied the benefits of civilisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
decision of the Government of Free India to extend their rule to this strange
land was, therefore, a rather bold one. The tribals ‘had never before
experienced anything but the rule of the brute-force which inter-tribal wars in
all their horrors typified...’ To introduce a regular administration straightway
was out of the question. A start was, therefore, made with the rudiments
thereof. The N. E. F. A, was a department of the Government of Assam till 1950
when it was made a new administration under the External Affairs Ministry with
the Governor of Assam administering the territory on behalf of the Government
of India. Early in 1954, a senior I. C. S. official was appointed Adviser to
the Governor to help him in the administration of the N. E. F. A. Steps were
taken at the same time to strengthen file administration and to organise a new
all-India Service, which has since been formed under the name of the Indian
Frontier Administration Service (I. F. A. S.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

N. E. F. A. bounded by Tibet on the north, by Burma on the east and south and
by Bhutan on the west, actually comprises an area of 32,000 square miles in
round figures. It is divided into six administrative units–(i) the Kameng
Frontier Division, (ii) the Subansiri Frontier Division, (iii) the Lohit J

policy. Tuensang, the last of the administrative units noted above, was for
example, given a regular, administration as late as November, 1951. About 3,000
square miles in the region are still a no man’s land to all intents and
purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

N. E. F. A. is administered by the Union Government of India through the
Governor of Assam assisted and advised by an Adviser with experience of border
administration and tribal areas. The six Divisions of the Agency are each in
charge of a Political Officer with a military background. A number of
well-qualified and responsible officials help the Political Officer in various
nation-building departments, such as education, public health, agriculture,
engineering and the like. A small contingent of the Assam Rifles posted in each
Division functions as the police and guards the international frontiers along
Bhutan and Tibet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

population–between 8,00,000 and 10,00,000 according to the Report of the N. E.
F. A. Administration, 1953-54–is divided into a number of tribes. The tribals,
the sturdy children of the bills that shelter them are a simple and open-hearted,
but proud and sensitive folk. By and large they are good-humoured, though shy.
They are intelligent, quick to learn and by no means conservative or backward.
Agriculture, handicrafts and domestic work constitute the principal means of
livelihood. Sing</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ing, chatting, dancing and drinking of
home-brewn liquour are the principal varieties of recreation. The various
tribes are in different stages of evolution from the most primitive Tagin to
the more modern Noktey. If the former are totally unaware of anything but their
immediate surroundings, the latter, through generations of contact with the
people of the plains have changed their dress, their way of life and their
scale of values. Agriculture is the principal occupation of the tribes. All the
tribes, with the exception of the Apatanis, the Monpas and the Sherdukpens,
practise the ‘jhooming’ or the shifting method cultivation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dialects spoken by the tribes belong to the Tibeto-Burmese and the Tai groups
of the Indo-Chinese family of languages. None has a written script of its own.
The policy of the Government is therefore to introduce the Devanagari script in
the N. E. F. A. The dialects spoken are of a limited value. Locked away as the
people are in almost inaccessible hills, they have no words for objects like
ocean or horse. Nor can abstract thoughts be expressed through them. The
Government policy is to teach Hindi to the people when ‘the limit of the
language is reached.’ Government anthropologists are at present studying
closely the history, manners and customs etc., of the tribals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru’s directive issued after his tour over some parts of the Agency in 1952
and bears his personal imprint. Administrative reorganisation of the N. E. F.
A. followed his visit. A senior and tried I. C. S. was appointed to advise the
Governor of Assam on the N. E. F. A. affairs. New staff were recruited to work
under him. Attempts are being made to rectify previous mistakes. The new
policy, experts and observers agree, have already produced encouraging results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Government of India did little more than open new administrative outposts here

at any rate–over the tribal areas. Fourteen outposts were opened during this
period. Six of them are on the Indo-Tibetan and the Indo- Burmese borders. The
number of outposts rose from 8 in 1947 to 22 in 1952 and to 66 in 1953-54. The
present policy of the Government aims at the consolidation and development of

that the tribes should be preserved as specimens without being exposed to the
corroding influence of the changing world.’ The other favoured a process of
transformation and assimilation with the object of modernising the tribals. The
Government of India have rejected both. They have adopted instead a policy of
gradual change with an eye </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</i>forests, high mountains and swift-flowing streams make communications in
the N. E. F<i>. </i>A. extremely difficult. Many places in the Agency can be
reached only after marches of 15 or even 20 days from the nearest
administrative centres. The villages are sparsely populated. Communications in
the interior village are difficult and hazardous in the extreme, involving
treks over narrow ledges along steep hills and precipices sloping vertically
down to ranging torrents hundreds of feet below. The great earthquake of 1950
and subsequent floods wrought havoc and changed the courses of rivers and even
the physical features of the hills at places. Some villages were washed away.
Fields, which were once rich in paddy and other food crops became permanently
water-logged. Due to heavy landslides and cracks, some mountain paths, which
were the only links of communication among the tribal villages, had to be
abandoned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of communication raise an almost inseparable barrier between village and
village and between tribe and tribe. The tribals have in consequence lived for
generations in small, isolated groups. This isolation has created a feeling of
self-sufficiency and a tendency to live exclusively. Corporate or formal tribal
unity–let alone inter-tribal unity–did not exist anywhere in the N. E. F. A.
Basic unity rests mostly in the village even today. Such narrow loyalties,
needless to say, obstruct the implementation of development projects in the
Agency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

higher up by now. The Agency had in the same year 13 itinerary medical units

instruction in the 172 schools run by the Agency administration. A Teachers’
Training Institute at Margherita in Assam gives some preliminary training to
the newly-recruited teachers before they take up their work. Agriculture is one
of the compulsory subjects in the school curriculum. Students are taught
besides the three R’s some crafts, such as carpentry, cane and bamboo work,
soap-making, weaving, spinning, knitting and the like. Vernacular is the medium
of instruction in the lowest forms, where teachers with a knowledge of the
local vernacular are available. Hindi is a compulsory subject in the upper
forms. Social service is among the more important subjects of the school
curriculum. The young learners are encouraged by the award of stipends and a
free supply of slates, pencils, ration and clothing. A number of night schools
have been opened for those who cannot, for one reason or another, attend the
day schools. Eight cottage industries training centres in the Agency impart the
necessary training to the tribals in carpentry, blacksmithy, spinning, weaving,
tailoring, cane and bamboo work, leather work, soap making, stone-masonry,
pottery and bee-keeping. These centres can train in all about 250 tribals a
year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

agriculturists in the improved manurial and cultural practices. Great emphasis
is laid on the development of new land. Thousands of acres of land brought
under cultivation for the first time during the First Five Year Plan period
have added not a little to the N.E.F.A’s production of food crops. Five hundred
thousand rupees in round figures have been spent so far on land development,
subsidised conversion of shifting to terrace (permanent) cultivation and on the
supply of improved varieties of seeds, tools and implements. Useful information
on improved agricultural methods is disseminated by exhibitions and magic
lantern shows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tons of supplies all over the Agency. The shortage of a personnel in a very
real sense handicaps progress in the N. E. F. A. A doctor or a teacher’s life
in the N. E. F. A. ‘living alone among tribal people, cut off for months on end
from civilisation and relying in some cases on air dropping for food supplies,
is not every one’s cup of tea.’ Immediate steps must be taken to make a career
in the N. E. F. A. attractive to young Indians from the plains. A greater
publication of the tribals themselves in development activities and more
employment for them in the technical and non-technical fields of administration
are, however, the best solution of the personnel problem in the N. E. F. A.
Both, it may be noted, are among the chief objects of the Second Plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

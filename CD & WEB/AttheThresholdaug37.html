<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What damsel is this standing thus at the threshold of my heart? Why does she stand so silent without asking for the door to open?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her eyes are of the depth of the blue, her glance of the sharpness of the sword. And her look has the power to disclose the whole of my being in a flash.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waving curly locks has she; lovely is her dimpled chin. Her tresses are black as night. and creeper-like is her standing pose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rose-like are her cheeks, petal-like her lips. Ever smiling like the rose is she, and coy like its fragrance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With something concealed in her bosom, and in bashfulness, the simple one stands. Who is this charming one? What concern has she at the threshold of my heart?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That pretty one standing so timid and shy, and smothering her longing, is none but Love. Erewhile did she stand beside thy heart, and yet would she never say, ‘Open the door.’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the threshold thus will she stand for a hundred years and yet all the while be mute. If thou enquire her not who she be, heart-broken will she pine to death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cling to her garment, friend, and beseech her. Else, never will she offer that hidden gift to thee, even though the longing to tender it nip her heart.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If on the nuptial night, the lover doesn’t win her and snatch a kiss, will the beloved bestow it of her own accord–even though the longing to tender it nip her heart?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until thou tease it out of her, Love proffers not the gift: the gift that sheds a strange lustre on life and renovates it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The damsel who for ever stands at the threshold of the heart is none but Love. If the door is not opened, she prays not for it, but will only stand without and pine away!</P>

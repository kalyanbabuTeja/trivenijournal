style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
myth of Shakespeare’s impersonality is vanishing like a ghost at cock’s crow in
the light of researches of scholars like G. B. Harrison. The objectivity of
Shakespeare has been monstrously over-philosophised. Poets, as Bagehot remarks,
do not keep tame engines to write their poems. Even poems which are cast in the
mould of a convention indicate the hobnobbing of the power of the moment and
the power of the man. Interior impulse and external fashion kiss each other
into the red blossom of art. It is not enough to remark that Shakespeare could
dramatize his experiences more effectively than others. When we speak of the
experience of poets we commit the mistake of drawing a circumference of
experience beyond the reach of the ordinary man. An unkind word by a neighbour
may make a sensitive man cynical and a wife’s taunt may dynamite the peace of a
man’s life and rouse all the sexual disgust there is in Hamlet. To draw Macbeth
it is not necessary to invent for the poet some macabre experience. We are all
murderers: easy victims of temptation. In so far as life is climbing, one
treads on the corns or on the head of somebody else. Round the nucleus of
ordinary experience gathers a vast life of passions and prejudices which rocks
and heaves at the impact of an appropriate stimulus. Without this no poem is
written and even if written, it is a case of verbal agility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
a proper appreciation of the Falstaff plays we have to go to the experience in
the Sonnets. The Sonnets reveal the poet’s deep attachment to the Fair Youth of
a higher status. The friendship is the target of unsavoury comments. There is
the rift aggravated by the Dark Mistress and an uneasy reconcilement takes
place because of the initiative of the poet. This essay attempts to prove that
this experience has gone into the Falstaff plays. Falstaff is the older man
misguiding the Prince as the world believed. The king sees riot and dishonour
atain the brow of his son. The Prince only relaxes himself in the company of
sweet Jack Falstaff and, as easily as he would shed soiled garments assumed for
a purpose, drops his boozing companion. The young man and the poet of the
Sonnets are the Prince and Falstaff of the plays. It is the friendship between
a man of high status and one who wishes to make his fortune in London under the
patronage of his friend. The poet has no claim over the young man as Falstaff
has no claims over the Prince. The rejection of Falstaff pains us precisely
because Falstaff makes the reader believe that he has claims on the friendship
of the Prince. It is entirely out of his grace or breeziness that the Prince
hovers round Falstaff. He is ‘in it but not of it.’ Hence the poet in Sonnet,

the start we find in the plays tremors in the thick rotundity of Falstaff. He
requests the Prince that when he became king, the ‘gang’ of Falstaff should be
‘gentlemen of the shade’. That the company of the poet has goaded the blatant
beast against himself and the young man is evident from the Sonnets. So the
poet bitterly or resignedly asks the young man not to mourn for him lest his
friends taunt him for his irrational love towards the poet:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this personal experience is properly juxtaposed, the rejection of Falstaff does
not leave a bad taste and a right understanding of the Prince’s character is
possible. This emotional context is finely described by J. A. Fort. (<i>A Time
Scheme for Shakespeare’s Sonnets</i>, p. 51): “It is only the story of an older
man of inferior rank, who already foresaw (No. xlix) that his influence over a
younger man of higher rank must some day cease, trying to retain his influence
as long as possible, and to do so Shakespeare had always to send letters of
compliment or affection immediately after his letters of reproof, but the poet
handled his difficult pupil with exquisite skill and this old story of a very
strange friendship is, I think, a fascinating one apart from the lovely poetry
in which it is told.” Shakespeare is irritated by the Rival Poet and the
infection and impiety that surround his friend (Sonnet, 67). This jealousy is
easily paralleled in Falstaff’s letter: “Be not too familiar with Poins; for he
misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell.”
The mistress of the Sonnets is perhaps, Doll Tearsheet of Falstaff. One might
go to the extent of positing that every scene of Falstaff and the Prince can be
fitted into the Sonnets decorously even to the way of address like ‘my sweet
boy’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we brand the Prince a prig, let us understand him. Whenever we judge a
character we take into consideration what he says about himself and what others
say about him. The Prince refuses to be a satellite of Falstaff because
Falstaff is a ‘rogue’, a globe of sinful continents, and villainous company.
The story of Willobie His Avisa is a description of this experience. Like the
Prince the young man of the Sonnets refuses to be tied to the apron-strings of
Shakespeare: Like the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>poet of the
sonnets Falstaff pleads every time he meets the prince that he should not
reject him. When he plays the kin &amp; he says, “There is virtue in that
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish.” (And from his description of the
Prince having a foolish hanging of the nether lip it is possible perhaps to
identify the Fair Youth of the Sonnets). Fal</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>staff blames the Prince
in his absence but glozes over it in his presence. “I dispraised him before the
wicked, that the wicked might not fall in lov</span><span style='font-size:

says Falstaff when he was surprised by the Prince.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from this personal experience there is artistic propriety behind the rejection.
Falstaff pretends exra-breeziness masking his flesh-quakes to win the love of
the Prince. The fears of the old man are expressed so often that the actual
rejection should not be a surprise just as murder in a novel of Dostoevsky does
not surprise us because it has been so frequently mentioned from the start. In
his own field–the kingdom of humour–Falstaff ‘stays put’; his improvement is
‘from prayer to purse-taking’. Satire, according to Ronald Knox, is Humour
capped with criticism; Humour is sheer breeziness and without Satire is a waste
product. Raleigh’s definition of Humour better fits Satire; it is “thinking in
fun while feeling in earnest.” Falstaff does not evolve from Humour to Satire.
The artillery of Falstaff’s good humour detonates constantly–but with the
purpose of ‘whitemailing’ the Prince. “A god wit,” he says, “will make use of
anything. I will turn diseases into commodity.” How is it that we read the soliloquy
of the Prince and condemn him as a hypocrite and do not think of censuring the
fat knight when he soliloquizes, “If the young dace be a bait for the old pike,
I see no reason in the law of nature, but I may snap at him?” The Chief
Justice, for instance, is Falstaff-prof. “Sir John, Sir John, I am well </span><span

with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a

sauciness from you can thrust me from level consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
Falstaff is the spirit of freedom from all obligations, he would have been free
from the obligation of death (if that expression is allowable). He would have
slipped like an eel from the disaster of rejec</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tion. Falstaff
smells of the meat and drink of jokes. But we tire of Jokes. The paradoxes of
Wilde exhilarate us for some time and then leave us heart-whole. There is
always the appalling risk of Shavian coru</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>scations becoming
Shavian monkeyings (an impossible adjective as Shaw himself noted). Shaw may
say the real joke is I-am-in-earnest but the reader thinks earnestly that he is
a joke. Shaw could not clap the lid on his irrepressible comicality even at the
time of his mother’s funeral that Granville Barker remarked, “You certainly are
a merry soul, Shaw.” Tolstoy could not stomach the inappropriate brilliance of <i>Man
and Superman</i>. The severe rebuke administered by the Prince to Falstaff:
“Peace, chewet, peace” or “Reply not to me with a fool-born jest”–indicates
that he could not have made him his lifelong companion. The famous catechism on
Honour is not so much criticism as irresponsibility that flies at everything
like a haggard without jesses. There is no propriety in his jokes. “What, is it
a time to jest and dally now?” The tragedy of Shaw lies, writes Ronald Knox, in
the shouts of laughter that greeted his remark that a woman risks her life
every time she brings a child into the world in a greater measure than a
soldier on the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Falstaff
silences our criticism by his brilliant retorts. That is why Poins warns the
Prince: “My Lord, he will drive you out of your revenge, and turn all to a
merriment, if you take not the heat.” The fat knight flings an enormous cloak
of self-pity about him. Falstaff refuses to be cornered because there are no
corners about him; he not only lards the lean earth with wit but slithers down
his way greased with self-pity though he mints laughter out of self-pity too.
If Falstaff makes fun of his girth, his sack, his lechery, his lying, his fleecing
others, it is not because of a Shakespearian hatred of pedantry and love of the
unending diversity of God’s creation. It is only to amuse the Prince, to cash
his cheques on the goodwill of his friend and give his lechery an unending
lease. We love Falstaff because we do not love to be frowned upon by moralists.
He is like the clown who shakes his ears or stands on his head, amuses the
audience and gathers his pennies; his clowning now runs with the hares, now
hunts with the hounds. Self-pity seems to be the characteristic of some of the
tragic heroes of Shakespeare. In many of his plays there is the case of “Virtue
rudely strumpeted.” That is why in fierce derision of the moral pedantry, “of
the frailer spies on his sportive blood” the poet shouts at the pitch of his
voice, “I am that I am” (Sonnet, 121) which is easily neighboured by Falstaff’s
passion against villainous company. Uneasy is the reconcilement we find in the
sonnets. The poet forgives the lapse of his friend but it is forgiveness issuing
out of helplessness. One is forced to think that by way of rectifying this he
drew Prospero forgiving, when he could crush, his enemies like nuts between a
door and the door-post. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is common to talk of Falstaff as not only witty in himself but the cause that
wit is in others. But the statement has to be revised. Though the Prince is not
a match for Falstaff, he makes possible the inimitable Falstaff just as in the
Sonnets the young man is no match for the poet but he is the substance of the
poet’s songs. “But thou art all my art” (Sonnet, 78). The Prince is the

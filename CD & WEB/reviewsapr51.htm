style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
all the ancient ruling dynasties of the Andhra country, Eastern Chalukyas of
Vengi were the only one that ruled for a period of four hundred and odd years,
with the exception of the Eastern Gangas of Kalinga whose rule extended to a
period of nearly nine hundred years. With the conquest of Pulakesin II, the
coastal Andhra country, came under the sway of the Early Chalukyas of Badami or
Vatapi. Pulakesin’s brother, Vishnuvardhana I, ruler of the region around
Satara, who, as Yuvaraja, helped his brother considerably in the eastern campaign,
was put in charge of the conquered countries. He ultimately assumed
independence and became the founder of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty of Vengi.
The period of rule of this dynasty may be correctly described as one in which
the elements of life that went to weld the Andhra people into a nation were
consolidated and the characteristic traits of the Andhras were formed
permanentely. Hence, the Eastern Chalukya period is one of the most important
the periods of the Andhra history; yet a complete history of this dynasty has
not seen the light of the day till now, though some attempts at it were made
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
history has to be reconstructed mainly with the help of the copper-plate grants
issued by this dynasty which, till now discovered, come to as many as one
hundred, as it was the age of the copper plate records. The Stone records of
this dynasty are very few, but they furnish very important information which is
otherwise difficult to get. The other source in reconstructing this history is
that of coins, though those belonging to this dynasty so far discovered are few
and consequently of little help. Literature comes to the aid of the historian
in reconstruction almost at the fag end of this period, as the ‘Mahabharata’,
the very first book so far extant in Telugu, was written by Nannaya-bhatta, the
court-poet of Rajaraja I, practically the last or, to be more precise, the
penultimate ruler of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty, whose son Rajendra Choda
alias Kulottunga Choda. I was the first member of the Challlkya-Chola line to
rule Vengi, his paternal kingdom, and also the Chola country, which belonged to
his mother’s family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Dr. J. F. Fleet who first made a systematic study of this dynasty, taking
all the copper-plate grants till then discovered into consideration, formulated
a chronology of the Ea.stern Chalukyas according to which the year of the
foundation of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom in Vengi was 615 A. D. He also noted
the important events in each reign as gleaned from their records. The writer of
this review was the next to write in Telugu a regular history of this dynasty
and to publish it in the Telugu monthly, <i>Bharati, </i>but unfortunately it
was left incomplete with the close of the reign of Amma I. The history of the
Eastern Chalukyas published by Mr. Ganguli, first in the ‘Indian Historical
Quarterly” and then in the form of a book, cannot be reckoned as regular
history, as he merely recounted the contents of the grants of each reign and
made no attempt to reconstruct it in correlation with the history of the
neighbouring kingdoms, to identify the unidentified places and persons and even
to recognise the existing problems. The writer comes to know that Sri B. V.
Krishna Rao has also written this dynastic history but it has not yet been published.
Hence, the work under review happens to be the only authenticated, regular and
complete history of the Eastern Chalukyas published till now, and thus relieves
a long-felt want. It is a solid contribution to the historical literature about
the Telugu country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

three appendices on (1) the commencement of Kulottunga I’s rule in Vengi, (2) <i>Dramila-ahava
</i>or <i>Chaulikarana </i>and (3) the Penneru copper-plate grant of
Saktivarman I from the Elliot’s collection (so far unpublished) this work
contains 23 chapters, all dealing with political history with the exception of
the last chapter entitled ‘Administration’ which, besides the system of
Government obtaining during the rule of the Chalukyas, contains also some
information about the heterogeneous society, religion and literature, in the
last of which was included an account of the three great Kannada writers,
Ponna, Pampa and Nagavarma I who “were closely associated with Kammanadu”. The
first five chapters of this work deal with the sources, the Chalukyas–their
origin and caste, Early history of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chalukyas of Badami,
the history of the E. Chalukyas as described in their inscriptions, and lastly,
the Eastern Chalukyan chronology. The remaining 17 chapters, with the exception
of the sixteenth and seventeenth bearing on the Interregnum and Restoration
respectively, after the rule of Danarnava and prior to Saktivarman I, are
devoted to individual reigns. Thus the author of this work deals thoroughly
with the history of each reign and tries to solve the problems, if any,
connected with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
the records of this dynasty discovered till now are very many, the historical
information furnished by them is not proportionate to their length. Subsequent
to the rule of Gunaga Vijayaditya III, the Chalukyan records repeat the same
facts with a few additions here and there. Consequently, the history of this
dynasty bristles with many problems. Another important fact to be noted is the
absence of dates, either in Saka years or cyclic years, in the early records up
to the reign of Chalukya Bhima I whose coronation date. Saka 814, has been the
bedrock of the Eastern Chalukya chronology. Though the Chalukyan records
furnish the length of each reign from the beginning of their rule in Vengi, a
practice set up for the first time by Gunaga Vijayaditya III, the predecessor
of Chalukya Bhima I, and followed by his successors, and some astronomical
detail that admit of verification, the chronology of the kings of this dynasty
remains a tough problem at which the writer of this review and Mr. B. V.
Krishna Rao have worked before. Mr. Krishna Rao’s date 624 A. D., for the
foundation of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom which is unconvincing, has been
provisionally accepted till now. The author of this work takes his stand on the
Terala record of the fifth regnal year of the hitherto unidentified
Sarvalokasraya Vishnuvardhana whom he identifies with Vishnuvardhana II,
corresponding to the cyclic year Bahudhanya, and thus confirms the same 624 A.
D. But he writes: “It (624 A. D.) has been adopted here as a working
hypothesis; and the dates of the early rulers of the dynasty are calculated on
its basis.” But judged from the script employed there in the above record does
not seem to be so early as to assign is to Vishnuvardhana II. “Though several
of his (Rajaraja’s) inscriptions which are dated in Saka as well as his regnal
years <i>definitely </i>indicates that his reign commenced in 1019 A.D., his
coronation was not celebrated, as a matter of fact, until 1022 A.D., three
years later” (p. 218). This statement requires some modification. Inscriptions
of Rajaraja which furnish both the Saka dates and Regnal years are not many and
they do not <i>definitely </i>indicate that his reign commenced uin 1</span><span

Saka 969 respectively. These sets of dates clearly indicate that the above
statement is not absolutely </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The author is definitely of the opinion that
Vishnuvardhana Maharaja Vijayadityadeva, the governor of the province of
Nolambavadi, is the same as Sarvalokasraya Vishnuvardhana Vijayaditya,
half-brother of Rajaraja I Chalukya. This Vijayaditya’s identity has been a
baffling problem from the time of Dr. Fleet. Though the author of this work
discusses it at length and comes to the conclusion noted above, still, in the
opinion of this review, this problem cannot be said to have been finally settled.
This has still to be investigated. There is bound to be–some difference of
opinion among scholars regarding the reconstruction of the history of some of
the Eastern Chalukya campaigns attempted by the author with so much
thoroughness and diligence; for, inscriptions which recount the conquests of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>kings being the main source, there is scope
enough for divergence </span>of opinion in reconstructing the history of the
campaigns and in the fitting of facts in their proper set-up. The evidence of
inscription may be the same, but the fixing of events and incidents known from
them in the course of reconstruction may vary in accordance with the line of
thought one follows.</p>

many a question. One may not agree with him on all points; but no one can deny

Vengi. The author had left no problem untouched and deserves to be congratulated

profound than the military might or proselytising zeal of Russia. But the

classes have not been placed in such a favourable position and they have
necessarily to go down when the atmosphere is surcharged with cries like “Land
to the Tiller”, “Absenteeism must go”, which have become veritable war cries.
It would however be profitable even at this stage to discuss whether the ‘land
reforms’ which will be ushered in ere long have any juristic or ethical basis.
And this is best done by a careful appraisal of the land tenures ill this
country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Madras, which one may take as a typical specimen, excluding Malabar and
Mangalore, which are governed by a special tenancy law, there have been three
kinds of tenures, viz., the ryotwari, the inam and the zamindari. The sovereign
in ancient India (as also the State in modern times) theoretically owned the
land and all that lay beneath it, namely, mines, minerals and treasure trove.
The actual occupant who took it up for cultivation was in effect the full
owner, subject to the payment of a tax which was normally a sixth share of the
produce, and was collected by the tax officials. This is the origin of the
ryotwari system which is in vogue in respect of 27.6 million acres in Madras
State alone. The Hindu kings had also conferred gifts of land in favour of
temples and charities and also as remuneration for public and spiritual
services; the tax was nominal or remitted. This concession was later extended
to the village artisans such as carpenters, barbers, etc., as a sort of old age
or disability pension,–a system which even now has been adopted for the
demobilised personnel and the political sufferers. This is the inam tenure
which accounts for 6.8 million acres. The Muslim and British rulers were keen
only on the collection of revenue and, not being in a position to deal with the
occupants directly, employed the very tax officials of the Hindu kings as rent
collectors and in course of time looked to them not merely for the payment of
the taxes but, in certain tracts of the country, for police duties as well. Not
long afterwards, the zamindars, as these people came to be styled, owning about
12.8 million acres, successfully asserted proprietary rights over the land
itself, becoming gradually a sort of <i>imperium</i> <i>in </i></span><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
British Government dealt with these three classes distinctly and differently.
The inams were enfranchised, that is freed from liability for service and the
grantees were confirmed in their possession on payment of a nominal tax called
quit rent. In the ryotwari tracts, a comprehensive survey of the soil was
effected and taxation was fixed on that basis, which, roughly speaking, worked
out at half the net produce. In regard to the zamindars their <i>peishcush</i>
payable to the Government was standardised in 1802. What however were not
standardised were the innumerable taxes and exactions which were levied on the
tenants, leading to constant irritation and friction. Some of the worst abuses
of the system were however remedied by legislation in Madras in 1908, whereby
the Zamindari ryot was given or, to be more exact, got back permanent and
heritable rights of occupancy in his holding. But still more remained to be
done to place him on a footing of equality with the inam or the ryotwari ryot.
The cardinal fact however was that the Zamindar, unlike the ryotwari landholder
or the inamdar, was at no time the owner of the land and hence could not
justifiably demur to all or any of the ryots’ demands. But suddenly in 1933,
the Zamindari-cum-Justicite Ministry thrust, so to say, occupancy rights On the
cultivating tenant in inam villages, without any agitation in their behalf, but
solely, as a retired English High Court Judge wrote to the present writer, to
spite the inamdars who were mostly Brahmins. The Zamindar, however, was a mere
interloper between the State and the ryot and could not be assimilated to the
position of an inamdar or a ryotwari proprietor who had been from time
immemorial owner of the land. And it would be the height of injustice to tar
the latter with the same brush. It does by no means follow that the exit of the
Zamindar must <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> hasten the exit of the inamdar or the
ryotwari proprietor. The times however seem to be out of joint for a calm and
dispassionate examination of public questions; and while all of us are guided
by passion and emotion, few of us could summon enough courage to prick the
bubble of such tendentious slogans as “Tillers of the soil” and “Absentee
landlords.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ryotwari tracts belong mostly to the agricultural middle-class people who have
for several centuries been functioning as full owners. With the advent of the
British and the increasing opportunities for education and employment in urban
areas, the villages became depopulated and the former peasant-proprietors
sought and secured government jobs or flourished in trade and commerce. But in
almost every instance, they did not cut themselves off from their villages and
lands. Conversely also many people in the urban areas became proprietors by
purchase or as investors. The income from landed property has always been
negligible, especially for small landholders, and this was all too evident in
the ‘depression’ years; and it was rather because of the owner’s subsidiary
occupation that many holdings had not been wiped out. No doubt technically
these people can be termed ‘absentee landlords’ in the sense that they do not
reside in the vicinity of the property all through the year, but otherwise their
connection with their lands always been real and intimate. Let us examine a
typical ryotwari set-up. The landholder contributes the capital and owns the
land by inheritance or purchase. He pays the government revenue and meets all
the cultivation, expenses such as manures, seedlings etc., and effects all
necessary improvements at his cost. He takes a share of the produce which
normally would be about half the net produce. In lean years however he has to
write off the dues, if he cultivates it with the aid of an intermediary; but in
surplus years he does not take more than his dues. In recent times, however,
thanks to the Black-shirt-cum-Communist-cum-Kisan agitation, no landholder can
endeavour to collect more than what his lessee or ‘waramdar’ willingly gives.
Furthermore the rentals, that is to say, the lease amounts in ryotwari tracts
have remained stationary for 50 years now, as contrasted with the house rents
in urban areas which have been quadrupled in recent years. As regards duration,
the ryotwari lessee or ‘waramdar’ is, in the vast majority of cases, kept on
almost permanently and hereditarily but the tenant of house property is exposed
to summary eviction immediately following default in rent, for however long a
period of years he might be in occupation. But it so happens that only the
ryotwari landholder is styled as a ‘parasite’ and dealt with as such. It is
true that there have appeared in the Press statements by even responsible
persons about the ‘sufferings’ of the ‘tillers of the soil’, but they have been
mostly on the model of the Muslim League’s atrocity stories of the Congress
Governments in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the movement has not been without repercussions. The main reason for the
failure of the Grow More Food Campaign has been the growing militancy of the
tenantry and the consequent disinclination of the landholder to invest huge
sums for scientific planning and cultivation, which only those with other
avenues of income can possibly undertake. Even the Five Year Plan which rightly
devotes major attention to agriculture will not cut much ice if the ‘absentee
landlord’ is dismissed outright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is both tangible and intangible; that is to say, it comprises not merely
houses, lands, cash and jewellery but also rights in regard to trade marks,
copyrights, and business goodwill.” Generally speaking, a certain degree of
‘absenteeism’ is inherent in the enjoyment of property, except perhaps dwelling
houses, personal jewellery and cash. The owner of a trade mark or copyright in
England, for instance, need not have to be actually present in India to
safeguard his rights; and it would be absurd to require of the Directors of a
commercial concern that they should sit at the counter and participate in the
business. A shareholder drawing fat dividends out of shares purchased at a
nominal price in a business transacted overseas, is as much of an ‘absentee”
owner as a ryotwari mirasdar who settles down in a township for earning his
livelihood and educate his children. Yet, why should it be a normal feature in the
one case but a sin in the latter, entailing deprivation of property? A ‘Land
Reforms’ Committee which recently went into the question confessed that, “it
had no sympathy with the big landlord who is content to receive a cash rent
from lessees whom he may not have seen for years.” One hopes that this type of
pernicious reasoning would not be applied to other kinds of property. For
example, there are debenture-holders of public corporations and companies who
are necessarily to be in the dark about the minutiae of the business transacted
by them and have no voice in the internal management. Would that disentitle
them to receive their income or assign their rights? Should every shareholder
of a mill actually know and work with the labourers on pain of being ousted
from ownership?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
argument that the “tiller of the soil” must be conferred ownership leads one to
fantastic conclusions, if only it be carried to its logical limits. Is the
State prepared to extend the concept to every other variety or form of ownership?
Let us for example take the case of a film which makes a big box-office hit
solely on the strength of its story and songs, bringing in several lakhs to its
producer. Would any producer be compelled to share his profits with the writer
and the composer upon whose ability alone the film becomes popular, but who
might have been dismissed with a few hundreds after all? Sir George Schuster
spoke recently in Madras of a “danger to society”, which was nothing more than
the demands of labour for profit-sharing. The idea of the tiller of the soil
becoming owner is equally ‘dangerous’ but how few of us realise its full
import! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not However suggested that agricultural labour should not be protected and
insured against destitution and old age; but that should be the primal concern
of the State acting in collaboration with the landholder. Agricultural labour
must be tackled as any other type of labour, and uniform privileges should be
accorded to every variety. The lot of the tiller of the soil is bad enough in
all conscience, if not desperate. Perhaps the only consolation is that it is
not worse than that of a mill worker or of a miner who has no heritable or
transferable right in his assignments but works harder–and in the case of a
miner, at the risk of being outright by rock blasts; or indeed, for the matter
of that, he is not worse off than a labourer in the tea and coffee estates. So
far as agricultural labour is concerned, the two enemies, debt and drink, have
been liquidated; but more remains to be done. The pressure on land must be
reduced and, as Gandhiji had envisaged, supplementary occupations must be
devised on the model of the Swiss farmer’s. Scientific farming and
mechanisation of agriculture must be taken on hand, and the number of persons
who live solely by agricultural labour must be reduced to the minimum.
Conferment of proprietary rights is a leap in the dark and the anomalies it
might bring about are too numerous to be mentioned. To take a common instance,
several cultivating tenants take up lands collectively, and, if they own the
entire holding, the resulting effect would be something very curious. Thus if A
cultivates 5 acres of B, 5 acres of C, and 5 of D, he may obtain 15 acres,
leaving A, Band C indigent and in the streets. Another method which is
suggested is to fix a ceiling on holdings, which in the ultimate analysis may
operate as discrimination, when it is not applied to other kinds of property
such as houses and shares. There are, however, innumerable ways by which a
tiller of the soil can become owner by dint of his own effort and diligence.
The recent Tanjore Tenants Act confers very substantial benefits on the
cultivating tenants, which, used efficiently and skilfully by thrift and good
husbandry, may enable them to buy up their landlords themselves without resort
to expropriation without compensation. In other words, let the tiller of the
soil rise by his own worth and work; let him not rise on the ashes of the small
landowner or peasant-proprietor. Above all let our rulers walk in the path of
righteousness and Justice, not minding the allurements of China or Russia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

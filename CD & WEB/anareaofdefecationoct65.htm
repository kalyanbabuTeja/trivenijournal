the centuries of recorded history, India had exercised a strange fascination
for the traveller from every part of the civilised world. The motley crowd, of
this description, might make a formidable list of names from Fahien and Huen
Tsiang, Nikitin and Travernier, Marco Polo and Nicolo Comti, to Katherine Mayo
and Beverley Nichols, and now Ronald Segal and V. S. Naipaul. Rather like the
message of Hinduism, the image of India could mean anything to any man, largely
depending on his delicacy of perception, keenness of observation, depth of
understanding and range of knowledge, not to speak of his quality of breeding,
level of culture and refinement of taste. For some, it was a land of peace and
tranquility, the El Dorado of the ceaseless seeker after Truth. For others, in
the remote past, it used to be a land flowing with milk and honey and abounding
in good hearts and great minds. In the less remote past, under the fevered imagination
of the Western romancer of either sex, it had come to be the land of Maharajas
and tigers, the cobras and the rope trick. The picture of a land of idolatry
and untouchability, of purdah and polygamy, of epidemics and early deaths,
painted by the self-styled evangelist and the intrepid do-gooder, has not been
unfamiliar to us. For some others, it is a babel of tongues and a vast
menagerie of tribes and castes. Some are amazed and astounded, some others are
intrigued and amused, yet others are vexed and irritated. Miss Mayo was
outraged and Beverley Nichols was tickled. To Ronald Segal (the Jewish emigrant
from South Africa?), India is a picture of perpetual crisis. To V. S. Naipaul
(the Indian expatriate fro Trinidad) it is “an Area of Darkness”.* It has
proved to be largest ‘blind<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>spot’, as
that of greater men before him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

little to learn from the primitive backwaters of India. In search of
pleasure?–He could get the best of it from Honolulu and Nassau, Monte Carlo and

fine piece of vivid writing indeed, from a writer who has a ‘nose’ for news, an
admirable sensitivity to the sights and sounds and smells of the East! Naipaul
could be almost as graphic as James Joyce in his descriptive passages (worthy
of a latter-day ‘Ulysses’) and no less emetic. But the more juicy pieces are,
of course, yet to come. Meanwhile, soon after descending from the dizzy heights
of civilisation represented by London and touching the lowly and lost land of
India, he is panic-stricken at the grave prospect of losing his personal
identity (so well nourished and fondly cherished) amidst the nameless, faceless
crowds of Bombay. He must be a heartless reader who will not shed his tears at
this experience, so full of pathos and poignancy: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

for the first time in my life I was one of the crowd. There was nothing in my
appearance or dress to distinguish me from the crowd eternally hurrying into
Churchgate Station. In Trinidad to be an Indian was to be distinctive. To be
anything there was distinctive: difference was each man’s attribute. To be an
Indian in England was distinctive; in Egypt it was more so. Now in Bombay, I
entered a shop or a restaurant and awaited a special quality of response. And
there was nothing. It was like being denied part of my reality. Again and
again, I was caught. I was faceless. I might sink without a trace into the
Indian crowd. I had been made by Trinidad and England; recognition of my
difference was necessary to me. I felt the need to impose myself; and didn’t
know how.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What a pity! No red carpet and tinkling bells or
sounding brass for this rare guest. But Mr. Naipaul is being too modest, when
he seems to admit defeat in declaring to be at his wit’s end. As a matter of
fact, for this unpardonable omission on India’s part, represented by the lesser
breeds without the law, he is to wreak his vengeance by looking down on India
and her 450 millions, the whole lot of them where he is not able to rap them on
the knuckles. Like a modern Voltaire, with a keener sense of comedy, he laughs
at everyone he comes across-man, woman and child–wherever he may have gone. The
Indian sense of duty (based on a conception that goes back to the ‘Gita’) is
ridiculous:</p>

and everyone Indian (with the possible exception of<i> </i>the friend in Delhi
who had presented him with a jacket-length of Indian cloth as a parting gift)
cause no end of amusement to the urbane and sophisticated Mr. Naipual, whose
sense of the ludicrous must be the envy of the authors of ‘The Pickwick
Papers,’ ‘The Human Comedy’ and ‘Don Quixote’. He is amused at his New Delhi
hostess Mrs. Mahindra (whose paying guest he was</span><span style='font-size:

craze for foreign….I want him (her eldest son) to marry foreign.” Her frantic
and farcical struggle with a foreign medium (at which he is obviously expert,
as to the manner born) tickles him not a little. He seems to forget, however,
that were she not so ‘craze for foreign,’ she would not have cared to bestow on
him all the officious attention, due to the brown sahib from London, but left
him high and dry in the face-less predicament that he found himself in at the
egalitarian, impersonal Bombay shops and restaurants! Not exactly the
consummation devoutly to be wished for by one who would expect a ‘special’
response and treatment. To India, he himself has no response, only reactions.
He is amused by the England-returned Sikh who goes out of his way to be
hospitable to him as well as by the’ South Indians’ in Madras who would prefer
to see him in his hotel room and not invite him to their own homes, by Mr.
Malhotra, who must nees remain single on Rs. 600 a month as by the Engineer
Sardarji (Rs. 1,300 a month) who can hardly get a nice girl to take out, by Mr.
Butt the hotel proprietor as by Aziz (the cook, or is it the waiter?) in
Srinagar, by the American girl (research scholar) as by her Muslim lover (Sitar
player), by the I. A. S. Officer (who helps him in many ways) in Lucknow as by<i>

cousins at his ancestral village, who receive him in tears and lionise him to
the confusion and embarrassment of a superior being, a Londoner to his finger
tips, with all the envied refinements of a cockney culture about him. During the
whole Indian sojourn, Mr. Naipaul had successfully avoided the risk of running
into any normal, sensible, cultured Indians–writers and others from the
intelligentia. For, the novelist and comedian that he had made a virtue of
stumbling upon clowns, morons, nitwits and other figures of fun.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

favoured niche for the ‘South Indians’ (not clear which particular linguistic
group he has in mind, but that is a small matter, for Mr. Naipaul makes no such
narrow, parochial divisions in the exercise of his comic spirit). Let us now
gaze at the author’s picturesque reconstruction of what would be quite an
ordinary scene (to us, without the gift of the Anglicised poet’s eye) in the
dining car of a railway train: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the dining car I sat with my back to the entrance. South Indian languages,
excessively vowelled, rattled about me. The South Indians were beginning to
unwind; they were lapping up their liquidised foods. Food was a pleasure to
their hands. Chewing, sighing with pleasure, they squelched curds and rice
between their fingers. They squelched and squelched; in one swift circular
action, as though they wished to take their food by surprise, they gathered
some of the mixture into a ball, brought their dripping palms close to their
mouths and–flick–rice and curds were shot inside; and the squelching,
chattering and sighing began again.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘defecation’, a word which seems to be his special favourite. (One can imagine
him rolling it over his tongue gingerly, in his impeccable Oxford accent.) It
enlivens his felicity of expression to the bright glow of Churchillian eloquence.

‘Paradise Lost’, and ‘Paradise Regained’, for his deliberate blindness (in
addition to his physical blindness) to the daily acts of ‘defecation’,
committed by Satan as well as the son of God, whose hunger and thirst are well
described in his classics. He might also, with equal justification, join issue
with Shakespeare for making the Prince of Denmark indulge in too many
soliloqueis in ‘Hamlet’, and hardly any solitary exercises in defecation (which
no human being could avoid for long), and showing King Claudius and Queen
Gertrude in constant intrigue but never in ‘companionable defecation’ (like
Naipaul’s giggling women near the Dal Lake or the rows of men on the river bank
in Goa). And the <i>Ramayana </i>would not be satisfactory enough as a work of
art for this author, mainly because Rama, Sita and Lakshmana have not gone on
record in Valmiki as having used the shelter of the Dandakaranya or the waters
of the Sarayu river for the eminently Indian purpose of the author’s extra-realistic
conception. If this criticism be any guide we need no enlightenment on what

be the Inspector-General of Indian Lavatories. Not that the author’s
observations on the subject were factually incorrect in any material detail.
Far from that being the case, he was deadly accurate, with an exasperating
literal-mindedness, on what he had seen in Madras, Bombay or Delhi. The question,
however, remains of what he had omitted to see or refused to see, wherever he
chose to go in resurgent India–not only the temples, mausoleums and monuments
(Ajanta and Ellora caves, the Taj Mahal and the Tanjore Temple and the like),
but a whole nation, risen from the stupor of ages, engaged in the adventure of
discovery and participating in the collective endeavour of economic planning
and material construction. Surely, no one can be so blind as he who has eyes,

is difficult to imagine how seasoned English critics (like V. S. Pritchett,
John Wain, among others) could go into raptures (‘brilliant,’ ‘lyrical’,
‘masterly’ and so on, proceeds the familiar litany) about this juvenile
perpetration, so full of rash and facile generalisations, resting on the
tenuous thread of isolated experience, private affront and personal irritation.
A high degree of frivolity, centering round inconsequential (and irrelevant)
personal detail, even in what is meant to be a serious discussion and balanced
appraisal, is obviously a sure symptom of the occupational disease of western
authors on their Indian jaunts–an earnest student of the world like Arthur
Koestler not excepting. Readers of ‘the Lotus and the Robot’ would recall how
Koestler’s provocative observations on the teachings of Hinduism and the ethics
of Vedanta are liberally interspersed with descriptions of the mystic enigmatic
smile of the Sankaracharya of Kanchi (as if the author were dealing with the
presence of a Mona Lisa) and the nose-picking habit of a leading disciple (who
had incidentally been instrumental in arranging the visitor’s interview), not
to mention less readable incidents. Not long ago, it was given to the
Indian-born poet Dom Moraes on a visit back home, to write at length of the illicit
stills of Bombay and the redlight district of Calcutta in quest of his India.
His friend and frequent companion Ved Mehta (who happens to be blind) has a
keen eye for equally spicy things in ‘Walking the Indian streets.’ All this
falls neatly into the new pattern of Realism–bold, brusque, brazen and
uninhibited. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seeing it would not require the expert labours of a Naipaul come to judgment

I awake or dreaming, Babli asked herself. The huge crowd, the blazing lights,
the speeches in her honour, the cheers, the flowers–was all this real or only a
dream? For a moment Babli could not believe her eyes. This was a. dream to be
sure....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been in a sort of dream for many days. The very first picture in which she
had played the title role had become a thumping box-office success. An obscure
twenty-year old girl that she had been before, she had become a dazzling ‘star’
and the darling of the crowds overnight. Her fan mail had mounted up into huge
piles. Her picture broke all records, wherever it was shown. In this Bombay
theatre it had reached the Silver Jubilee week...Babli could not bring herself
to believe that all this was really happening...And now tonight she had been
invited to put in a personal appearance at the last show. She sat in a chair on
the stage surrounded by several important people, and listened to the sweet
eulogies showered on her by speaker after speaker...Somebody garlanded her. She
heard a roar of applause. This was the climax of her dream, and the next
instant the dream would end, she thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dream ended. But another–a dream in which she was awake–took its place...She
came down the stage and walked towards her Box, with the producer-director of
her picture on one side, and Rangnath, the financier on the other, hanging on
her words, murmuring congratulations, holding her hand, and a large crowd of
people following her. She stepped into her Box and sat on the sofa in between
the director and Rangnath. The loud buzz of a bell was heard. The noise of the
crowd subsided. Lights went out. Darkness and silence filled the theatre. The
big white frame of the screen was caught in the projector’s light. The show
started again. Babli saw herself on the screen–exquisitely made up and lavishly
draped. She stood against the tree, covered with flowering vines, on the bank
of a river. The air was filled with the music of birds and the ripples of the
river’s water. Resting her head on the tree she broke into a song. The tune
went straight to the hearts of the crowd. A thousand hands began to clap and
mark the beat of time...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Babli,
watching this from her seat in the Box, felt a shiver running through her
limbs. She was certainly dreaming, she thought....And even before the shiver of
her body had faded, the song ended. The lovely maiden in the picture picked up
the pitcher which lay at her feet. She went down to the river and plunged it
into the water...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Babli’s
mind went back over many days. She remembered an incident in her actual life
which had been exactly like this!...But that had happened years ago!...How
many? Three!...Just like the girl in the picture, she was one day plunging a
pitcher into the river. The only difference was that she was not singing for
joy but was holding back the tide of grief and despair in her heart. Her tears
mingled with the river’s water. She was tired of life. She could no longer live
honourably. People would call her a senseless girl seduced and disgraced by the
son of a money-lender. Her father would drive her out of his house. Even if he
did not, drudgery and abuse and even occasional beating would be her lot. What
was the use of living after all this? Why not take a plunge into the river and
end everything? She looked about. There was no one in sight. She put away the
pitcher, and tightened her clothes. “Forgive me, O God!” she said. The next
moment she would have dived into water...But she heard a voice. “Babli!” She
turned and looked. Pandit was running down towards her...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the money-lender’s son, was well-known in the village as a rogue and a scamp.
He had seduced several innocent girls. And yet Babli had fallen in love with
him. It was not a matter for surprise that Rangnath was drawn towards a young
and pretty girl like her. But people wondered how Babli thought of running
after him. “I’ll break your bones, you fool, if you keep company with that
scoundrel Rangnath,” her father had told her. Many other elders in the village
too had given her a warning. But she was struck with young love which never
listens to wise counsel. She wanted Rangnath. A desperate passion had seized
her. Rangnath could not give her any money. His miser-father kept a tight hold
on all property, and cash. But Rangnath knew how to spread a net of sweet words
and promises. She believed in him, and began to meet him secretly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bhosle loved Babli and wanted to marry her. But Babli did not want to be the
wife of an ordinary man like a petty army officer’s son. What sort of a life
can Pandit offer me, she thought. Can he give me rich and costly clothes, or
ornaments or rides in cars? Serving as a soldier he will go from place to
place, get wounded and die in some battle, and leave me to bring up
half-a-dozen children on the petty pension which Government will give his
widow. That will be my lot if I married Pandit. Rangnath, on the contrary, will
fill my gay life with luxuries and pleasures. His old father will die some day,
and then Rangnath will inherit a big fortune. I shall be the happy wife of a
rich man...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

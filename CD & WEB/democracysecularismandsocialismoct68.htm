style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Take
for instance the system of education that the British established here. Though
it was designed to create a cheap Indian agency to staff the lower rungs of the
administration, it made familiar to the educated Indians the history of the
people’s struggle for freedom and democratic rights waged in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>, Europe and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They unified the country
as it was done only at rare intervals of our history. It will be said that all
that was done in other countries under imperial rule. It is my opinion that
other imperial countries did not do as <span class=GramE>much</span> as the
British did for the indigenous population. Another factor was that, in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, people
who took advantage of this education were the higher castes who had
centuries-old traditions of learning in their families. They therefore, <span

effectively than the people elsewhere under imperial yoke. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

also established the rule of law which broke down only in the case of political
opponents, violent or non-violent. The higher courts that they set up were by
and large impartial, and some of them even in political trials. The British law
that was introduced in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was in accordance with the principles of jurisprudence. They also introduced
some </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

the Provinces and in the Centre. Though these legislators could not throw out
the Government, yet they were free to speak out what they and the people felt,
and <span class=SpellE>criticise</span> the actions of the Government. This
gave some kind of training to educated Indians in running democratic
institutions.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

are, in brief, some of the advantages with which we began our independence.

on the initiative of one liberal British administrator was <span class=SpellE>organised</span>
the Indian National Congress. It was a non-sectarian and non-communal body. It
voiced the grievances of the people and devoted attention towards removing the
poverty of the masses due to foreign domination and exploitation. The result
was that our national struggle for independence began much earlier and with a
leadership that was well-established and which knew the problems of the country
and was in touch with the common people. Not to talk of Gandhiji’s unique
leadership which may come once in centuries, even the second and third rank
leaders were superior to those in other colonial countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Today
the Congress leadership talks of democracy, socialism and secularism. But all
these were present more or less from the very inception of the Congress. After
Gandhiji’s leadership, they were stated in terms which those who run may read.
If free <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> were not to be
a democracy, from where could they find a King or an </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Emperor
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>?
In our country, princes were mere tools in the hands of the foreign Government.
They were not free agents even </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

make any of the hereditary <span class=SpellE>princelings</span> the ruler of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>? There
was no possibility of a dictator being appointed by a popular body like the
Congress with almost universal franchise. Moreover, dictators are not appointed
or elected. They impose themselves on the people when democracy fails or when
the country is in utter chaos. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far as socialism is concerned, though the Congress did not use the term for
very good and valid reasons, it always stood for the poor and the underdog. The
burden of our leaders’ exhortations to the people was that <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> had been bled white by the foreign rule
and that justice must be done to the poverty-stricken masses of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Karachi Resolution on economic progress had the
concept of social justice as its base. Gandhiji’s emphasis was always upon
ameliorating the conditions of the suffering masses of the country. He said he
could not carry spirituality to them unless it was in the form of a ‘bowl of
rice’. At the Second Round Table Conference, he said that the only
justification for the existence of the Congress was the service of the poor and
that, in free <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE>,</span>
all such Interests whether indigenous or foreign, must subside before the
interest of the masses. Democratic socialism is inherent in these ideas. If the
word ‘socialism’ was not used it was because, after Marx, it has been
associated with violent revolution and class-war dictatorship, ideas which were
abhorrent to the Congress from its very inception. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for secularism, that too was inherent in the Congress ideology from the very
beginning. It had members from all communities, the Muslim, the Christians, the
<span class=SpellE>Parsis</span>, the Sikhs, the Jews and the Hindus. After
Gandhiji’s advent in Indian politics, this aspect of the Congress policy was
much more pronounced. He made every effort to migrate the opposition of the
generality of the educated Muslims towards the Congress. His efforts and those
of <span class=SpellE>Rajenbabu</span>, Jawaharlal and <span class=SpellE>Maulana</span>
were all directed towards this end. Unfortunately both for <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, these efforts did not
succeed. But it is a fact that after the martyrdom of Gandhiji, if not a little
before it, the Muslims had come to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> in him
their true friend. In his prayer meetings were chanted the prayers of every
major religion with a special emphasis upon the One Universal God. Even today,
in thousands of Hindu houses one would hear the chanting of ‘<span
class=SpellE>Ishwara</span> Allah <span class=SpellE>Tere</span> <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nam</st1:place></st1:country-region>’, and of
“Ram <span class=SpellE>Rahim</span> and Krishna Kareem” being the same.
Gandhiji had in his Ashram inmates belonging to various religions <span
class=GramE>whom</span> he never advised to adopt Hinduism. Rather, when <span
class=SpellE>Mirabehn</span> misled, once desired to embrace Hinduism, she was
told by Gandhiji that there was no need for such conversion if she remained a
good Christian; that was enough for her salvation. His old companion from the
Phoenix Settlement in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Imam Abdul <span class=SpellE>Kadar</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bawazir</span>, lived with his family in the <span
class=SpellE>Sabarmati</span> Ashram performing his “<span class=SpellE>Namaz</span>”
five times a day and also attending the prayer meetings. Another Muslim inmate
of the Ashram, <span class=SpellE>Amtulbehn</span>, did the same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
Gandhiji’s secularism was not due to any indifference to spiritual values which
he considered to be common to all the important religions of the world. As a
matter of fact, his conception of spirituality was that whoever followed the
Moral Law was religious, whether he believed in God or did not believe in His
existence and was an atheist. He considered the Moral Law as God. He said the
law and the law-maker are one. He also reversed the saying that ‘God is Truth’
into ‘Truth is God.’ Before <st1:City w:st="on">Independence</st1:City>, these
ideas were accepted not only by Congressmen and Congress leaders but, generally
by the whole of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
One, therefore, fails to understand the present-day boast of Congressmen when
they say that they stand by democracy, socialism and secularism as if these
ideas were introduced by them after independence. Actually they are as old as
the Congress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further,
it is useless to compare <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
with other colonial countries in Asia and <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>.
They had neither the institution that we had nor had they the leadership that
was granted to us. If then the country finds itself in its present depressing
plight, it is not due to the fact that these basic ideas were not accepted by
the nation but because those in whom Providence has placed the destiny of the
country did not know how to work them out effectively, after they were
entrusted with the high and noble task of leading India on the path of
progress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

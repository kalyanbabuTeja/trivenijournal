on Rajaji: a unique conjunction. The subject is one of the great Lights of 20th
century Indian history. Lawyer and patriot, freedom-fighter and Satyagrahi,
Gandhiji’s ‘keeper of conscience’, hot-gospeller of prohibition, twice Chief
Minister of Madras, first Governor-General of Free India, elder statesman,
spokesman for human survival, classicist in letters, humanist and <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>moralist and man of God: the ‘elements’ were
so mixed in him and made so complete a marvel of a man and a leader of mankind
that we are not likely to meet his equal again. As for the author, now
fourscore years and more, Masti is a revered Fellow of the Sahitya Akademi and
the President of the PEN All India Centre, the doyen of men of letters in the
country, and a man of the richest and most variegated achievement in Kannada
and English as novelist and short-story writer, as poet and dramatist, and as critic,
essayist and evangelist of our culture. Masti on Rajaji cannot but be a unique

properly speaking, a comprehensive or orthodox biographical exercise. <span
class=GramE>It is, confessedly, more of his study of his personality”, at once
a simpler and a more difficult undertaking.</span> The first volume almost
stands by itself, for it efficiently covers Rajaji’s life in the course of six
brisk chapters, followed by the 50-page concluding chapter on ‘The Rajaji
Evangel’ bringing together his <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>views</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>on politics, religion, planning,
socialism, welfare state, official language, social reform, nuclear
proliferation and the need to halt it. Perhaps the chapter “The Last Phase” in
the second volume should be read immediately after the sixth chapter of the first
volume so as to have the complete story of his life at a stretch. Nothing
important relating to Rajaji’s political period, or his memorable spells of
office at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
or at the Centre, or yet the decade of fearless service as critic of the
Government’s. “<span class=GramE>statist</span>” policies or as the Tribune of
the people–nothing of real significance is missing in the recital of events. It
is a quick review, but the picture that emerges is by no means blurred; on the
contrary, the main lines stand out bold and clear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The second volume
follows a different strategy. The Rajaji-Rama Rao friendship, illustrated by
their correspondence, gets a whole chapter, and here we have unexpectedly
refreshing insights into Rajaji’s tremblingly human sensibility, his infinite
capacity for love and understanding, and his singular genius for friendship.
Likewise, another chapter lifts the veil over the Rajaji-Masti friendship
spread over thirty years, beginning really with Rajaji’s happy collision with
Masti’s great short-story, ‘Masumatti’ as rendered into English by Rama Rao. <span
class=GramE>When Rajaji translated it from English into Tamil (as ‘Venuganam’),
the Rajaji-Rama Rao duumvirate in letters expanded into a Masti-Rama Rao-Rajaji
triumvirate with creepers of influence fanning out in several directions.</span>

follow chapters that illuminate Rajaji’s associations with his relatives and
with his political colleagues, and his services to Tamil and English letters.
The two chapters, ‘The Rajaji Image’ and ‘Characteristics’, which together
account for about 80 pages, form a pocket cyclopaedia on the numerous facets of
Rajaji’s personality and achievement, excepting that the entries here are not
arranged alphabetically. But each entry arrests and holds the reader’s
attention, and the divers traits are sometimes illustrated with citations from
his or others’ writings. Rajaji’s sense of humour, his tact in dealing with
public meetings, his skill in debate, his inconsistencies, his practical
religion, his courtesy, his interest in music and sports, his many exemplary
roles on the theatre of life, his preference for the simple life, his high
sense of duty, his tolerance, his unfailing charm of manners, his beautiful
calligraphy, his wide reading, his Gandhian ministry, his luminous thinking,
his deep wisdom, his innate godliness–these and a score of other facets of his
power and personality receive attention in these pages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
thus assembled adequate evidence, Masti concludes that Rajaji was “a great
worker and leader, a fighter and administrator and parliamentarian, a great
thinker and teacher, a great idealist.” <span class=GramE>In the consciousness
that he had done his best and never spared himself, never tampered with weights
and measures, never knowingly sinned against the Light–in that consciousness
Rajaji said towards the very end of his immaculate and inspiring life: “I am
happy.”</span> What was Rajaji’s final measure except that of a Rishi, a modern
Rishi? Although rather unconventional as a biography, Masti’s two volumes give
us an endearing and convincing portrait of Rishi Rajaji. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a chronicle of the main events in the history of the Indian National
Congress, which had its birth in the year 1885. There have been books written
of the important part played by the Indian National Congress by Dr Annie Besant
and Dr Pattabhi Sitaramayya, both of which have earned the gratitude of the
public as good representations of the great political work of the Congress till
the period of the lives of the authors. This volume takes it further to our own
times, namely that of Smt. Indira Gandhi. No doubt it is a praiseworthy attempt
to narrate the entire long history of the Congress without omitting any of the
significant changes that had happened in its evolution from a body of mere
memorializers to a foreign Government, to the actual legitimate holders of
ruling powers over a vast country, known as Bharat. Still, one has to reckon
with the need to present a tale which should be considered a fair, just and
authentic account. The author, here, has tried his best to mention in a short
canvas of nearly 223 pages what he felt as the selective events and important
documents worth knowing to a student of our freedom fight. Tracing the history
from its origins in 1885, the early period of its activities when there were
only resolutions passed with sufficient details of the country’s crying need
for a representative form of government on the model of the British Parliament,
the slow but steady transformation into a huge organisation with direct action
for liberation from the foreign yoke, under the lead of the Mahatma, naturally
becomes one of fascinating reading. The author has done well to make the
readers realise how from the first one running thread, namely the eradication
of poverty, has been one of the main items of the programme of many leaders,
consequent upon the resolutions passed in the annual sessions of the meetings
of the National Congress. We are even today on the same question of how to meet
the challenge of the distressing poverty of our millions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

through this book, anybody will be most likely struck by Sardar’s

difficult situation which confronted the formation of the Indian Union. The
story of his remarkable achievement in bringing round most of the Indian States
into the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place> gets evidenced in many of the
speeches and statements included here. The Junagadh problem, the Hyderabad
incident and the many other historical events proving the matchless ability of
the Sardar in his one-pointed drive towards the formation of a strong Indian
Union–complete in itself for administrative purposes–raised his stature in the
eyes of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

appraising of a situation appearing too difficult for others to tackle boldly,
in his hands, shaped without much of energy wasted. Everything done to overcome
resistance seems to have been normal with him. His words of challenge to the
United Nations Organisation or to Mr. Winston Churchill in dealing with the
Kashmir and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>
debacles respectively, breathe of his determination against odds to accomplish
what he set himself to bring about. Further, his utterances show how there is
no veiled thrusts or trickery of language in his armour. If he strikes, he does
it with his-wonted consciousness of a righteous undertaking of a thing in
earnest. If he followed the Mahatma; he did so as would a soldier his Supreme
Command. His beaming intelligence, his sense of the immensity of responsibility,
his method of performance and last but not least, his complete self-abnegation
in sharing the fruits of his labours with others–all would convince the coming
generations, who had had no personal knowledge of his great deeds, how much
they owed to this single leader the claim for a vast Bharat, despite the
partition, under one strong administration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sculpture is one of the finest phases of Indian culture. But the art of
sculpture is younger than that of painting. Indian sculpture is merely 5,000
years old while Indian painting is more than 20,000 years old. Yet, Indian
sculpture has obtained greater reputation in the world, than Indian painting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is the significance of Indian sculpture? The significance of Indian sculpture
lies in the absence of naturalism, in that of realistic anatomy, in the poetic
expression and supple execution. The Indian sculptors had paid little heed
towards realistic representation of the external forms and thus they followed
their own conventions stated in canons. Indian sculpture cannot be said to be
mere stylization; it is more than stylization. Indian sculpture is a sort of
poetic realism, if not a prosaic realism. Those sculptors paid greater
attention to creative conception than to critical perception. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

uneffected by the alien influences. It has undergone several influences from
the lands beyond the border of India; and among those influences the strongest
had been that of Greece. That is why the Greeco-Gandhara sculpture of the
North-Western India (now Pakistan) is peculiar in its style and technique
alike. It has greater realistic features than those of the Indian sculpture of
other periods. The sculpture of India has, thus, various styles belonging to
various traditions formed in various periods. Realism, idealism and </span><span

a Mauryan sculpture of the third century B. C., reproduced in the present

stone sculpture of the Mauryan period is its mirror-like smooth polish. The

in general, is of two types–round and relief. Round sculpture could be viewed
from the back side also whereas the relief sculpture could be viewed from the
front only. Single figures are generally executed in round sculpture while
group compositions are done in relief sculpture. In contrast to the
above-mentioned “Chauri-Bearer” of the Mauryan period, “Music and Dance”
belonging to the Sunga period of the second century B. C., is a relief
sculpture representing a group of musicians and dancers full of rhythmic
movement. Another sculpture captioned “Vasantasena pursued by Sakaara”
belonging to the Kushana period of the first century A. D. is more realistic in
both form and expression. This fine piece of sculpture illustrates an incident
in the Sanskrit drama entitled “Mritchakatika” written by Sudraka. The physical
features of this sculpture are more robust than those of the sculptures of the
preceding periods. “The Toilet of Sundari” of the Greeco-Gandhara style of the
second century A. D., is quite different in style, technique, texture,
expression, etc., from all other Indian sculptures mainly because of its alien
influences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
of all the sculptures of various periods of India, the most poetic, the most
rhythmic and the most dynamic is the sculpture of the Satavahana and the
Ikshwaku periods belonging to Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda respectively. One of
these sculptures captioned “The Adoration of the Buddha’s Feet,” reproduced in
this album, of Amaravati, belonging to the second century A. D. (Satavahana) is
one of the most enchanting pieces of Indian sculpture, in the beauty of
balanced composition of figures, in the delineation of the living rhythmic
curves of the limbs of adoring women and in the concentrated contemplative
expressions of their faces. In the Nagarjunakonda sculptures are discerned the
reflections of those of Amaravati, but in a more refined and more lyrical
manner. In Nagarjunakonda sculptures, some of the Sanskrit poems are
illustrated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

form without content, for all content is perceived through the form alone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Time and again AIR has been the target of criticism
of every kind from every quarter and this has been its unfortunate lot from its
very inception. A service organisation which has perhaps the widest contact
with the public everyday is bound to attract the attention of the people from
every quarter. The radio has an intimate contact with the home and the family
and people rightly consider the organisation responsible for this service as
something vital in their lives. A better appreciation and assessment will be
possible if the working of AIR is viewed with a perspective of the background,
of how the organisation has been developing over a period of three decades.

between two characters Noecis and his friend Gynea from outer regions and men

the terrific problems of atomic explosion. The alarming developments of nuclear
weapons and atomic energy spell not only the ruin of this nation or that nation
but the extermination of the entire humanity. How is one to escape it? Can he
do it in the present traditional ideological context? Can we effect a total
regeneration in the ways of man’s thought and avert the crisis by the adoption
of a new ideology which involves the discording of the outmoded ideas and worn
out concepts about family, marriage, education, life-style religion, that are
no longer functional and meaningful to us. In the place of these concepts, new
ideas are expounded to the visitors from the outer-space. The new ideas centre
round an imaginative ‘man-centered’, ‘this worldly humanism.’ In the place of
love between man and woman, a friendly relation which is non-possessive,
non-dominant and sincere is suggested. The concept of freedom and the reasons for
affirming authentic <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>existence of man
are highlighted. The style of the book is delight</span>ful and easy reading
and is highly erudite without sounding pedantic. The theses discussed are the
criticisms of the current religious beliefs, organised theology, the changes in
the codes of morality, the disintegration of family life and the institution of
marriage, totalitarianism and freedom, etc. It is a substantial and enjoyable
volume on important themes that matter most to men and women. Chapters VII and
VIII are the plums in the pudding that are relished most. The dialogue form

an exercise into the exploration of the occult in India, this work is a fair
beginning. The author has met a number of men and women who wield certain
occult powers and are accessible to the journalist. For most of the occultists
shy away from inquisitive minds. But there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

are quite a few of them here explaining to the author the feats they have done
or can do, especially in matters of healing, materialisations, telekinesis,
etc. There are miracle men like Kalika Prasad to whom liquor is God; Narayan
Baba who brings into existence idols and ashes and foretells your future by
just looking at you. And of course there is Satya Sai Baba who is largely
misunderstood, his own disciples being responsible for this unfortunate
development. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is different from spirituality. Perhaps that is why some of the genuine saints
with God-conciousness do not find place in these pages. Broadly the writing
gives a garish picture of occult India which may titillate the Western tourist
but hurts the susceptibilities of the cultured Indian who sets little store by
these miracle-powers, who always looks to the quantum of spiritual
consciousness in the saints and sages he comes across. The difference between
white magic and black magic, the difference between those who perform miracles
by virtue of their own natural endowments and those who are under the control
of malevolent spirits, are some of the points to be considered at length before
one is in a position to assess the proper value and significance of these

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
book under review is a remarkable presentation of the life and ethos of the
Hindus as found in Northern India, especially in Bengal, where the author W. J.
Wilkins was a Pastor of Union Chapel for four years and dedicated Missionary
for another thirteen years. It is a companion volume to his earlier work <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hindu Mythology: Vedic and Puranic, </i>published
in 1882. The first edition of the present book appeared in 1887. Rupa and Co.,
deserves our thanks for having brought out a second edition now. Its
publication is timely because the book will administer a shock treatment to the
complacent and proud Hindus and instil a new sense of religious awareness in
them. The book was written by a foreigner for the foreigners, but it can be of
immense value to the modern Hindus who in a way are as foreign to the essential
spirit of the religion as any foreigner can possibly be. It makes a very
interesting reading, the language being simple and effective. The observations
and experiences of the author on which the book is mainly based are true and
authentic. The sources from which he quotes to support his viewpoint at times
are genuine and authoritative. The whole book is informed by a spirit of
dedication and honesty. It is largely free from the Christian bias which mars
the worth of many a book of this kind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
we gladly grant objectivity and sincerity of purpose on the part of the author,
we cannot but observe that the picture he gives of the Hindus is spoiled by
lack of proper perspective and understanding. It seems he has no proper idea of
Hindu Dharma and view of life. While he concedes that, for a Hindu, life and
religion are one, he fails to notice the relation between Hindu philosophy and
Hindu religion. Hindu religion derives from Hindu philosophy whose roots are in
the Vedas and Upanishads. It is wrong to dub Dwaita, Adwaita and Visishtadwaita
as mere religious. Nor is it correct to say that in India original Vedic
religion was lost and modern Hinduism is a poor substitute for the original
Vedic religion. True, the Puranic religion has done considerable damage to the
prestine Vedic thought by encrusting it with meaningless ritual and inseparable
superstitions which characterise it still. But it does not mean there is a
break in the continuity of religious thought and practice in India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
the inherent limitations of the Western mind in understanding the vast varied
all-inclusive system of Hindu thoughts, which defies analysis, Wilkins’s
attempt to portray the Hindu society as it was is a commendable one. Though its
value as correct assessment of Hinduism is doubtful, its value for the modern
Hindu to know where he stands is really inestimable. If the Hindus live a life
of depravity in spite of the essential nobility and loftiness of their
scriptures the fault cannot be laid at the door of religion. Has any foreigner
who visited India before the Mohammedan invasion written that the Hindus were
irreligious rabble steeped in irredeemable superstition, forever fallen? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a fanatic Shaivaite, and forced his reluctant son to observe the Shivaratri
fast and vigil. But the young boy’s faith was severely shaken by his noticing
when all the others were asleep, a mouse climbing on to the <i

incident is narrated in unsophisticated, flat prose. But despite this, the
agonized dilemma in the boy’s mind comes through to the reader. This lack of
texture and the curious feeling of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>social
vacuum despite the myriad names of places and persons mentioned, persists
through the book, and makes it more a chronicle of events in the Swami’s life

“Wanderings and Studies: 1845.1863” recounts the young Dayananda’s escape from <span

His accounts of his encounter with the meat-eating Brahmin Pandits at Rishikesh
(P. 28) in 1855 and his disgust with the Tantric literature which approved of
incest, meat-eating and nude worship sound authentic and convincing. His young
mind responded with horror to these obnoxious practices. The whole chapter is
propelled by the energy of Dayananda’s irresistible quest for truth. Such
patterning of experience as we notice in these chapters is rudimentary. The
second chapter brings to an end Dayananda’s education, with his learning
Sanskrit grammar under Vrijananda at Mathura, where he remained till 1863.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

third chapter entitled “Public Ministry: 1863-1883,” is concerned mainly with
his wanderings in quest of knowledge and truth, and his philosophical
disputations with the leaders of various Hindu sects. Here we are forced to
admire the gusto with which Dayananda propagated his ideas, though he provides
few details about the battles with his opponents. There is also a fourth
chapter called “My Beliefs and Disbeliefs.” This is included by way of an
appendix. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a different kind of tribute to Dikshitar has been paid in the September issue
of the Journal of the Indian Musicological Society of Baroda. This special
number contains articles on the different facets of the composer by a band of
nine musicologists. The present reviewer was the Guest Editor of the issue. The
articles cover the life of Dikshitar, his contemporaries and disciples, the
contribution of the members of his family to Karnataka music and the literary
excellence of his compositions. The distinguished writers include Smt. Vidya
Shankar, Sri T. Sankaran, Dr. S. Sita, Dr. T. S. Ramakrishnan, Sri B. V. K.
Sastry, Sri Rajanikanta Rao, Smt. S. A. Durga and Dr S. Ramanathan. Dikshitar’s
compositions in Desya ragas and the influence of Venkatamakhi on his music have
been discussed in two scholarly articles. Eight representative kritis of
Dikshitar in Devanagari script with an English translation by this reviewer have
been printed in this number as also several photos connected with Dikshitar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was an ardent devotee of the Lord Srikrishna of the Guruvayoor temple, and also
a prodigy and versatile scholar in Sanskrit. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Narayaneeyam </i>is a marvellous and dexterous epitome of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bhagavata Purana </i>in 1036 verses written
in eighteen popular metres and divided into 100 chapters. On completion of this
work the poet was cured of his deadly disease–paralysis. He prays the Lord, at
the end of every canto to relieve him of his illness. Bhakti is the dominant
sentiment. Pathos is also there. There is a galore of alliterations and easily
understandable ‘yamakas.’ Sound and metres match with the sense, as is
evidenced by chapters 24, 25, 68 and 69 describing the incarnation of
Naarasimha, Krishna’s reunion with Gopikas ‘Rasa Lila.’ Being of the outcome of
a suffering heart, this poem evokes devotional feelings in a reader, and
pleases his ears by the jingling and resonant language. The outstanding
grammarian in the poet is seen in all the verbal forms in particular and a
reader is struck by the poet’s command of the language. Descriptions are very
natural and the poet’s appeals to the Lord are moving. The translation is
excellent. The long introduction covering more than forty pages and the
elaborate notes at the end, dealing with the life of the author, the merits of
the poem and the “Bhagavata: a perspective of its contents” and “its teachings
on the theory and practice of Bhakti” are immensely useful for a proper
understanding of the essence of the poem. The Ramakrishna Math has done singular
service to the devotees and lovers of Sanskrit literature by publishing this
precious work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

literature, late lamented Sri Tikkavarapu Rama Reddi. He met the expenses every
year for honouring the scholars. Not only that he endowed a handsome amount and
created a trust so that the celebrations could continue in the same dignified scale
even after his passing away. It is laudable that Dr B. Gopala Reddi who is the
son-in-law of Sri Rama Reddi and President of the Kavitraya Jayanti Sangham,
gave a new and better turn to the celebrations from 1957 by inviting three
scholars instead of one and thus commemorating the trio (Kavitrayam –Nannaya,
Tikkana and Yerrapraggada) instead of one poet, viz., Tikkana. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

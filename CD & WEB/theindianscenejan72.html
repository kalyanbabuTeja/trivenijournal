style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
quarter October–December 1971 is a most memorable one in the history of our
country. We won a war against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and broke up her political unity and military power. In this process we
liberated <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>, a
nation of 75 millions, from the oppressive yoke of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This is a feat
unparalleled in the history of the world. We have no other instance of a nation
waging a war at a great cost to itself for liberating another nation and
winning success in it. We have every reason to be proud of this achievement and
our thanks naturally go to our armed forces which through their heroism and
concerted action brought us this victory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We argued earlier that without a
military intervention on our part it would be impossible to send back to their
homes with <span class=SpellE>honour</span> and dignity the ten million
refugees to whom we gave shelter on purely humanitarian considerations and that
such intervention would be equally necessary to settle the issue of the freedom
of <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. Events have
shown that our line of argument was correct. War becomes inevitable in certain
situations and no country should shirk from it when no other alternative is
available. Non-violence and peaceful negotiations are no doubt desirable but
they are not always possible. This is the lesson of history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the war we waged we were lucky in
two ways. In the first place we waited and waited patiently till <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
herself openly took to the bombing of our cities. We could therefore convince
the world that the responsibility for starting the war rested squarely on her
and not on us even though the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> with their vested
interests in preserving the military regime in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and with their anti-Indian
bias were not prepared to be convinced. In the second place we were lucky in
having had to fight only <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
Victory would have been more difficult if the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
had intervened </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>on
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
side as they threatened to do. Although <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> sent her seventh fleet to the <st1:place w:st="on">Bay
 of Bengal</st1:place> she hesitated to make use of it. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> also was
not in a mood to <span class=SpellE>moblise</span> her forces in the direction
of either <span class=SpellE>Ladakh</span> or <span class=SpellE>Nefa</span>.
She knew that we were better prepared now to face her than in 1962. She had
also the excuse that the mountain passes were snow-clad. There was, therefore,
nothing very surprising in the victory we won. Our armed forces were three
times as strong as <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
have also to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> in this connection that the
Indo-Soviet Treaty concluded in August also contributed–though in-directly–to
our victory. Both <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and
the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> were fully
aware that any active move on their part to intervene on <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>’s side would automatically result in
Soviet Russia intervening on the side of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and that this would lead to a
nuclear war which was not to <span class=GramE>anybody’s liking</span>. The
readiness with which Soviet Russia moved some of the units of her fleet to the <st1:place
w:st="on">Bay of Bengal</st1:place> and some of her armed forces to the borders
of <span class=SpellE>Sinkiang</span> made this more than clear to the other ‘great’
powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Let
us now see what the meaning and significance of our victory are. Here we have
to remember that twenty-five years ago our leaders agreed to the partition of
the country and the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>creation of Pakistan in the hope that it would
satisfy once for all the Muslim communalists, that in consequence peace and
stability would reign in the sub-continent and that both the new States would
be able to concentrate their efforts on economic and social development and on
raising the standards of living of the two peoples. But such a hope has all along
been belied by the hostile attitude adopted by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> from the very beginning.
She took to an aggressive war as early as 1948. She later on entered into a
military alliance with <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
and next with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and having thus armed herself she undertook a war against us in 1965 and again
in 1971. She spurned the invitation which we extended several times to her to
enter into a no-war pact with us. All these years she continued to oppress the
Hindu-minority living within her boundaries, denied to them all rights of citizenship
and drove them out to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as refugees, thus keeping alive the communal tensions here and fomenting both directly
and indirectly Hindu-Muslim riots. This was an impossible situation for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> to live
with. Now that <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> has
been defeated </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and broken up she will cease to be a thorn on
the side of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and even if she continues to be a thorn it will be a thorn with blunted point.
This is the main significance of the victory we won. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ever since 1962 when <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> suffered defeat at the hands of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> she was
being regarded as a country of no consequence and there has been a tendency on
the part of other states to belittle or ignore her. Many of them believed in
the myth propagated by <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
that West Pakistanis were a martial race with extraordinary fighting qualities
and that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could never win a war against them. The recent victory exploded this myth and
proved to the world that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has the capacity to become a major power and that she is already such a power.
Her rulers displayed a high order of statesmanship in taking independent
decisions on what they considered to be their national interest in the face of
international opinion and of opposition by great powers like <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Her stature is now
far higher than what it has all along been. Self-confidence is the most
valuable asset of any nation and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s victory has brought this
self-confidence to her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

modern times religion cannot be the basis of a State and that the mere fact
that both the rulers and the people of a State follow the same religion is no
guarantee against oppression. It has also shown that the best interests of all
citizens are served when a State pursues secular policies. A large section of
Muslims in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> have not
accepted this thesis and they have continued to believe in the <span
class=GramE>two-nations</span> theory of which the pre-independence Muslim
League and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were the champions. Even though they have been given equal rights of
citizenship with Hindus and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the<i> </i></span>followers
of other religions they have declined to enter the main stream of political
life in the country and participate fully in it. Some of them have been
attracted by the policies pursued by <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>

pursued by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There is now <span class=GramE>a likelihood</span> that most of them will
follow the example of their brethren in <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span

active participants in the public affairs of the country. If they do so it will
kill the communalism </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which
is found among certain sections of Hindus–a communalism which is not really
indigenous but a reaction to Muslim communalism. All this will strengthen the

We may feel that all this is short-sightedness on their part and that whatever

is open to Government to take possession of private property by paying what is
called some “amount” instead of compensation. It is not open to any court to
question whether the amount paid is adequate. Moreover this amendment touches
not only the right to property but also the other fundamental rights like the
right to equality and equal protection of laws guaranteed in Article 14, and
the right to seven fundamental freedoms guaranteed in Article 19. A mere declaration
by Parliament that these rights are in conflict with Article 39 which lays down
a number of Directive Principles of State Policy is enough to give validity to
any law which abrogates these rights and such a declaration is not open to
question by any court of law. The 25th amendment thus puts an end to the right
of property, the right to equality and the right to fundamental freedoms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the rights of minorities and the rights of states may be abrogated if they come
into conflict with Article 39. Parliament can thus change the nature of the
whole Constitution in whatever way it likes. Instead of the Constitution
remaining supreme, Parliament becomes supreme. The Judiciary is deprived of
whatever power the Constitution has given to it to check the hasty and
unconstitutional action that Parliament and the Executive might take. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

necessary to give effect to socialism and eliminate poverty. This amounts to
saying that for the sake of socialism all other rights should be abrogated.
This is a dangerous doctrine as it virtually amounts to the introduction of
communism by the backdoor. In communist states there is no right to private
property and there are no other fundamental rights. A democracy differs from
communism as individuals are guaranteed certain rights in the former which is
not the case in the latter. If according to the 25th amendment a man can be
deprived of his property on payment of a nominal amount it is virtually a
denial of the right to it. The same is the case when other rights are taken
away in the name of the Directive Principles of State Policy. </span><span

is to prevent totalitarianism of this type that in all democratic constitutions
provision is made for the sharing of power by different institutions–the
legislature, the executive and the judiciary, a central government and a number
of local governments and so on. It is the experience of history that
concentration of power proves dangerous. Whatever might be the outcome of such
concentration in nature democracies where there are strong opposition parties,
a live public opinion, and a large section of politically conscious people
keeping a constant watch on the deeds and misdeeds of those in power, its
outcome is bound to be harmful in our country where these factors are absent
and where a majority returned in an election is in a position to exercise dictatorial
power. It is because of this that the 25th amendment should be regarded as
having given a shock to the democratic nature of our Constitution and as having
cleared the path towards some kind of ‘constitutional’ dictatorship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

26th amendment which has deprived the Princes of their so-called privileges has
also been passed in the name of equality. The assumption is that there should
be no class of people with hereditary privileges even though such a class is
sure to disappear by efflux of time as is the case with the princely order.
Here is a clear breach of promise made by national leaders who were at the helm
of affairs only twenty-five years ago. We proclaim that it is one of our sacred
duties to pay regard to the commitments of those who led us to freedom. The
26th amendment is a deliberate disregard of such commitments. It was no less a

part of the obligations by transferring all ruling powers and by agreeing to
the integration of their states. The main part of our obligation under these
agreements is to ensure that the guarantees given by us in respect of privy

philosopher-statesman, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan (born 1888) is one of the most
dignified and yet lively personalities among the world’s great men, and can be
counted now along with Asoka the Great and Marcus Aurelius. It is given to very
few philosophically minded men to rise to a position from which they can make
their philosophies effective. The world can rarely bring together circumstances
that enable a great soul to become a ruler, particularly of a great State or
Empire. It was the hope of Plato in the West and of Confucius in the East that
philosophers would be kings; and in both <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
political history was interpreted as a cycle of events that throws out a
philosopher-king for rectifying the evil that accumulated in the past before
one cycle closes and another begins. During the historical times, after Asoka
the Great, there has not been, for nearly two thousand years, a philosophically
minded ruler in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
who presided over the destinies of the whole of the sub-continent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Radhakrishnan comes from the State of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Andhra
  Pradesh</st1:place></st1:State>, which has not been particularly known for
giving recognition to its great men. This observation holds especially after
the Satavahana Dynasty, which was really Andhra, but was claimed also by <st1:place
w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place>. Nagarjuna, the great Buddhist philosopher,
patronised by the Satavahanas, presided over the great Buddhist establishment
at Amaravati. But it is not established beyond doubt that he was an Andhra by<i>
</i>birth. Nimbarka and Vallabha, two of the great Vedantins, found no place in
their own native State. For a long time, the Andhra area has not been known for
the origination or leadership of any great spiritual, social or political
movement. Its great men became great outside, or men from outside became great
there. No wonder that the greatness of Radhakrishnan was recognized after he
became King George V Professor of Philosophy in the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>.
His greatness was recognized by <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> first.
The geat philosopher-statesman who built up the Vijayanagar Empire, Swami
Vidyaranya (Sayana-Madhava) was an Andhra, took sanyasa, and established the
tradition that the heads of the Sringeri Monastery should be selected from
among the Andhras. But he was as much a Karnatika as an Andhra. Dr.
Radhakrishnan is also claimed for different reasons by the States of Andhra,
Tamilnad, Karnataka, and <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>. However, he
is an Indian first, and is the least provincial in feelings. Temperamentally,
Dr. Radhakrishnan is a philosopher, spiritual and profound in outlook. He is a
Stoic, an idealist, extremely humane and deeply concerned with the lot of man
on earth. His idealism and stoicism can be seen in his accepting only
one-fourth of the salary which, according to the Constitution of India, his
predecessor was drawing. That is, in terms of American money, he will receive
only about 510 dollars per month. And that amount too is subject to income-tax
deductions. Yet in spite of his philosophy, he can show lively interest in all
human affairs, without being abstract-minded and putting on a long face. He is
a person who can give the fullest consideration which the opposite point of
view deserves, because his vision is deep and comprehensive. He is a man whose
foresight can reach farther than that of most men. Intolerance is a word that
cannot be applied to him. Even during the days when jealousy was able to harm
him, he could be charitable to his enemies. Every great man, however good he
may be, creates some enemies not necessarily by doing positive harm to them,
but by being able to accomplish what they could not and thereby arousing their
envy. And Dr. Radhakrishnan could not be an exception. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a philosopher, Radhakrishnan started as an admirer of Rabindranath Tagore’s
ideas. Later he became a follower of Sankara’s Vedanta, but yet with a
positively constructive philosophy of the world. He is rightly regarded as the
first Indian thinker who had an equal grasp of Indian and Western philosophies,
and is therefore qualified for the role of a liaison officer between East and
West. Nobody disproved Kipling’s view that the East and the West can never meet
more conclusively than Dr. Radhakrishnan, who proved that not only did the two
meet in the ancient times, but also that long before their meeting they were
one and took different ways. He is one of the strongest opponents of the view
that man in the East and in the West is basically different. He believes
strongly in the spiritual oneness of mankind, which has to be brought to the
surface, although hidden behind cultural differences. These differences should
not be equated to the man behind the culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Radhakrishnan takes earnestly the fourth Aphorism of the <i>Brahmasutras </i>and
applies it to all fields of human life, and to all the philosophies and
cultures. The Aphorism refers to the reconciliation of the conflicting texts.
Similar reconciliation is necessary and possible for discovering the unity of
all religions, cultures and mankind. The differences between religions and
cultures are only external. If we look through the externals, we can see the
underlying unity, which is more important than the differences. Radhakrishnan
does not advocate the abolition of the different religions and the giving up of
the different cultures, but pleads that each realize the internal, essential
truth expressed in different ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Radhakrishnan’s philosophy is essentially
religious, in the sense of being spiritual. But “spiritual” does not mean for
him the mere practice of Yoga. The practice of Yoga is good and useful; but
true spiritual life should express itself in good social institutions, good
political forms, and a healthy family life. The contemporary distrust of
religion is due to its presumed indifference to them. Religion is Dharma;
Dharma is what supports life and preserves its harmony. Whatever is not
conducive to such harmony cannot truly be religion. A religion that preaches
discord, hatred of the followers of other religions, cannot be a true religion.
Religion, if true, should contribute to the harmonious life of mankind, but not
to its breaking up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Radhakrishnan
is in sympathy with humanistic movements, from his own point of view. He
observes that humanistic revolts are justified when religion forgets man and
does not come down from its holy heights to help him in his concrete
situations. Yet humanism without a spiritual philosophy is never complete. It
concerns itself with man in his external forms, but leaves out the inner source
of his creativity, the spiritual fountain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
important idea that Radhakrishnan has made popular is that religion is
essential for democracy. Democracy is based upon the principle of the freedom
of man. Every man is free to choose what he considers to be right and rational.
His freedom works through economic, social, political and material forms. As
forms, they are not only subject to determinate laws, but also expressed as
such. What then is the basis of man’s freedom? It cannot be economic and
political laws, which also have determinate forms. It must be the Spirit within
man, the expressions of which are the different laws which cannot be equated to
it. If democracy believes in the freedom of man, it has to believe in the
Spirit within him. And it is religion that takes, in all earnestness, the
reality of such a spirit. Without belief in the reality of spirit, no
philosophy of democracy can be self-sufficient. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
we do not believe in the reality of Spirit, philosophy has necessarily to be
pessimistic and the forms it takes on will be the different kinds of
materialism or of existentialism. A thorough-going materialism can give no hope
to mankind. Nor can existentialism that does not believe in the reality of
Spirit give it. The finite man is the beginning and end of all such
philosophies, and he ends in death and hopelessness. The idea is not that we
should believe in Spirit in order to give false hopes for which there is no
real basis. Radhakrishnan says that the understanding of man as merely the
finite, physical and psychological individual is false and mistaken. He
believes in what the <i>Mahabharata </i>says, namely, that man contains in
himself the essential secret of the universe, the inner Spirit, the Brahman. It
is faith in such Spirit, which is not necessarily bound by external conditions,
that has enabled cultures to survive in spite of centuries of catastrophies,
and to re-create themselves from time to time out of ruins. Otherwise, they
would have broken down and entered the limbo of history with only antiquarian,
but not living, interest for us. The cultures and civilizations that survived
in spite of adversities could do so owing to unbounded faith in an
indestructible Spirit. And those cultures only that reached the stage of such
faith could survive and assert themselves with new vigour after the storms
passed away. The nature of Spirit is rationality and not blind force, sweetness
and not violence, love and not hatred, harmony and not discord, compassion and
not cruelty, and dynamism and not sterility. Where such qualities lie at the
basis of a culture, and its philosophy teaches that they are not temporary and
prudent expedients for attaining transitory goals but the expressions of the
innermost spirit working through man, such a culture is sure to survive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

nice, or philosophical remark. He has the capacity to talk to people of all
ages and levels, and make them feel at home in his presence. With children he
can take interest in their fun. He can humour youth. As a Vice-Chancellor he
could send back the students who carne to complain and argue, satisfied,
smiling and in good humour, and yet make them follow what was right. He could
be strict when conditions demanded, yet strict in a way that his strictness was
not felt as harshness. To the people who went for advice over their

was as great as that of any Bengali professor and the students were really

mediator and peace-maker not only among the students, but also in the whole
university, and not only within the university but also between the university
and the government, whenever some trouble arose with the students. Not only
over abstract philosophical ideas, but also over the minds of men was his

he was a member of the Indian Educational Service and was knighted by the
British Government–either of which would have prevented anyone else from being
sympathetic towards national leaders who were asking the British to quit
India–he gave a party to Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1929. This was at that
time a sensation. From that time onwards, his mind was moving from abstract
philosophy to concrete human situations. Not that he gave up philosophy from
that time. Even during his vice~presidentship he wrote a number of books. He
became the Spalding Professor at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>
long after he gave the party to Nehru. From the year 1929, one may safely

is recalled by the students of Radhakrishnan that he was one of the best
teachers of logic. But he was always of the opinion that living best is more
important than arguing best for defeating the opponent. The doctrine of judgment
and proposition is not philosophy in itself; the aim of philosophy is to tell
man how to lead a good life, pointing out when it is wrong and which is the
right way. The right way concerns not only the way to salvation, but also a
harmonious, full, and perfect life in this world. It concerns the relation
between man and man, man and woman, man and animal, nation and nation, religion
and religion, and so forth. Philosophy is a way of life, not merely a way of
thought. Logic and analysis are not the end of philosophy. They were not so for
the Greeks, the Indians or the Chinese. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Brought up in the Indian tradition of the
Vedanta, Dr. Radhakrishnan would never accept that the question about the
meaning of life is meaningless. The thinkers of the Indian Renaissance–Tagore,
Tilak, Vivekananda, and Gandhi–whatever be the differences between their
philosophies, emphasized the importance of the life in this world. Tagore
showed more interest in the created world than in the pure, eternal, perfect
Brahman behind all appearances. Vivekananda, although a follower of Sankara and
himself a monk, preached the uplift of man, utilising Sankara’s doctrine that
the Atman is the Brahman itself for exhorting man to realise his greatness and
express it here itself. Tilak preached that there can be no realization of the
Brahman without active life in this world. Mahatma Gandhi said that he found
religion in the service of humanity, in its economic and political uplift. The
spiritual significance of religion came to be discovered in the life of man as
man, in its various kinds of<i> </i>institutions. Human life is not
meaningless, its meaning lies in the implications of its conscious being, which
reaches right up to the Brahman. The Brahman can be discovered the best in man,
although the flower in the crannied wall also can reveal it. Such a discovery
is the main task of philosophy, if it is to teach a way of life and is not to
be merely content with being a way of thought. Man contains the cue to the
secret of life and the universe; as such he is in his essence the Brahman
itself. That he is the, Brahman, the principle of unity and harmony in the
universe, should be exemplified in all human institutions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

world should have as its aim the realization of this unity, the unity of
mankind. Such realization is not to be confined to meditation and prayer, but
should express itself in a harmonious living of all men and all nations, making
the unity transparent not only in the economic and commercial forms, but also
psychologically in active expressions of love, compassion, and sympathy. It is
not meant that all nations should weld into one, that all religions should
disappear giving place to a new one, all cultures should be given up and a new
one introduced. It is meant that each should realize the essential unity of
mankind, the basic similarity of man everywhere in the world, through the
concrete feeling of the brotherhood of man, in spite of the differences of
race, culture, religion, and nationality. These differences are differences
within the one great institution that is to be governed by the great principle,
the brotherhood of all mankind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Radhakrishnan in some of his lectures spoke of the one world. But this one
world is for him more psychological and spiritual than political. It does not
seem that the idea meant for him one nation, one political constitution, or
anything of the kind. He was a member of the League of Nations, Chairman of the
UNESCO; he adorned several such positions. He has the greatest faith in the UN.
The international associations like the UN and the trans-national and
trans-cultural associations like the different religious and academic bodies
are not only bringing together all the social and political groups, but also
cutting across the boundaries of each, bringing to the forefront the
universality of human nature, human interests, aims and aspirations; and they
may ultimately succeed in creating in man the habit of thinking and orienting
himself towards the idea that all humanity is one. But whether they will
succeed in creating a super-nation on the earth under a political constitution
is too early to predict, although the League of Nations and the UN are
noteworthy attempts in that direction. I do not remember to have read or
listened to any definite programme towards such a goal laid out by
Radhakrishnan. One would imagine that he has not done it because he has enough
realism in him not to be too Utopian. At present the idea of one State for the
whole world with one constitution, in which all men are equal, free, happy, and
contented, is too Utopian. Dr. Radhakrishnan is a realist in action and an
idealist in outlook–a rare but a most desirable combination for the supreme
Head of a State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>India has been very fortunate in having Dr. Rajendra
Prasad, who was a scholar and one of the most trusted followers of Mahatma
Gandhi, as her first President. And she is no less fortunate in having as her
second President Dr. Radhakrishnan, who is well known throughout the world as
one of the greatest of contemporary thinkers and statesmen and who, even apart
from the highest position he occupies in India, is held in respect wherever he
goes. It is through his thoughtful guidance that she can not only retain and
strengthen her individuality and keep the continuity of her great spiritual
past, but also make progress towards strength, health, and prosperity. The
contemporary Heads of India can no longer have the advantages of the
autocratic, though benevolent, monarchs like Asoka the Great, whose will was law;
Asoka submitted his will to Dharma, the sustaining law of the Spirit, but there
was no worldly force that could have compelled him to submit his will to
Dharma. Now India is democratic, and one can only pray that the conditions and
forces, necessary for enabling Dr. Radhakrishnan to see the results of his
profound insight and vast experience, obtain in India. The tendency in most
countries that have recently obtained independence is to break off from their
spiritual traditions, not knowing how to assimilate the new to the old or how
to adjust the old to the new. Either process needs insight, understanding and
proper guidance. India is fortunate in having Dr. Radhakrishnan who can supply
the three requisites. Without the spiritual leaven in her culture and outlook,
India will no longer be India; nor can she survive without material progress.
Her need is an evolution of their unity.</p>

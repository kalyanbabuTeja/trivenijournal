short stories of E. M. Forster anticipate to a very large extent the values
that he treats more substantially in his novels. The social relations of his
time–its norms of respectability and behaviour–are the chief target of
Forster’s early satire. It was difficult to think of a gentleman talking to
another without proper introduction; it was a class-conscious age of such heavy
social inhibitions. In <i>The Story of a Panic </i>(1902) the tourists at
Ravello are shocked at their<i> </i>servant’s breach of etiquette and the
dialogue<i> </i>of that part of the story is significant. The speaker is a
middle-class gentleman, talking to a fisherlad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>It is the protest of Edwardian
England against taking liberties with its conventions. The falsity and
flimsiness of such a social texture come in for serious criticism at the hands
of Forster. The conventions, gestures and greetings, have, instead of promoting
and enriching understanding, become so much empty ritual. In spite of their
shaking hands and uttering polite ‘how-do-you-do’s, they are worlds apart. The
private little society is more meaningful and hence Forster insists on the
values of personal relationship, truthfulness and spontaneity of nature. It is
this vision which the author conveys through Pan or Faun in his works.</p>

Story of a Panic </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brings out the message by contrasting the
understanding and sympathy of an unsophisticated fisherlad with the stupidity
of the higher classes. ‘Panic’ does not signify so much the fear as the
consequences of the entry of Pan, the <i>Panic. </i>The pun is obvious. The
members of an English picnic party enjoy themselves at a beautiful Italian
village, bandying shibboleths of respectability. They express admiration for
nature and, indeed, all the formalities are observed meticulously. There is
something hollow and mock-heroic in their sorrow when they dramatically mourn
that “Nereids have left the waters and Oreads the mountains.” Pan enters the
scene and the members of the party–except an uneducated youth called
Eustace–take to their heels. It is typical of their tribe. Those who run away
conspire later to bring the boy into the stifling falsity of their own
predicament. But he escapes into reality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
real and the conventional are the recurring patterns of antithesis in all the
works of Forster and Pan mostly symbolises the real in his short stories. The
collapse of the shallow and the conventional is again spotlighted in <i>The
Curate’s Friend, Other Kingdom </i>and <i>The Eternal Moment. </i>Harry, in <i>The
Curate’s Friend, </i>is ‘facetious without humour and serious without
conviction.’ He talks to his audiences about the Other World in the tone of one
who has been behind the scenes, and about the Roman earth works which, of
course, have since proved to be Saxon. The descriptions expose the humbug of
the man. He loses his beloved to ‘a little man’ under the influence of
Faun–nature, again–and thus he is cured of his cant. The contrast in the <i>Other
Kingdom </i>is between wealth and the reality of nature. Evelyn Beaumont, the
heroine of the story, is engaged to Harcourt Worters who is an embodiment of
the Bank Balance Civilisation. The overtones of meaning that one sees in the
description of Evelyn, are part of Forster’s purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

her skirt dance in the open meadow, lit by sudden gleams of the sunshine. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was really a beautiful sight, and Mr. Worters did not correct her, glad perhaps
that she should recover her spirits, even if she lost her tone. Her feet
scarcely moved but her body so swayed and her dress spread so gloriously around
her that we were transported with joy. She danced to the song of a bird that
sang passionately in <i>Other Kingdom </i>and the river held back its waves to
watch her (one might have supposed), and the winds lay spellbound in their
cavern, and the great clouds spellbound in the sky. She danced away from our
society and our life, back, back through the centuries till houses and fences
fell and the earth lay wild to the sun. Her garment was as foliage upon her,
the strength of her limbs as boughs her throat the smooth upper branch that
salutes the morning or glistens to the rain. Leaves move, leaves hide it, as
hers was hidden by the motion of her hair.”<sup> 2</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lover wants to overwhelm Evelyn by his show of money and status. She escapes
from him and becomes a beech tree. Harcourt Worters is too stupid to realise
the significance of his defeat. There is no question of his being ‘saved’. In <i>The
Road from Colonus </i>Forster portrays another kind of fall and completes the
pattern. The alienated man is saved in one case, ruined in another, and
degraded in the last mentioned story. Lucas an old man touring Greece, decides
to live in a beautiful village there. But he is forcibly removed from that
place and it looks, for the time being, as if it were the best thing to do. The
place where they have been staying is destroyed shortly after their departure.
Lucas must be called lucky in the sense that he escapes death. But he drags on
such a disgusting kind of life that one feels sorry that he has not died at the
moment of vision in Greece. The symbolistic pattern in the story is discussed
in detail by Lionel Trilling in his <i>Study of Forster. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Road from Colonus is about old age and death. But chiefly it is about modern
life: it tells of a common place English Oedipus who does not die properly at
his Colonus and who, therefore, loses the transfiguration he might have had.
The elderly Mr. Lucas is a tourist in Greece. One day, riding ahead of his
companions, he arrives at a tiny hamlet. In a scorching landscape the hamlet is
a deeply shaded spot, sheltered by great plane-trees. The greatest tree of all
overhangs the primitive inn; it is hollow and from its roots gushes a spring of
living water. The symbolic juxtaposition of hot rocks and flowing water we have
encountered in The Waste Land; the sheltering plane-tree might recall Handel’s
great song in xerxes and the scene in Herodotus which Handel was dramatizing.
Mr. Lucas lives, but in a way so base that we grieve he did not die. It could
be objected, of course, that a petulant and degraded old age can come in any
civilization and that the Greeks whom Forster so often </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>invokes
dreaded old age extravagantly. But this would not be to the point, which is
that death and the value of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>good life are related,
that death is in league with love to support life: death, indeed, is What
creates love.”<sup>3</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the short stories, nature and over-sophistication are juxtaposed only to
spotlight the misfortune of man who has alienated himself from reality and
freedom. The pity of it all, Forster seems to say, is that people become
panicky at real freedom because they have learnt to worship their shackles. It
is a matter of faith with Forster that man’s home is nature and that his
salvation lies in maintaining smooth and harmonious relations with it. Pan is a
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>concrete
expression of the values which are good in themselves and it represents the
values of reality, freedom, truthfulness and spontaneity. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Forster
may call his symbol Pan or Faun, or even a beech tree. What really matters is
that they all indicate nature. J. K. Johnstone writes as follows about the
significance of Pan in the works of Forster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Pan
represents for Forster an honest, natural acceptance of the body and of desire.
He is the spirit of nature, Or rather, of man in harmony with nature Forster
asks above all for spontaneity and vitality; he hates the <i>ersatz. </i>He,
therefore, trusts youth and love. And when He<i> </i>allows </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>himself
to dream, he dreams of a magic island in which there is eternal youth and men
go naked beneath the sun. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Pans of the short stories have a
further significance. They personify the link which Forster feels to exist
between men and the countryside–the countryside which has been man’s home since
the youth of our race and which he has made and moulded while countless
nameless generations have come and gone. Forster’s feeling for nature is partly
Wordsworthian and partly Pagan, but the deities of his fields and downs,
geniuses of his wood and trees, are the past generations who have lived and
died there.” <sup>4</sup><b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
moment of supreme joy for Lucas must have been the moment of death also. He
misses that opportunity and degenerates. The hero of <i>The Point of It </i>does
not miss that opportunity. Harold is an invalid who, in a spurt of enthusiasm,
goes rowing in the sea, ‘enjoys a few moments of fighting sport’ and then
suddenly dies. Joy is an end in itself to him and he underlines the principle
with his own death. It is the point in <i>coordination </i>too, where the
school system goes under and joy wins.<sup>5</sup> Harold in <i>The Point of It
</i>knows that the strain of rowing would kill him. The doctor has warned him
against it, sufficiently in advance. But Harold prefers ‘living’ a few ecstatic
moments to a pointless existence. This is the point of the story. Harold’s
friend Micky is the antithesis of the values symbolised in Harold. The story is
rambling but not so much as to wonder ‘what is the point of it?’<sup> 6</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
content of good life is shown from many points of view. <i>The Other Side of
the Hedge </i>looks at it in the context of the scientific inventions and the
platitudes on progress. The story describes a race along a dirty road, the road
of progress. One of the participants in the race hears the magic song of the
nightingales and smells the odour of the invisible hay from the other side of
the hedge which stands close to the race track. ‘Those whom he meets are all
happy and he might have been happy too, if he could have forgotten that the
place led nowhere.’ The road of joy leads nowhere because, obviously, joy is an
end in itself. The road of science and progress has failed us miserably. <i>The
Machine Stops </i>brings out the pointlessness of the over-developed technology
in powerful terms. Vasti lives in a highly-mechanised world. There are buttons
and switches everywhere–buttons to call for food, for music, for clothing. The
machine fails and thousands die instantaneously including Vasti; Kuno, Vasti’s
son, realises that ultimately man is the measure of things. This realisation
did not come in the case of the travellers on the path of progress in <i>The
Other Side of the Hedge. </i>In his novel, <i>Howard’s End, </i>the heroine
touches on the idea of ‘progress’–the money civilization. “Injustice and Greed
would be the real thing if we live for ever. As it is we must hold to the other
because Death is coming. I love death, not morbidly but because he explains. He
shows me the emptiness of money. Death and money are eternal foes. Not Death
and Life”<sup>7</sup>. The machine is just one aspect of the money civilization
and, in human terms, is the opposite of spontaneity and such other values of
nature that Forster has praised all along. <i>The Machine Stops </i>is a
remarkably prophetic story because Forster has been able to see the disasters
of the machine even at the beginning of this </span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
importance of spontaneity is stressed, not only indirectly as in <i>The Machine
Stops, </i>but Positively in the stories like <i>The Eternal </i></span><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Moment.
</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Miss Raby falls in<i> </i>love with a porter in a beautiful
Alpine village. But she suppresses her spontaneous and genuine feeling; She
realises her mistake years later and visits the same village. She seeks out the
porter who inspired her love once. She tells him that she would bring up his
child. The porter, of course, declines her offer. But even her failure makes
her happy. ‘In that moment of final failure, there had been vouchsafed to her a
vision of herself and she saw that she had lived worthily. She was conscious of
a triumph over experience and earthly facts, a triumph magnificient, cold,
hardly human, whose existence no one but herself would ever surmise’<sup>8</sup>.
It is empty sophistication that inhibits her from accepting the spontaneous
affections of her heart. Forster stresses the value of this principle again in <i>Mr.
Andrews. </i>The soul of Andrews is filled with sympathy and concern for the
salvation of a Turk who has led a life of plunder and wordly pleasures while he
has been alive. They both go to the gates of heaven. At the entrance Andrews
does not ask, ‘Can I enter?’ He spontaneously comes out with the question, ‘Can
<i>he</i> not enter?’ The Turk too asks the same question at the same time.
Both of them are admitted to heaven. The heavenly pleasures, however, do not
make them as happy as their experience at the gate where each thought only of
the other. Andrews and Raby are very finely drawn characters, though they are
called symbols here and their symbolic quality emphasised. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</i>The things that the boy takes as natural shock Bons and he collapses after
his impact with truth. It is a fine piece of subtle irony that the boy who
stands for genuine literary experience, goes without a name in the story. The
biggest casualty in this atmosphere of sophistication is truth. Even the great
institutions which speak in the name of divinity lack of commitment and Forster
points out the dangers of such a distorted perspective in <i>The Story of the
Siren </i>clearly. A young man who has seen a siren living under the sea
marries a girl who also has seen her. It is said that their child will bring
the siren out of the sea for all to see, ‘destroy silence and save the world’.
But the girl carrying the unborn saviour is pushed into the sea at the instance
of a priest and killed. The child is not allowed to be born. The Siren, as
Christopher Isherwood suggests, is the absolute.<sup>9</sup> It is through
those who have had a perception of the Absolute that mankind could be saved.
The theological bureaucracy, however, is against unofficial prophets and
unauthorised perception of truth. The symbols of Forster seem to indicate that
the emergence of a new man, if not the appearance of a saviour, is to be
expected from a revolution in values, achieving perfect harmony with nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

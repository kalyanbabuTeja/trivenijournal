may ask–“A happy and useful old age? Is not that a contradiction in terms? Is
not old age a growing sorrow to the victim, and a burden and nuisance to
society? Is not every old man in some degree a Struldburg–Swift’s horrible
immortal whose every faculty perishes, but who is cursed with a relentless life
he cannot get rid of? Reflecting on the gradual decay of powers of the senses,
well might young Nachiketas of the Katha Upanishad exclaim, ‘who would delight
in two long life!’ Is it, in short, possible for an old man, and all I am going
to say is equally true of the other sex, is it possible for an old man to live
with joy and usefulness?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
one talks of the utility of old age, there are two aspects to be considered:
the subjective and the objective. The first concerns the old man himself; the
second, the society in which he lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
subjective aspect of the question resolves itself into this: Is old age a part
of life worth living? Should not a hoary–or possibly bald–Hamlet ask himself
whether ’tis nobler in the mind suffer it or<i> </i>end it with a bare bodkin,
or by retiring from the world as a Sanyasi? This is a question which ultimately
each one has to answer for himself according to his temperament and philosophy
of life, but the thoughts of a person who, like me, has found a satisfactory
solution in his own case may not be without use or interest. For, if we were
never to learn from other people’s experience we should still be and for ever
remain, savages. Well, to me, flight from the world, either with a bare bodkin
or into the forests did not occur for a moment, for there was in fact nothing
to fear, nothing to flee from. When I retired from Government service I was in
splendid health and full possession of faculties. I felt the stir in me of
ideas and interests which had long clamoured for expression, but had to yield
precedence to official duties. I had always loved my work as a Civil Servant,
and loved the world in which it lay, and my retirement left me free to work in<i>
</i>that world in the way that pleased me best. It is true there was a wrench
to start with–the parting from old comrades and familiar fields is always
painful; but this was of short duration, and I next felt the frolic freedom of
a school-boy at the commencement of a long vacation. I soon got tired of my
holiday, and knew the restiveness born of the long habit of strenuous life. The
cessation of official duties left no permanent vacuum, as their place was
gradually filled by other interests–other work, other studies. The winning of
virgin land to agriculture, the pursuit of Sanskrit and philosophy, the renewal
of acquaintance with old friends–both persons and books, and service on public
committees kept me reasonably employed. As a Government servant it had fallen
to my lot to make an intensive study of our silk industry, and it had been my
good fortune to discover what was wrong with it and help to restore it to a
vigorous health. By education a lawyer, and by occupation and training an
administrator, I had interested myself in sericulture as a hobby: and my hobby
was destined to become the principal interest of some of the most useful years
of my life. I firmly believe in the cultivation of a useful hobby, for there is
always a potentiality of service in it. My knowledge of sericulture enabled me
during the crisis of the last Great War to help in furnishing our side with
parachute silk. During the darkest period of that war I placed my services at
the disposal of Mysore as Chief Warden of the A. R. P. You will pardon me for
this mention of my own activities, which I make only to illustrate that flight
from the world is not only uncalled for, but may be running away from duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

best of life–because “youth is a fire ending in ashes, what survives is gold”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a brave faith, and to my mind the true one. Every incident natural to life
should be accepted cheerfully if we wish to be happy, and what can be more natural
than old age and death? The fire of life gradually sinks and finally goes out
from exhaustion of fuel; the ripe fruit drops through sheer maturity. The
nearness of natural death raises one above earthly fear. Solon was asked by a
blustering tyrant what made him so bold. “My age”–he answered. But while
prepared, like the chivalrous Jatayu, to sacrifice the small remainder of life
nobly, one should not quit it through weariness or frustration. “Quit not your
post till your commander allows you,” says Pythagoras, and Shakespeare warns us
that we must abide our going hence even as our coming hither.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the terrors of approaching age is the fear of the scorn of the young. The
King in “All’s Well That Ends Well” quotes the old Count Rousillon with approval
as saying, “Let me not live after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff of younger
spirits”. This fear arises from an inferiority complex. The King goes on to
say, “Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home”. But why not? He could bring
the wax of experience and the honey of wisdom!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

old age which brings itself into ridicule is the one that refuses to realise
itself and foolishly apes youth in its conduct and even its follies. No
spectacle can be more unedifying than that of an old man disgracing grey hairs
by depravity. The crown and the glory of grey hairs, says Cicero, is the
natural authority that appertains to respectable old age, to the old man who
guards himself from becoming the tool or property of others, who vindicates his
rights and independence, and maintains the dignity of his manhood. With this
end steadily in view, all previous stages of life should be lived with
attention to health, with thrift to prevent indigent dependence, with
moderation in all things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wise grammar of life should adapt itself to its successive changes. Our
ancients mapped out a scheme suitable to each stage. The kings of the Raghu
race, says Kalidasa, devoted, themselves to study as children; they enjoyed the
good things of life as young men; as they grew old they gradually divested
themselves of attachment to this world; and, finally, cast off their bodies by
Yoga.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sad earnestness and vivid exactness. Then he comes to understand how it is that

get good from your environment unless you render it back in some way. The world
is a great living entity subject to the law of balance of give and take. Happy
therefore the man who habitually builds up a credit balance for his old age, by
rendering back to the world in service more than he receives from it! What has
age to give back to the world for what it receives? Why, it can give the world
what itself is most rich in: experience, dispassionate judgement; disinterested
guidance. As fire and strength are the glory of youth, wisdom and caution are
the prerogatives of age; and youth and age wisely co-ordinated constitute the
power and the control with which the world moves safely forward to its
fulfillment. Take a well cultured family which is microcosmic of society. While
its young people are animated by the fire of life and the spirit of adventure,
its elders are full of a cold prudence which subjects all enterprises to the
test of experience; and the whole functions as one body, at once sound and
sane. It is not a mere accident that the average age of the Cabinet is greater
than that of the executive or the army. The history of the world proves that
old age does not disqualify a man for the great affairs of the world,
especially in those departments which require not corporeal strength but
prudence, coolness and foresight–qualities which grow with years. It is in
recognition of this truth, says Cicero, that the Romans called their Supreme
Council a Senate (from <i>semis, </i>old man) and the Lacedaemonians their
highest magistrates Elders. Irruptions of youthful vehemence have synchronised
with social catastrophes. As we know, the carnage of Kurukshetra came of the
disregard of the counsels of Drona, Bhishma and Vidura and the supersession of
Dhritarashtra. Some of the world’s greatest men have been at their best after
they passed the meridian of life. In our own times, old men rule the destinies
of a large part of the world, and in our own land our rulers are on, what an
imbecile idiom calls, the wrong side of sixty. Our Independence was won under
the leadership of veterans who had grown grey in the country’s service; and the
apotheosised Father of our Nation–were he not an ageless immortal–might have
been called a very old man. Perhaps the most essential function of age is to
serve as a Second or Upper Chamber in human affairs,–a wholesome curb on haste,
a house for review, revision and reconciliation. It is the supervision of the
head over the heart. When we are no longer combatants, the heat and the dust of
battle cease to distort our vision. As our Divine Teacher has warned us, man is
driven to evil in spite of himself by greed and wrath, and in the evening of a
well-lived life the mind is comparatively free from these tyrants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recommended the cultivation of whist as a prophylactic against the tedium of
old age, and some truth mingles with the cynicism of this counsel. But beyond
doubt the best provision that youth can make against this evil is the
cultivation of the reading habit, which secures to age the freedom of the
realms of gold and intimate converse with the great living and the immortal
dead. There is only one provision higher and better, and that is the habit of
reverent acceptance of God’s will, and steadfast faith in God’s Love and Mercy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

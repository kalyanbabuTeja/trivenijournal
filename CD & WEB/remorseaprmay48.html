mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was the first Deepavali after the marriage of my
neighbour’s daughter. Need there be any mention of the din and bustle on the
occasion? Even four days prior to the event the place resounded with the
bursting of crackers, and the sweet fragrance of delicious sweets came swimming
across the air. In the midst of my tiresome work I had no leisure to pay heed
to it all. But my son Raju could not keep quiet. I had noticed on one or two
occasions that he was keenly observing everything that took place in the next
house and detailing it to his sister Jaya. As I was un-familiar with the nature
of children, I condemned them and said that they were wrong in prying into a
neighbor’s doings. I considered it but just to administer such a rebuke. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Raju was always fighting with Mani, the boy next
door. As Soon as Mani’s mother bought him new shirts and other clothes, there
would ensue a misunderstanding between him and Raju. If any noise of such
quarrel reached my ears, I would shout at them. It was Jaya who would bring
about a compromise between Raju and Mani, and restore peace in the house. As I
had my work in arrears and in confusion, I was unable to pay attention to the
children and even considered children’s affairs a total nuisance. Moreover, if
they talked in glee of other people, or exercised their limited intelligence in
discussing happenings in other houses, I was read them a short lecture and tell
them that their behaviour was not proper. As a result of all this, they were
absolutely frightened of me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is now ten years since my wife died, leaving me
only these two children. Jaya is fifteen years old. She was married only last
year. My son-in-law is employed at Poona. He wrote to me that he was unable
come, as he could not get leave. As I am not particularly interested in such
matters, I was not sorry for my son-in-law’s absence. I even felt it a good
riddance. But I never imagined what Jaya’s feelings might be. I had celebrated
her marriage with the minimum of expense. Even such things as are dire
necessities in middle-class families, I determinedly stopped, and felt as happy
and proud as if I had conferred a great benefit on the community at large. If
any of my friends questioned me on this point, I would say, “All these result
from our actions alone. Do the children clamour for this or for that? It is the
elders who draw upon themselves all unnecessary worries and in the end say they
did it for the chidrens sake.” This became my habit. Not once did I stop to
think whether the children held opinions similar to my own. If any of Jaya’s
friends was talking to her about the pomp and splendor of other weddings, she
would not take a prominent part in such talks. She never let it appear that she
had grievances of her own. Perhaps she thought that such an expression might be
misunderstood by me. This was a comfort to me! I felt I had made a great
sacrifice by not marrying again after my wife’s death. How could I understand
that the lack of a mother meant an empty life to my children?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was raining in torrents the day before
Deepavali. I could not go to the club as usual and had to remain at home. I
took up the previous day’s newspaper and idly turned over the pages. As I had
never let my thoughts run in other channels than in what my vocation induced, I
was at a loss to know how I should spend my leisure hours. Just then the fact
came to my remembrance that I usually talked very little to my children. I
looked round to see where they were. They were nowhere to be seen. Jaya was
sitting alone in her room deeply immersed in some fanciful thought, her head
supported on her left arm. Seeing her, I called out loudly, “Jaya!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was bending over something on the hearth, said with a meaningful smile, “Raju?
Look into the <i>puja </i>room. He will be there,” and looked at Jaya. When I
approached the <i>puja </i>room. I heard Raju’s voice. Before I could know what
was doing there, I heard him say, “Oh God! Is it not because he has a mother

once in my mind as I wondered why he should do such a foolish thing. Silently I

just out of ignorance! Maybe he has quarreled with Mani. The things which Mani

That is why he acts so.” Thus she spoke in a manner calculated to pacify me and
at the same time taking the side of Raju.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

These last words uttered by Jaya plunged me into the depths of thought. As Soon
as Sri Rama went to the forest, Dasaratha, seized with boundless grief,
recollected a grievous crime he had committed in his early years, and died
saying to his wives that it was as a result of that crime that he had to part
with Rama. This incident from the <i>Ramayana </i>I now remembered vividly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Like every child, I too had a great yearning for play and a good feed. How I
would create chaos as Deepavali approached! One incident, particularly, did not
fail to come to my recollection. As a child, I was even more prone to get into
a temper than Raju. My parents passed away when I was very young. At home, we
children were subjected to strict discipline, my brother and sister would never
consent to condone any fault I committed. If anyone made fun of me, I would not
tolerate it, but would fret and fume. It took many days for that wound to heal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Rangu, the son of a rich advocate living opposite
to our house, was my friend. During those days, his father mother and all
others in the house treated him kindly, gave him whatever he asked for, and did
not object to his going out to play. The contrary was the rule in our house.
None would willingly allow me to go out to play. They would condemn me on some
pretext or other. Sometimes this would result in my getting jealous of Rangu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One evening after school, we boys went as usual to
the large <i>maidan </i>to play football. That day Rangu chanced to come late.
The reason was that his father had been ailing for some time; and I knew that
day his condition had worsened. Doctors were hurrying to and from his house
since the early hours of the morning. Some even doubted if there would be any
play if Rangu failed to turn up. But Rangu came a little later. Both sides took
their places on the field. We were ready for the ‘kick off’. I had the honour
of giving the first kick. If I scored a goal, I was sure of my side’s victory. Rangu
stood ready, opposite to me. Quite unexpectedly my kick sent the ball flying
above the heads of all the players and landed it into the net. It was the
signal; the players on my side shouted ‘goal! goal!’ But Rangu protested, “No,
it is not. I was not ready,” and shouted louder than the rest. He did not stop
at that. Looking at me Rangu taunted me, “Could the ball fly like this, kicked
by <i>him</i>! ‘Never!’ I could not endure it “no doubt; Rangu was a good
player. In fact I could not play as well as he could. Still, I felt as if my
heart would break in two as I thought, “When on one solitary occasion I play
well, this Rangu does not tolerate it! How often have I praised him!” As those
round me were inclined to yield, I continued to argue, “No, it is a clear goal.
No doubt about it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pacify me and said that we might end the quarrel somehow that day and continue
the game next day. But I was stubborn and said that the game could be continued
only if our success was accepted. Rangu flew into a temper. “Come along, let us
go. Who is going to play with <i>him </i>hereafter?” So saying he called away
his own players and those on my side. No one would support me. “This fellow is
always like this never stopping a, quarrel! Rangu is right. Never shall we play
with him,” they said in disgust and walked away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distance lay the ball unheeded. At the thought that I was a solitary soul in
the whole world, my heart overflowed with boundless grief. “Is it not because
Rangu has a father that everyone accepts his word,” thought I, and my shame
turned into jealousy. “Would these people shun me and leave me alone if I had a
father as Rangu has? Would Rangu himself have treated me with such contempt?
Never! Wouldn’t his condition be the same as mine if his father were to die
tomorrow!” This evil thought began to take root in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hours. Then, gradually I fell into a deep slumber. As I remained awake till
late in the night, I could not get up early. As I opened my eyes, the sound
that roused me was that of weeping in the opposite house. Getting up from my
bed, I went and looked through the window. There was a large crowd gathered at
the entrance to the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

At once, the events of the previous evening came to my recollection. “Alas!
What grievous sin have I committed! Could my evil thoughts have been the cause
of Rangu’s father’s death?” A struggle took place in my mind. A sort of nausea
came over me. My first feeling was to run to Rangu, confess my sin and beg his
forgiveness. But later, being but a little boy, I was afraid to go alone to a
house of death. All my people had gone there for condolences. Like a condemned
criminal, I struggled alone in my house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and see Rangu, and started with that intention. My mind trembled at the thought
that Rangu might cry out on seeing me. But what in fact happened was different.
He and his friends were playing on the road. The reason why he did not cry was
that he was a boy, and to boyhood all grief is evanescent. Little by little I
began to forget the worry that had overtaken me. I did not find time even to
tell him all that I thought. We pursued different paths in life, and I did not
get the chance to tell him about the suffering that I underwent that day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The rain had stopped. The dripping of the raindrops from the roof was the only

taking some money, went out. After I had gone a short distance, I remembered,
“Was it not because Mani showed Raju a new type of cracker that this calamity
overtook him? What was its name?” In the troubled state I was in, I forgot all
about it. I went back home knowing that Jaya could tell me. In her room Jaya
was sitting on her, bed, and Raju lay with his head on her lap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

How many cares and anxieties had I bequeathed to Jaya since my wife died! Could

puzzled. “Raju, look! There is the ‘Hitler cracker’ too!” she said, in wonder.

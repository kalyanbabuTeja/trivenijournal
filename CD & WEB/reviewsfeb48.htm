Iqbal he finds a rare combination of the progressive and conservative elements
in art–a revolutionary in thought with a lingering longing look on the glorious
past. Iqbal, according to the author, is a prince among poets. Josh is a true
progressive poet, in the sense that he faces realities. In his attacks on
imperialism, as well as on political and social tyranny, and in his regard for
the poor and oppressed he is second to none. Among the novelists and story
writers the author has rightly named Premchand, Krishan Chandar, Akhtar Ansari
and others who have been honoured and revered In Urdu Literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
approaches a book of this sort in a mood of jaded interest. What <i>could </i>anybody
have to say afresh about such popular heroes? “These sketches were written
(among others) in the course of a journalistic career as routine tasks,” we are
told in a short Preface. And turning to the dust-cover the familiar publisher’s
patter meets our eye, containing more information about the writer–“a writer of
distinction with a style as vivid as Robert Lynd’s and as provocative as Aldous
Huxley’s.” The writer had his early education in Ceylon, took his M. A. degree
in Allahabad, and is at present on the staff of the ‘The Times of Ceylon’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Going
through these short sketches on such well-worn themes after these stimulating
preliminaries, one must admit that one is not disappointed. The pages are full
of apt and scintillating phrases, clever paradoxes and neat epigrams. Though by
a Ceylonese author, the book contains sketches only just two Ceylonese, Ananda
Coomaraswamy, the great art-interpreter, and Bhikku Rahula, a fiery Buddhist
monk who is an impassioned advocate of Indo-Ceylonese unity. A few more would
have been very welcome, if only in the interests of greater Indo-Ceylonese
understanding. Of the fifteen other sketches, Gandhi, Nehru, Rajendra Prasad,
Sardar Patel, Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, Rajaji and Jai Prakash Narain, make up
nearly half the book. The other publicists sketched are Sir Tej Bahdur Sapru,
Sir C. P. and Sir R. K. Shanmukham Chetty. Sir S. Radhakrishnan and Jiddu Krishnamurti
are the themes of two arresting sketches. Amarnath Jha, C. K. Nayudu and </span><span

Venkatachalam are the other vignettes presented in this volume–alto</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>gether
an attractive assortment of different types of personality. There is not a dull
paragraph anywhere–no padding nor fluff–but a breezy, almost brusque,
‘hail-fellow-well-met’ manner which makes the book eminently readable from
cover to cover.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Dhanapala has caught the trick of the great sketch-writers of hitting off in a
few smart words the most marked traits of his hero. “It is a strange destiny
for a man to be exhibited for half his life as a bit torn off from the Divine
and then spend the other half denying the divinity attributed to him,” says the
author beginning his sketch of Jiddu Krishnamurti. Of Jai Prakash Narain we are
told, “He amalgamates in his person associations and atmosphere of Karl Marx,
Shivaji and the Scarlet Pimpernel.” Radhakrishnan is “a philosophical
bi-linguist who acts as the liaison officer, of Hinduism”. Sometimes Mr. Dhanapala
can be sarcastic or irreverent, as when he writes of Sir R. K. Shanmukham
Chetty, “A man may change his party once through conviction, twice through
courage. But if an ambitious man with a keen head plays leap-frog with parties
more than twice, it must be through sheer cussedness.” And writing of C. K.
Nayudu’s fame as a cricketer, the author writes, “Nayudu stands with his bat at
the wicket in lone splendour as almost the only man whom all India hailed with
full-throated ease before Europeans had time to give tongue in the praise,” or
of Nayudu’s external bearing, “An officer of the Indore Army and an A.D.C. to a
Maharaja as this high-priest of the bat really is, yet he has the outward
demeanour of a travellin</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
even a talented journalist to have entered so intimately into the traits of
such diverse personalities as are presented here is an admirable feat. But
smart writing and love of the sparkling phrase is not without its perils. In
the sketch of Gandhi, for instance, occur a few statements that are open to
challenge. “Yet this mystic spinner is a queer mixture of epic poetry and stump
oratory, the prophet at his boldest and the politician at his funniest.” (P.
3). Gandhiji was innocent of oratory, stump or otherwise, and those who had
occasion to deal with Gandhi the politician found him far from funny. Again,
Gandhiji is reported to have said, “If we Indians could only spit in unison we
could form a puddle big enough to drown three hundred thousand Englishmen.” (P.
17). One has heard of this apocryphal statement before, but Gandhiji is not its
author nor could he have repeated anything so morbid and nauseating! “Yet a
general melancholia pervades the inner nature of Gandhi,” (P. 18) is an
assertion that shows the bright writer entirely off his rails–or of Rajendra
Prasad that he is ‘undersized’!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a collection of the addresses and speeches delivered by the author on
various occasions from 1931, when he was a student at Oxford, to 1945. Mr.
Humayun Kabir has the distinction of being eminent not only in the field of
letters but also in politics and public life. He has, besides, guided the
student movement in his own Province of Bengal and elsewhere and has been an
active trade-unionist. He has a flair for English expression, and a
parliamentary manner, characterised by a suavity and sweet reasonableness
reminiscent of the spacious days of Gokhale and Sastri of a past generation,–a
combination of gifts getting somewhat out of vogue in present-day India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this volume are collected together twenty-one speeches and addresses, four
delivered before the Oxford Union dealing with contemporary British politics
from the standpoint of an Indian nationalist, four presidential addresses
delivered to Students’ Conferences, and one addressed to a Teachers’
Conference, two Radio talks, and the rest, ten speeches delivered in the Bengal
Legislative Council. The author is a well-known nationalist, a believer in
Socialism, and has been among the doughty fighters for the political and
economic independence of our country. Above all, he has been a firm believer in
the integral culture of our Motherland and has spoken and written eloquently of
the fundamental unity of India and of our cultural heritage. Though topical and
often treating of matters which appear to be of ephemeral, interest, the
addresses repay perusal, if only for their charm of expression and the high level
at which the arguments are presented. As the author points out in his brief
Preface, many of the problems dealt with in them still baffle us and await
solution. Some of the addresses, however, like ‘Literature of the Machine Age’
dealing with some modern English Poets, and ‘Education and Nationalism’ are of
more enduring value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>‘Fancy Tales’ is a collection of fourteen short
stories, of which about seven are reminiscent of South Indian folklore and the
rest are creations of Mr. Isvaran’s peculiar twilight fantasy. The folk tales
are clothed in attractive raiment, and sometimes even in heavy embroidery. The
story of the ‘Stolen Jack Fruit’, as here narrated, has lost some of its native
humour, because, in the village version the imprisoned priest eats the entire
fruit, all by himself, whereas Mr. Isvaran allows the policeman surreptitiously
to share the fruit, and reduce the glory. The author is at his best in tales
like ‘The Deepavali of a Princess’, ‘The Rainbow’, ‘Mukta’, and ‘The Cop and
the Angels’. The uniform perfume of these blossoms lingers long in the
atmosphere of the mind, mainly due to the picturesque style adopted by the
author in delineating the moods of Nature. One has to complain, however, that
the phrase, “impudent like the worm that turns under the eclipse” can hardly be
intelligible to many readers who do not know the South Indian story of the
snobbish earthworm which raised its head and claimed kinship with Rahu, the
Dragon, just when the latter was engaged in swallowing the Moon!</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rikshawallah’
is a collection of ten stories. The title-piece takes up a third of the book.
It is a great story, told artistically and with genuine </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>feeling
and sympathy. “Deep in the bottom-lands of his mind, the past reared its head
and egged him on to definite action.” Mr. Isvaran, with </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>his
keen observation and kindly understanding, has plumbed those bottom- lands and
described that action which brought about the poor fellow’s death. ‘The
Toilette’ is a story which basks in the sunshine of humour. The scene is laid
in a third-class compartment of the Calcutta Mail and the author watches the
scene from his vantage point on the upper plank. She, “the second young wife,
smart, charmingly forward,” and, on the opposite bench, he “who saw no
difference between her and a well-masticated chew of betel and nuts”! ‘Visit of
an Immortal’ deals with a worn-out theme, handled by Mr. Isvaran, too, in the
traditional style. ‘The Thoughtless Donkey’ could well have gone into the
volume of ‘Fancy Tales’ since it shares the childlike pomposity of stories in
that collection and has no kinship with its neighbours in this book. ‘Passage
Money’, too, is below par. The story revolves around the two meanings of the
native idiom, “she is a little girl”, one chronological and the other
physiological, which have not been made clear. Of the others, ‘The Gap in the
Wall’, ‘The Dance of Siva’, ‘The Death of a Doll’, and ‘Posthumous Award’, the
two latter are eminently satisfying. Subedar Ratnaswami’s spirit hovers over
the ceremony where his widow accepts the V. C. on his behalf, and whispers to
itself, looking at the tiny girl his wife carries on her hip, “You are favoured
of the gods, for you are a female, and you will not have to enlist as a soldier
in the event of another World War.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mr. Isvaran’s stories ‘move to pity and mould the
understanding’, to quote his own words while appreciating the writings of two
of his friends. While announcing his book on the flap, his publishers claim, “In
the handling of the short story, as pure literary form, Mr. Isvaran is both
artist and artisan.” It may not, therefore, be out of place to plead that Mr.
Isvaran may give us less of the artisan and be the artist, more of the time.
His artisanship and ‘technical skill’ cloud the sincerity of his style by the
tinge of artificiality. With his large compassion and energetic vision, he can
well afford to shed his occasional partiality for the strange and the garish in
style and vocabulary.</p>

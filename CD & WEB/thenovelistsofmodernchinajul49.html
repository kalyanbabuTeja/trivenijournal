Chinese soul is rooted in her soil, and it is this love of the soil that
explains her writers’ loyalty and gives to all their writings an aroma
distinctly Chinese. Their ideals and dreams Soar high and are often tenuous in
their pathos, but its real affiliation is with the world of daily life, of the
earth earthy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Chinese stories and novels have developed from their traditional folk-tales,
which are an unending source of fresh inspiration to her writers. An
introduction to China’s old and classical literature is necessary before we can
understand her modern writers, who have received shocks of diverse influences
other than traditional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>First
about language. Two types of language have been used all through the literature
of China; <i>Wen-li</i>, or the Written Language, and <i>Pai-hua</i>, or the
Spoken Language. Most of the traditional writers of China have written in
Wen-li. This language was quite unintelligible to the common reader and the
literature was thus confined amongst the learned and scholars. Although novels
in Pai-hua were written as far back as T’ang (618-907 A.D.) and Sung (960-1126
A.D.) dynasties, they were insignificant in comparison with their traditional
Wen-Ii literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chinese
stories and novels originate from the traditional folk-tales and folk-lores.
Such a traditional book is ‘San Kuo Chi’ or ‘Stories of the Three Kingdoms’.
What are these Three Kingdoms? With the end of the Han Dynasty (200 B.C.-221
A.D.) the country was, due to wars, divided in three parts between three
war-lords. Wei became the king of the North, Shu of West and South-West, Wu of
East and South-East. Wei established the Tsin Dynasty by defeating the other
two war-lords, and this dynasty ruled over China till 420 A.D. The period the
book ‘San”Kuo Chi’ deals with is the 3rd century A.D. Although it was written
in pure Wen-Ii, the novels which originated from it were written in Pai-hua,
and the name of the collection of these novels is ‘San Kuo Chi Yen I’, published
at the end of Yuan rule (1206-1368). Another well-known book of Old China is
‘Shui Hu Chunan’ or ‘All Men are Brothers’, using 13th century China as its
background. This book has hundred and eight characters–men who are bandits in
the eye of law and enemies of the government. This group of rebels resort to
the hilly tracts of Shantung, being unable to bear the tyranny of law and the
barbarity of society. They have been described as fighting against the wrongs
and evils of society, and helping the poor and the distressed, and bear some
resemblance to Robin Hood of England. Even today the Lian-shan-fo region of
Shantung is known after the name of this gang of robbers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Novels
in Pai-hua or the spoken Chinese began to grow in number during the Mings
(1366-1644) and the Ch’ings (1644-1911). The most remarkable novel of the Ming
Dynasty is ‘Chin Fing Mei’–translated into English under the title ‘Golden
Lotus’. The plot of the book centres round Chin, Fing and Mei–the three
concubines of a rich man. The language of the book was regarded as obscene and
it was banned for younger people. But it is much more strange that the obscene
portions in the English version have been put into Latin!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most popular Ch’ing Dynasty novel is ‘Hung Lo Meng,’–which has its title ‘The
Dream of the Red Chamber’ in its English translation. This was written in
Mandarin–the state language of Peking (Peip’ing). lt is a love story which ends
in a tragedy. The heroine did not marry the lover and died of pthisis. The main
plot deals with the episode of a pair of lovers who were cousins, and there are
a few sub-plots of romantic love. The book consists of long portions giving
detailed descriptions of houses and gardens and elaborate family-histories. The
book has provided themes for many dramas and plays written out of its many
episodes. There was much controversy over the author of this great work, but it
is now believed to be written by one Chao Hsien-chin, who did not want to
reveal his identity, possibly out of doubt and fear lest a novel written in
Pai-hua be disliked by the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gradually lost its unique position and became the constant source and subject
of criticism by the end of the Ch’ing rule and the establishment of the Chinese
Republic. This was a revolution which has made China shake off so much of its
old tradition. Students went overseas for higher studies and with their return
home they spread the dangerous ideas of individualism, women’s education, etc.
And then they began criticising minutely all the Confucian ideals. By 1917, the
literary renaissance took a definite shape and Wen-li was replaced by the
outcast Pai-hua. The May Fourth Movement of 1919 had considerable influence
upon Chinese life, though mainly for political reasons. This movement attempted
to shake off the lethargy that followed the success of the Revolution. The note
of this new literature was marked in 1917 in the literary theories of Dr. Hu
Shih. When he told that the language of China’s literature should be Pai-hua
instead of Wen-li, the innovators began to look at the modern age and its
problems as completely different from those of the old times. A new style, a
new angle of vision and a new technique were felt necessary. But the pundits
maintained the legacy of the language as their own by binding it with so many
rhetorical and grammatical rules. It was not an easy task to break through that
legacy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Hu Shih was not alone in this task. Dr. Tsai Yuan-Pei, Chancellor of the Peking
University, helped him. This group of young reformers were described as
‘obscene’, loose-characters, haggards. The traditionalists charged them with
having sold themselves to Western ideals, that they are destroyers of Chinese
culture and tradition. But most of these charges have proved to be untrue. It
is nevertheless true that the modern Chinese novel owes its existence to the
impact and influence of western literature. In the attempt to introduce a new
attitude and a new style, Chinese literature appeared almost new in its ideas,
language, technique and subject-matter, as it has declared war against all that
is old and traditional. A great urge was felt throughout the country to pull
down the walls of the Confucian ideals of morality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
beginning of this renaissance, however, did not mark any brilliant future. Hu
Shih’s poems in Pai-hua were somewhat experimental. But gradually, through the
untiring enthusiasm of Hu Shih, Tsai Yuan-Pei, Ch’en Tu-Hsin, Ch’ien
Hsuang-t’ung and others, Pai-hua began to monopolize the world of literature,
even in books on science and philosophy. A change in grammar was also noticed
by the end of the first and the beginning of the second World War. Innumerable
European words also gained currency in the Chinese language. And such
adaptations of European grammatical systems made translations from western
literature an easy task, and the influence of western technique, style and
subject-matter counted for much in the literature of Modern China. The
revolutionary ideals of Young Russia were felt in the very beginning of modern
Chinese novels. As a result, we find the writers attaching more importance to
the subject-matter than the treatment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
important publication in modern Chinese literature is the collection of short
stories by Lu Hsun (1918). Lu Hsun himself said of this </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>book
that he tried to point out the disastrous consequences of adhering to the
traditional Chinese family system and the so-called rules of morality. This has
been the tone of all writers of China of that period. Lu Hsun’s life itself was
a revolt against the social customs and traditions that then prevailed in
China. An interested reader will mark the profound note of love in every human
being he depicts, even in very queer and impossible characters. He toiled much
in completing the work. His room in Peip’ing used to be flooded with pieces of
paper in which he recorded any idea that came to him, and he would build out of
these broken pieces a good story just like a good builder. Lu Hsun, while
studying Medicine in Japan, saw a picture of the execution of a Chinese secret
reporter. This brought a change in his life and he realised that China needed
mental medicine much more than physical treatment. His future rival Kuo Mo-Jo
also, like him, was a medical student in Japan, and also realised the futility
of studying human physiology rather than human psychology. Both of them treated
literature as a great and sacred task, as if they had been entrusted on behalf
of China, with this difficult and very important job for the benefit of
humanity. This gives a moral grandeur to their work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
intellect of Kuo Mo-Jo was all-embracing. Lu Hsun created a literary circle
called Literary Research Society. Kuo Mo-Jo also, with Yu Ta-Fu, Chang
Tsi-Fing, Th’ien Han and Chen Fang-wu, formed a group in 1922 called
Creationist Society. They never admitted compromise between literature and
morality. They said that literature deals </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>only with beauty, and
this creation of beauty is morality. Kuo Mo-Jo had a bold style. But Yu Ta-Fu
wrote rather touchingly. He also, like </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lu Hsun, wanted the
old traditions to die out. Lu Hsun wanted art to help social reform; but Yu
Ta-Fu and his friends dealt directly with art avoiding the problem of reform.
To the former, reform was the ultimate object and literature its means; to the
latter, art was the only important thing in literature, and reform, if
necessary, was to be a by-product.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
such movements, one of which aspired for “art for art’s sake,” and the other
wanted art or literature to be indirectly the means of social reform, actually
were not separated from one another. There was some link between them, some
sort of bridge. The writings of Hsi Che-Tsun supply an example of this. He was
neither a romantic nor a reformer; he was also first to employ Freudian
psychology in novels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Time
took its usual course in ending these movements, and gradually political
movements overwhelmed all else. Between Dr. Sun Yat-Sen’s death in 1924 and the
success of the second revolution in 1927, a new sign was marked in the fact
that the writers, who generally avoided political or social movements,
obviously got themselves entangled directly in such movements. This literature,
born only about thirty years ago, received another blow within ten years of its
existence. This infant literature, born during war, has been continuing its existence
through wars, one war after another. This uneasiness of this particular period
is marked in the novels of Mao Tun. He maintained that one should be neither
sentimental over the past, nor too hopeful over the future. So we get in his
writings a balanced scanning of the present, a good and creditable attempt
towards diagnosis of facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Th’ien- Yi, a powerful writer from Honan, who uses the life of peasants as his
subject-matter, was also influenced by Lu Hsun in the sense that all
ultra-modern stories, with language cruelly unmasked, owe their origin to him.
Chang Th’ien-Yi was also famous as a satirist, but his real merit seems to be
in assembling his plot from the earth of China. He had the rare quality of
depicting revenge, with sympathy. I may mention here of one of his stories,
‘The Breasts of a Girl’, in which a married woman, not satisfied with the cold
attitude of love from her husband, joins her lover and even bears a child to
him. She is, on the one hand, punished by the clan leader, and is also sought
to be seduced by the same. She finally succeeds in taking revenge on this old
man and on society, and re-joins her lover. The story reveals insight into the
minutest matters and an attitude of sympathy towards all the characters. Chang Th’ien-Yi
once wrote that in the human organism there is one nerve which has not been
discovered by any physiologist, and that is the nerve of Contradiction and
Inconsistency. He may not be an all-round artist like Lu Hsun or Kuo Mo-Jo, yet
he seems to have discovered that nerve much more successfully than others. His
writings vibrate with the earthbound life of China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

entirely new trend came into Chinese literature in 1931, with the Japanese
invasion of Manchuria. It turned towards nationalism as its inspiration. The
spirit of revolt, with which Lu Hsun was born, matured. It was Hsiao Chun who
first wrote stories instigating the Chinese </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>directly against the
enemy. The young group of writers who followed suit, wrote against the
aggressive war-mongers and instigated the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chinese to save their
ancestral abode from these enemy hordes. But in doing so, the literature of
this period lost its significant approach and be</span><span style='font-size:

circumscribed. Awakening the nation was the major object in view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seriously of the present system of government, society and aspects of life, and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>literary
renaissance down to the second World War, China has not produced many good
books. This renaissance and the war came in such quick succession that all the
stories and novels have obviously and unhesitatingly been dealing with war and
inspired by war. This literature has a local importance rather than a permanent
value. Yet we have many writers who have crossed the bar of the period and have
been eternal artists. They are gifted writers like Lu Hsun, Kuo Mo-Jo, Lao She
(one of whose famous books is ‘Rikshaw Boy’), etc. Another great writer is Shen
Yen-Ping, alias Mao Tun. His novels and stories alike have earned fame, e.g.,
‘Eclipse’ (1927), ‘The Rainbow’ (1929), and ‘Twilight’ (1933).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the second World War, attempts were made to write in the common language in
which a man in the street talks, instead of adapting </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
style and technique of the West. This happens quite naturally during wars. The
writers from different provinces, deprived of their hearth and home, and
joining the army, naturally come in contact with the common folk. Some are
forced to leave the cities and live in their village homes. As a result of
this, the writers, who had so long ignored the existence of the poor and the
forgotten, now came in close contact with them and were attracted by the mode
of their living, their individuality perseverance, patience and other
qualities. They realised that these people–who form the majority of
population–are actually bearing the brunt of the war, but are being ignored by
the small group of persons at the helm of the country. The literature thus
became healthy by this link with the common people, and a real novelty crept
in. The language which was being influenced by western modes was now completely
rid of this influence and became that which is true Chinese. The language now
was really a universal one,–which could be understood by all,–and became alive

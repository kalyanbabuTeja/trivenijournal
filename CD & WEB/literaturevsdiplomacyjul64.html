used to wonder why people would be annoyed with me–not the workaday man, but
the man-in-power–and I believe I know the answer. As a literary man I could not
help speaking the truth–and the whole truth–not <span class=SpellE>realising</span>
that it does not pay to speak the truth. And I am reminded of Francis Bacon’s
famous essay on Truth beginning with: “What is Truth?” asked Jesting Pilate and
would not wait for an answer! And, come to think of Pilate. He cared two straws
for Christ and let <span class=SpellE>Barabas</span> be free! And this is what
is being done everyday and it pains me that this should be done with such
regularity as to make truth-speaking synonymous with lunacy in our country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Orwell knew the joy of Truth which makes men free his <i>Outspoken Essays </i>(I
am sorry the publishers have called them <i>Collected Essays</i>)<i> </i>are
worth reading in the paper cover backs recently brought out by Mercury Books, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>. Orwell has
written a novel called <i>1984</i> and though he is dead I believe he is far
more alive than some of our writers who are playing tricks with the noble
profession of writing, to the extent of letting politicians have <span
class=GramE>their</span> own way and not raising their pens in protest. The P.
E. N. to which I belong has for its creed to speak the truth and fight for it
and I am happy to belong to the group of people who love to use their voices as
much as their pens for the glory of God and Man. Coming again to Orwell, you’ve
got to read his novel <i>Burmese Days </i>to know how the English people or
Europeans can so deform themselves as to be regular tyrants in the lands where
British or Foreign Rule existed. One has to go abroad and see the people for
what they are instead of making <span class=SpellE>generalisations</span> on
the poor imported rats that we have seen and may be are yet seeing! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

man who has uttered a great many truths both at home and abroad is that genius
Bertrand Russell and though I have not met him I feel I love him as I love very
few. He has gone through hell for his outspoken views (please read his <i>Outspoken

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Essays) </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and even now he has
had the misfortune to go counter to public or Government opinion in his
country. I remember seeing his photograph and his wife’s on their way to the
Lock-up because of his sit-down strikes in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>. Bertrand Russell is a pleasant Lloyd
George; and you’ve got to see the photographs of the two men together to see
that they resemble each other, with this difference: Russell is pleasant,
charming, genial and he has eyes open; as for George, well, you can see him for
yourself: you know he is a politician all right. In this <span class=SpellE>connexion</span>
I remember telling my students when I was taking them in the English classes
with <i>Pioneers of the Modern World. </i>I referred my students to the
photographs of each of the pioneers, beginning with Napoleon, and having such
varied figures as Garibaldi, Madame Curie, Louis Pasteur; and by the look in
their eyes you could see who was a man or woman of the world and who the man of
the next world: the man of the world looked a ferocious lion and he had to look
ferocious or no one would have cowed down to him; the man of the next world
looked mild, genial and no one who came to them ever went away sad or dismayed.
And yet, we see the uses of these two types in the world of Matter and Spirit! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have known engineers and men of science who have craved for the wealth of
literature; and we have examples of men of science and engineering who have
taken to the ways of literature because they felt free and saw in <span
class=GramE>themselves</span> the wealth of the Eternal. Their discovery of literature
could be likened to the discovery of Chapman’s Homer by Johnny Keats. There are
others who kick against the good things of literature and life and they can be
compared to Saul of Tarsus. He was a man who saw the idiocy of the things of
the spirit and believed in the here and the now. He poked fun at Christianity,
seeing it as the religion of the idiots–but then there came a day when he was
transformed, resurrected as King <span class=SpellE>Asoka</span> was, and
followed the things of the Spirit. All great and lasting memories are those of
people who believed in the Truth and fought for it tooth and nail–and whether
we call them <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>,
Gandhi or Kennedy makes no difference because they belong to the Greats. It is
only the small <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>frys</span></span> who make
a noise and leave behind a stench and they remind us of disease that is beat
eased by death. Longfellow’s <i>Psalm of life </i>reminds us of the really
great and we see ourselves as all great by the power of the God Who made us </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
all things on earth and in heaven. But it is given to a few to rise above the
din of environment and find release and greatness–and we are reminded of the
unknown <span class=SpellE>Miltons</span> and <span class=SpellE>Hampdens</span>
who live and die <span class=SpellE>unhonoured</span>, thanks to the people
around who are taken in with the superficial things of life and prefer the pomp
and glitter of life, to the great and silent things of the spirit. Great men
and women heed no advertisement but small men and women do; and we have a good
deal of these small <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>frys</span></span>
making eloquent speeches and discoveries on nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the man who had <span class=SpellE>fervour</span>
and the conviction of his heart to speak the truth was John Bright who spoke of
the mockery that people made of Christianity by flocking by the thousands to
Churches on Sundays and left the world a desecrated place. And what are our
temples and mosques and Churches here but the same: a huge mockery! And we see
instances of this mockery in all walks of life, prompted as the people-in-power
are by modernism, torn between <span class=SpellE>mediaevelism</span> and
industrialisation! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

would have thought that with education things would pave the way to a Bright
New World, but it is in the field of education that we see the greatest number
of rats! And these rats do all they can to stay the progress of education or
enlightenment by methods only known to people of devious means. Some call them <span
class=SpellE>Machiaevelis</span>–and it is a pity that such men are being
elevated to positions of <span class=SpellE>honour</span> when they are doing
all they can to crush the power of man as man and reduce him to abject
servitude. There was a time when people treated others as slaves on questions
of <span class=SpellE>colour</span> or creed, but today we are beginning to
have a subtle form of slavery even among our people and we invoke the past for
the continuation of slaves or slavery in one form or another. I have seen in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> a form of education which I believe is
no good–and when I wrote Lord Russell about the education in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> and how
I was <span class=SpellE>victimised</span> for doing my duty as a teacher the
reply of Lord Russell was a God-send. It showed me that <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
and broadmindedness go together and that it is futile to want someone to be
great or understanding when he is a dim-wit. But, alas, the standard of the
rich is often the standard of Money! And when Money is known to buy anything,
including humans who seem to have a price-tag, so to speak, on their necks, the
standards of the rich people (Matthew Arnold called them Philistines, seekers
of Mammon as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>they were) are beginning to gain in currency;
and we see this in the policy of education as adopted by different people the
world over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

be said of the drawbacks of Britain in education, there is no denying the
people, including the rulers, a love for the country and traditions and
naturally we see Britain progressing and democracy a safe thing in their hands.
Where there is a dignity of the human spirit and in <span class=SpellE>labour</span>

But then what is to be done when <span class=SpellE>Godses</span> are in the

countries teachers are taken to task or reduced to ashes. A good teacher
believes in doing his job: of elevating those who come to him and, truth-speaking

Ancients, and sees our progress through the lessons of History believes–in
Values–in the Sanctity of Truth and in the Human Personality; and his chapter
“Tradition and the Individual Talent” is a landmark in literary and cultural
criticism. And T. S. Eliot, like Lord Russell, won the Nobel Prize<i> </i>for
his contri­bution to humanity–and can we not, in this ancient land of ours, of <span

steep and where humans are divided by seas and lands of prejudices and <span

one language when we do not believe in the oneness of humanity? There is, thus,
a constant tug-of-war between litterateurs and politicians, between the
enlightened folk and the men of darkness and when the two clash, as they are
bound to do, there is the hope that good will triumph and the evil will come to
roost; and talking of hope brings to mind the hopeless lot that politicians

eradication–Ignorance, Disease, Anti-Social Elements, Poverty–and we need to
put our heads together and fight these. The nations of Asia, as much as Africa
and Europe, have their problems, but then the more international-minded we are

volume contains the author’s research results in a very exhaustive voyage on
the ocean of the Mahabharata, which teems naturally with every type of
information that a modern mind tries to bring to light in order to prove the
advanced stage of civilization of ancient India. The adage that “Whatever is
not here, cannot be found anywhere else” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Yennehasti
na kutra chit</i>)<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>pertaining to the
Mahabharata, will be evident to a reader of this volume, which however deals
only with the political ideas and institutions in the epic. No doubt from the
very developed state of administrative conditions and political consciousness
elaborately described here, one can certainly guage how much equally fully
developed should have been the state of other branches of life during the
period when the great epic was composed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

will be difficult in a short review to pointedly refer to the many aspects of
administration such as council of ministers, civil service, judiciary, revenue
system, army, diplomacy, interrelations between States, etc., though it is
necessary to indicate the satisfactory knowledge which the author vouchsafes us
in illustrating his points by referring to exact details of the epic’s versions
upon them. For instance, dealing with capital punishment, the pros and cons of
the underlying principle in such a punishment, is being argued between two
persons which clearly indicates how much our ancients were exercised in mind
about the value of imposing a punishment on criminals that would be deterrent
or otherwise. Again, in the chapter on taxes one finds how useful the basis of
taxation had been divined and the procedure adopted for collection of taxes.
The tax imposition, according to the epic, must be gradual when enhanced and
the analogy referred to is that just as a bee gathers honey from flowers
without harming further the flower and as the cow gets milked without further
depriving it of its portion to its calf, so should the king or authority collect
taxes without completely fleecing the assessee of his possessions. Emergencies

extra to the assessee after the situation in the country had returned to normalcy.

of public activity and governmental administration, but space allowed limits
further comments of the kind in a short review. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a compilation of excerpts from the speeches of the Presidents of the Indian National
Congress from the time of its first sessions in 1885. Starting with Womesh
Chandra Bonnerji it ends with D. K. Barooah. It wilt be interesting to note how
from the beginning of our national struggle for freedom–however today we may
deem our predecessors to have been only bold in language and not in actual work–we
cannot escape a feeling of the prodigious labours they had undertaken to study
the many problems facing the country under a foreign rule and their methods for
finding solutions to them. The speeches are not always fully given here; only
portions found to be useful are selected. Even in the selection, it passes our
comprehension why speeches of eminent Presidents like Sir C. Sankaran Nair,
Salem Vijayaraghavachariar and S. Srinivasa Aiyengar find no place here, when
some others of less importance, from the point of view of the constructive
nature of their ideas to the advancement of an economically developing nation,
have gained favour with the selecting committee. Anyhow the volume can present
to an earnest student of the history of the Congress in what ways from our
early fighters we had tried to reason out gradually the need for a drastic
change over from long established principles in government to times of our own
with different ideologies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

September, 1975, Dr D. C. Sircar, a very eminent epigraphist of India, declared
that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mahabharata </i>was a myth of
very little historicity and was simply a war song of a “petty family or tribal
feud” around which the legendry epic developed later. This view was based on
the fact that the Vedic literature makes no mention of the Mahabharata battle,
and Kurukshetra does not figure in it as a battlefield. This categorical
statement of a historian and an epigraphist of the eminence of Dr D. C. Sircar
had led to an examination of this problem in depth by various scholars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Archaeologically
speaking Dr B. B. Lal, retired Director-General of Archaeology, basing himself on
his very skilful and well-documented excavations at Hastinapura and other
places connected with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mahabharata </i>stated
that the most likely pottery connected with the Mahabharata era is the painted
gray ware. His excavations also revealed that the flooding of Hastinapura by
the Ganga was a fact. In fact material was even recovered from the river bed
which proved beyond all doubt that the traditional view of the shift of the
capital from Hastinapura to Kausambi after a flood in the Ganga was factually
true. The similarity in broad features of the P. G. Ware between Hastinapura
and Kausambi supported this. On a full examination of the problem Dr B. B. Lal suggested
9th century B. C. for the Mahabharata. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are in vougue several extremely divergent views about the date of Mahabharata

author who is a distinguished astronomer and indologist himself, has examined
the problem afresh from the astronomical point of view. He has collected
astronomical data like Krishna’s attempt at reconciliation took place which at
the Revati Nakshatra while the talks broke down on Krishnashtami, and the moon
was at Sravana on the 18th or the closing day of the battle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
most reliable astronomical evidence, according to the author, is the death of
Bhishma just after Uttarayana because once the point of the solstice in the
Nakshatra circle is known, an epoch could be computed by taking the rate of
precession at 72 years per degree. Since Bhishma fell on the tenth day of the
battle, i.e., Margasira Krishna Navami or Dasami, and since Bhishma lived for
58 nights on a bed of arrows, and since Bhishma said that the Uttarayana ought
to be Magha Sukla Tritiya, though actually it was the 8th day of the dark
fortnight (from which the author concludes that the verse is quite genuine
being a well-known Vyasa Kuta verse), the author calculates that these astronomical
data and others given in his book lead to the positive conclusion that the date
of the Mahabharata is between 1400 to 1300 B. C. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an impartial observer, it must be evident that the brackets fixed for the Vedic
literature by Max Mueller, for the first time, are completely arbitrary. In
fact Max Mueller himself admitted is much at a later stage. It is an
unfortunate fact that Indian historians have never been able to fully rid
themselves of the various Anglo-Saxon pet theories and aversions, built in the
19<sup>th</sup> century, suggesting highly arbitrary dates for various
traditional events of our country. For the first time the present author hag tried
to correlate archaeological, historical, astronomical and traditional evidences
and to evolve a new pattern for this unknown ancient Indian chronology, that could
stand any critical test. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pieces garnered from the harvest of half a century of writing and
public-speaking. The earliest talk, given in 1916, pleads that Kannada (or whatever
be the regional language) should receive the first importance in any scheme of
education. English has its uses, and may be indispensable, but it would be
clearly suicidal to our culture to cultivate it at the expense of the
mother-tongue or the regional language. Of the 17 other pieces included in the
collection, some are commemorative tributes, like those on Rammohan Roy, Sir M.
Visvesvarayya, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore. There are, in fact,
two tributes to Sir Mokshagundam, one at the time of his birth centenary and
the other on the conferment of the “Bharat Ratna” title on him. Again, Tagore
is the subject of three pieces–one a personal reminiscence recalling a visit in

seasoned centenary tribute delivered in the Gujarat University; and the third a

and audition are the most sensitive sensations of all the others. Form and
sound belong to these sensations perceived by the eye and the ear respectively.
Form is generally deemed to be devoid of sound, and sound devoid of form. But
the investigations made into vision and audition, by the psychologists and
parapsychologists, have revealed that the visual form has not only the form but
also the sound while the auditory sound contains the form too. Thus every form has
the auditory aspect too in the same way as every sound has the visual aspect
too. Hence it is proved scientifically that form could be heard in the same way
as sound could be seen. In this sense, music is not merely audible but also
visible, while painting is not merely visible but also audible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

present volume “Music Forms” is an attempt to show the music in paintings. The
author Geoffrey Hodson is a student of Theosophy and occultism and thus he is
interested in the superphysical world and its reactions to music and its
vibrations causing various forms and colours in the matter of the superphysical
world, which is not an utopian world but a world built of finer matter than
that with which our physical world is made. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a certain musical note is either vocally sung or played on an instrument, its

Sculpture of Vibrations” originally appeared in the “UNESCO Courier” written by
Dr Hans Jenny. Dr Jenny’s illustrated essay is very profound and touches many
an invisible horizon of the psychical vibrations. His attempts prove that the
vibrations caused by music world not only create forms in the superphysical world
but also do in the physical world that belongs to vision, audition, smell,
taste and touch. Even what we call the invisible is not in fact invisible at
all; the invisible world is the microcosmic replica of the macrocosmic world
which we call the visible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author, Geoffrey Hodson, claims to have discovered the musical forms by dint of
his clairvoyance. He states, “in the course of his evolution, man develops
physically, culturally, intellectually and spiritually. His body grows in
capacity to express the results of evolutionary progress and develops one sense
another. How far, then, man has travelled up to now? What powers do we already
possess? Let me briefly review our position up to the present time. We have
reached self-conscious awareness physically, emotionally and mentally; for we
can truthfully say, ‘I act, I feel, I think.’ We also have developed the five
senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell. The present time is of
especial interest, because the sixth sense (ESP) is just now beginning to show
itself to a marked degree. This new, sixth sense, consists of clairvoyance,
telepathy, pre-cognition or correct premonitions, metaphysical states of
awareness and other psychic faculties.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the matter discussed in this volume belongs to Western music and thus those,
who are not familiar with the Western music, fail to understand both the text
and the illustrations with ease. For instance, the author writes on “Prelude in
C Sharp Minor–Bach” as follows, “The minor key always tends to produce a
drooping form in contradiction to the major with its upraised, turreted
tendencies. In addition, we have the theme itself as well as the various
melodies of the composition repetitions of the theme, all of which move
downward. Indeed the only ascending melodies are episodical materials, not
derived note by note from the commenting theme. Thus from the very nature of
the music we are led to expect a drooping form.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

above quotation from this volume is hardly intelligible to the lay reader who
is unacquainted with Western music. Yet, one would never fail to enjoy, if not
appreciate, the splendid colour plates as sheer visual enchantment. Colour is
visual music and thus we view the music in the rich colour plates.
Parapsychology, occultism, esoteric sciences, etc., would lead the psyche of
modern man from the physical to the metaphysical, from the mundane to the
supra-mundane, and from the audible music to the visible music which manifests
itself in rhythmic form and radiant colour. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

central concept of Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy is the emergence of the superman,
who transforms all dross material existence into divine illumination. Human
existence and life on earth and man’s sojourn here have been looked upon with
no significance by the theistic and the absolutistic vedantins. Advaita Vedanta
looks upon this world as illusory and unreal, enveloped by Maya, which is
sublated by Brahman realisation. It has no permanent value. It is neither real
nor unreal nor a mixture of them. It is indescribable in terms of the real and
the unreal. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sadasattvaabkyam anirvacyam. </i>The
theistic vedantins ascribe to the world of reality a temporary value in which
we should not rest permanently and from which we must leave to attain
unexcellable bliss. On either account, the world of reality is a disvalue. Sri
Aurobindo repudiates this view and holds that when the individual soul
surrenders itself joyously without any reservations, consciously to the
supermind, it prepares the ground for the descent of supermind. As long as the
individual mind functions in its ego-predicament, the descent is not possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mathai paints a rather bleak picture of the emerging culture as one of violence
and rigid confrontations with authority. Even the centres of learning have
become a fen off murderous waters. Rev. Pallikunnen analyses in detail the contribution

that revel in Goebbelsian propaganda. C. P. Menon studies the effect of
scientific inventions on cultural attitudes. For example, the automobile creates
a new culture made up of ownership prestige, automobile cultism, speed mania, increased
respiratory ailments, etc., including “changes in the pattern of courtship”.
Having thus limned the field of inquiry, the other seminarians search for a
spiritual identity to transform the new culture into a meaningful endeavour.

aesthetic theory can ignore his thought; it is part of the atmosphere in which the
classical mimesis and rhetorical affectivity cannot retain their very form and
pressure. Of course he has not won the assent of writers and critics to the
monism of Intuition-expression: there are no institutions without expressions.
This means that all talk of mute inglorious Miltons is all bunk. This monism
does not help us to distinguish between two intuitions. A newspaper clipping is
not inferior to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>King Lear. </i>This
monism regards the world of poetry as a self-created world, Mimesis has no
place in it; the poet does not imitate beauty external to himself. Perfect
intuition is beauty and any flaw in it is ugliness. This monism delivers the
most devastating blow to genres, figures of speech and rules, Monism cannot
approve of fragmentation of intuition, listing of figures of speech, of rules
and translation, of form and content. There is no single rule that has not been
subverted by some writer or other. It may be of some interest to Indian readers
to know that the exhaustive and exhausting analyses and categories of character
and plot, etc., in Sanskrit poetics get short shrift at the hands of Croce.
Shakespeare is the great In Spite Of. But this leads to theoretical paralysis.
If we accept Croce’s philosophy of intuition, art and criticism of art may disappear
like the grin of the Cheshire cat. There is no light here for the ordinary
business of criticism. Ultimately Croce’s Plotinian neo-idealism leads
dangerously to Poe’s doctrine that a long poem is a series of short poems
connected by prose. This is leads to art for art, the slogan of the 1890s. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cognitive monistic aesthetic ignores feeling. But a work of art, the
externalization of intuition, is accompanied by pleasure of pain as it is
perfect or imperfect. So later Croce defines, intuition-expression as one of
feeling; “lyrism” is the term used. Art gives not only aesthetic knowledge but
aesthetic pleasure too. Intuition-expression externalized gives to the qualified
recipient the same aesthetic experience in which passion is calmed and calm is
passionate, in which Wordsworth’s spontaneous overflow and emotion recollected
become synonymous. But when an aesthetic theorist says as a practising critic
(for after all the proof of the pudding lies in the eating) that Shakespeare
can be understood by one of slight or elementary culture or that the <i

pseudo-science alternating with snatches of poetry, it indicates either the
theory is right and the application wrong or the application is right and the

Criticism’, Arnold and Eliot fight shy of metaphysical flights and Daiches does

four main activities of the spirit: the other three being the logical, the

stories of great people are generally narrated in the form of stories or
rendered as ballads to make an everlasting impression on the people who witness
it or hear the same. Enacting a drama is more impressive than story-telling.
The author Sri T. K. Ramanujam Kavirajar, who is an advocate by profession, an
ardent patriot and a close follower of Gandhi, had written Gandhi’s life in the
format of a drama which is commendable as a novel attempt. To be easily
understood, he had adopted a simple style using conventional and conveniently
constructed proverbs and parables. Some major incidents in the life of the
father of the nation, in this country and abroad have been dramatised with
calculated imagination. The author has restricted himself to such of those
situations in the life of the master which bring to focus the attention of
Gandhiji’s steadfast adherence to Truth and his unfailing faith in Ahimsa. In
every act of the five acts of the drama–why, in every scene for that matter–the
author introduces a critic of Gandhi and his actions, who before the end of the
scene gets converted to appreciate the master’s sterling qualities of courage
and conviction. It is possible for the author to hope to realise his objective
to convert the sophisticated in the community through this work. This is the
author’s contribution on Gandhiji during the centenary celebrations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

society) and the murder of his love Yasmin (the teen aged Muslim girl betrothed
to be the third wife of a middle-aged Railway Guard, Gul Muhammad), and
sustained by the current of his passion for poetry, scholarship and freedom.
The dominating and fascinating feature of the book is the Yasmin-Krishan love
theme that ends up in tragedy with the murder of Yasmin by her jealous husband.
The novel opens with Krishan cycling through the streets of Amritsar to join
Khalsa College as a ‘first-year-fool.’ And he is shocked to find himself ragged
by the senior students, when he is rescued by Noor another first-year student
who becomes his bosom friend ever since. Krishan is initiated into a world of
contemplation and ideas by the poet Iqbal, the theosophist Professor, Henry,
and the Christian Priest, Reverned Williams. Implicated in the secret terrorist
bomb-making activity of Kedar Nath and his companions and kept under arrest for
a short while, puzzled Krishan escapes to Bombay where he writes for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bombay Chronicle </i>for a short period and
returns to his college in Amritsar. Obsessed much by the tragic death of Yasmin
and his father’s strictures, and addiction to the world of follies, but
encouraged by his grand success with honours in his final degree examination,
the poet Iqbal, his Principal, Lalla Jag Mohan, and above all aided by his compassionate
mother, Krishan leaves for England to peel off the various sheaths of what he
calls “ghaoon maoon” and get to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Core</i>.
The book is also a fine record of the various aspirations and depressions and
emotions, illusions and illuminations, experienced by Krishan in his quest for
happiness which marks the second stage in the evolution of Anand’s mind and art.

than the spark to make it into a fire. And then one begins to dance in the circle
of fire–dancer becomes the dance “burning and melting.” Further the significant

itself symbolic of the universality of the book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author richly merits our congratulations for having fathomed deep into the
oceans of some important Brahmanas, made a critical study and finally brought
out a wealth of information, not seriously noticed by anyone till now. The
authorlessness of the Vedas is upheld in a rational way. The symbolic significance
of the Vedic deities and sacrificial elements is explained. A picture of the
performance of a yaga is presented. The philosophy of Brahmanas including
metaphysics, cosmology, cosmogony, psychology, eschatology, ethics and
political science also is expounded. A special chapter is devoted to a study of
the sciences like biology, medicine, metallurgy, mathematics and astronomy
referred to the Brahmanas. It may be interesting to note that the application
of “Saumya syaama caru” together with recitation of a Mantra is suggested as a
remedy for cataract in the eye. Copious notes and references are given. Views
of scholars both oriental and occidental are quoted. Critics are silenced.
Importance of the Brahmana portion of the Veda is well brought out. Students of
Indian culture and Sanskrit literature are advised to study this thesis and get
themselves enlightened. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ramayanas available in Sanskrit, and other Indian languages like Tamil, Oriya,
Assamese and Bengali, and in the Praktit literature of Bauddhas and Jainas are
consulted. All variations from the popular Valmiki’s Ramayana are pointed out
in the footnotes. For instance, according to some Ramayanas, it was Sita but
not Rama who killed Ravana in the battlefield. Sita was born to Mandodari.
Bharata and Satrughna were not twins but born to different mothers. Rama’s
sandals which ruled the country, kicked each other when a wrong judgment was
given, but kept unmoved and silent in cases of right decisions. (2) Questions
raised regarding the episodes of ‘Valivadha’ and ‘Sambukavadha’ are easily
answered. (3) Dates of some incidents in the story found in some Ramayanas are
given here. (4) Some of the author’s critical remarks are revealing of Yakshas
and Rakshasas. (5) Some very popular verses from Valmiki Ramayana, and Ahalya
Stotra from the Adhyatma Ramayana are quoted. (6) That Rama is an ideal king,
bon, brother, administrator, and hero, etc., and Sita is a perfect woman is
shown in a long introduction. (7) Some contradicting statements found in
different Ramayanas are found reconciled herein. (8) A bibliography of all the
Ramayanas and Rama stories in the appendix is very informative. This work
provides a very refreshing and interesting study to all Sanskrit knowing
students. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

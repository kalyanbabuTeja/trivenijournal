style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
word ‘co-existence’ is now on the lips of every one. There is much talk and
writing about it. It has come to be included in the list of those blessed words
whose pronunciation and hearing seem to bring calm and consolation to many
troubled minds. What then <span class=GramE>is</span> exactly the idea and the
implication behind the word? It may be of some value to enquire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is necessary at the outset to grasp that it is in
a special context that the word is being used today. The context is that of the
cold war which has threatened to bring about a third world war. For the last
eight years the two giants–Soviet <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the United States–<span
class=GramE>have been</span> facing each other as determined foes, believing
that the existence of either depends on the destruction of the opponent and
that it is not possible for both of them to exist together, either physically
or morally or spiritually. Both have therefore been engaged in making
unprecedented preparations for the transformation of the cold war into an open
war, and these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=GramE><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>preparations</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
have taken various forms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of these forms consisted in the pressure on the smaller States and the weaker
States in the world with a view to convert them into the position of
satellites. It will be a useful historical exercise to explore and discover who
began this process after the <span class=GramE>second world war</span>. But
whoever began it, it was Soviet Russia that first achieved success in the
enterprise. Within three years of the close of the war Soviet Russia brought
the three Baltic States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,
Albania, etc., within her control and made them her satellites, completely <span
class=SpellE>sovietising</span> them in their internal and external policies.
They are today a part of her empire and hold in relation to her the same
position that <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Korea</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Formosa</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>
hold towards the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>,
or Malaya, the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Gold</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Coast</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">etc.</st1:PlaceName>,
towards <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Great Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Preliminary successes in the process only encouraged the giants to extend it
further. Every State in the world lying outside the two power-blocs is being
increasingly subjected to continued political pressure from both parties and is
not allowed to pursue its existence in its own way. It is this pressure that is
most resented especially by States like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and it is responsible to
some extent for the exaggerated importance they have come to attach to
neutralism. They plead for co-existence as a means of relief from this
excessive pressure, though this is not the whole explanation of their attitude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
reply of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to this policy of Soviet Russia was to imitate her and to secure satellite
States for <span class=GramE>herself</span>. The only difference between the
two has consisted in the means used for the purpose. The <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is the richest country in the world. The technological skill of her population
is the basis of her prosperity. It is therefore through the instrument of
economic aid that she has tried to bring States within her sphere of influence.
And in several cases it was supplemented by military aid and technical aid.’
All this has become possible because of her enormous riches. The West European
States, Italy, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Yugoslavia</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Turkey</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Thailand</st1:country-region>, the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Formosa</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Korea</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> are
now subject to American economic and military domination. In several of these
States the governments are democratic only in name; and in several others they
do not even bear that name. Very many of them are reactionary in character and
they cannot support themselves against popular forces, unless it <span
class=GramE>be</span> with the economic and military help of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This help is as much necessary to them as the help of the Soviet armies and of
the Soviet-dominated Communist parties are necessary to the leftist governments
in the Soviet satellite States. While there has been an extraordinary growth in
talk about the steady expansion of democracy and freedom, there is really more
of imperialism–and where open imperialism is absent, more of indirect rule and
domination by the U. S. S. R. and the United States–in every part of the world.
In every country which is still independent a struggle is going on between
pro-Soviet and pro-American <span class=GramE>parties,</span> and those who
dislike this struggle are anxious to carry on propaganda in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of co-existence, which they think will remove the tension between the two
giants and bring domestic peace and calm to their countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The cold war has also resulted in a growing
expenditure on armaments. This is as <span class=GramE>much true</span> of
Soviet Russia as of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Much of the wealth of the world is
being diverted to the manufacture of instruments of warfare, even though more
than one half of the world’s population–especially in Asia and Africa–is
suffering from dire poverty and is in need not of weapons of warfare but of
more food, more clothing and more shelter. There are several nations who are
tired of war <span class=GramE>either because they have, like the French,
suffered too much and</span> too frequently from it, or, like large numbers of
Germans, because it has not brought to them the blessings claimed for it by
their Kaisers and their <span class=SpellE>Hitlers</span>. There are other
countries like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which are not for war, primarily because they are countries which have achieved
freedom recently and which have to concentrate their attention on the consolidation
of their freedom and on economic improvement. It is from these quarters that
the demand for co-existence is highly vocal and strong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally
we have to take note of the influence exercised by the accumulation of Atomic,
Hydrogen and Cobalt bombs. Every one is now conscious of their unlimited powers
of destruction. So long as their manufacture was a monopoly of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
it was felt by the Americans that an atomic war would destroy only the Soviets.
But now that the Soviet also has her pile of such bombs, the feeling is that
any atomic war would destroy both, and that the physically poisonous atmosphere
which the explosion of such bombs on a large scale would create would destroy
the neutral world also. If today the language of co-existence is spoken by both
the U. S. S. R. and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it is the outcome of this
realisation that war would not pay them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Taking
all these points together what has to be grasped is that co-existence has come
to mean a state of affairs in which the United States and the U. S. S. R. would
not enter into any open war and would reconcile themselves to each other’s
existence. It now remains to see how far this principle will be adhered to in
practice and the implications of such adherence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
principle of co-existence can be effective in practice only when Soviet
Communism abandons its faith in world Communism through revolution. It is an
article of faith with the Marxists that, though the destruction of Capitalism
is inevitable and will be brought about automatically by its own inherent
weakness in the natural course of its history, this destructive process should
be hastened by conscious human effort, that this effort should take the form
not of peaceful argument and persuasion but of active revolution accompanied by
bloodshed as all revolutions are bound to be, and that preparation for such
effort should be by efficiently <span class=SpellE>organised</span> Communist
parties in every Capitalist country through incitement of workers to go on
strike frequently, through sabotage, and through fomenting all sorts of
discontent. A necessary corollary of this faith is the need for establishing a
party dictatorship dominated by the Communist minority and lasting for as long
a time as is necessary to liquidate not only Capitalism within the particular
country concerned but throughout the world–which naturally means an indefinite
period. The philosophy of Communism is a philosophy which is totally opposed to
the doctrine of co-existence. Will the leaders at the helm of affairs in the U.
S. S. R. have the courage to give up their faith in this philosophy? There was
a time when Stalin in his opposition to Trotsky proclaimed that Capitalism and
Communism can co-exist and when, to get the American and allied help in the war
against Hitler, he dissolved the <span class=SpellE>Comintern</span>–the
organisation for bringing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>about world revolution. But it was only
as a matter of expediency that this was done. The principle has never been
abandoned and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the goal of Communism is still world revolution.
There is thus no real harmony between Communism on one side and the principle
of co-existence. One is exactly the negation of the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be contended that it is not ideologies and religious faiths that really
sway men’s minds and bring about wars, and that it is the realities of the
world situation that determine the course of events. There is a great deal of
truth in this point of view but it is necessary to understand the limits within
which this is true. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To what extent men are influenced by ideas
and to what extent by the practical situations in which they find themselves</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>this
has </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>been an eternal problem. No universally satisfactory answer
has been found for it and the evidence of history is not conclusive. There are
ideas and ideologies which are far in advance of their age; and it is only when
the time is ripe for their realisation that active efforts are made for the
purpose. There are other ideas–the moral truths of a Buddha or a Jesus–which in
spite of constant teaching are observed more in the breach than in practice. There
is the element of duality in man–he is both good and evil. This is the reason
why Communists may not be influenced completely by the Communist philosophy and
why they may prefer a life of co-existence with Capitalism. Like all human
practices the practice of Communism by Communists may swerve a great deal from
its precepts. But what is the conclusion that one should draw from this? If for
instance the Communist rulers of the U.S.S.R. today prefer to preach the
doctrine of co-existence which, as has already been poised out, is a negation
of their fundamental philosophy, what is it due to? Two points deserve
consideration in this connection. They strictly adhered to the philosophy of
Communism so long as it paid dividends to them. Their domination over the
countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe and their attempts to dominate <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
Indo-China illustrate this. It was only when they met with an overwhelming
resistance, as at the time of the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Berlin</st1:place></st1:State>
blockade or in the Korean campaign, that they gradually switched on to the
Principle of co-existence. They became converts to this principle, not because
of their inherent faith in it but because of the extraordinary power built by
their opponents through the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Marshall</st1:place></st1:City>
Plan and schemes of military aid, and through the accumulation of conventional
and atomic weapons. It is because <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> has grown enormously in the
power to attack, and to defend herself when attacked, that the Soviet leaders
have begun to feel that they should stop their policy of expansion. The
conclusion for us is that the building of armaments is not futile, and that it
is only when an intending belligerent is convinced that his enemy on the other
side is sufficiently strong that he will speak the language of peace. One has
to keep his powder dry. If today, the word co-existence is found on the lips of
all people, and if steady propaganda is carried on in its <span class=SpellE>favour</span>,
it is because of the increased military and economic strength of both, the
parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is also another point to be noted in this connection. History shows that
aggression scope only when it meets with a determined and strong foe. It also
shows that aggressors require time to consolidate their conquests and this
makes them talk the language of peace. This does not mean that they are
prepared to abandon for all time their aggressive intentions. The aggression of
Islam in the first centuries of its history stopped only when it met with
superior force. Religious wars in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
stopped when each party went as far as it could and when it could not proceed
any further through the pursuit of war. Neither party is prepared to yield its
conquests and restore the <i>status quo ante. </i>Is the U.S.S.R. today
prepared to liberate the States of Central and South-Eastern Europe? Is the <st1:country-region

are people who say that war does not settle anything and that it is folly to
take recourse to it. From this, premise the conclusion is drawn that

nations. But this statement that war does not solve anything is only partially
true. Many questions have been solved by war and they could not have been
solved in any other way. There is not much use in shaking of “what might have
resulted if people were peaceful.” American independence was secured through
war which was necessitated when all peaceful means failed. Italian unity,
German unity, the liberation of the Balkan peoples from the Turkish yoke, all
these have been achieved through war. It is the loss inflicted on <st1:country-region

led to her withdrawal from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

it has so far made, war has been an effective means and that it has not been so
far abandoned. This is due to the fact that unreasonable men yield on most
occasions only to superior force and not to superior reason. Peace has not
solved all human problems in the world of men. In an ideal world consisting of
persons who are all angelic in their temperament, who are embodiments of
perfect reason and wisdom, and who are not under the influence of emotions and
evil instincts universal peace will rule. But men are not angels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in practice, its right to use arms as an instrument of national policy.
Advocates of co-existence as a practicable guide to the conduct of States
should not forget this. It is only as between States which are equal or
approximately equal in strength that co-existence is a possibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as between the U.S.S.R. and the United States, and therefore as between

the sources of the spiritual energy of the nation are important constituents of
it, and that a nation which has only this material superiority may lose in the

there is nothing to indicate that these will be abandoned. On the other hand
there is every probability that relaxation in international tension due to
preparations for war may be accompanied by the strengthening of these
instruments. The question therefore naturally arises whether co-existence under
circumstances like these is capable of being realized in practice. The pressure
which the two giants are exercising on nations which are still neutral may
become more intensified, especially in the countries of South Asia and Africa
which are economically undeveloped, and where the Communists are in a position
to make an effective emotional appeal to the masses of people who have not the
maturity needed to distinguish between utopia and reality, between slogans and
reasoned statements, between promises and the extent to which they can be
fulfilled. In a world where men are motivated only by reason and are not
influenced by passion, complete freedom of discussion may be relied on to
produce the best results in the matter of discovery of truth. Not so in the
ordinary world, especially in the undeveloped countries. And discussion among
intellectuals is not the same as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

destroyed openly by enemies coming from outside, or surreptitiously by enemies
from within working secretly and underground. The ultimate outcome may be–not
co-existence but the victory of only one kind and way of life. It is not war
alone that destroys. There may be other and more effective and ultimately more
dangerous weapons which bring about destruction. The lives of millions of
people have been taken away through the so-called process of liquidation in
several countries of the world in peace time. Their innocent children have been
made to suffer. Their properties have been taken away. How far can the theory
of co-existence be accepted as sound under conditions and circumstances like

nations to help others who are in need of help may be interpreted as attempts
to extend its influence and power, and steps may be taken to put a stop to

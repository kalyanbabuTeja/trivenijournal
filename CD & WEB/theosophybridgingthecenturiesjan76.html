<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
the age of sixteen, I have been connected with the Theosophical Society as an
official member, and before, as an unofficial member. My contact has not been
with those great people such as Madame <span class=SpellE>Blavatsky</span> or
Colonel <span class=SpellE>Olcott</span> and their generation to whom we owe so
much. My contact has been with others who have inspired me in my life. The
three who have most inspired me have been Dr Besant, who has been like a mother
and Guru to all of us, C. W. <span class=SpellE>Leadbeater</span>, a great
comrade in the work, and Dr <span class=SpellE>Arundale</span>, because of whom
I had wonderful opportunities of coming into a greater family. My experiences
have been not merely something to talk about, but have been educative, because
I feel that when I travel, speak, or do any work, I am not only trying to tell
somebody what to do or to teach, but much more, to learn why we are moving
about in the world. That has been the great education. But most important of
all has been the spiritual appeal made to each one of us to live a grater life,
a life of dedication and sincerity by which we discover ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
I pay profound homage to Dr Besant, I would like very strongly to say, as one
who knows, I think probably better than anybody else here, that never has the
spiritual education she gave been such as to make us into what other people
want. What I learned from Dr Besant was to discover myself, to discover my
capacity, to discover my contribution, and to give it to the best of my ability.
When speaking about “my” contribution, there is no “I” in it. It has nothing to
do with the personality. It is the contribution we have built up through ages
and incarnations, that with which we are born, and which we have yet to
discover, just as each child is trying to discover its own life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So
we come with certain gifts which we have built up in many incarnations, and
these gifts we must develop in this and in every life. If we can <span
class=SpellE>fulfil</span> our missions and give the best that we can, whatever
it may be, this is the highest and the greatest contribution we can make. The
essential message of a spiritual life, or even of the celebration of a
centenary, is not that we should think of starting a new century in time. In
terms of years it is a new century, but in terms of life, it is not a new
century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
have been taught to try to attain certain spiritual levels, in order to achieve
spiritual consciousness and live in a greater way because of it. We have been
taught that we must rise into the consciousness of the Great Ones in order to
become one with our Higher Selves and with the Great Ones. We have been taught
that we have to reach the feet of those Elder Brothers by our life, by
meditation, by spiritual perception, by study. All this may be true, but in my
school, which is the world, it is not so much that we make a bridge between
ourselves and that which is highest, but that our interest should be the bridge
between ourselves and all that is great. If we are going to meditate on God, I
would like to reverse the process and say let us mediate on life. Let us
meditate on the thing which we think is less evolved. I feel that the contact
we make with things around us is even more important than the contact we try to
make with something greater and un-seen by us. Because all that is unseen, all
that is <span class=GramE>greater,</span> is also in the seen and in the
lesser. And in the lesser and in the seen, there is greatness, there is beauty,
there is perfection, which we must learn to appreciate and enjoy. I feel that
unless we can express that, unless we can feel that, we can never go into a new
century except in the process of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Going
into a new century is starting life, a new life, a new world, a new expression,
and a change that must take place within <span class=GramE>ourselves</span>.
And that change which must take place within <span class=GramE>ourselves</span>
is the only change that will come, not any other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
all speak about Theosophy and the Theosophical Society and the great gifts
given by Madame <span class=SpellE>Blavatsky</span>. We all accept them, but
however proud we may be of these gifts, we must not act as if we initiated
them. We did not start them. Amongst you there may be a great person who might
revolutionize the world, but I think the majority of us are not capable of
starting such a movement or giving such a teaching. Therefore, we have to learn
that the greatness in H. P. B. brought forth a message, and we are merely
humble recipients of that message which we must appreciate, understand and be
inspired by. There must be that greatness which makes us humble rather than
proud of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
feel very often that we talk about Theosophy and the Theosophical Society as if
they are our private possessions. I think that attitude of possession is
something we have to forget, because we do not really possess them, we cannot
possess them. It is impossible to possess these things. What we can possess is
the gift that we receive as the result of an inspiration that we might derive
under any circumstances. If you ask what is spiritual, I would say any
inspiration that we can derive which is true, which is beautiful, which
inspires others, which appreciates others, which brings comfort to others,
which helps others. That inspiration is the reality, the inspiration from
above. We cannot label <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it<i> </i></span>and
say this inspiration is <span class=GramE>Theosophy, that</span> inspiration is
not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>People
talk about defining Theosophy, but we need not take the trouble to define it.
Why do we want to analyze it? Why do we want to put it into words? That which
is the greatest can never be put into words. It is inspiration, it is universal,
<span class=GramE>it</span> is greatness. That is the essence of all spiritual
teaching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Therefore
it is the life and not the form which <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is
</span>Theosophy. It is that life that we must learn to feel under every
circumstance in the world. There are thousands of circumstances <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>which we can feel, and be
inspired. Unfortunately we do not often recognize them. If we do not feel
inspired by something, we say this is not it. We miss the great opportunity of
contacting a very wonderful and high consciousness of beauty which we can do if
only we will not be sectarian, or if we will not label that life under any name
whatsoever. All that is great is obviously nameless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Therefore,
what we have to do if we really want this convention, or this particular
moment, to be a great moment that will take us into a new life, is to try to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lift </span>ourselves, not into something
higher, because there is nothing higher, but into everything around, which is
high also. We have to learn <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>express
that life and let that life flow through us, first, by inspiration and second,
by action, because right action can come only from inspiration. Life can be
released only by that inspiration. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>First
</span>we have to learn to be inspired. Second, we have to learn to give. We
have to learn to express that inspiration in a thousand different ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
am <span class=GramE>not <span class=SpellE>not</span></span> saying anything
new. We cannot say anything new, but we can think, we can feel<span
class=GramE>,</span> we can examine ourselves to see how many things there are
in the world <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>which we
really feel concerned. We talk about helping humanity. The first question we
have to ask is how interested we are in humanity. How interested are we in the
world? How deeply do we feel for the world? How much do we feel the suffering
that is taking place? I think that we should spend at least two-thirds of our
time on these things and only one-third on speaking or teaching or talking.
This is my viewpoint. There are those for whom we must feel. What will be our
contribution? If we are inspired, how will we express that inspiration? Where
is our contribution? We say that we believe in brotherhood. Brotherhood has to
be proved. It is not enough to believe. Everybody in the world believes in
brotherhood. Even those who are violent believe in brotherhood, only, they are
brotherly in a violent way. Why do you fight? Be calm, they say, but with great
anger. And so violence is approved as a means of working for brotherhood. We
have to think of the means to the end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
if we believe in brotherhood, it is about time that we do not talk about it at
all, because it is understood. We do not need to talk about it any more. Why
should we go on talking about something we all know? Why should we try to
convert the converted? Now the thing to do is to <span class=SpellE>practise</span>
it. How can we put it into practice? We have to feel. We have really to love.
We have to sympathize. We have to think about brotherhood. We have to do many
things which must come from out hearts. That is important. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
am interested in and appreciate the great achievements of the intellect. I
appreciate the wonderful way in which humanity has discovered ways of going to
the moon, the wonderful way in which humanity has discovered how to get into
Mars. All these wonderful things are there, but we still remain where we are.
Our world is still the same world, and we have to change our world. Though the
achievements are there, the greatest achievement is the achievement of change
that we can make in ourselves. So, when we talk about brotherhood, let us
examine many things–whether we are really working for it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
really believe that not all of us are <span class=SpellE>practising</span> our
Theosophy as much as we should and as much as we could. We have not yet learned
to appreciate fully, to understand, and to take interest in life in all its
forms. There is so much suffering going on in so many ways. I do not understand
why it is we cannot say to all our <span class=SpellE>Theosphists</span>, as
the Ashrams do and insist on that. To lead a spiritual life we must be
vegetarian? Indeed, we say that we must be vegetarian only to be spiritual. Why
cannot we be vegetarian because of compassion? So many are vegetarians because
they think by being vegetarian they can make great spiritual progress, yet
there is no love or compassion. May be the time will come when we can say that we
should not <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>follow<i> </i></span>these
ways just for our personal benefit. We want to be recognized by some great
being, or we want to gain a very high level of spiritual consciousness. If we
cannot put our tenets into practice, how can we reach that spiritual <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>level </span>and why should we want
salvation? I am not interested at all in whether I am going to be saved in this
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>life </span>or in the next life. I
shall be much happier in saving a large number of animals and human beings. Why
must we think of spiritual life in terms of personal satisfaction and our
personal progress? I feel really that we should avoid that particular way of
thinking. The great teachers of humanity have said “change <span class=GramE>yourself</span>”.
Think how <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>you </span>can reach the
feet of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>God. </span>We do not know how
they meant it, but we know very well when we read their words that when they
think of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>God, </span>they think of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>God </span>in every living being, in every
living creature on earth. I cannot see <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>God
</span>anywhere except here in this world. I can only see around me. I am blind
as far as <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>God </span>is concerned in
that exalted <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>form </span>in which
people picture <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Him. </span>I am not
blind when it comes to seeing people, human beings, those about us, the
animals, and so on. There are so many things to which I feel we must put our
minds. We must examine ourselves and see in what way we can change our way of
thinking. How can we turn outward and not always <span class=GramE>inwards.</span>
The strange thing is you cannot turn inward unless you turn outward. If <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>you </span>cannot love nature and animals, it
is no use saying I am going somewhere deep inside. Even those who are the most
highly developed have insisted upon love and compassion towards all living
creatures, not merely compassion but active practical compassion. It is no use
going along the street and saying, “Look at that poor man. I am so sorry for
him.” He does not care whether <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>you </span>are
sorry <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>him or not. What he wonders
is what are <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>you </span>going to do. It
is no use saying, “Look at that animal suffering. It is a great pity the SPCA
does not do something.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What do you do? How
do you try to serve that creature? This is Theosophy. This is brotherhood. Our
mind must be turned outwards. If it is not, it is not spiritual, as far as I am
concerned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are many things in the world which we can do, but we must see the world, study
the world. You may think<span class=GramE>,</span> I want to change the world.
How am I going to change it? Take it step by step. This year is called the
International Women’s Year. I have told many that I do not like the idea of a
year for women. It is the International Women’s Century. There are problems of
the East and problems of the West. The West–quite a large number of people in
the West–is interested in Eastern teaching. The East is interested to see how
Western they can be. While Western young men wear dhotis, our Indian young men
wear trousers. While foreign women want to wear saris, our Indian young women
want to wear trousers. The other day I happened to mention it to the Dalai
Lama. “That’s a good exchange!” he said in fun. I do not mind whether they wear
saris or trousers, but the fact is we have not understood values. If we
understand values, if we really feel that we appreciate <span class=GramE>them,
that</span> is all right. But mere exterior form without appreciation of the
meaning or values is an unfortunate tendency in our world. The appreciation of
true values is important. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Very
often I hear people say, “Oh, this is what they do, but that is the modern way.”
I cannot understand that phrase at all. What does it matter whether it is
modern, or old, or new, but is it true, is it beautiful, is it real? Is not
that much more important? People condone certain customs, and say, that is the
modern outlook. The only thing I can say <span class=GramE>then,</span> is that
I do not like that modern outlook. Even Theosophists say, “Well, you know,
ideas have changed.” So, if ideas change for the worse, we accept the change

it after thinking, after feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

must have a standard, a certain idea created by our sensitiveness, not through

modern times, there is a general deterioration along so many lines. What are we
thinking, what are the reforms we are trying to make? How are we affecting our
civilization? Most important is our not examining the things that we do not
see. So many things we do not see. We talk about violence. There is <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>violence </span>everywhere. We feel it very
deeply <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>when a hundred </span>people

Everywhere there <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is. </span>No country

mental world of our own. What is that world according to which we must live?
The greatest and most important influence of all <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

loving attitude towards all living things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

came here. She discovered the <span class=SpellE>rishis</span>. Perhaps we are
incongruous. When we use the word <span class=SpellE>rishis</span>, we think we
are being Hindu. When we use the word Masters, we think that we are not. The
teachings of the great <span class=SpellE>rishis</span> are founded on this selflessness,
on making a complete contact between the higher and the so-called lower world.
There is neither a higher nor a lower world. There is only one world, one life,
one atmosphere, <span class=GramE>one greatness</span>. And the great <span
class=SpellE>rishis</span> have given this message, and the teachings of the
Buddha, of Sri Krishna–<span class=SpellE>marvellous</span>, wonderful examples
to all of us. The entire world is trying to understand them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

who are in India, we who are members of the Theosophical Society in this
country, what are we doing to see the truth, to take away from it all falseness
that might exist created by ourselves, to see the truth, to discover the truth,
lift it and give that message to the world? When we give that message to the
world, I do not mean by talking, but by action. I am only pointing out the opportunity
that we all have, which each one of us must share in this tremendous
opportunity to give that true message to the country which has been the source
of inspiration to the great founders. It has been the source of inspiration to our
great leader, Dr. Annie Besant. She established schools and colleges everywhere
so that our young people might imbibe that spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

will tell you one small story about her. One day when I came on a boat with her
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>, she
landed, and I saw her prostrating on the dirty ground outside. I stood there
and said, “Why do you do it?” She said, “Because this is the land which the
great Teachers of humanity have trodden. I do not see the dirt, I only see the
light.” That was because of <span class=GramE>her own</span> greatness. We may
not feel like doing it. I am only telling you what inspired her. Let these
great teachings and the Teachers inspire us on our pathway. Let them inspire us
to make our country a truly holy, beautiful country, an Ashram and a home of
the most compassionate living. As we read in <i>The <span class=SpellE>Saakuntala</span>,
</i>when the king <span class=GramE>comes</span> hunting in the Ashram, the
Guru says, “No, this is a place of peace for all living creatures. No creature
must be hurt.” How beautiful those words are! Try to feel, and if you feel
deeply you realize how beautiful it is. Try to live beauty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

know you might expect me to speak about art, but art is this same thing to me.
It gives <span class=GramE>inspiration,</span> it gives me a picture of another
world that can become part of this world. It gives me a picture of a world that
can show how this world can be, how you and I can be. And therefore, that
inspiration is the inspiration which unites all, which uplifts us all and
brings into our life new greatness. That is the greatness for which we may
live. So, if you say to me, “What is the centenary, what is the new life?” I
say I don’t mind what I am or to what religion or to which organization I
belong, but as long as I can sincerely feel without bitterness or hatred or
jealousy, a real love for every living creature, as long as I can give every
ounce of my energy to help these, as long as I can feel or at least try to do
so, I think, for me, that I have fulfilled my mission as a Theosophist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

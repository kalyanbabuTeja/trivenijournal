style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Recently
I visited the Buddhist caves at Kanheri, dated about 200 B. C, and the Hindu
caves at Elephanta, across the harbour at Bombay, dated 800 A. D. My object in
this article is not to give a description of these caves but rather to trace
the development of the psychology of the Indian mind from its state of agony
and distraction in the Age of Buddha to integration and virility in the Hindu
medieval age, i. e., about 600 A. D. to 1100 A. D. I have purposely chosen this
period of Indian art and history for study, because, to my mind, the Buddhist
age is very similar to present-day India in its licentiousness, disintegration
and vulgarity. And, therefore, a study of the development of the Indian mind
from the Buddhist age may help us in getting an insight into the nature of our
present-day problems and their possible solution. I will rely on the art of the
Buddhist and Hindu caves to develop my thesis, for a nation’s art reveals the
various stages of its spiritual history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the outset I should like to make one point. Two great teachers, Buddha and
Mahavir (the founder of Jainism), appear on the Indian scene about the 6th
century B. C. It is the period of the Great Enlightenment, but we find that
this spiritual consciousness does not find its expression in the arts, religion
and public life in India till the Gupta period, i. e., the 3rd to the 5th
century A. D. In fact, the period immediately following the Great Enlightenment
for some centuries is of darkness and perversion. We see, therefore, that it
took about eight to ten centuries before the spiritual awakening of Lord Buddha
could find its expression in the soul of India. To my mind there is a
remarkable similarity to this in the present-day position in India. The second
half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century in India have
seen the appearance of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, Sri
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Swami
Ramtirtha, Pherozsha Mehta, Dadabhai Naoroji, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore,
Mahatma Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo Ghose, Lokamanya Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale,
Lala Lajpat Rai, Dr. Jagadish Chander Bose, Dr. C. V. Raman, Pt. Vishnu
Digamber Paluskar, and many other illustrious sons of India, who, like a galaxy
of brilliant stars, cast away darkness from the despondent, despairing horizon
of Mother India. The mind of India was suddenly lighted and shone luminously.
In no way was the experience less profound than the Great Enlightenment of the
Buddha. The Indian mind was alive in all aspects of culture–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>religion,
politics, arts, philosophy and science. But there is before us the enigma that
this enlightenment has been followed by our present </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>age
which is exceedingly corrupt and rotten. This paradox is a riddle unless we see
it from the perspective of the Buddhist age, and realise that the age of Buddha
too was utterly corrupt, and it took about eight centuries for the spiritual
ideal of Buddha to find expression in the national life. Mr. Nehru, therefore,
is perhaps fruitlessly exercising himself to transform India into a mighty
power in haste, and it will be well for him to remember that there is hardly
anything more painful </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and slow than spiritual growth. We see the
same phenomenon in the history of Europe, where the spiritual significance of
Christ did not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>find its expression in European culture till
many centuries after the crucifixion of Christ. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall now take up in detail the age of Buddha. And, by reference to art and
history, we shall see how amazingly it resembles </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>our own. Just
about the time of Buddha (520 B. C.) India was invaded by Darius, King of
Persia, who established a vast empire on </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian soil, similar
to the British Empire in our times. The mind of India thereafter was completely
dominated by foreign ideals, and India lost consciousness of her own
personality and identity. The country was politically disintegrated; the four
large kingdoms of Magadha, Avanti, Kosala and Vatsa were constantly at war with
one another. Political murders were the order of the day. For example
Bimbisara, the King of Magadha, was killed by his son Ajatasatru. All this is
not without a parallel in our own times. Linguistic states are fighting over
their border issues with a shameless fervour which would make one think they
were foreign countries at war. Only the other day the Chief Minister of Mysore
assured his State legislature that he would not give any of the disputed land
to Bombay State nor would he allow the Centre to decide the issue. As for
political murders, they are not quite unknown today. If anything, in its
shameless vulgarity, loss of national idealism and irresponsibility, the
present-day Indian political scene is as rotten as, if not more than, the
Buddhist. For a few centuries after the time of the Persian invasion of Darius,
India the glorious land of purity and culture and thought, sold her soul to the
foreigner and her expressions in politics, art and religion were the coarse
experiences of a prostituted mind. The condition of the country was so
distracted that it invited one aggressor after the other who ravished and
outraged her and left her denuded of her treasures, both material and
spiritual. Of these, the Greek invasion of Alexander in 300 B. C., and the
Scythian and Hun are the more prominent. The intimidation of India’s political
integrity is in evidence these days, and makes confusion and trouble for Mr.
Nehru’s foreign policy. India is sought to be bullied by any power, however
small and insignificant, which takes it into her mind to do so. Portugal
continues to humiliate India in Goa. Mr. Nehru almost kept on philosophising,
listening to his own voice, while China swallowed Tibet and now threatens more
outrages. The Chief Minister of Nepal, B. P. Koirala, had the audacity to go to
Peking and sign a border treaty with China, right in the face of India’s
discomfiture on this issue. Burma signed a similar treaty with China. The first
statement made by the recently elected Prime Minister of Ceylon, made in a
condescending tone of superiority, was that she would endeavour to settle the
“Indian problem of Ceylon.” Pakistan has issued stamps showing many parts of
Indian territory in Pakistan. The truth is that what are now Pakistan, Tibet,
Nepal, Burma, and Ceylon have, historically, all been inviolable parts of
Greater India. It is Indian culture and trade and philosophy and customs and
civilization which nurtured these, and lent them a characteristically Indian
outlook. But India is weak today and these unruly, thankless offshoots have the
courage to face her with discomfiture. If Mr. Nehru looks at the political
scene from the vantage point of the history of the Buddhist age, he will not
mistake himself into believing that his foreign policy is a bird of a rare
species. His policy of appeasement and weakness has reduced the country to a
state of disintegration and distraction far worse than that of the Buddhist
age. The Persians, Greeks and Scythians were able to wield power in India, not
because of any innate superiority in their systems, but because the Indian
kings were disunited and disloyal to their own country and invited the
foreigner in order to wreak vengeance against a neighbouring power. We have
again witnessed this phenomenon recently when the Communist Party of India has,
to all intents and purposes, sided with China on the border issue; and in
Kerala the Congress has entered into an unholy alliance with the Muslim League,
whose aim is to disintegrate India. We know that Alexander particularly
exploited this situation to further his ends and took care not to alienate the
sympathy of powerful local princes who were prepared to help him. We are only
too familiar with this experience in the establishment of the British Empire in
India. Both instances point to a deadening of the Indian national consciousness
and of its fixation to greed and meanness which makes a foreign ideal, however
treacherous, readily acceptable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Religion
in the Buddhist period was marked by two characteristics. Firstly, Buddhism was
almost unknown. It was a minor sect in the Gangetic Valley. Hinduism in this
age consisted of blind idol worship accompanied by animal and human sacrifices.
We are familiar with this experience even today. As Swami Vivekananda put it
tersely: “Hindu religion has gone to the kitchen and become a creed of
touch-me-not-ism.” Religious life in India today continues to be either
agnostic and atheistic, especially among the rich and upper middle classes; or
a narrow and dogmatic ritualism, in spite of the many spiritual giants who were
born and who preached in India in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Secondly,
the Buddhist age was marked by degradation in the Hindu society as a result of
casteism. With this also we are familiar today. India abounds in conflicts of
Brahmin <i>vs. </i>non-Brahmin, South <i>vs. </i>North, Dravidians <i>vs. </i>Aryans.
And fanatical bodies like the Dravida Khazagam publicly burn the <i>Ramayana </i>and
the <i>Indian Constitution. </i>Untouchability, too, if anything is on the
increase, in spite of legislation, and in spite of the efforts of Gandhiji in
this direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
these tendencies were reflected in the art of the Buddhist period. To my mind,
two distinct effects were visible. One was on the art in the Indian tradition.
The first thing that strikes us is that there was very little of it. The most
representative piece is the “Parkham Statue” in the Mathura Museum, which has
an inscription referring to King Ajatasatru who, as we mentioned above, killed
his father Bimbisara. This is what one would expect of the age–monuments being
erected to the unworthy. We know of portraits and busts of Congress Ministers
and other local dignitaries being unveiled so frequently these days. This art
in the age of Buddha was primitive, lacking in imagination, in philosophic
introspection, or in devotion, and there was no trace in it of romanticism or
refinement. It was utterly material without any sign of spiritual quest. These
remarks apply equally to our age. Firstly, there is a very meagre literary and
artistic output, and what little there is utterly material and mechanistic.
Pseudo-communist schools represent the coarse literary quality. In painting and
sculpture, the modern school of nihilists, existentialists, cubists and what
not are producing a kind of art which represents nothing but their own twisted
ego. The second characteristic of art in the age of Buddha was the dominance of
a foreign ideal on the Indian mind. This is seen in what is known as the
Gandhara School. We can take up discussion of this school along with the age of
Buddha, even though it actually relates to a later period–about 100 A.
D.–because it owes inspiration to the Greek influence. The Gandhara art is
represented in the mains by Hellenistic Buddha statues based on Greek models.
It is a thoroughly hybrid art, effeminate and sensual and totally lacking in
virility. It aims, in the tradition of Western art, at representation of
reality, whereas the aim of Indian art has always been metaphysical and
symbolic. This Gandhara Hellenistic art, therefore, is foreign to the Indian
genius, and has no place in the development of Indian art and ideals. We are
very familiar with hybrid art and music in our times. Indian films are
shameless and corrupted copies of English films. Even the titles are English,
as in “Love in Simla,” and the posters have begun to display semi-nude women in
the Western tradition. Film music is even worse. It is an unabashed mixture of
jazz, rock and roll, Western hilly-billy and negro spirituals. From the point
of view of aesthetics, we notice corruption in Indian women’s dress. The sari
as a dress is an evolution in keeping with the development of Indian
philosophy, art and aesthetics. As we have said above, the essential principle
of Indian art is that, unlike the Western artist who aims at the representation
of the real, the Indian artist aims by symbolism to bring out the hidden
metaphysical and spiritual content. Therefore, Indian art subdues detail in
order to emancipate the essential spirit and mood of the theme. The expression
takes the aid of an intricate symbolism. This is the genius of the sari. The
sari worn in the traditional Indian style, whether Gujarati, Bengali,
Maharashtrian, South Indian or any other, attempts to subdue the female
physiognomy to the utmost in order to bring out her femininity to its best. It
subdues her physical voluptuousness, so that the mind may readily attune itself
to her essential feminine quality. And this is encouraged by symbolic
design–long hair, the vermilion mark in the parting of the hair, the “bindia”
on the forehead, ear-rings, “nathee” in the nose, bangles, “payal” in the
ankles. Gurudev Tagore sang of this symbolic, spiritual, aesthetic aspect of
woman when he said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
with one stroke the champions of the modern Indian woman have cast all this to
the winds. Their essential advice to women is “Don’t act like women, act like
men. In your manners, dress, desires, be masculine, coarse, aggressive. Give up
meekness, shyness, modesty. These are degraded feminine qualities.” The sari
already does not cover the heads of Indian women today. “Eve’s Weekly” would
have it off their shoulders too! Not content with this, the blouse has also
been corrupted. It is backless, low-necked and shows a bare mid-rib. Add to
this: transparent nylon material, cropped hair, smudges of lipstick and rouge,
and you have the horrifying seductive figure of the modern Indian female–an
utterly naive, materialistic, unaesthetic, vulgar and primitive prototype. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we close our discussion of the age of Buddha, we must examine Mr. Nehru’s
personality, because an outstanding personality symbolises the aspirations of
the age. Mr. Nehru has two characteristics: the rose in the button-hole of his
‘achkan’ and the baton in his hand. The crisis of Mr. Nehru is that the baton
has very nearly smothered the rose. Mr. Nehru’s essential personality is
represented by the rose–the poet, the dreamer, the idealist, the man of
letters. The rose symbolises florescence of culture, integration in the Indian
tradition, “capacity for stillness,” yoga, introspection, self-reliance,
meekness, humanity, spiritual growth, poetry, art, philosophy, in short,
fineness of feeling and depth in the personality. The baton is the unleashed
brute, atomic power, steel plants, massive inhuman plans, power politics,
bigness, hurried movements, hasty steps, indecision, communism, that is, a
coarse and rabid materialism. Mr. Nehru is a true picture of the Indian mind
today, which, at an inner subconscious plane, has repressed all feelings of
culture, humanity, enquiry, self-reliance, adventure, experimentation,
devotion. Instead, the uncontrollable Brute, the monster Thing, the seductive
foreign Passion, fixation to Greed and Lust, and desire for quick Exploitation
obsess her mind like the desires of a mad person. This is India’s problem of
personality today. This too, was the problem which the great Lord Buddha
conquered through his ordeals and the Enlightenment. And we shall now see how
this was translated into life in the next phase of Indian history and how the
Indian mind gradually came out of this abysmal torture of darkness and death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the course of spiritual growth the pendulum inevitably swings from one extreme
to the other–from licentiousness and abandon to asceticism and revolt. It
follows the Hegelian development from thesis to the antithesis. This
development we see in the age of the Mauryan Empire, which follows the age of
Buddha. If the Buddhist age was characterised by loose morals, obsession with a
foreign ideal and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>treachery, we now enter a period of Indian
history and art where </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there is a sudden and complete revolt
from this position, and the Indian mind submits itself to asceticism, control
and a heroic attempt to revive Indian values. The very first example we have is
in the personality of Chandragupta Maurya. While still a lad, he met Alexander
in the Punjab and offended the King by his boldness of speech. Alexander,
therefore, gave orders for Chandragupta to be killed. But Chandragupta escaped,
and sought asylum and tuition from the astute and learned Brahmin, Chanakya,
who with the help of other Indian princes, helped Chandragupta to organise a
vast Indian Empire. Here then we have all the elements of the age: revolt
against foreign ideals, reliance on Indian wisdom and tradition, and looking
for help to Indian princes, and not to a foreigner, for establishment of power.
It symbolises a restoration of self-reliance and self-respect in Indian
politics and thought. In India today, we are yet very far from this ideal.
Indian Government teams are constantly going to foreign countries for every
conceivable and petty object. We are studying the Japanese method of rice
cultivation, the Russian method of steel-making, the American quiz methods of
examinations and all sorts of other fads. But these are not being assimilated
into Indian life, because, fundamentally, wisdom and self-reliance are lacking
in the Indian personality. Brave attempts are afoot to organise opposition to
the blind tyranny of the ruling parties and to wean the body politic from its
pre-occupation with foreign aid and foreign ideals to nationalism and
self-reliance. Chandragupta’s efforts met with success and he defeated
Alexander’s general Seleukus. Thereby vast territories of foreign land
including Baluchistan came under the Mauryan Empire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
even more outstanding personality was Asoka, the grandson of Chandragupta. He
continued his predecessor’s policy of aggression and brought Afghanistan,
Baluchistan and the whole of India, except Tamilnad, under his sway. But the
sight of misery in the Kalinga war smote Asoka’s conscience and changed his
personality. It brought him repentance and sorrow, and thereafter he is a
lonely figure undergoing penance and suffering. He made a deep study of
Buddhism, and turned this local sect in the Ganges valley into a world
religion. Instead of games and hunting and court pomp, he now travelled among
the people and preached the gospel of Buddha. Such men have yet to appear in
our public life. Vinoba Bhave is but a sign on the scene. There is no repentance
in our public men. Our public men are not sorry for the sins they are daily
responsible for. They are not men whose conscience suffers the sorrow of the
country. They are very far from the ideal of Asoka. The Indian personality is

characteristic of Asoka was his tolerance. Although he had adopted Buddhism as
his own religion, he not only tolerated but always respected and helped
Brahmins, Jains and persons of other faiths. This quality is sadly missing in
our public life. Our public men are intolerant in the extreme, and one of the
biggest drawbacks of Mr. Nehru’s Government is its inability to tolerate
criticism. Even the Press in India today is subdued, and it fears expression of
ideas which the Government may take amiss. This is a very unhealthy situation,
and could lead to the most dangerous consequences, because criticism like steam
must have an outlet, otherwise it explodes the machine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we close this discussion of the Mauryan period we must note one important
thing. Although the Indian mind has developed considerably, there is still a
great deal of repression in the personality, which stifles expression. The
Indian personality has turned its face away from the world and is dutifully
engaged in lonely penance and suffering. There is yet too much guilt (what in
Yoga philosophy is called “samskara-vasanas,” i.e., auto-inherited tendencies)
in the personality to allow an easy and fearless relationship with life. The
personality is occupied with vague fears, remorse, guilt and complexes. And,
therefore, the age is engaged in a terrible struggle against spiritual death.
This takes the form of asceticism, renunciation, austerity and puritanism.
Buddhism takes the form of rationalistic search and, therefore, there is no
scope in it for poetry. The morbid and guilty temperament does not permit any
metaphysical expression in art. In fact the arts and music are suppressed. The <i>Markandeya
Purana </i>at this time writes: “Nothing should be done by a Brahmin for the
sake of enjoyment.” Chanakya classes musicians and actors with courtesans. Manu
forbids the householder to dance or sing and thinks of architects and actors as
unworthy men. The Buddha even condemns the presentation of the Dhamma in an
attractive literary form. We are familiar with the beginnings of these
tendencies in our times. Society today looks down on teachers, thinkers, poets,
writers, actors, painters, musicians and all those who are engaged in high
intellectual, literary or artistic activity but who are not wealthy. Society,
and along with it every prospective mother-in-law, has much more respect for
any jackanapes who is in commerce and has amassed wealth by any means, however
doubtful and undesirable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
these tendencies we see reflected in the art of the Mauryan age. Buddhist caves
like Kanheri, Karla, Bhaja, Bedsa and Lena are situated in out-of-the-way,
far-off places, usually on lonely distant mountain tops. The architecture is
simple and austere. There are no carvings on pillars or walls and the only
sculpture one sees is a solitary pair of “ dwar-palas” (gate-keepers). Buddha
sits at the end of a huge “chaitya” hall–a lonely figure in deep thought and
suffering. These were all big monasteries like Nalanda and Taxila. There are
small cubicles for the monks. They lead an austere life of asceticism, study
and contemplation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
now enter the third and final phase of our subject–the Gupta Age. If the age of
Buddha was material, the Mauryan religious, then the Gupta age was truly
spiritual. The rigorous “sadhana” of Asoka and his age bears fruit, and the
Gupta age finds the Indian personality completely emancipated. Hinduism revives
with all its traditions and vigour. Buddhism is absorbed into Hinduism. Buddha
becomes an “avatar” (incarnation) of Vishnu; and Mahayana Buddhism develops a
mythology and art (as at Amaravati) similar to the Hindu pantheon. It is an age
in which all foreign influences have been absorbed and Indianised, and its
character is self-possessed, urban and exuberant. India after many centuries of
darkness, is now again truly conscious of her own personality. In the age of
Buddha, as in ours today, the Indian personality was obsessively fixated to
material reality, and had completely given up idealism. The Mauryan age saw the
other extreme where India turned her face to reality, and in the seclusion of
Buddhist caves launched on an austere effort to recapture a vision of lost
Indian ideals. But it was only in the Gupta age that the rescued Indian
idealism found its beautiful expression in daily life. This was, therefore, an
age of song and dance, an age of the poetry of Kalidasa, an age of the nine
brilliant gems in the court of Vikramaditya, an age of the vast military
campaigns of Samudragupta, his personal accomplishments, his polished
intellect, his knowledge of scriptures, his poetic skill and proficiency in
music. The Indian personality again experienced a fundamental unity of
character which transcended all political, racial, linguistic and sectarian
distinctions. There were no guilt repressions in the personality. It was an age
which could afford the fullest enjoyment of life, by right of innate virtue. It
combined brilliant intellectual and spiritual development with the utmost sensuousness
of experience. Politically the country was integrated, and possessed a vigorous
national consciousness which found expression in the grand military campaigns
of Samudragupta and Vikramaditya, in the annexation of vast territories, in the
establishment of Indian colonies in distant parts of the world, and in the
emergence of Greater India in a florescence of political, intellectual,
artistic and spiritual attainments. All this found beautiful expression in
Ajanta, where, it has been said, “renunciation and enjoyment are perfectly
attuned, in an art at once of utmost intimacy and reserve.” The work of the
early medieval period had even greater force and national taste. And when we
turn to the sculpture of the 8th century–of Ellora, Elephanta and Mahabalipuram–we
are face to face with the zenith of Indian art. Shiva and Parvati on Mount
Kailas at Ellora and the Trimurti at Elephanta are the quintessence of the
Indian genius. They have a silent spiritual force, at once calm and vital. And
so true is the art that the stone passes away from sight and the essential
spirit immediately moves the devotee. If the age of Buddha showed the Indian
personality fixated to a degraded concept of sex, and to a coarse, perverted
relationship of man and woman, the Mauryan age was a complete negation of sex
and the Buddhist men of the age refused to even look at women. It was in the
Gupta or the medieval age that a healthy and elevated relationship in sex was
restored. Gurudev has sung truly of this mood in: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

literature it finds expression in the remarkable work “Kama Sutra,” and in the
temple architecture at Konarka and Khajuraho–a beautiful imagery of
sensuousness, poetry and vital living. Here we truly understand that where
religion ends, spirituality begins. The aim of religion is not to make people
turn their back on life, but rather to make it as intense and vigorous as
possible: not to live in the spirit, away from the material, but rather to
invest the most material with the essential spirit. No aspect of life, therefore,
can be excluded from the religious, least of all sex–the most vital quality in
the human being. It is characteristic of the Indian genius in this age that
Konarka and Khajuraho and others, which are actually temples of worship, should
not only not disregard, but spiritualise and deify the sexual principle by
depicting in sculpture all aspects of sex life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all aspects of our national life and culture today there is no attempt at
originality. We are, to use Gandhiji’s expression, “aping the Englishman”
blindly. Gurudev Tagore has said somewhere that there can be no intercourse
between a beggar and a prince. And it is as beggars that we approach the West
today, thinking the West a prince. If it is a college student, he approaches
Shakespeare not for audience, like a respectable man, but for a few mouldy
crumbs from the dingy backdoor of notes and guess papers. If it is technology,
our engineers have no ingenuity to understand peculiar local requirements and
the use of indigenous materials or skills; we are going headlong in a mad race
to build a carbon copy blueprint of European industry. If it is finance, we do
not take to austerity and sacrifice, but send Morarji Desai round the world
with a begging bowl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in our social life, our art, our aesthetics and crafts, we have done with
original thinking, and we have resorted to the more convenient expedient of
copying the West. We may here recall that, in some ways, even more than the
work of the Indian nationlists, it was the effort of noble and idealistic
Britons which first shook India out of her lethargy, and made her realise that
she had lost her personality completely, and had become a mere parasite of
Britain. Now we seem to have again slipped into that hypnotic state. And, more
than ever before, we have now to realise that, unless self-reliance and
self-respect are restored by a revival of Indian ideals, we as beggars will
never be able to eat at the same table as Europe or taste the choice fruits of
Europe’s virile culture, without being poisoned or falling ill. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dr. Bhagavandas, the distinguished scholar and philosopher, demonstrates this
thesis in his monumental work on the essential unity of all religions. Eleven
religions, viz., 1. Shin</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Judaism, 10. Christianity and 11. Islam are usually regarded as great, living,
and current at present. The book is evidently the result of a laborious study
of all these, and contemplation spread over a long period, and brings together
1150 parallel texts from the sacred books of these eleven living religions of
the world, in the original, with their English translations. All these texts
are arranged systematically in three parts: 1. the way of knowledge (Jnana), 2.
the way of devotion (Bhakti), 3. the way of works (Karma) which are also shown
to be common to all religions. The author succeeds in developing a taste in the
readers for discovering identities of thought in great records of the deepest
human experience in different languages. Without attaining such synthesis,
humanity cannot attain happiness here or elsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rajendra Prasad, the President of India, in his Foreword to this book, rightly
observes that the reason for the repetition of crusades, Jehads and individual
persecutions was that the people had not cared to study and understand the
fundamentals of different religions, and instead of appreciating their
essential unity, laid emphasis on the differences of form. Pursuit of wisdom
and practice of love are the basic assumptions of all living faiths. In the
words of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the scholar-philosopher, this book which points
out that there is a transcendent unity of religions, in spite of the apparent
empirical diversity, helps towards inter-</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Bhagavan Das, with his encyclopaedic knowledge of the origin and growth of
different religions, has made a notable contribution towards bringing people
together on the plane of mind and spirit. In the fitness of things, there is no
copyright in this book. The author feels, evidently that there can be no
originality in truth and there is only one eternal Truth for all to copy.
Herein he reminds us of Count Leo Tolstoy, who renounced copyright over his
books. This is a book that deserves to be read, re-read and digested inwardly.
A great book like this is like a great symphony which must be heard many times
before it can be really understood. The motto of live and let live, of
tolerance and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of toleration, and above all, the Realisation of
unity in diversity, is reflected in every page of this book. When the mass man
becomes the moral man, a community of mind with universal loyalty is created
and it becomes possible to live up to this motto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
author strives his utmost to clear the mists of misunderstanding and give to
the world a friendly countenance and character calculated to dissolve the rigid
postures and frozen attitudes and unveil rich horizons of the human spirit.
Asoka in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

to his own, with intent to enhance the glory of his own sect, in<i> </i>reality,
by such conduct, inflicts the severest injury on his own sect. Concord
therefore is meritorious.” In this connection, altruistic ideals like <i>Sarvesham
Santirbhavatu, Sarve Janah Sukhinobhavantu, Sarvadeva Namaskara, </i>meaning
let there be all round peace and happiness, equal homage to all Gods, are
significant. The printing and get up leaves nothing to be desired. The book
deserves to be translated into the different languages of the world. It is a
great book that the Doctor has given to philosophers and pious men for reverent
study, as Rajaji aptly puts it in the course of his appreciation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bengali poet. And whatever the race or religion, and the language in which the
creative artists expressed themselves, they have sought Truth and their paths,
though different, have led them to One God. Tyagaraja’s in his musical
compositions is the supremest expression of the universal mind. Since there is
nothing like a universal script which everybody in the world could read,

impossible task. To a person well-</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the <i>kriti </i>would
suffice for him. But, since the aim of the book under review, according to its
editor, is to “give Hindustani musicians in particular, and the world at large,
a clear grasp of the melodies themselves,” the use of some of the <i>gamaka </i>signs
(peculiar to violin–as the three violin plates show) is really a welcome
feature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Karnatic Music </i>is “a word I have coined to mean a shorter <i>Andola, </i>that
is a <i>gamaka </i>within the same <i>svara,” </i>This is only Andolita, a
gamaka described by Sarangadeva; <i>Aandolito laghuvegataha. </i>And <i>Andolika

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tyagaraja’s
compositions are very pliable and offer great scope for modulations. His direct
disciples preserved in palm leaves the compositions taught to them. Even then
pieces attained slight variations in each disciple’s hand and hence the
versions such as the Walajapet <i>paddhati, </i>the Umayalpuram <i>paddhati </i>etc.
These direct disciples in their turn have taught many more of their own
students who were innumerable, so that at present one comes across a music
school in every street, Thus the compositions of Tyagaraja are so deviated from
the original that even the front-rank musicians, instead of trying to preserve
the authenticity of the piece show off their skill by polishing and
embellishing the <i>kriti. </i>This assuredly is not to its advantage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

record the pieces of great composers, the original tune of the composition has
got to be maintained. This Mr. Ayyar has competently done. His capacity to take
pains has been immense. While he hopes for a world-wide recognition of his
work, and legitimately too, one feels that <i>108 Kritis of Sri Tyagaraja </i>would
have been complete if the author had given all the <i>charanas </i>for the
multi-charana pieces and a general annotation for each composition. But, all
the same, we are his debtors, for what he has given us; his is a noble
enterprise in the vast and difficult field of music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looks fitting enough to take the place of honour. Indeed, a sentence as the one
‘In my opinion Buddha lived Hinduism in his own life’, or the other one ‘I
found, Buddhism is nothing but Hinduism reduced to practice in terms of the
masses’ may go a great way to disabuse minds, in some quarters, of a belief in

historical places as Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, Jagayyapeta, Ghantasala and
Bhattiprolu, to erudite discussions pertaining to some of the great masters and
teachers of Buddhism who made Andhra their centre of teaching. Thus Nagarjuna,
Aryasena, Dignaga and Bhavaviveka come in for short sketches of their lives and
messages to humanity. A scrutiny of Buddhistic art in historical perspective
has been made by P. R. Srinivasan in a brief survey, of pre-Buddhistic Art,
while P. R. Ramachandra Rao has dwelt on the influence of Andhra art on
subsequent styles in South India and the East. Somasekhara Sarma diverts us
with a dissertation upon the tooth of the Buddha which became the bone of
contention and the cause of strife among the prominent rulers of the times.
‘Buddhism after the Buddha’, ‘Buddhism absorbed in Hinduism’, and ‘Prakrit
Inscriptions in Andhra’ throw sufficient light on research made by scholars so

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps,
the above passage sums up succinctly the entire basis of Indian Art. Those who
are yet uneducated in the values of Indian Art, because of a certain lack of
optical illusion in it which they are familiar with in Western representations,
bound up as they are with rules of perspective, may find here enough material
to make them conscious of a vast region till now concealed from their view. Let
us then listen to what a Master-painter of our times has to say on one of the
most vital of factors necessary for art-appreciation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
our mind’s eye the distant may be as good as the near and a nearby object grown
quite small or totally lost in a loss of emphasis or attention. There are no
fixed standards of measurement for the mind and distances are only relative,
that is, related to its moods. An Oriental artist either knows this or has this
knowledge at the back of his mind. He, therefore, denies that a break of our
eye-habit or an over-stepping of the rules of natural perspective must
necessarily spoil rhythm and beauty in his creations. The mind is the artist
and not the eye. It is the mind that looks at and responds to the created
beauty.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Anjilvel V. Matthew’s <i>Teacher and Friend </i>which forms the first volume of

qualities of intelligent precision and clarity. Dr. Matthew, devout Christian,
is a reputed name in the field of education, his specialist study consisting in
his application of up-to-date advanced psychological analysis to an
understanding of Christianity. Conceived and presented as a Book of Devotions,
the volume carries 365 Meditations, one for each day of the year–all based on
the teachings of Jesus, “his recorded words.” The ground covered is extensive;
every human problem, every aspect of human life has been touched upon with an
admirable relevancy. The scheme for daily studies in the Gospels, to supplement
the prayer, given under each section, shows the thoroughness with which the
work has been done. Here opens out a domain of spiritual light and opulence; a
prayer a day can well be an aid for any kind of readjustment in adult life, and
for the vital development of young lives toward faith, hope, and charity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may well be said of the present day Indians, politicians as well as laymen,
that they had made a Constitution and forgot about it completely. A democratic
Constitution lives by criticism, otherwise either it perishes or turns into an
instrument of dictatorship. It is in the light of the danger that we should
specially welcome such studies in the working of our parliamentary democracy as
the one sponsored by the Indian Bureau of Parliamentary Studies. What is now
published is the Report of the First Seminar held in February, 1956 Though much
of it deserves to be deleted, and seems to have been included more for show
than for scholarship, there are a few contributions which deserve our special
study, as they give an insight into the actual working of our system. Mention
should specially be made of those of P. Kodanda Rao, M. N. Kaul, N. C.
Chatterjee, and V. B. Gandhi. The Report deserves to be read by all

have claimed a niche in the temple of poetic genius. These lyrics are marked
with such intensity of feeling and vibrant heart appeal that Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu would fall into a trance singing them. He included them in his ‘kirtan’
and gave them wide currency throughout the Northern India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mainly after Jayadeva, but he drew freely, on other popular amatory works of

of worship belonging to a school of ‘Bhakti’. He is a man of the world, a
pleasure-seeker and a luxury-lover. He is a man by nature and dallying with young
minds, among whom Radha is the chief, is his sole pastime. He plans and
arranges meetings with her on the banks of the Jamuna, at her own house or in
the woods and pleasure gardens. He strokes back while she is fast asleep and
stealthily watches her bathing in the pond, her wet sari sticking to her body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

threshold of youth of which she is slowly growing conscious. Although adorned
with all the traditional attributes, the poet’s genius has endowed her with a

shapely breasts are hard and round. She slyly glances over them and covers them
under her sari with a coy smile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

interest in prurience. She is learning to be coquettish and her charm and

more exciting than the other and has lavishly described their fun and frolic
and playful activities. He has depicted Radha on a physical plane, who excites
lust rather than reverence and flirts with handsome Krishna. She is an object
of sensual gratification and represents the feudal taste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has described both the aspects of love: love in union and love in separation.
Radha is blossoming into youth and meets Krishna on the way. They gaze at each
other and still they gaze and still the wonder grows. Cupid shoots his arrows
thievishly and they fall in love at first sight. She lets her sari slip from
over her breasts, winks smilingly at him and encourages him to love. She can’t
endure a moment’s separation from him. When she learns that he is about to
leave for Mathura her heart brims with fear and anxiety and she coaxes her maid
to ask him to postpone his departure. But when the maid fails to prevail on
Krishna to do so, she flings away all bonds of modesty and etiquette and boldly
gives vent to her feelings. So intense is her love for him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

night and when she wakes up to learn of this her heart breaks. The poet has
beautifully compared her to a female partridge whose mate has flown away and
who cries painfully in his absence. The parrot, the cows and all her maids and
playmates are moved with sympathy for her. A palpable silence falls about her
and the banks of Jamuna where she used to meet Krishna and dally<i> </i>with
him are enveloped in loneliness. The poet has faithfully recorded her most
transient feelings and moods and gestures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Separation: </i>Separation tests the endurance of love. The physical distance
between the lovers burns the dross and taint of lust and true love purified of
all its carnal concomitants shines forth. The heart of the lovers is a scene of
expectancy and despair and Vidyapati has delineated these feelings in a
masterly manner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

tendency to display his learning and becomes pedantic. The descriptions often

suffering melts the poet’s heart and carries off the kindred reader. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

idea of it nauseates her in the absence of Krishna. “Whom should I adorn myself
for?” asks she peevishly. She wipes the vermillion mark off her forehead, and
casts her pearl necklace into the Jamuna. Sandalwood paste and soft moonlight
scorch and burn her like hot summer winds and aggravate her pain and agony. The
cool fragrant breeze of Sawan stings bites her and enkindle her passions. She
fondly hopes to meet Krishna in a dream but the Almighty is so cruel-hearted
that she fails to get to sleep. And when, perchance, she drops off for a moment
and sees Krishna in her dream she wakes up disturbed and writhes with pain. She
spends the night restlessly tossing about on her bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has been reduced to skin and bone and her maids fear to fan her with a lotus
leaf lest she should be blown away with the puff of breeze. This is the height
of poetic fancy. When her maids prompt her to forget such a callous lover who
has renounced her and gone away, she regrets her inability to do so, for her
very existence is bound up with his memory. The moment she drives him off her
thoughts she would cease to exist. She is reluctant to die as she has no one in
mind to whom she can bequeath Krishna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

heroine all the pangs of love in separation. His feelings are intense and he has
not missed even the minutest thought that may cross the mind of the love-lorn
heroine. His lyrics are replete with a spirit of romanticism and are a
wonderful product of conscious art. Elements of genuine folk songs survive in
the refrains, repetitions and interjections contained in these lyrics. He is at
once strong and restrained in the expression of elemental passions. He is
unexcelled in dainty sweetness, grace and movement. He weaves variations of
metaphor and music round a single statement and repeats sonorities to arouse incantatory
rhythm. He rounds off every single line with finished care without ever
sacrificing the organic unity of the entire poem. He favoured classical
conventions but never allowed his scholalship to chill his creative imagination
which is always ardent and marked <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>by<i>
</i></span>luxurious fancy and joyous abandon. His lyrics have all the freshness
and charm of youth, they are better and more directly sensual and exhibit the
lighter and more fanciful side of his genius. The form, the idea, the development
from start to finish are bee beautifully fashioned and correlated. They present
a curious and piquant combination of an ardent romantic imagination and an
outlook essentially worldly and matter of fact. In technique he is admirable
and while displaying, in no small measure, of the charm and grace of the Sanskrit
lyrists, he infuses them with innovations of his own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

matter of language also his courage is noteworthy. Flouting the traditions of
his age he chose Maithili, the dialect of the people as a vehicle of his lyrical
effusions. In this sense he was a true revolutionary poet and had an unswerving
confidence in the power and capacity of his language and diction to charm the
popular ear. He elevated Maithili from a local dialect to the language of poetry
and rightfully became its first poet and singer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

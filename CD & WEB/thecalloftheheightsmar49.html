(Hons.) Oxon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THEY
were no longer so very young when they started on the journey. They were no
longer in the flush of youth that urges to fantastic romantic deeds; they were
old enough to know quite calmly what they wanted, and to do it quietly, with
unhurried spontaneity. They were old enough, people said with half-hearted
reproach, to have known better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
had been nothing spectacular in the story of their relationship. It was just
one of those attachments that start as in a story-book but so often end in the
tragedy of reality. They had come to know each other as workers in a Basic
Education Centre where they had come from different parts of the country; they
were both already married and with pleasant homes. The same reason had prompted
them to join the training centre: they felt that the course would make more
useful citizens of them and enable them to work effectively in their own
villages. Thus an affection grew between them through forces quite outside any
reason, logic, or commonsense; it had grown through the months of broader
mutual understanding, of slowly deepening confidence, of increasing mutual
respect. This was no romantic attachment, for they had come to value each other
in spite of knowing the other’s weaknesses–they knew each other without
romantic illusions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had become friends, exchanging experiences and hopes, and discussing their
thoughts on life and its vagaries. They would discuss their work to which they
brought the sincerity of their interest and, from the interplay of their minds,
was born a simple philosophy, a wisdom through which they could assess anew the
values of life. They had other interests in common, apart from their work at
the Centre, for they both loved literature and music. Often, after the day’s
work, the inmates of the Centre would sit round him to hear him recite
poetry–sometimes improvised as he sat among them–or to hear him read from some
favourite book; or they would call upon her to sing to them, sitting hushed as
she sang, carried away to higher planes of feeling. It was not long before he
was nick-named The Poet, and teased for always seeming to be dreaming of other
things; while they nick-named her The Queen, because she always looked, even in
a crowd, as though she stood alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the evening gatherings of workers, a place would be kept for The Poet and The
Queen, by common consent and an unconscious feeling of fitness; then he would
tell her of the poems that had come to during the day while crossing a field or
watching the clouds sail over the distant hills, or noticing the splash of a
bright wild blossom by road-side. As he chanted his poems, she would feel
melodies well up within her, and she would sing his words to them, while the
inmates of the Centre laughed happily and declared that they needed no outside </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>entertainment
since they had their own provided for them by The Poet and The Queen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And so it went on until, one day, in an exchanged
look, they both knew that they had passed from one realm into the next, that
henceforth the bond between them was of a different quality. Henceforth, it
would no longer be the plain comradeship of two minds: henceforth, the
insistent urge of more acutely tuned senses, the suffusing awareness of
emotions would make them continuously conscious of each other as apart from
their fellow-workers, continuously conscious that, in the midst of their
comrades, they were bound together by different ties. And it was this change of
quality in their companionship that also altered the attitude of their
surroundings towards themselves. With that exchanged look, they left the
story-book and entered reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Work
nevertheless continued, a constant and comforting as it were denominator:
sometimes it was in a song of exhilaration, sometimes against dull oncoming
waves of doubt and restlessness stirred by the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>implications of
their changed relations, sometimes in a deep certainty which gave them the
confidence to feign indifference and carefree detachment. It had been a common interest
in their work which had brought them together, and now they wove the new
pattern of their lives across this warp of work; the pattern became a fuller
expression of their richer communion–their work became as it were a child to
which they dedicated the flower of their ability, their deepest sincerity.
Their smallest action, the smallest task accomplished was done with the thought
of the other, like an offering of the self in token of gratitude for the
affection and respect they bore each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
going about his tasks during the day, The Poet would feel rise within him
ripples of lyricism, an imagery ever and again inspired and suffused with the
vision of the one whom he now sensed was the tangible embodiment of his manhood
dreams. Then, in the evenings,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>under
the half-inquisitive, vaguely hostile looks of their fellows, now that the
story-book state had been left behind, he would murmur to her fruits of the
day’s thoughts, the songs that had risen in his heart during the hours of work.
Over her sleep would float the memory of songs offered to her in the tones of
his voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet,
at first imperceptibly then gradually more and more imminent, there began to
loom over them the tragedy of reality. With its appearance moments of carefree,
spontaneous comradeship left for ever, and the consciousness of obligations and
exigencies crept over The Poet and The Queen, the consciousness of the
anchorage of their own to the lives of others. Excluded from a relationship
that as it were formed an island in the midst of the stream of community life,
their fellow-workers now regarded the two with a sort of vague resentment, an
uneasy envy which turned every exchanged remark between The Poet and the Queen,
every moment of conversation into something snatched, something almost
unlawfully taken. There could no longer be any mistaking of the disapproval of
an understanding, a unity of affection that could blossom as would a wild
flower in a hedge, outside the ordered boundaries of the garden. The former
innocence of their meetings at the evening gatherings was tarnished: they began
to talk together and to look as from behind a veil of indifference, straining
all the former spontaneity of their friendship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
flower that had blossomed in the free sunlight of mutual attraction, that asked
nothing but to give of its fragrance and to glow in the response to the charm
it shed around, now felt bruised by furtiveness; the flower began to wilt in
the breath of insinuation. One day, as they were both at work in different
parts of the Centre, they came quite independently to the same determination.
“We must go away,” they thought as they worked and, when they at last met in
the evening gathering, “We can catch the train on Saturday,” they whispered to
each other. To leave everything behind was easy enough, for everything they
valued lay within themselves and ahead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
train took them towards the north, towards the hills. It was a long journey on
hard benches surrounded by the swarming of all those to whom the valued is the
tangible, to whom a leaving behind is a losing. In their little island of
happiness, there were no hard benches for the two, and the swarming to and fro
in and out of the carriage, the shouted confidences, the incipient quarrels,
the impatient words, the gruff neighbourly kindlinesses, were as a rough sea
tumbling and roaring against the shores of their unassailable world. With the
end of the train journey they reached the foot of the hills; the last stage of
the journey lay ahead and on foot–an ascent to the final heights. As they left
the railway carriage and the station, they were freed from the last bonds with
what lay behind; as a ripe fruit leaves the branch bearing its own life within
itself, so they left the train and the crowds and the station, with everything
they valued within themselves and ahead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
hostelry for pilgrims offered them a space overlooking the river, and here they
spent the night. They slept, lulled by the joyous rhythmic and powerful melody
of fast speeding waters; and, with the sharp breath of dawn, they woke and
bathed in the snow-chilled current. The sun had just topped the hills and
pierced the river mists when they returned to the hostelry, where they were
summoned to register their names before departure. The Keeper of the hostelry
sat behind his ponderous ledger in which had been inscribed generation after
generation of pilgrims; there he sat as would some stern Recorder at the Gates
of the Hereafter, forehead freshly marked, snow-white clothes forming a hale of
irreproachability around him. Thin-nibbed pen poised between hard fingers, the
Keeper of the hostelry pored importantly over his pages as the two entered to
take their leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Affronted Dignity looked up, a sharp reproof on his
lips; but the reproof was never uttered for it was quite true–there they stood
before him a poet and his beloved. The Keeper stared at them and, as he stared,
something of the glow that suffused them seemed to touch him <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>like some remembered fragrance; and the
Keeper stared, then he </span>shrugged his shoulders helplessly. “Oh, let them
go,” he thought, a half-reluctant, half-deprecating concession to his own
weakness.</p>

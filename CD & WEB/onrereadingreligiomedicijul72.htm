was Andrew Lang who once said “to write on <span class=SpellE>Izaak</span>

moment one closes down Shakespeare’s ‘Sonnets’ he is likely to banish all
thoughts pertaining to Mr. W. H., the Rival Poet and the Dark Lady and begin to
admire at Shakespeare the poet who raised Love to the level of religion and
worshipped it. The people would read Shakespeare’s ‘Sonnets’ day in and day out
for here is “the greatest love poetry” to quote C. S. Lewis. Love in the sense
of Agape, not Eros. Likewise when we come to the end of Browne’s ‘<span
class=SpellE>Religio</span> Medici’ we <span class=SpellE>realise</span> in no
time that the author comes nearer to our hearts not because of his vocabulary,
not because of his <span class=SpellE>latinisms</span> but because of his
profound philosophy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thomas Browne who is acclaimed by George <span class=SpellE>Saintsbury</span>
as “the greatest prose writer, perhaps in the whole range of English literature”
was a famous physician before he became a philosopher. His ‘<span class=SpellE>Religio</span>
Medici’ is a confession of his faith. It is not an “Elizabethan lumber room” as
some would make us believe. His views on the problems of life and religion are
contained in this book. Browne wrote this book because “there was raging battle
of sects and churches as obstinate and as confused as the famous conflict in
Spenser where the knights are constantly changing their allies and their
enemies.” This book is an attempt to make his religious opinions clear to his
own mind and to defend himself and his profession against the ancient charge of
impiety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may not be a philosopher in the real sense of the term. Surely he is not an
Indian ascetic or Yogi or a follower of the Buddha or of Kant sitting either on
the banks of the Ganges or on the mountain tops having closed the eyes in quiet
meditation and pondering over the world’s ills and problems. But his tolerant
views expressed on religion, his conception of the Universe and the role
assigned to the human spirit in the great drama of existence are enough to
speak of him as a philosopher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other person except a philosopher can have such tolerant views and brotherly
outlook. The book ‘<span class=SpellE>Religio</span> Medici’ expounds a tolerant
view of Christianity. Though he is of the ‘Reformed new-cast Religion’ he is
not vehemently opposed to the Catholic Church for in his view Protestants and
Catholics–both are Christians. He is not so fanatical as to hate even the
infidels. Browne does not hold a man in contempt because his faith is different
from his or because his views do not agree with his own ideas. His firm faith
in Christianity leads him to accept without doubt or question the mysteries and
miracles pertaining to it. He accepts the passage in the Bible as true. He
never questions their veracity or <span class=GramE>apply</span> his logic. As
Edmund <span class=SpellE>Gosse</span> observed, Browne, like his contemporary
philosopher Pascal, held the realms of Science and Religion as entirely
distinct. Neither Pascal nor Browne allowed science to interfere in the domain
of faith or with the dogmatism of moral ideas. Thus we see an amalgamation of
dual personality in him. The philosopher has obtained his ideas of God from two
books–one the Holy Book and the other Book of Nature. He believes that God
directs our actions though we commonly believe that the events of our life are
determined by destiny. For destiny is nothing but the will of God. He says the
Gunpowder’s plot, the defeat of the Armada and the victory of the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Netherlands</st1:country-region></st1:place>
are all the mysterious workings of the will of God. Browne deplores the schisms
which have given rise to diverse beliefs. He says it is madness to bring men to
reason by force or by sword–a principle which reminds us of Gandhi. It is as
cruel an act as that of Nero’s. He refers to Christ’s promise that all
Christians will be united one day or other. He longs to see that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a doctor he cures the bodies of his patients with medicines and as a
philosopher he cures their souls with prayers. Browne loves all mankind alike.
To him all are equal and he is charitable to each and all. In the second part
of his ‘<span class=SpellE>Religio</span> Medici’ he advises us to love even
the poor. <span class=GramE>For he says “who <span class=SpellE>giveth</span>
to the poor <span class=SpellE>lendeth</span> to the Lord.”</span> So we must
love our <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span> for God’s sake. That is true love
and that is the source of all happiness. Like Saint Francis of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Assisi</st1:place></st1:City>, he loves even creatures, birds and
animals for they are also a part of God’s creation. So when he sees a scorpion
or a serpent or a toad or a viper, he is not startled to pick up a stone to
kill them and smash them. Like the ancient mariner of S. T. Coleridge he
admires even at the slimy creatures. All that he scorns or laughs at is the mob
so opposed to reason, virtue and religion. Man should not question and doubt the
validity of the scriptures. We must have implicit faith in God. Men cannot
question God as the Pot cannot question the Pot-maker. Browne’s views on ‘sex’
are queer like that of a true philosopher. He will be happy if the population
is produced by any other method like the plants and trees. He abhors the word ‘sex’
as he does the ‘Hell.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Browne
does not believe in the theory of Pythagoras that souls pass into beasts. He is
not afraid of Death like many great people. Browne’s peaceful life was
disturbed occasionally by the death of his children. Out of his ten children
six died right in front of his eyes. He knows full well that Death is certain
and inevitable. So he bore their loss as the inexorable Fate. After the shock <span
class=GramE>at every bereavement</span> he soon regained his normal placidity.
Browne <span class=SpellE>honours</span> the man who hates life. For when men
die the birds and vultures pounce upon them and tear them into pieces. The sight
filled him with disgust as the sight of the slaves at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">New Orleans</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Town</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
filled Abraham Lincoln with disgust and moved him to tears. Like Donne,
Whitman, Emily Dickinson and Tagore, Browne considers Death as the gateway to
immortality but not a thing to be afraid of. Francis Bacon said “Death is no
terrible enemy.” It is the accompaniments of Death that frighten more than the
death itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
world we live in appears to the philosophers in a different way. Browne the
philosopher regards the world not as an inn to live in but a hospital to die
in. World to him is a mock-show and as Shakespeare, Browne too thought every
man and woman is an actor in it. So in his short span of life man should think
and <span class=SpellE>realise</span> God. Man the microcosm of the Universe,
if he neglects his business it will be provoking the wrath of God. So his aim
should be high. As Emerson said “hitch your wagon to the star,” man should fix
his attention on God. Like <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arnold</st1:place></st1:City>’s
Scholar gipsy he should always await the Heaven-sent spark. Man should always think
about Truth that is God. He should not give even least importance to wealth and
riches. He should never run after gold even in his dreams. Though Browne is not
born rich he does not stoop to gold. <span class=GramE>For he knows full well
the words of the Bible, “It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle rather than for a rich man to enter the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">kingdom</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Heaven</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.”</span>
Moreover, the riches cannot buy one necessary of the Soul. So if gold is God,
Browne will be the first man to become an atheist. <span class=GramE>For he
cannot persuade himself to <span class=SpellE>honour</span> what the world
adores.</span> For him there is no happiness here in this world except in God.
This world is full of transient, ephemeral and broken joys. All else is vanity
and everything earthly. What the world calls happy is to Browne a delusion and
an illusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus
one finds Browne awakening the earth-bound mortals from their deep slumber to
the realisation of God. As <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Milton</st1:City></st1:place>,
Browne too pointed out the just ways of God to the earthly mortals. Few doctors
of medicine could have written such a book and as such it is unique. The
allusions, the philosophy, the learning bear witness to his vast reading and
deep meditation. On matters of theology, Bacon is on par <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with<i> </i></span>Browne. But a more exact
comparison can be made with Pascal, his contemporary French philosopher. The
only difference is that Pascal ended his life as an ascetic and a
thorough-going pessimist as regards human knowledge and <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>
believing in nothing except the necessity of a humble resignation to the will
of God, whereas Browne lived and died as an optimist pursuing his hobbies and
science. It is not too much if we say that if Vasco de <span class=SpellE>Gama</span>
had not rounded the sea-route to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> somebody would have done it,
but if Browne had not been born there would have been no ‘<span class=SpellE>Religio</span>
Medici.’ In his prefatory note to ‘Gitanjali’ W. B. Yeats once wrote “I have
carried the manuscript of these translations with me for days reading it in
railway-trains or on the top of omnibuses and in restaurants and I have often
had to close lest some stranger should see how much it moved me.” And I am sure
Browne’s book ‘<span class=SpellE>Religio</span> Medici’ is being read down the
ages and round the clock for its philosophy, ideas and ideals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

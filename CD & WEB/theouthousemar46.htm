spirits. I could not ignore an eye- witness’s account. The English there in the
western hemisphere are a highly sceptical lot. But even there some assert the
existence of spirits. I began to think of the particular spirit that possessed
Kamalabai. I was most fascinated by its ability to fetch bricks, a useful
material for the construction of dwelling houses. Bricks are now a bit too
costly. won’t it be a blessing to have such a spirit in the house? It would be
so useful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I had long been planning to raise an out-house in
my yard. If the spirit is obliging, the house can be ready in a trice. There
won’t be much difficulty. In hardly a month it can supply the bricks necessary
for my house. If still the supply continues I can make a good business out of
it. It would be paying, I am sure. I must somehow attract the spirit to my
house. I must congratulate myself on the bright idea dawning on me. But how to
get at the spirit? That’s a problem. It’s not so impracticable as I feared. I
see a way out. Suppose I put myself in touch with the exorciser and pray him to
divert the spirit he is driving out of. Kamalabai to my own house. The
solution, good in its own way, did not appeal to me on second thoughts. After
all, it may be imprudent to divulge this matter to others. The benefit
derivable from its services is too tempting for me to sacrifice. I resolved,
therefore, to summon it by my own sincere and unaided efforts. My heart
accordingly breathed out a fervent prayer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I thought, a funny story. But now, in the light of what my aunt had told me, it
appeared so convincing. If there exists a brick-laying spirit, there must also
be a gold-laying spirit. If the spirit live with me and yields me gold, there
would be no end to my fortune. I now remembered my wife’s long deferred wish
for a gold chain. But, in the first place, the spirit must come-hither. Next it
must fetch gold, if not in large quantities, at least in driblets. As the
intimacy between us ripens, I can suggest the place where it’s available in
large quantities, say the Kolar mines. On assuming this certainty, my mind
became a prey to a number of misgivings. There is trouble if the government
gets an inkling of it. They may levy a crushing tax which must be paid even
after the spirit leaves me in the lurch. If they are able to trace my
prosperity to its source, they might specially invite the spirit to fill their
treasuries. Therefore–hush, hush,–none should know of this spirit. I must
conceal it in my house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

extortionate Deity* who filches His half from a devotee’s offerings. I have
committed myself already. It cannot be withdrawn, I mean the prayer, nor can it
be transferred to another deity without giving offence to Him. The Lord can
easily detect that I shirked giving His dues and therefore changed my loyalty.
He may resolve to take me to task. It’s a sin to think such thoughts. I felt
duly penitent and at once begged His forgiveness. Every cloud has a silver
lining. If the devil is a gold-getter I can with a contented heart surrender a
half to Him and grow rich even with the remaining half. But if the devil is a
poor thing and gets nothing else but fuel, it complicates the situation. It’s

invitation. Will it leave me in peace even then? I wonder, But why should
it?–rose a countermanding thought. The first impulse was defeated by my natural
greed for gold. The thought was as repulsive as dashing a cup of nectar lifted

curiosity. I ran out and devoured with my eyes the open courtyard in front of

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A furlong more to my house. But I could see a light
beaming from the house. No mistake in this. Clear as anything, the light was
streaming forth through the open window. “Hell-fire on it! Is it the spirit?
Has it contrived to get in during my absence, and is it having a close survey
of the house? My heart well nigh broke at the very thought of it. With slow
dragging feet I came nearer and nearer; stood awhile in front of my house an
looked up for a minute. I also saw somebody moving about in the house; then the
thought dawned on me that my wife had returned with the children; I chuckled
within myself and twitted myself for thinking otherwise. I ran inside and
enquired. “O! When did you arrive, and why did you not write to me?” She
explained that she had arrived a few hours earlier; that she could get inside
even during my absence, by means of the duplicate key she had always carried
with her; and that she had hastily prepared the food; the children tired by the
journey were asleep. Then she enquired “What news?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>She had upset my apple-cart by arriving a trifle
too early and unexpectedly. I had thought of taking her by surprise by
employing more workmen and presenting to her the <i>fait accompli </i>of a nice
tidy house. But I felt robbed of half my enthusiasm by the sudden turn of
events. So I resolved not to play the spoil-sport by volunteering information
on the matter nearest to my heart. I wanted to try if a fraction of the
surprise, if not the whole of it, as, originally planned, could be roused. For
the night at least, mum is the word. Next day, the timber man may astonish her.
Then it would be time to give her information piece-meal on the relevant
points, scrupulously avoiding all reference to the spirit. Not that she would rejoice
at my securing such a helpful devil; but purely for selfish personal
reasons–that I might not command as much respect as before. Therefore, I should
say, “I don’t owe anybody anything. I thought of some work and therefore
started a business.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

alliance for our daughter, paying the necessary price, of course. In a day or
two I shall get you a gold chain of a design after your heart.” She flared up,
“ Phew enough of this mockery please! No more wishful thinking! You have hardly
discharged the debt on the house and what is it you say? One would think you
are expecting a gold mine to open out under your feet.” But I repeated, in a
tone of confidence, “You will be convinced by deeds.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

noticed my wife shouting, “Whoever wanted so much timber? It’s not for us.
Enquire at the next door.” But seeing that the depot clerk was adamant, she had
to raise her voice and repeat, “Don’t you hear? Nobody ordered timber here.” I ran
out to her and said in a coaxing voice, “ O! You don’t know. It’s for us; I
bought the timber.” She gasped, “What for?” and began observing me as though I
had been deranged. Then I told her, “This material is for our out house. The
workmen will be coming here shortly. You derided me last night by asking,
“Where’s the money? Now what do you say to it. The house will be ready in a
couple of weeks. Come along. I shall show you the bricks, lots and heaps of
them in our yard.” These words made her look blank. I caught her by the hand
and rushed out into the yard paying no heed to what she said, “What, you never
breathed a word to me!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Not a single brick. On the other hand, I found to my unutterable chagrin a wall
rising up between my compound and my neighbour’s and several workmen busy
there. I was so confident that the devil would never cheat me. I turned round
on her and demanded how she could remain cool as a cucumber when our neighbour
was committing daylight robbery by employing a number of workmen and removing
all this valuable material from our premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

explained, “Why do you break down like that? How can I prevent people taking
what’s their own? Our neighbour’s wife requested me, ‘There’s hardly any room
in our yard. Pray allow us to stock our bricks in your yard for the
construction of the wall.’ I thought we would lose nothing by obliging her.
This morning the workmen have come; they used up the bricks, and, the trifle
remaining over, shoved it into a corner of their own yard.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a saying in Sanskrit that discussions and Counter discussions reveal Truth.
But this wise saying is falsified by the heated controversies which rage
amongst literary artists and their critics. They manifest a mulish obstinacy
and cling to the opinions which they have once fancied. It is said that a man
who cannot write a novel becomes a critic. There is thus a greater number of
critics today who pronounce favourable or unfavourable judgments on Literature
than artists who produce first-class Literature. Controversies and quarrels
resound much more loudly than first-class stories and novels and plays and
verse. This is all right so far as it is a token that people’s interest in
Literature is alive. But apart from this these literary controversies seem to
fie overdone, particularly since they follow set unchangeable patterns. And one
very much wishes that a strenuous effort was made to make the literary public
understand the fundamentals of Literature, so that they would be able to decide
for themselves, once and for all, which particular school of literary criticism
was right and which wrong. I believe that the literary controversies continue,
and the reading public goes on believing the men whose only virtue is a loud
and abusive voice, because they are rarely invited to do some thinking about
the essential principles of creative Literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
exactly is Literature? Why does the writer create it? Why does the reader read
it? Bradman, the world famous Australian cricketer, in his remarkable
autobiographical book on cricket asks “Why Cricket?”, and proceeds to answer
that question. In a similar fashion let us ask, “Why Literature?” Why is it
produced, and why is it read? From where comes the urge to write a beautiful
story? And the urge to read a beautiful poem? In other words, what is the
intrinsic purpose and function of literature?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sanskrit word “Pratibha” is rather difficult to translate into English. Its
exact shade of meaning and suggestion eludes translation. I am, therefore,
using the phrase “creative imagination” as the one that comes nearest in
meaning to the Sanskrit word. As an alternative you may use the phrase “poetic
genius”. Whichever phrase you choose, I mean by it the faculty which grapples
with the Riddle of Beauty that lies hidden in the Universe, as Science grapples
with the Riddle of Truth. Nature is made of millions of inanimate objects and
living things. And just as they have their properties which science tries to
determine, they have their Beauty too. The bottomless depth of the sea, the
summits of mountains covered with snow, the rivers, the trees and birds and
wild animals and insects, the fruits and the flowers, the rain and wind,
animals and men and women, all these have, on the one hand, specific properties
governed by laws, and on the other hand they have each a Beauty of its own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
want to understand the myriads of things which surround us, but we also want to
enjoy their beauty. We must understand the ocean, so that we may build ships
and cross it. But we would also like to enjoy its Beauty. We strive to
understand the mountain–its surface and the layers inside its womb; but we also
crave for the sheer enjoyment of its majesty. The properties of trees and
plants have to be understood before we can make them bear fruit and flower. But
there is also a grace and a beauty in the trees and plants and fruit and flower
which give us pure enjoyment. We react to our surroundings intellectually and
also emotionally. In each one of us there is a scientist and also an artist.
Our reason unravels the mystery of Truth. And our creative imagination
discovers the Beauty that lies in all the things of which Nature is made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is Beauty in the tides of the seas, in the terrific eruption of the volcano, in
the blossoming of the fragrant flowers, in the movement of the tiny creeping
insect, in the lovers’ embrace and their sweet words and kisses, in the
innocent prattle of a child, in the agonies of a dying soldier, in the
heart-rending shrieks of a mother who has lost her only beloved child in the
sobs of a disappointed lover or a widow. In fact there is Beauty everywhere–in
the soft caressing moonlight as well as the destructive burst of a volcano, in
the laughter of men and women as well as in their screams of utter grief.
Beauty is where you find it. The artist finds it everywhere, since he possesses
uncommon faculties of perception, absorption, and interpretation. A well-known
Marathi poet-saint Ramdas has said, “The poet sees things which even the Sun
fails to penetrate.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We,
common mortals, do not feel our joys and sorrows to their full measure, and we
also lack the power to give expression to what little we feel. But the poet,
the novelist, and the playwright can, by the power of sympathy, enter into our
feelings and can express them beautifully. In the hands of the artist, even a
sad experience turns into a thing of Beauty. The artist finds Beauty in the
wrinkled face of an old beggar woman, and when he paints her face, puts it in a
frame, and hangs it in an exhibition, we stand before the picture and exclaim
“Beautiful!”. The very face which in actual life we will call horrid and ugly
and detestable becomes beautiful when presented as a piece of art. This is the
magic of Literature–the magic of all Art. The business and purpose of
Literature is thus to unravel the Riddle of Beauty and to make you see Beauty
and joy wherever you turn your eyes. At the touch of the literary artist grim
things lose their grimness, sorrows lose their sadness, villainy loses its
detestability, cowardice sheds its pitiability, and even vice drops its
shamelessness. Like the Sun gilding all things with its splendour and light,
Literature makes all things beautiful and delightful. The purpose of Literature
is thus to interpret to you the delight and beauty in your life. That is why
you look upon the poet and the novelist and the playwright and the storywriter
as your representatives. They help us to experience the emotional exuberance in
our lives which, without their help, we shall miss. They are the manufacturers
of an indescribable delight without which our lives will not be full.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
actual life which has fallen to the lot of each one of us is limited and
narrow. If I am a Professor I am not a soldier, a statesman, a shopkeeper, a
bank clerk, a bus driver, or a postman. The very fact that I live the life of a
professor precludes me from a thousand other ways of life. I live within the
four walls of my house, and lead a life which is, as Shakespeare said, “Cabined,
cribbed, and confined.” I become impatient with these limitations on my
experience. There is an urge in me to peep into the lives of other men and
women–brave and timid, kind and cruel, generous and miserly, virtuous and
vicious. Each one of us experiences this urge to break through the bonds of our
narrow lives and to enter into the lives of others–soldiers and prisoners,
lovers and gamblers, devoted wives and prostitutes, saints and crooks! “Ekoham
Babusyam.” “I am only one but I want to be many!” “I am single but wish to be
multiple.” Our ancient philosophy believes that this was the urge that made
Brahman take on Maya, and manifest Himself in millions of things and living
beings. Literature owes its origin to the same urge–the urge which lies in the
depths of the heart of every man–to smash the limitations of the actual, and to
enter into the lives of all kinds of people. This is not “Escapism”. If you
need a name and a label for it, you may call it the “widening of the self”–its
ennobling, its enrichment. And the irresistible lure of Literature lies in the
fact that it affords to its readers this enrichment, giving them the much
desired opportunity to rise above the prison of actual lives, and to spread the
wings and to soar into the limitless expanse of Experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
catch the hidden beauty in whatever is seen or heard or experienced and to
express it so as to convey this beauty to others–this is the primary urge that
leads to the writing of poetry or the short story or the novel or the play. And
if this is the urge behind all Literature, its purpose and aim is obviously the
sharing of the emotional mood by the writer with his readers. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
essence of Literature is this Emotional mood</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which
our Sanskrit critics called “Rasa”. They considered it as the very </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>heart
and core of Literature, and defined poetry by saying, “That alone is Poetry
which affords us the delight of a deep Emotional Mood.” The Literary Artist is
he who possesses an uncommon emotional sensitivity and also an uncommon power
of imparting his own emotional exuberance to his readers. A poet or a novelist
is different from ordinary people by virtue of his keen emotional
susceptibility. We, common men, lack this keenness. Our susceptibility is
blunt. We are not moved deeply by what we see or hear, by the comic and the
tragic things that we witness. This is why we miss the beauty of life. The poet
however is differently made. Even an ordinary thing like a butterfly fluttering
round a flower may send him into raptures of joy. And the sight of a wounded
bird may cause him a deep anguish. This is why the poet is regarded as
mad–unfit to live in a society of sober people whose cold callousness helps
them to forget life’s joys and sorrows easily. The things which impress us
common people only casually and superficially, impress the poet with shattering
intensity, so that he must share his emotional experience with others. This is
why and how poetry comes to be written. The intensity and quickness and
subtlety of emotion, and the power to express an emotional experience in
beautifu1 words–these are the essential virtues of the literary artist. They
are the true test of his goodness and greatness. And, therefore, they are also
the only test of the quality of all Literatutre. A novelist is great, not because
he champions a social, religious or political cause, but because his writing
bears the hall-mark of his emotional depth and intensity, and also of his power
to convey to the readers his own emotional exuberance. All other tests are
evidently extraneous and irrelevant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Literature would never arise, and there would </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>also be no
heated controversies about the role of Literature. It is easy to argue that
since man lives in a society, he is in duty bound to serve his society.
Therefore, the poet and the novelist too must contribute his share towards
social reform and national regeneration. In other words the poet and the
novelist must use his pen in the service of the society and the nation. This
argument is very attractive, and therefore, there arises a school of critics
who maintain that the purpose of a novel must be to arouse political
consciousness, that propaganda is the business of the novelist, and that his
art would be great only if it promotes morality, imparts some valuable lesson
to the people, and is marked by the fervour of the social reformer or a
national leader. We shall judge Literature, they declare, by this standard, and
they refuse to sign a certificate of merit if a literary Artist follows in his
writings the maxim of “Art for the sake of Art”. They contend that “Art for the
sake of Art” is a vicious and dangerous doctrine, and that the artist must use
his art in the service of his society and his nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
argument is so facile that timid and weak-kneed novelists are frightened out of
their wits and begin to think that, in order to achieve greatness in
Literature, they must achieve greatness as a social reformer or a political
propagandist. They begin to give their verse and stories, and novels and plays
a political colour. They join the ranks of the Congressites, or the
Mahasabhaites, or the Socialists or Communists, and hope thereby to be called
great literary artists. There can be no greater danger to Literature which must
be repudiated with all possible vehemence and determination by those who have
the true welfare of Literature in their hearts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

writer lives in a society. Who will contest this obvious truth? It is also true
that since the writer lives in a society he must serve it. But is political or
social propaganda the only way to serve society? Certainly not. There are
countless ways in which a man may give of his best in the service of the
society or the nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unfortunately
we in India are so obsessed by the importance of political propaganda and
agitation that we forget that a nation does not live and thrive by politics
alone. Our undue obsession with politics is perhaps the hang-over of the
struggle for liberty which engaged all our attention and energy for more than a
century. But now that we are a free nation we must cure ourselves of this
obsession and the consequent distortion of perspective which has affected our
literary standards of judgment. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We must understand
that although a literary Artist owes a debt or service to his fellowmen, since
he lives in a society, he must not be told–and if he be told he must not
believe–that the only way in which he can serve society is to sell somebody’s
moral or political ideas, and to turn his writings into a warehouse of
political doctrines. The literary Artist must tell his critics that the is far
bigger than politics. A politician’s service may catch the public notice most
easily. There may be a glamour about it as there is about the work of a film-star.
But this should not, in our eyes, minimise the value of the service which other
men render to society. We must not forget the saying “they also serve who stand
and wait.” The soldier, the banker, the farmer, the scientist–hundreds of
persons who are not politicians–serve society in their own ways. Their service
is as important as that of the politician. If we want to build a great free
nation, let us remember that we can achieve all round strength and greatness
only by asking the soldier to become a model soldier, by asking a scientist to
become a model scientist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

possesses an intrinsic value, and the best service to society or nation which
the writer can give is by functioning as a literary Artist, without accepting
the dictation of the preacher or the politician. Just as men must learn to use
weapons and to fight, just as they must learn the pursuit of business and
industry, they must also learn to be sensitive and alive to the joyful and
sorrowful experience which life brings them, so that they will come to find
beauty in life and they will achieve an enrichment of the heart. Men must learn
to laugh and to weep heartily. They must cultivate a capacity for the
enrichment of the heart.. Who will help men in the cultivation of the capacity if
not a literary Artist? The writer must, therefore, have confidence in the value
of the service which he renders to society as an artist, and he must never for
a moment believe that he will be great only if he stands on the props of moral
or political propaganda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

regimentation of Literature is a very dangerous doctrine to which genuine
lovers of Literature and true artists will never submit. The experiment of
producing Literature under State control and according to politically conceived
blue-prints has been tried in Russia with disastrous results. Soviet Russia has
not produced that type of Literature which the pre-revolution Russian writers
gave to the world. If the history of the Literature of the world has any lesson
for us, it is that the greatness of Literature–its lasting quality–has nothing
to do with social or political propaganda. The domination of propaganda kills
the finer qualities of Literature. Shakespeare never aimed at teaching or
preaching. Kalidas and Bhavabhuti were not propagandists. The creator of Faust
did not sell any political ideas. Even Ibsen was not a champion of any
political cause. Nor was Galsworthy. If any great novels or plays, marked to
some extent by a fervour of political or social reform, have lasted through the
passage of time and become immortal, they have done so, not because of, but in
spite of, the propaganda they contained. What made these books immortal was
their artistic excellence–the subtlety and the depth of the emotion which the
writer experienced and the power with which he conveyed his emotional
exuberance to his readers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

do not intend to suggest that the poet or the novelist must remain strictly
aloof from political ideas and ideals. On the contrary, I do believe that as a
citizen of the nation the writer cannot help being aware of the political
events happening in his country, and also in the world. I shall go one step
further and say that since the writer is essentially an artist, his political
consciousness will be more keen than that of other men, his admiration of those
who lead the country and fight for her liberty will be more warm, and his
disgust for the forces which retard the progress of his nation more profound.
It is farthest from my mind to suggest that the literary Artist lives, or should
live, in a water-tight world of his own–a sort of ‘fools’ paradise’–where
serious social and political ideas cannot find access. My belief on the
contrary, is that the Artist is more susceptible than the common people to all
the things that happen around him, and therefore his national or political
consciousness is bound to be much more acute than that of a common citizen. But
it is one thing to admit all this and quite another thing to demand that the
writer must turn his poetry or stories or novels into a vehicle of political
doctrines, and to threaten that he would not be called great unless he plays
the role of a preacher and a propagandist. How ridiculous and misconceived is
this threat which is flung at the writers of today! Literature does not have the
strength to bring about a revolution. And is there any shame in admitting this?
Is there any shame in admitting that you cannot make a sword out of gold? Is
there any shame in admitting that a beautiful garden of flowers does not give
man the food which the paddy fields yield? Literature was not born for the

novels or problem plays, you cannot </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>expect him to take up
each and every problem and make it the subject of his books. There are great
things happening in free India today. Take for example the Bhakra Nangal Dam.
It is indeed a great project which will bring happiness to millions of people.
But can it be said that because it is a wonderful project of which India should
be proud, therefore a writer like me should produce a novel about it? Take
again the problem of Kashmir, or the problem of United Maharashtra. Why, even
the sterling problem is a vital one, so far as the interests of our nation are
concerned. But do you mean that because these are the burning questions of the
day, therefore our writers of fiction must turn them into subjects of novels
and plays?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not produced in this way. A novel or a play is a piece of art, and the
artist must feel deeply about what he writes, and will write only about that
which moves his emotions. A writer is not a machine. He is not a slave. You
cannot dictate to him, “write about this and write about that.” He cherishes
his own freedom, and will write only about that which moves him deeply. And his
greatness as a writer will be totally irrespective of his contribution to
political propaganda. Rabindranath Tagore is acclaimed as one of the greatest
writers modern India has produced. Did he preach politics in his novels and
plays? Is there a single novel of his which aimed at bringing about a political
revolution? He lived in the days of the Bengal Partition. The ruthless
partition of Bengal was a political event which insulted and enraged forty
crores of Indians and led to a country-wide agitation, the like of which was
not seen before. But did Rabindranath Tagore write a novel or a play on this
partition? He did not. And yet his greatness is today beyond all challenge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tagore reached heights of greatness and glory and fame, not because of the
political character of any of his novels or verse, not because he aimed at
bringing about social or political revolution, but because of has unique
brilliance as an artist, because of his amazing powers to make his readers
distil and enjoy the emotional beauty of human experience. We cherish Tagore’s
Literature, not for its propaganda value, but for the rare literary qualities
which it possesses. “Art for the Nation” is a maxim with which we need not have
any quarrel. But we shall insist that Art serves the nation by being great art.
When the artist is asked by the present day politically-minded critics to use
his art in the service of the nation, the artist must tell them that he will
serve the nation by being a great artist. An artist must </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>remain
an artist first and last. He must be loyal to no other master than his art. The
value of his work must be determined by no other test than the principles and
standards of his Art. This is what I mean by “Art for the sake of Art.” And the
entire history of the great Literature of the world will bear ample testimony
to my contention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

need not surprise us that politicians and revolutionaries wish to use
Literature in their own interests and ask the writers of fiction to turn their
novels and plays into instruments of propaganda. I have said above that
Literature does not have the strength to bring about a revolution. But let his
admission not be taken as a mark of diffidence on my part as to the power of
Literature. Literature has a power of its own, the power to entertain, to
enrich and widen the self of man, to expand his experience and to quicken and
sharpen his emotional response. Owing to this power Literature exercises a very
strong and wide appeal. People have, therefore, always wanted to grind their
own axes on the stone of Literature, and have always tried to persuade the
literary artist to become the mouthpiece and slave of some other master. It has
always been a problem for the literary artist how to guard the sanctity of his
art, and how to protect the frontiers of his literary kingdom. The history of
the Literature of Maharashtra, the Literature of Bengal–in fact the Literature
of every country in the world–shows that the Church and the State have always
tried to dominate Literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may seem that since Free India is a Republic and since India’s administrative
machinery is far too different from the one which operates in countries like
Russia, Literature in India need not have any fear of State control. But let us
remember that there are many ways in which the State may control the lives and
pursuits of its people. State invasion has many forms. It may be direct, and it
may be indirect, it being equally dangerous in both cases. The Indian
Government of today, it is true, does not directly and openly invade the field
of Arts and Literature. But the prizes and gifts and subsidies and the silver
and gold medals and the high-sounding titles which it bestows upon musicians
and painters and novelists and playwrights constitute a very alluring seduction
of Artists. And seduction is after all a subtler and a veiled form of coercion
and control. Those who are in power in India today have accepted the Gandhian
philosophy of life. Apart from the question how far this philosophy is truly
suited to the needs of modern India, it is evident that our present rulers are
bent upon making as much capital as they can out of it, and carrying out
schemes after schemes for the betterment of the Indian people as they conceive
it–even including the morals of the people, and their means of entertainment
like Music, and Film and Theatre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

believe that the problem before the writers of fiction in India today is, will
they let themselves be seduced? Will they consent to become the slaves and
mouthpiece of those who are in power or of those who wish to bring about a
political revolution? Will they, or will they not hold fast to the true test of
the greatness of Literature? It will not much matter if gold ceased to be drawn

Ramayana and Mahabharata, we must decide to repudiate firmly any form of
invasion of Literature attempted by any political party, or any fanatical moral
or religious cult. Let us, writers of fiction, refuse to imagine that our
political colours or moral enthusiasms will bring us greatness in the literary
field. Let us not think of standing on any props in order to increase our
stature as artists. Let us have faith in the intrinsic value of the service
which we can render to our nation, altogether apart from all question of
political or moral propaganda. Let us have faith that, like the politician or
the industrialist, or the banker or the soldier, we too are great and useful in
our own ways. Let us have faith that the deity we worship is as great as any
other God. Let us be unflinchingly loyal to Goddess Saraswati. She will then

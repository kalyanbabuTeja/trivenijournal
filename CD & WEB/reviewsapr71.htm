are few V. I. P.s nowadays in any part of the world who seem to need any
persuasion to share their experiences with others by perpetuating themselves in
print. But not many books by authors of this category are found to be
particularly readable or otherwise remarkable. It happens many times that those
who have had a rich and varied experience in life are not necessarily those
gifted with the expression to evoke it effectively through the written word.
Conversely, it also follows that those who have this gift might not have had
the same experience. It is difficult to think of a politician or diplomat alive
now who is lucky enough to have had a longer spell of success or a series of
more glittering assignments than the Right Honourable Malcolm Macdonald. It is,
perhaps, harder still to find another who had made as good use of his
opportunities in finding the raw material for his books. The “random
reminiscences”, incorporated in this book, at the end of his official career,
are among the most delightful that has come out of the pen of a hard worked
diplomat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That
he was exceptionally lucky in his parentage tells but half the story of his
success in life. True, he became an M. P. and junior Minister while still in
his late Twenties and a member of the Cabinet while yet in his early Thirties,
thanks mainly to his father who was Prime Minister. But it redounds to his credit
that he kept up the promise by one achievement after another. His father was no
longer alive to see him rise to the occasion in later life under masters as
different as Chamberlain and Churchill, Attlee and Eden, Macmillan and Wilson. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
distinguishing feature of the author’s make-up is his genuine interest in
people and places–in people even more than in places. He has been keenly
interested in animal life and bird life as was the latter in particular. No
professional ornithologist of the forbidding sort of specialised scholarship,
he has an enviable knack for getting the reader interested in all the stories
that engage his attention. If he could, elsewhere, hold the reader entranced
with the romance that pervades the life of the birds in his New Delhi garden,
he could beguile him for a whole chapter here with endless stories of loves and
quarrels in the family life <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of<i> </i></span>the
chimpanzies in the woodlands in the vicinity of Nairobi. He could watch them
intently from his tent under the expert guidance of a European couple making a
detailed study of this species. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

from the opening chapters of this book, we are left in doubt about one thing-that
the author knows how to take time of the daily grind. Also that he knows how to
tell a story that the reader is sure to enjoy. While doing his stint at the
Palace of Westminster, from early in the morning to late in the evening, he
never seems to have had a dull day (or may be even night). It was his regular
practice to make his way to the playhouse, into the green room to hobnob with
his favourite heroes and heroines, as well as playwrights half-way into the
night. This world of his was full of Dorothy Dicksons and Beatrice Lillies,
Noel Cowards and Ivor Novellos. Sometimes, he would spend the night at the house
of one of these cronies in appetising company, where beauty was matched by brains.
The conversation was enlivened by the flash of wit and the peal of laughter.
Matters of state lose their air of solemnity and homely news of the author’s
engagement is followed by the pleasantest of practical jokes on him related in his
own inimitable way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
fact, Macdonald’s capacity for laughter is so infectious and his flair for
recalling a joke is so impeccable that one might be led to think that he was
pulling off these stories from his fertile imagination if one did not already
know that they were true. The srory of a fake viscount who nearly succeeded in
tricking a fabulous American heiress, almost twice his age, into wedlock is
among the most amusing. The bevy of beautiful young geisha girls, whom he takes
up and down the lift in the multi-storeyed hotel in Tokyo, flit through the
pages with a quaint grace on their light fantastic toes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Hardly
any place in the world is too dry or dangerous for author, as we could see him
through these pages. The rebel-infested jungles of Malayasia could not damp his
high spirits. He had unusual ways of entertaining himself and his guests. His
haunts in Singapore were familiar, setting a problem for his security men. He
could do one thing, which in the words of Lady Mountbatten, even Jawaharlal
Nehru could not do (in spite of his yoga )–which was–to walk with his hands on
the ground and feet in the air. He did demonstrate this feat on the lawns of
Teen Murti House after a sumptuous supper, to the unqualified merriment of the spectators.
And he now looks back on it all, to the unceasing delight of his growing
readers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is a most welcome addition to the existing literature on Sri Aurobindo’s
philosophy. A thesis approved for Ph. D. by the Nagpur University, this book
gives a very clear analytical and at comparative idea of Aurobindo’s philosophy
with special reference to his concept of spiritual evolution. The book is
divided into three sections. The first is an introduction to and exposition of the
philosophy of Sri Aurobindo. The second section deals with the spiritual
evolution. In the third section, the kernel of the thesis, Aurobindo’s theory
of spiritual evolution is compared with the theories of Aristotle, Bergson,
Whitehead, Saamkhya and Sankara. A critical estimation of Aurobindo’s theory is
found in the last section.<i> <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
comparative study of the concepts of matter, soul, God and spiritual evolution,
etc., is really an intellectual treat by itself. The matter of either Aristotle
or Bergson is not inconscient of Aurobindo. While it is a mere conceptual idea
for Aristotle, it is an aggregate of images...an existence half-way between the
‘thing’ and the ‘presentation’ for Bergson; while for Aurobindo the world forms
the manifestation of God, the Supreme Being, who is realizable and who
transcends Reason; for Aristotle God is pure reason, and is not the creator of
the Universe. The God for Whitehead is a logical construction but not a
spiritual entity as for Aurobindo. The God of Whitehead is driving towards his
self-fulfilment while for Aurobindo He is self-fulfilled. For Aurobindo the soul
is the real eternal principle. But for Aristotle it is just the function of the
body, as sight is of the eye. For Whitehead it is “nothing else than the
succession of occasions of experience extending from birth to the present
movement.” Prakriti of Aurobindo not like the Saamkhya Prakriti inert. Prakriti
of the Saamkhya is not also the Divine Mother, the consciousness of the Supreme
of Aurobindo. The world of Saamkhya is as in Aurobindo, not unreal. The Iswara
of Aurobindo is not the Purusha nor Sakti the Prakriti. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“The
Brahman of Aurobindo is not like Sankara’s Brahman iundifferentiated and
simple, but a complex and differentiated of which the individual, universal and
the transcendental form the eternal and ingredient poises.” According to
Aurobindo an individual is necessarily and eternally distinct from the Brahman.

of even the physical evolution is absent in Aristotle and spiritual evolution
appears to be inconceivable to Bergson. White-head’s “process” is not a process
of spiritual evolution. “Saamkhya evolution adopts downward path while
Aurobindo’s spiritual evolution proceeds upwards.” Sankara’s spiritual
evolution of man to Brahman, according to Aurobindo, is only the beginning towards
the higher grades conceived of by him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author finally concludes “that the concepts of the descent of the supermind on

contribution in the realm of philosophical thought.” We whole-heartedly commend
this book to all students of philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the Bengali literature of the old and mediaeval times has been inspired by
the religious and spiritual movements which developed in various directions.
Some of these like the Vaishnaya and the Shakta movements are fairly
well-known. There are others however, which are little known, but have
nevertheless exercised a great influence on the evolution of the culture and literature
of these parts. The object of the present thesis is to study the origins and
growths of these obscure cults, e.g., Buddhist sahajiya, seeking the Divine as
Bliss; Vaishnava Sahajiya, seeking the Divine as Love; Natha, seeking the
Divine as Immortality; the Bauls, seeking the Divine as the Supreme Beloved;
and the Dharma cult, a composite of Buddhist and Hindu traditions of a sovereign
Godhead. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author’s exposition goes to the roots of each cult and traces its growth
vis-a-vis other parallel movements in these parts. He does not lose sight of
the common tradition underlying these special manifestations of the inner
seeking of man. The importance given to the physical body and the care with
which its potentialities were sought to be cherished and developed are
emphasised. He notes: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the culture of the body <i>(kaaya-sadhana) </i>through processes of Hatha-yoga
for the attainment of physical perfection, was of paramount importance on the
Nath cult, it was more or less common to all the esoteric schools including the
school of Vaishnava Sahajiya which laid emphasis on love. The realisation of
Sahaja either of the nature of ‘Supreme Bliss (Maha-sukha) as is understood by
the Buddhist Sahajiya or of the nature of ‘Supreme Love’ (as is conceived by the
Vaishnava Sahajiyas), presupposes the strength of the physical organism to
stand such a supreme realisation. It is for this reason that we shall find that
all the esoteric schools spoke of the culture of body through some Hatha-yogic
practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the esoteric schools of India are fundamentally based on speculation on the two
aspects in which the ultimate reality functions and manifests itself, and that
the religious creed is based on the final aim of the attainment of a state of non-duality.
It is to be noticed that this idea of unity of the esoteric systems implies no
process of negation; it, on the other hand, implies a process of supreme
position through a regressive process of transformation and trans substantiation.”

the dynamic life and truth and beauty, his love for first-hand discovery of the
secrets of life and nature, his comprehension of the unifying principles
underlying the variety of religions, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and all, his
penetrating vision to read spiritual principles behind scientific laws–physical,
biological and others–his catholic criticism of antagonistic philosophies like
Realism and Idealism to be harmonised into his eclectic ‘Vedanta’, his broad
synthesis of the varying forms of Indian and Western idealisms–all these stand

liberation from ignorance of the whole man–not the soul alone. In this sense he
adumbrates the philosophy and yoga of the Life Divine that came to be developed
later by Sri Aurobindo. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vedanta, employing the modern analytical method. In the first lecture he makes a
fundamental distinction between (a) mere ignorance (ignorance that is <i>not </i>aware
of itself); (b) ‘learned’ ignorance (ignorance which <i>thinks </i>it knows);
(c) ignorance that is aware of itself (ignorance that <i>knows </i>that it does
not know). He analyses the last two categories of ignorance in some detail and
quotes from the Chandogya Upanishad to illustrate Virochana’s ‘learned’
ignorance which led him away from Truth and Indra’s awareness of his ignorance
which impelled him to continue his dialogue of self-examination till his
inquiry culminated in the knowledge of the supreme mystery of the Being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Professor calls that a “free translation of Sundarakanda.” It is not literal
nor done line by line. Yet, he has been careful to keep to the substance,
especially in rendering the conversations of the characters of the story, Sita,
Ravana, the Rakshasis, Hanuman and Rama in the places in which they occur.
These are the relevant portions of the Sundarakanda. Yet, one must say that the
translation does not bring out the anguish and the pathos of the <i>Virahataapa
</i>of Sita and Rama, the intensity of the joy of Sita on seeing her lord’s
ring and the grateful relief that Rama experience on receipt of the happy
tidings. One cannot weep reading these sections in the translation as one does
with the original. And, in the Sundarakanda one weeps at every turn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has in mind when she upbraids Ravana. “You know, only ordinary persons are sent
as messengers” seems to be an inadequate translation of <i>nahi prakristah
preshyante, preshyantehi itare janaah. </i>Anyway, in these days when the study
of Sanskrit has fallen on evil daysa, Prof. Mani’s book will introduce the
Sundarakanda of the Ramayana to our youths who may otherwise grow in ignorance

since education began to be imparted systematically and in educational
institutions, educationists and other intellectuals have been revising,
recasting and rehashing the curriculum with a view to reforming the system. By
and large, our public schools and their ilk give a better account of themselves
than Government or quasi-Government institutions in our country. There have however,
been a few institutions which, if not modelled on the public schools, at least
emulate them in discipline and devotion though not in content and curriculum.
One such is the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education (SAICE). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the maladies and malfunctions of education as it obtains today and prescribes
remedies. The present system with a mass turnover of “finished products” has
been reduced to a “race for diplomas” and the heavy elbowing of these trained
men for jobs has necessarily resulted in nepotism and corruption. Contrary to

true teaching is that nothing can be taught.” Again, “The idea of hammering the
child into a shape desired by the parent or teacher is a barbarous and ignorant
superstition.” An integral education is that which “takes into account the
entire complexity of man’s nature.” And as regards discipline, here is a gem. “...You
can impose a certain discipline on children...but you can get their hearts and
natures on your side, the conformity to this imposed rule becomes a
hypocritical and heartless, a conventional, often a cowardly compliance.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Moghul Empire has vanished but has left behind two abiding monuments: the Taj
Mahal and the poetry of Ghalib. The sunset tints of that great empire were
reflected by the ghazals of Ghalib which ran through the entire gamut of human
emotions. Though some of his raptures emanated from the fumes of wine, Ghalib
had also tasted the bitter cup and was aware of the door for which none could
find the key and the veil past which none could see. In this study the authors
have made an attempt to portray Ghalib’s interesting personality, the momentous
times and the impetus given to his muse by the strange vicissitudes of his fortune.
They have also offered some renderings in English which enable us to catch a

theory of integral experience is not developed from the primary datum of “I am”

subjective. Advaita Vedantists conceive of the data of reason, intuition and
religious experience as steps leading to the absolute knowledge, which is based
on the subject alone and not as in Radhakrishnan, as integral elements
containing the absolute knowledge. According to Radhakrishnan all these
elements merge into one another and finally become an integral, indivisible,
indissoluble whole, which carries certainty and indubitability, answering to
all aspects of the multifaceted constitution.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Telugu and English and a knowledge of psychology and music are pressed into his
service by the author. The first scholarly and successful attempt of its kind
in Telugu literature, this book must be studied both by poets and critics alike
for profit and as well as for pleasure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mahabharata is one of the greatest epics of the world, a perfect human document
and a storehouse of knowledge and wisdom. The “transcreation” into Telugu of
the great epic (the fifth Veda) from the Sanskrit over a period of three centuries
was considered the first major literary event. The three great poets
Nannayabhattu (11th century), Tikkana Somayaji (13th century) and Yerrapraggada
(14th century) who were the three authors of the Mahabharata in Telugu–known as
Kavitrayam–were held in high esteem by all scholars and discriminating readers.

may be recalled that the idea of a critical edition of Andhra Mahabharata emerged
about the beginning of this century. The controversy about the Grandhika Bhasha
(literary language) and Vyavaharika Bhasha (spoken language) paved the way for
the emergence of the conception of a critical edition. Rao Sahib Gidugu Ramamurti
pantulu in his crusade for the spoken language took to an examination of former
models of writing. Since then a number of scholars contributed to the vast
research on the subject. Among them mention may be made of Messrs. Korada
Ramakrishnayya, Dr. C. Narayana Rao, Bharatam Lakshmipati Somayaji, Nelaturi
Parthasarathi Ayyengar, Akondi Vyasamurti Sastri, Tirupati Venkatakavulu, Palle
Purnapragnacharya, R. Anantakrishna Sarma, Prof. G. J. Somayaji, Vemparala

has been heard in recent years about the foibles and failures of the native

been the unethical quality of existence of these erstwhile major and minor
states, their contribution, however limited it might have been, to the cultural
life of the country needs appreciation by all serious students. And on a closer
look one would think that in the ever-changing complex political situation that
obtained in this country for more than three hundred years the native states

written by Dr. Thoomati Donappa chronicles the fillip and encouragement given
by the successive rulers of these states to literature, arts and sciences. It
is a fascinating study to know the data regarding the area and peshkus of each
state (in alphabetical order) followed by a brief history of its origin,
development, decline, and its final dissolution as also of its successive
rulers with a contemporaneous picturisation of the literary activity, the poets
that were encouraged and honoured, the works that were caused to be written or
the rulers themselves wrote. Dr. Donappa, a seasoned research scholar, has brought
to bear on his work a rare insight, sensibility and objective evaluation. His
intuitive and perceptive faculties along with a quaint charm of his language
lends the work a creative flavour. One meets with not merely a scientific
methodology but a kind of kaleidoscopic beauty. Well-written and well-produced
the book, in spite of its modest claims, is a mine of information and a major
contribution to the branch of History of Telugu literature. It is the winner of
Andhra Sahitya Akademy award. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

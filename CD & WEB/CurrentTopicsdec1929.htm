<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE GANDHI-IRWIN CONFERENCE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To those who had been looking forward to a speedy and peaceful settlement of the Indian problem, the breakdown of the Delhi Conference between the Viceroy and Indian leaders has caused the gravest disappointment. The Resolution of the Lahore Congress defining Swaraj in terms of complete Independence is a necessary sequel to the breakdown of negotiations. Differences between the progressive political parties in the country have been accentuated, and the coming year is likely to witness a combination of all those who have pinned their faith to Dominion Status and the Round Table Conference, as against the Congress that has declared a boycott of that Conference. Even those Congressmen who have felt bound to obey the Congress mandate regarding resignation from the legislatures, are making open declarations of their desire to seek re-election as Independent candidates. Pandit Malaviya is trying to bring together the more moderate elements in the country, while Gandhiji is maturing plans for a campaign of civil disobedience in selected areas. Parties and programmes are all in a flux, and within the Congress itself the Democratic Party has emerged as a result of personal more than political differences.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is yet too early to forecast the developments ahead. But one thing is clear. Gandhiji has definitely accepted the leadership of the nation in the coming struggle for Swaraj. Whoever might happen to wear the Congress crown, Gandhiji will continue to wield the field-marshal's baton. In President Jawaharlal , and the new Working Committee, he will find powerful instruments for the working out of his plans. Blame is sought to be attached to him in certain quarters because he asked for a guarantee of the grant of Dominion Status from the Viceroy. If the Viceroy as a representative of the British Government was not authorised to promise Dominion Status so too were Gandhiji and Pandit Motilal, as representing the Congress, precluded from offering co-operation except on the terms laid down in the Calcutta Resolution. They were on their way to Lahore and they could not very well ask for a postponement of the Congress decision without a definite assurance of the establishment of Dominion Status. If Swaraj has to be won through a Round Table Conference, the Liberals and others are perfectly competent to plead the Indian case for Dominion Status. The Congress has parted company with them, and is no longer concerned about preparing ‘a case’. It hopes to mobilise the nation and forge an effective sanction to back up the demand for <I>Purna </I>Swaraj. This is indeed the parting of the ways, between Dominion Status and Independence, between Liberals and Congressmen, between Swaraj by negotiation and Swaraj by civil disobedience.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE INDO-BRITISH MUTUAL WELFARE LEAGUE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We desire to draw the attention of our readers to a communication from Lady Emily Lutyens and Mrs. Hannah Sen, setting forth the objects of this organisation and inviting co- operation from those who are in sympathy with its ideals. The future of Indo-British relations is at present a matter of great uncertainty. The days of Britain's political domination are numbered, but the readjustment of relations on the basis of a fellowship on equal terms in a Commonwealth of free nations is the cherished goal of idealists like Dr. Besant and Lady Emily Lutyens. It is this larger faith that lies behind the organisation of the League which expresses &quot;a willingness to learn rather than a wish to dictate.&quot; It is open to Indians and Englishmen of all schools of thought to help the League in its noble endeavours, for the cultural contacts between the two countries are bound to continue, long after the unfortunate relationship of the &quot;rulers and the ruled&quot; ceases.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DR. AND MRS. COUSINS</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We extend a hearty welcome to these friends of India and Indian Culture on their return home–for, have they not made India their home ?–after a prolonged and eventful tour in America and on the Continent of Europe. Wherever they have gone, they have sought to interpret the ideals of a renascent India, and to counteract the evil propaganda of ‘drain-inspectors’ of the type of Miss. Mayo. Mrs. Cousins was a prominent member of the Indian Women's Delegation at Geneva, and also represented India at International Conferences of women along with Mrs. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya and others. She is now planning an All-Asian Women's Conference with a view to preserving all that is best in Asian culture. Dr. Cousins too intends to go back to America and lecture once again to American audiences about the arts, philosophy and literature of India. The collection of pictures of modern Indian artists which he took with him during his last tour enabled the West to glimpse for the first time the great possibilities behind the art-revival in India. In nearly every place he visited, he organised exhibitions of these pictures, and famous artists and art-lovers welcomed these visible symbols of an India seeking to recover her lost soul. The exhibition in London created a particularly favourable impression. <I>The Illustrated London News </I>reproduced half-a-dozen water-colour pictures in its Christmas Number, thus giving an opportunity to a much wider public to get to know Indian Art at first hand. Dr. Cousins has always been an invaluable friend of rising Indian artists, cheering them during moments of gloom, and bringing their productions to the notice of cultured circles in all lands.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cause of cultural co-operation between East and West has never had more devoted exponents than Dr. Cousins and Mrs. Cousins, and we respectfully wish them godspeed in their unselfish work.</P><P ALIGN="center"><A HREF="CONTENTSnov1929.htm"><IMG SRC="Image245.jpg" BORDER=0 WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=48></A></P></BODY>

this area of the world numerous conflicting forces are at work. There is no

the view of very many people, what is most desirable in the Middle East is the
creation of a strong Arab National State extending over the whole of the
territory now comprised of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen,
Egypt and the rest of North Africa</st1:place>. It is argued that this alone
will satisfy the Arab national sentiment which is now too strong and too
powerful to be resisted. Until this becomes an accomplished fact the crisis in
the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place> will continue. Every delay in
its accomplishment will make the crisis more acute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
other peoples who think of their ancient glories and who hanker after their
revival, the Arabs think of their past greatness–the greatness they achieved
and enjoyed during the era of the Caliphate, when their imperial supremacy
extended from the banks of the Indus to Spain and from the borders of the
Caspian Sea to those of the Arabian Sea. A <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">United</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Arab</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">National</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> today appeals to
them because it will be a revival, though in part, of their earlier empire.
Nationalism is one of the strongest forces in modern history. Most of the new
States, that came into existence in Europe, Africa, Asia and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the period after the French Revolution, are the outcome of this force. And
the formation of a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">United</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Arab</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
will be quite in harmony with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Arabs base their case for such a State not merely on an emotion like this. They
also bring forward a number of powerful </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>arguments in support of
it. Such a State will be politically strong unlike the existing States of
Jordan, Iraq, Libya etc., whose independence is only nominal and who find it
necessary to lean on the support of some great power or other to maintain
themselves. It will not be the playground for the diplomatic activities of the
West and the East. Such a State alone will be able to adopt a really
non-alignment policy and save the area from the intrigues of outside powers. It
will also succeed in the economic development of the whole of the Middle-East,
raise the standard of living of the masses and put an end to the exploitation
to which they have been subjected for more than a century by Western nations.
The modernisation and the development of the economy of the area–and especially
of its oil resources through their pooling under one government–will add to the
material strength of the State and make it really viable. All this will give an
impetus to Arab cultural revival.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the ideal of the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Arab</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">National</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> cherished by large numbers of
the Arabic-speaking people in West Asia and <st1:place w:st="on">North Africa</st1:place>.
But because there are many who are opposed to the creation of such a State, a
crisis has come into existence in the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
those who are opposed to it are the present holders of power. Those who are now
ruling <st1:country-region w:st="on">Lebanon</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jordan</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Iraq</st1:country-region> and other States know
that it will result in their losing all power and in most of the benefits being
reaped by President Nasser and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There are also other opponents of the idea. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is one of them. All the Arabs were against the establishment of what they
regard an ‘alien’ State in their midst. The defeat they sustained at the hands
of the Jewish State in 1948 has made them more bitter against it. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
feels that so long as the Arab world is politically disunited, it has nothing
to fear from it. A <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">United</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Arab</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
will, however, mean its ruin. And unless its continued existence is guaranteed
by some international agreement, it will oppose by all means the creation of
such a State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is next the opposition from the West. Western powers like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region> and even the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United

<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Arab</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
becomes an accomplished fact. It is these powers that are now in control of the
oil resources of the area and of the pipe lines which carry the oil from the
places of production to the Mediterranean ports. They are afraid that they will
lose this control, in the event of the establishment of a single State, as they
will not be able to dictate terms to it just as they have been dictating terms
to small States. The rulers of the new State may nationalise the oil industry,
just as President Nasser nationalised the <st1:place w:st="on">Suez Canal</st1:place>.
In the cold war which they are carrying on with Soviet Russia they will suffer
defeat if the flow of<i> </i>oil from the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place>
is impeded in any way. It will mean from their standpoint the triumph–though
indirectly–of Soviet strategy. It will also interfere with their communication
with the countries of the Far East and <st1:place w:st="on">Australasia</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is also opposed to the formation of such a State. For centuries the Turks ruled
over the Arabs and it was only after the First World War that they lost their
imperial hold. There is thus no love lost between the Turks and the Arabs.
Moreover <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is terribly afraid of Soviet attack and the only course that can save her from
becoming a Soviet satellite is help from the West. This is the reason why she </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>accepted
American aid and became a member of the NATO. Any </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>weakening
of the West in the Middle East will mean a weakening of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and ultimately the loss of her independence. She cannot afford to adopt a
policy of non-alignment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this is a part of the same old story. It is only in very rare cases that what
is advantageous to one group of people, or to one group of States, is equally
advantageous to other groups of people or of States. There is always a
divergence of interests and no unilateral or simple solution can be discovered
which will satisfy all the parties concerned. An Arab National State is of
advantage, no doubt, to the masses of people and to certain governments under
certain conditions. But it will gravely affect the interests and fortunes of
certain sections of the Arabs, and of a number of States like Israel, Turkey,
Britain, France and the United States. There are, of course, those who argue
that, in a matter like this, it is only the interests of the majority of the
Arabs that deserve consideration and that outsiders, like Turkey or Britain,
have nothing to do in the matter. In the real world an argument like this has
got its own limitations. The real world is an inter-dependent world. It is the
product of history; and history has brought Israel, Turkey, Britain and France
into the Middle East. Any solution which ignores this fact, and which denies to
them any say in the settlement of the affairs of the area, is bound to be
unrealistic. The solution should, while satisfying the legitimate interests of
the Arabic-speaking peoples, enable States like Israel and Turkey to maintain
their independence and guarantee to Britain and other Western States regular
supplies of oil on which their very existence depends. It is because such a
solution is not being aimed at–it is because the Arabs think exclusively of
their abstract rights of self-determination and the other powers equally
exclusively of their vested interests–that there is now a crisis in the Middle
East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lebanon
has been the scene of this crisis for some weeks. The government in power is
being attacked by a certain section of the Lebanese people on the ground that
it is pro-Western in its attitude and general policy. There is a revolt against
it and a civil war has been going on. It is alleged by the government that the
rebels are being aided by the United Arab Republic of which Colonel Nasser is the
President, that there have been infiltrations into rebel ranks from Syria and a
regular supply of arms to them from outside. It has not </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>so
far been able to suppress the rebellion which is growing in intensity from day
to day. What the rebels have done is to use force and to resort to war to
overthrow the government established by law. The government’s inability to
suppress the revolt is due to its military weakness, and this perhaps is the
result of its own army sympathising with the cause of the rebels. It can only
be saved if it gets outside help, either from the United Nations or from
Britain and the United States. But is it legal for the United Nations to
intervene in a civil war? The Charter provides for intervention when a State is
invaded from outside. This was what happened in Korea in 1950. The U. N. sent
an army to defend South Korea because of the aggression of North Korea. In the
view of the Secretary-General of the U. N., who recently visited Lebanon, there
is no aggression against her by any outside country like the United Arabic
Republic, as alleged by the Lebanese Government, and the utmost that the U. N.
could do was to appoint a team of observers on the Lebanon-Syria borders to
watch and report on any infiltrations that might take place. Active
preparations were made at one stage, by both Britain and the United States, to
help with their forces the weak government of Lebanon. But they have given up
the attempt as they realised that any intervention by them might lead to Soviet
intervention, either directly or indirectly through the United Arab Republic.
The Lebanese Government is thus compelled to deal with the rebels without
securing the help it wanted and there is every possibility that it might not
come out victorious in the fight. There is every likelihood that, if things are
left to themselves, an anti-Western government might come into power in Lebanon
and that Lebanon might become allied–if not completely integrated–with Egypt
and Syria. This will mean one more step in the direction of the formation of an
Arab National State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

centre of crisis in the Middle East is Cyprus. It is an island with a mixed
population of Greeks and Turks. The Greeks are in a majority and, on the
principle of self-determination, they have been agitating for integration with
Greece, although at no time in the past was Cyprus a part of the Greek State.
Cyprus had long been ruled by Turkey until the British secured possession of it
in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The Turkish minority in the
island want self-determination for themselves, with its logical corollary of
the partition of the island, just as India was partitioned by the British. They
are opposed to being ruled by the Greeks. There is nothing wrong in the
solution put forward by them. If self-determination is appropriate for the
Greeks, it is equally appropriate for the Turks. </span><span style='font-size:

solution, other than division, will not satisfy both parties and any such solution
will ultimately have to rest on force. Because of the critical situation in the
Middle East, the British do not want to give up completely their hold over the

In the Utopian world, in which there is no war, it does not make much
difference from the strategic point of view whether a piece of territory is in
the possession of one State or another. But the world in which we are living is
quite different. War is a reality and States have to be ready to defend themselves
against aggression. To expect, therefore, either Britain or Turkey to reconcile
themselves, without any kind of protest, to the absorption o</span><span

reconcile both the Greeks and the Turks in the island, and at the same time to
safeguard their own strategic interests, the British have recently come forward
with a scheme of settlement which will hold good for seven years. It is a
settlement which recognises that the Greeks and the Turks are two different
communities with separate interests and needs. It is too soon to say whether
Greece and Turkey will accept it. It is, however, a solution which deserves
consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

third centre of crisis which affects the politics of the Middle East–and
indirectly of all the Western States which are members of the NATO–is Algeria.
Here ten million Arabs demand independence which the French are not willing to
concede. There are one million French settlers in Algeria occupying today a
privileged position, and an independent Algeria will reduce them to the status
of a minority. They are much more determined in resisting the Algerian national
movement than the French in metropolitan France. For the last four years a
terribly costly war has been going on between France and the Algerian
nationalists, but nothing but misery and suffering for both parties has come
out of it. Five hundred thousand French forces have been bogged there. It has
also been responsible for misunderstandings between France on one side and
Tunisia and Morocco on the other. What happened recently was a rebellion of the
commanders of the local French armies against their own national government in
Paris and taking over control of Algerian affairs. They were disgusted with the
weak and vacillating policy of the French Government and attributed to this the
military failure in Algeria. They demanded that parliamentary government in
France should be suspended and that all power should be handed over to General
De Gaulle who had been at the head of the ‘Free French’ in the Second World War
and ruled over the country for two years after it was freed from Hitler. This
demand had to be conceded, as the only alternative to it was civil war. De
Gaulle became the Prime Minister and Parliament agreed to go out of existence
for a period of six months surrendering all authority to him. A sort of
dictatorship has thus been established and the future alone will show whether
it will disappear at the end of six months or will continue indefinitely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
solution to the Algerian problem has been proposed by De Gaulle. It consists in
extending to the Algerian Arabs the same rights of citizenship as the French
possess. They will have equal rights of voting and holding offices–all this,
however, subject to the one condition that Algeria continues to be a part of
the French State. It does not look as if the Algerians will accept these terms.
In the French State they will be in a minority as contrasted with more than
forty million Frenchmen. What they want is an independent State of Algeria. They
are opposed to any settlement which results in the loss of separate political
nationhood and the acceptance of French citizenship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attitude is based on sentiment and emotion and it will be futile to discuss
whether it is a right or reasonable attitude. If the French settlers in Algeria
are sincerely prepared to give up their privileged position; there may be some
chance of the Algerians revising their views on what membership in the French
State will mean to them. In a shrinking world it is desirable to move in the
direction of multi-national instead of uni-national States wherever this is
possible. But it is only very rarely that events in the actual world take the
best and the most desirable course. Desires and counter-desires act and react
on each other and what actually happens is in many cases something which no one
desired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

today, that it is the product of a variety of conflicting factors and that it
is impossible to foresee in what way it will be ultimately resolved. There is
every likelihood that the crisis will continue for a long time and that the
final shape of events may be something of which no one can draw even a vague
picture at present. The picture as it finally emerges–if at all there is
anything like finality to the march of history–will not and cannot be fully and

crisis in the Middle East is only a part and a phase of the present-day world
crisis resulting to a great extent from the cold war between the East as
represented by Soviet Russia and the West as represented by the United States.
Among the points at issue between them is which of them should control this
region. The West is directly involved in the Middle East crisis and it is also
positively involved. It is the Western States that are now in possession of its
oil resources; </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

in driving </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>out the Western powers from this possession and
this alliance. If she succeeds in this she will then be able to step into their
place. She is not indifferent to the events that are happening in this area.
She is not neutral. Hers is not a policy of non-intervention, although
non-Intervention is a part of the doctrine of Panch Shila to which she has
proclaimed her adherence. She has given active military and economic aid to
Egypt and Syria. She has been carrying on a propaganda war against the West and
in favour of those sections of the Arabs who are interested in driving out the
Western powers. We generally forget that it is impossible to adhere to a policy
of neutrality or non-alignment in the cold war, even if one does not enter into
a military pact with one side or the other. The cold war is being fought not
only with the help of military pacts, military and economic aid, but also with
the help of world public opinion. If a so-called neutral State supports
generally the United States in discussions on crucial international issues, it
does, to that extent, depart from the policy of neutrality. Similarly if
another State generally takes the same stand </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as Soviet Russia
does in respect of the international issues which divide the East from the
West, it has no right to say that it is not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>taking sides in the
cold war. States like these need not be accused of hypocrisy or insincerity. It
only shows that it is next to impossible to adopt a policy of strict
non-alignment. By consistently supporting the Arab case against the West,
Soviet Russia has been rendering great service to the Arabs who are behind the
formation of a United Arab State. Whether, after the West is driven out, Soviet
Russia will continue to back the Arabs is more doubtful. If any lesson is to be
drawn from past history, it looks fairly certain that she will try to step into
the place vacated by the West and even succeed in such an attempt. It is
against a background like this that the significance of the execution of Imre
Nagy, the great Hungarian patriot, has to be </span><span style='font-size:

execution has been one of the most sensational events of recent weeks. It was
also a most barbarous deed. Soviet Russia played an important part in freeing
Hungary, Rumania, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia etc., from the yoke of Hitler. But
she freed them to make them a part of her own empire. Her sway over Eastern
Europe is as imperialistic as Britain’s or France’s sway over their colonial
dependencies. It is in addition far more terrible because it is wedded to a
philosophy of materialism which denies the value and sacredness of individual
human personality. Communism has been forced by her on the peoples of Eastern
Europe at the point of the sword. The heaven on earth which she promised to create
in these countries receded to a distant future. National slavery became the lot
of countries like Hungary. The crime of Imre Nagy consisted in leading a
movement to secure Hungarian national independence from the yoke of Soviet
Russia. People rallied round him. He could have succeeded, had it not been, for
the Soviet armies. The revolt was crushed and he was taken away to Rumania.
Nothing was heard of him. Everyone thought that he was out of danger because of
the assurance given by the pro-Soviet Kadar’s Government of Hungary, when he
came out of the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest where he took refuge. Suddenly
came a few days ago the news that he was tried and executed along with some of
his colleagues and it was the Moscow Radio that first broadcast this news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

did the Soviet dictator Khrushchev do this, and that at a time when
negotiations for the proposed Summit Conference of Heads of States were being
carried on? The impression which this atrocious deed created in all the
countries of the non-Communist world is that Soviet Russia has once more
reverted to the policies of Stalin and to Stalinism so strongly condemned by
Khrushchev himself sometime back. He then proclaimed that there were different
roads to Socialism and that each country was free to take the road which suited
it best. The execution of Nagy was both preceded and followed by an ideological
warfare by Soviet Russia and her satellites with Tito of Yugoslavia. He was
accused of the crime of ‘Revisionism’–of swerving away from the principles of
Marxism-Leninism, and he was refused the large economic aid which Soviet Russia
promised sometime earlier on the additional ground that he was getting aid from
the United States. In all this the People’s Republic of China supported Soviet
Russia and clearly showed that she would not tolerate any division in the ranks
of the Communist world, that every Communist State should stand by Soviet
Russia whatever its effects be on her own national interests, and that the
doctrine of “Different Roads to Socialism” as proclaimed by Khrushchev, or that
of Mao, “Let a hundred flowers bloom” were not intended to be put into effect.
The execution of Imre Nagy was meant to be a warning to all patriots in the
satellite countries of Eastern Europe that they would meet with the same fate
if they made any attempt towards national freedom. It was meant to demonstrate
to the peoples of satellite countries that Soviet Russia had the strength
necessary to put down the national movements aimed at the break-up of her empire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is in this situation that negotiations for a Summit Conference are going on.
Neither party, however, is optimistic about the outcome of such a conference.
Simply because the Heads of States meet for two or three days, nothing like a
miracle is going to happen. The issues, which are responsible for the cold war
and which could not be settled by the U. N. or by meetings of foreign ministers
and of ambassadors, will not get automatically solved simply because the Heads
of States meet in a conference. It may be that a dictator like Khrushchev can
overrule the opinion of his advisers. This is impossible in countries like
Britain, France and the United States where the Heads have to be guided by
their colleagues and experts and where public opinion is strong and alive. In
addition to this there has so far been no agreement on the issues to be
discussed at the Summit. Those proposed by Soviet Russia have not satisfied the
Western powers; and those proposed by the latter have been rejected by the
former. The only subject which both parties think should be discussed is that
of disarmament. But the question is whether in a conference extending over only
two or three days any solution can be found for this problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
lifting of the nearly one year old blockade of Berlin and the meeting of the
Council of Foreign Ministers after a long interval of nearly twenty months are
regarded as the most outstanding events of the month. The world has been
greatly relieved at least for the time being of the fear of a third world war
in the near future although it is too early to say whether there is a sound
basis for such relief. The welcome which has throughout been accorded to the
meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers shows, however, how eagerly and
anxiously the world is thirsting for peace, for stability, and for carrying the
needed social and economic changes on an ordered non-violent basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
will be a confirmed optimist if one were to say that it will all be smooth
sailing in the Council of Foreign Ministers and that the tension between the
East and the West which began even while all the great powers were fighting a
common foe could be completely eased and that they will work together in the
interests of the world and humanity as a whole. The differences between Soviet
Russia and the Western democracies are basic and fundamental and it requires a
spirit of extraordinary toleration and even humility to get over them. The
specific problem which the Council has to solve is the future of Germany and
the conclusion of a treaty of peace with that country. Both parties have been
saying that they want a unified and not a partitioned Germany, that it should
be a democratic state and that all steps should be taken to prevent that
country from again becoming a source of menace to Europe and to the rest of the
world as she did in the days of Hitler. This kind of agreement between the East
and the West was always there but when these generalities has to be given a
concrete workable form differences arose in the past and it remains to be seen
whether the present meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers would get over
these differences and arrive at a solution satisfactory to all of them and also
to the German people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
main difficulty in the way of such a solution is that the Soviet’s
understanding of democracy is different from that of the Western powers. The
latter mean by it a State where there is liberty for the individual, freedom
for rival political parties to come into existence and carry on peaceful
fighting with each other, and free elections. The Soviet, however, has a quite
different conception of democracy. It does not attach much value to the
fundamental rights of freedom of speech and movement in a society where there
are acute economic inequalities. It does not believe in the need for rival
political parties as they would undermine the organic unity of the State. Free
elections in which candidates are set up by the different political parties and
voters are given freedom to choose from among them has no meaning for it. It
believes in one party rule in the period of transition between capitalism and
communism. It is on this basis that it conducted the recent elections in the
Eastern Zone of Germany–elections in which nearly forty per cent of the voters
voted against the single list of candidates put forward by the communist party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question therefore is whether the western powers would agree to give up their
own view of democracy knowing that it would result in the government of United
Germany being dominated by the communists and whether the Soviet would abandon
its cherished view and allow bourgeoise Parties or Socialist parties to come
into power. For it is now an axiomatic truth that communist governments would
ally themselves with Russia and that Socialist or bourgeoise governments with
the Anglo-American powers. Each side is therefore anxious that united </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Germany
should become its ally. This is the crux of the whole problem and all other
aspects pale into insignificance by its side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
that these aspects are unimportant. On the other hand they also raise
formidable issues. For instance, there is the question of the extent to which
Germany should participate in the European Recovery Programme. The Western
powers think that this is absolutely necessary and all along they have been
proceeding on that hypothesis and have provided for Western Germany which has
just now been constituted into a separate federal state being included in that
programme. The Soviet, however, has been opposed to this programme and a
Germany unified in accordance with her view of democracy will be a communist
Germany having nothing to do with the programme of European recovery. This will
make a wide difference to the success of the programme as a whole and would
interfere with the way in which it has been able to make progress during the
last two years. There are other questions also. There is the question of
reparations from current production. There is also the question as to the
extent to which the Soviet should participate in the control of the Ruhr
industries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
conclusion, therefore, that emerges from this brief reference to the issues
with which the Council of Foreign Ministers will be faced is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that
it will be a miracle if any agreement is arrived at on them. Nothing short of a
spiritual change based on “Unity in diversity” will bring </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>about
this miracle. The Soviet should be prepared to confine its activities to Europe
east of Germany and to those regions in Asia where she had already established
herself. The Anglo-American powers should also be equally satisfied with the
influence they have in the other areas of the world and not try to undermine
the foundations of the Soviet political and economic sphere. The idea that
either the one or the other power should dominate the whole world to the
exclusion of the other has to be completely abandoned. And on the basis of such
self Surrender should the two be prepared to work hand in hand for the
maintenance of peace and for the orderly progress of the whole of humanity. It
is a change of heart that is needed. And some doubts arise on this point when
one sees how in the very first meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers
which met to discuss the German problem the Soviet Foreign Minister raised the
subject of the peace treaty with Japan. We have therefore to wait and watch the
situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
are asking themselves why the Soviet has now agreed to lift Berlin blockade.
The general answer that is given is that the blockade has failed and that its
lifting by the Soviet is only a confession of her defeat. But the answer is not
so simple as this. It is not so much the sense of defeat as the sense of
victory in a larger and a wider field that seems to be responsible for this
change in the Soviet attitude. It is the course of events in China and its
repercussions on the countries of South-East Asia that really afford the key to
this. The communists of China have<i> </i>now become the masters of the
northern half. They are taking the key-towns which will bring them to the South
and enable them to establish their dictatorship over the whole country–a
country with a population of 450 millions and with natural resources which when
developed with the technological skill and knowledge of the modern scientific
age will make her the richest country in the world. So far as foreign policy is
concerned a communist China will ally herself with Soviet Russia and not with
the Anglo-American bloc. Naturally this has brought about a change in the
tactics of Soviet Russia. It is quite true that during the period of the Berlin
blockade the United States has consolidated herself in Western Europe and
brought the Atlantic Pact into existence. But the communist success in China
has brought plenty of compensation for all the loss that the Soviet might have
suffered in Western Europe. The lifting of the Berlin blockade is therefore a
sort of generous gesture made by Soviet Russia, a gesture which she can now
afford to make without any serious material loss to her. It is the events in
China that afford a truer explanation of the change in the Soviet policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
events are also responsible for several other changes that have become
prominent. One is the more conciliatory attitude that the Dutch have adopted
towards the Indonesian Republic. For three years they have been fighting with
the Republic with a view to destroy it completely and re-establish their
imperialism. They cared little for Asian opinion as voiced by Pandit Nehru and
by the several conferences which he convened. They cared less for the opinion
of the Security Council knowing as they did that it had no sanction based on
physical force behind it. They have, however, changed their policy now. They
are prepared to give Jogjakarta back to the Republican government and allow it
to function as a government in some of its former territories. This may not
bring complete peace to Indonesia but it may be taken as a first step in the
re-orientation of Dutch policy in this part of the world. It is to be observed
in this connection that Pandit Nehru’s talks with the British Government during
his recent visit to London had a great deal to do with this change in the Dutch
policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A similar change is also noticeable in the French
policy towards Indo-China. The negotiations between the French Government and
the ex-Emperor Bao Dai have been completed and he has returned to Indo-China to
form a new government. The French Parliament also passed a resolution
abrogating the colonial status of Cochin-China and permitting it to be
incorporated in the Viet Nam Republic. Bao Dai has made this a condition before
setting up a national government. The exact im<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
1.0pt'>plications of this alignment have to be clearly understood. The French
and the other colonial powers are now beginning to see that the forces of
nationalism have to be recognised and that any further delay in doing this will
only help the expansion of the communist sphere of influence in South East
Asia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is from this standpoint that events in Burma have to be examined. The
government of Burma has not succeeded in quelling the Karen rebels or their
communist allies. On the other hand a large area of Central Burma has been lost
and a rival state is being set up there. In addition to this there is a steady
infiltration of Chinese communists from across the frontiers and the civil war
in Burma is, for all practical purposes like the civil war in China, a war
between the communists and the anti-communists. If things are allowed to take
their course there is the danger that the government of Burma might collapse
and communism become firmly entrenched there. It speaks highly of the
statesmanship of the present Burmese Premier that in this hour of danger he has
not stood on mere prestige but has come out boldly to ask for the help of the
neighbouring countries like India, Pakistan and Ceylon and also of Britain. The
Governments of these States have now agreed to extend their aid to Burma. In
doing this they have been prompted not merely by the fact that they have to
depend on that country for the supplies of rice but also by the fact that the
triumph of communism there might threaten their own stability. What India,
Pakistan and Ceylon now require is peace which will enable them to reconstruct
their economy on the basis of ordered progress. They are therefore interested
in arresting the further progress of communism outside China. And it is from
this standpoint that the course of events in that country has today a
world-wide significance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ideologically
there are now two factors contending for world domination. One is communism and
the other is democratic socialism. In every country of Western Europe and in
the countries of South East Asia and to some extent in other countries also the
fight between the two has reached a decisive stage. In Asia, especially, the
revolutions which are being witnessed–the revolutions which in their first
manifestations are anti-imperialistic–are both national and social. While the
nationalistic aspect appeals to all sections of people in each of these
countries it is the social and economic aspect that is more attractive to the
masses. And unless this aspect is handled immediately with great skill,
imagination and statesmanship there is a danger that communistic forces will
gain ground. National governments established in these areas should not merely
try to preserve peace and order but direct their activities to economic
reconstruction on socialistic and democratic lines. The struggle that is going
on in the world today is in the main a struggle between the totalitarian forces
of communism and the forces of democratic freedom directed to the peaceful
establishment of socialism. They are like different religions and it ought to
be possible for both of them to exist side by side just as different religions
are existing side by side. The success of the meeting of the Council of Foreign
Ministers may make this a possibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

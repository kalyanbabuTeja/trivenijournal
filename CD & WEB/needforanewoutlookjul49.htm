is time to begin thinking seriously about the economic problem. Of all the
failures with which the new regime can be charged none is more disturbing–or,
admittedly, so far as the Central Government is concerned, more excusable–than
its failure to pull the country out of its economic stagnation, or to afford
any promise of doing so in the future. India is in fact involved in two
simultaneous crises, the political and the economic. The political tasks of the
assumption of power and establishment of the new order have quite properly
taken first place. But though this consideration must make critics for the time
being more charitable, it does not diminish the acuteness of the economic
crisis, nor will it moderate the disaster which seems likely to be its outcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is necessary to think of a relatively short period, in terms of decades.
Advocating a policy designed to reduce the rate of increase of population, one
has often been met with the scientific answer that when our technical knowledge
is fully applied the country will be able to maintain its present, or a much
larger population, at a high standard, and that when this position is reached
the birthrate will fall automatically. One can reply in one word–”When.” We are
failing at present even to move significantly in the direction of an
application of modern technology. Our technological level has risen, but our
production has barely kept pace with our rising population. In agriculture we
have been losing ground for the past twenty years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is probably true that if existing technological
knowledge were applied, our people, like others, could live at a satisfactory
material standard on two or three hours’ work per head per day. It is probably
true that there is an adequate technological answer even to the
soil-and-population scaremongers like William Vogt. But though we may know in
principle what to do, and there is probably no insuperable economic difficulty
in the way of doing it, the administrative, political, psychological and
educational difficulties are enormous, and there is no real prospect of
overcoming them for generations yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nor
is it convincing to say that these difficulties would be greatly reduced if we
went over to socialism or communism. The socialist is apt to think it is so,
because he imagines himself, endowed with technological omniscience, operating
the levers of an omnipotent and frictionless administrative machine. In
practice things are not so easy. In fact the evidence hitherto does not suggest
that collectivism has any great advantage over capitalism in regard to speed of
technological progress; though, as we have not yet had much experience of
collectivism, there is still room for hope. However it is clear <i>a priori </i>that
the socialist exaggerates. Bureaucracies can develop vested interests as
powerful and as obstructive any capitalist group. Experts disagree, as also do
non-experts, and interests of all kinds organise their pressure-groups, under
socialism as under capitalism. If the collectivist dictator attempts any
cutting of Gordian knots, he can never be sure that his choice is right, and he
will inevitably suffer from the restricted thought and initiative, the
paralysis of fear developing into active sabotage, that hamper an over-centralised
administration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
India, then, we know how to grow all the food we want, and how to produce all
the industrial goods we want. Probably a few years’ high-powered research would
show us how to stabilise the population. It is the human difficulties which
prevent application of this knowledge. Thinking in terms of decades, we cannot
call in to our aid any spectacular technological improvements. We have to think
in terms of a very modest rate of improvement from the existing technical
level.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
meanwhile the economic position is rapidly worsening. There is no need to go
into the familiar detail, of enormous food imports–at the cost of our precious
foreign balances–the abject failure of the attempts to grow more food, the
obstinate stagnation of industrial production, the failure of private capital
to undertake new productive enterprise. Lately a new factor or aspect of the
economic crisis has come to light, thanks to the <i>Eastern Economist. </i>For
the past two years new investment has fallen below the figure of the
depreciation of existing capital; so that we are actually disinvesting, failing
even to maintain our capital resources, not to speak of increasing them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>These are but the more immediately striking facts.
If the favourable Possibilities held out by technological improvements are left
aside, as in prudence they must be, the longer-period prospects of the national
economy are equally gloomy. The land is very fully occupied, by a population
which is growing rapidly, and will presumably grow more rapidly still if our
health services improve–though this effect is likely to be offset by famine.
Emigration on a significant scale is out of the question <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>for technical reasons, even if political
obstacles did not prevent it. The expansion of the cultivated area is
necessary, and is being undertaken, </span>but it cannot proceed nearly fast
enough to accommodate five million more people every year; if it did, the
available waste land would very soon be fully occupied. Moreover this expansion
demands heavy and rapidly increasing capital investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
difficulties confronting industrial expansion are almost equally grave. The
Bombay Plan contemplated investment in industry at the rate of 5,000 crores (at
pre-war prices) in 15 years. This was to increase production three times, and
with a somewhat slower growth in agriculture (investment 1,200 crores) was to
double the real income per head of the population. This aim, the doubling of
real income in 15 years, is not extravagant. Anything much slower should be
regarded as dangerous. We cannot be satisfied with much less than an annual
investment of 1,000 crores at current prices. As things are this is crying for
the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Economic
progress at present goes backwards. The standard of living is falling. It is
higher than is justified by current production, for in addition to our failure
to invest in industry, we are spending our foreign balances on current food
consumption. Nevertheless the standard of living is falling, and must continue
to fall if we continue to use up our capital instead of increasing it. When we
come back to economic sanity and begin to save again, the standard of living
must fall sharply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the ultimate result of a continued fall in the standard of living must be
discontent, revolt, and the dictatorship either of the present or of a new set
of rulers. In the existing conditions in Asia generally, there can be little
doubt that the communists would be the ultimate victors. This does not mean
that the communists have a solution to the economic problem. Probably they
would do no better than others even in economic policy, while the rest of their
policy amounts to nothing short of the destruction of civilisation. But their
technique of dictatorship is so perfect that they can retain power however
abject their failure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
our economic future can be regarded as a race to overtake and reverse the
present rapid slide downhill. The pace of that slide is set primarily by the
increase of population. It is hastened still further by the improvement of the
health services, by our current over-expenditure, and by the baseless
expectation of better times ahead aroused among the people by communist,
socialist, and indeed by Congress propaganda. Can we overtake it in time? Can
we lower the birthrate, increase the cultivated area, induce the farmers to
work harder, provide them simple technical aids, and persuade them to use them,
and save or borrow enough capital to raise industrial production, solving
meanwhile all the administrative, educational and other problems involved–can
we do this in time to forestall revolution?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
cannot hope for many years before the catastrophe overtakes us; in that short
time the task is obviously enormous. Ignoring the organisational, educational,
technical and other aspects of the job; consider it purely from the point of
view of capital investment. The country cannot be considered safe, as we have
said, until it is investing, in industry alone, something of the order of 1,000
crores per year. At present our net investment in industry is nil, or rather
negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>How can the country obtain so much capital? Clearly
we cannot expect to get it all from abroad. Whatever we can get from abroad we
should get: the supposed dangers of foreign investment are at the worst far
less than the dangers of not investing, or not investing enough. But however
farsighted and generous the Americans may be, they cannot be relied upon for
continued investment on that scale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
alternative is to raise the money, that is to save it, within the country. This
involves lowering the standard of living at least of substantial sections of
the population, without lowering production correspondingly. At least a
considerable part of the population has to submit to a substantial cut out of
its present real income. There is no evading </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>this. Any kind
of regime, pursuing any economic policy, would be faced by the same necessity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>If this is considered as a matter of policy, it is
clear that the burden must be made to fall on those who can bear it. It would
be inhuman to try to lower the standards of the poor majority, of town or
country. Moreover that policy would defeat its own purpose, since it would
drive them into the communist camp. The middle and upper classes must suffer
the cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
these classes are already complaining of the high taxation. Indeed it is high,
and probably little purpose would be served by stiffening up the income-tax
schedules, since the result would be more evasion. A different financial
approach might yield some result. The Finance Department might try postponed
expenditure: compulsory loans instead of confiscatory taxes, and not just at
the top but right down the middle income brackets. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>However, nothing adequate to our needs is likely to
be obtained by the methods of finance. People’s thinking and feeling about the
problem must change. The outlook of our middle and upper classes is strikingly
out of accord with the realities of their position. It is natural enough, but
that fact will not save them. It is natural that on the attainment of
independence the dominant administrative, business and professional classes
should conceive of themselves on the model of the recently dominant classes of
other Countries. But that is not their real position.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Much criticism has been directed at our showy
embassies and the expensive life of the governing class in Delhi. This is quite
justified, but the important moral is seldom drawn. It has been regarded as
mere bad taste; but in fact it is class suicide, and national suicide. This
ostentation sets an example which the dominant class all over the country has
been only too eager to follow. Everywhere people of these classes are raising
their expenditure–for trips abroad, travel by air, entertainment, bigger
houses, flashier cars, fashionable clothes. Where a man puts his money into
business, it is less likely to be a productive enterprise than a “luxury”
cinema.</p>

of the Gandhian injunctions. The provincial governments are enforcing
prohibition, and will soon ban horse-racing. These are almost wholly beside the
point, though it is arguable that racing is a factor of importance in
encouraging the mentality of display and extravagance. The effort to cut down
luxury imports is praiseworthy, though its success is not very noticeable.
Altogether there has been little effect on the public mind. There is no
realisation that the new ruling class cannot, as a matter of elementary
political prudence, afford to live as other dominant classes of free countries
in recent generations have lived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

similar classes all over the world are losing theirs. The capitalist age is ending;
the socialist age is beginning. Not that this will be an era of equality,
without ruling and privileged classes. There is forming a new ruling and
privileged class, the administrators, technicians and managers. There is no
long future before a ruling class whose position depends largely on private
wealth. Our dominant classes must realise that in the long-period sense their
day is done. They have a choice now, between following the extravagant,
ostentatious style of life of other capitalist classes, which will lead to an
early communist revolution; and on the other hand a prudent and patriotic
sobriety, which may greatly prolong their dominance, and may enable the country
to pass gradually to a different type of economy without the appalling suffering
and destruction of cultural values which communism involves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so many dubious purposes, that it has almost ceased to have any meaning. For
what he had in view for the richer classes under Swaraj is very similar to what
is advocated here. He used the term trusteeship: he meant that there should be
no confiscation, but that the rich should voluntarily limit their personal
expenditure, and devote the bulk of their wealth to public purposes. He foresaw
that the alternative would be confiscation, and he was right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

change of attitude, a renunciation of the habit of conspicuous and competitive
expenditure, which is after all a recent import into India from the West, at
least among the capitalist class, and is indeed a relatively new thing for
capitalists even there. Until the late Victorian age the typical capitalist in
the West worked hard and lived soberly and thriftily. In the same way in India,
until a generation ago, the tradition among the capitalists was that of the
merchants in mediaeval India who, as Moreland relates, “studied to appear
indigent” to protect themselves from pillage, and devoted their surplus to
works of piety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tradition, handed on by Mahatma Gandhi, ought to be revived but with the
difference that surplus wealth must be spent on modern means of production, or
lent to the Government for the same purpose. The country needs, for a long
transition period, a combination of the mediaeval or Gandhian life-style of low
living and high thinking with the scientific outlook and technology of the
modern age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

combination is a somewhat contradictory one. It will doubtless be thought quite
fantastic to demand of the new ruling class that they should cease to celebrate
their triumph, and should voluntarily simplify their lives in order to give up
a substantial fraction of their incomes for public purposes. But the
alternative is plain: economic decline, revolt, and dictatorship, in all
probability a communist dictatorship. If we of the middle and upper classes do
not give up a fraction of our wealth voluntarily, we shall lose the whole of it
by coercion, and–to make it quite clear–a great many of us will lose our necks
as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

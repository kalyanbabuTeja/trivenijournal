<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
outstanding event in the quarter April–June 1912 was the carrying on of the
negotiations between India and Pakistan for a durable peace, first at the
official level and next at the level of a summit meeting at <span class=SpellE>Simla</span>
between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Pakistan leading to
the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement signed on 2nd July. The
negotiations at <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> were rather protracted and till
the very last moment it appeared that they would break down as there was hard
bargaining by both sides. <span class=SpellE>UItimately</span> between wisdom
and good sense prevailed and the Agreement was the result. The <span
class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement had been acclaimed as a historic basis one
and was generally welcomed in the country except by the Jana <span
class=SpellE>Sangh</span>, a few Socialists, and certain prominent leaders like
<span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span> and Acharya <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>.
The welcome was based on the ground that, though it did not settle all the
issues which lay at the root of misunderstandings between the two countries during
the last twenty-five years, it was a first step in that direction and that it
laid down an effective method for the purpose. Everyone <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
that it was only the first step and that several more should be taken before
real peace could be established between the two countries and that the future
alone would decide to what extent the method would prove really effective. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Of
all the issues between the two countries <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>
occupies a central place. All others like the evacuation of territories occupied
during the last (December 1971) war and the release of prisoners of war are
secondary in character. Kashmir is legally as much part of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> as any other States like Andhra or <span
class=SpellE>Tamilnadu</span> but <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> has not <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> this. It has laid claims to <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>
as a whole and has been in illegal and forceful occupation of nearly a third of
it. It has even ceded a part of it to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. All the three wars which it
has so far waged against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were aimed at the conquest of the whole of the state. It was this aim that she
entered into military alliances with the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>,
(CEATO) and with states like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iran</st1:country-region>
and Turkey (CENTO) and established intimate relations with <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>.
Its advocacy of the principle of self-determination for the people of <st1:place
w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> has had the same aim. It is clear that there can
be no lasting peace between the two countries unless <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
gives up its illegal claim to Kashmir and enters into a compromise with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
considered reasonable by the latter. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has shown on more than one
occasion her readiness to enter into such a compromise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
question therefore would naturally be asked whether the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span>
Agreement brought the settlement of the <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>
issue nearer. It does so only remotely and indirectly. It does this in a variety
of ways. In the first place the Agreement contains the clause: “The two
countries are resolved to settle their differences by <i>peaceful </i>means
through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed
upon between them.” Commentators on the Agreement have drawn special attention
to two points in this clause, viz., the stress on peaceful means for settling disputes
and that on bilateral negotiations. It is <span class=GramE>a recognition</span>
on the part of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> that
wars like those of 1965 and 1971 could do little to settle issues like <st1:place
w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. It is also a recognition that military alliances
would be equally futile in bringing victory to her in such wars and that
intervention by a third party like the U.N.O., which has had the Kashmir in its
agenda all these years, would serve no purpose and that if the Kashmir issue
has to be solved it can be done only through direct negotiations with India and
not through mediation by a third party. Our Prime Minister was very firm
throughout the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> meeting on the method of bilateralism
and it paid dividends in the end and it brought round President Bhutto to her
point of view. This is an improvement on the Tashkent Agreement where the role
of Soviet Russia was significant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
is also in the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement a more direct and positive
reference to <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. This is the clause which
says: “Both sides will meet to discuss further the modalities and arrangements for
their establishment of durable peace and <span class=SpellE>normalisation</span>
of relations, including a final settlement of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Jammu and Kashmir</st1:place></st1:State> and that both governments
will take all steps within their power to prevent hostile propaganda directed
against each other.” This again is in contrast to Tashkent Agreement which
merely said that <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jammu and Kashmir</st1:place></st1:State>
was discussed and each of the sides set forth its respective positions and did
not commit them to further discussions on the subject or to its final
settlement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
much more important aspect of the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement is
the clause which says: “In <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jammu and
  Kashmir</st1:place></st1:State> the line of control resulting from the cease-fire
of December 17, 1971 shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> positions of either side. Neither side shall
seek to alter its unit laterally irrespective of mutual differences and legal
interpretations. Both sides further undertake to refrain from the threat of use
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>force in violation of this
line.” This clause is of the greatest significance in more than one way. At <st1:City
w:st="on">Tashkent</st1:City> we were persuaded, to give up the areas we
occupied in <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> during the war of 1965,
even though they included some strategic passes. Now <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> <span class=SpellE>recognises</span>
our title to occupy the areas taken possession of in the war of 1971. This
means that the old cease-fire line laid down in 1949 holds good no longer and
that the U.N. observers who were functioning all these years in Kashmir will
have no place and they should leave the area. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
has, it is true some hesitation in accepting this outcome but <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is firm
on the issue. It has made clear that bilateralism is as necessary in regard to
the new line as in regard to other matters at issue between the two countries.
Finally this clause if adhered to in its true spirit rules out any
encouragement to <span class=SpellE>saboteaurs</span>, infiltrators and other disturbers
of peace. It thus marks a definite advance on <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Tashkent</st1:place></st1:City>. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
has now <span class=SpellE>realised</span> the realities of the situation in <st1:place
w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. This will prevent it from interfering in its
internal affairs and will also weaken her attempts to create tensions on this
issue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We
may therefore conclude that though the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement
has not finally settled the <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> issue it
has paved the way for such settlement. Whether President Bhutto will make use
of this new way, enter into bilateral negotiations with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and come to a permanent understanding with
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will of course depend on the internal situation in his own country. His
position has not yet become fully <span class=SpellE>stabilised</span>. The
army junta continues to be dominant. Democracy has not been established and
popular forces which stand for peace not released. Above all there are the
imperial powers<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>–China and U. S. A.</span>–<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>which </span>live on <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>tensions in </span>the sub-continent. <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s
veto on the admission of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Bangladesh</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> to U.N.O. is </span>evidence of this. All
this goes to show that it is premature to take the view that the <span
class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement has settled the issue of <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>.
Bhutto has been harping on the right of the people of <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>
for self-determination even after he signed the Agreement and invoking the
intervention of U.N.O. in the matter. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> cannot therefore afford to
give up her vigilance and become complacent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Of
the two other issues arising out of the war of 1971–the withdrawal from
occupied territory outside <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> and the
returning of prisoners of war–only the former was settled at <span
class=SpellE>Simla</span>. <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
agreed to withdraw from all the territory in <span class=SpellE>Sind</span> and
<st1:place w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place>. Being the victor in the war <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it </span>could have retained this territory
pending the settlement of the <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> issue.
But both prudence and magnanimity prevailed <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>with </span>the Prime Minister. We did not wage war to conquer any part
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Our object was primarily the liberation of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this objective and prudence dictated
that we should be content with </span>it. <span class=GramE>Hence the
willingness to withdraw from the occupied territory.</span> This could not
apply to <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> because what our forces occupied
there is legally a part of our own country. As regards the return of the 90,000
prisoners of war the Prime Minister made <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>position quite clear and she had firmly adhered to it. The war in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:country-region> was fought jointly </span>by the
Indian army and the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Mukti</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span><span class=SpellE>Vahini</span> and
the prisoners were under the joint control of the governments of both <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They could not
therefore be released unless with the consent of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
and that to secure her consent <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
should deal directly <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with </span>her
Government. The release therefore of the prisoners of war depends entirely on
Bhutto’s readiness to confer <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with </span>the
representatives of the Government of Bangladesh. He however knows that no such
conference is possible unless he <span class=SpellE>recognises</span> <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He has
not yet chosen to do so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> also may not be prepared to release them–in

 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> would adhere to the path
of peace as laid down in the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement. The
prisoners of war have been well-trained to fight and their release would mean
the strengthening of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
military arm. This necessitates <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>

now see what the <span class=SpellE>Simla</span> Agreement has been able to accomplish
and the limitations under which it suffers. This is why our Prime <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Minister </span>was careful to say that it was
only the first step in the way to peace with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and that many more steps were
necessary before peace could become a reality. We should continue to build our
strength both on the military and economic fronts. We should also cement our
friendship with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and use all diplomatic skill to root out the anti-Indian forces which are
active there. Though the Government of Bangladesh is committed to democracy and
secularism there are remnants of the old Muslim League with its anti-Hindu and
anti-Indian attitude raising their heads. There is also a powerful Communist
party led by <span class=SpellE>Maulana</span> <span class=SpellE>Bhashani</span>
with its pro-China sympathies. There is again an American lobby with its
growing strength. All these are interested in fomenting anti-Indian feeling
among the masses. They do not attach any value, to <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s
role in liberating <st1:country-region w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
than the tyranny of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
This is the situation which Indian diplomacy has to face and every step has to
be taken in consultation with the Government of Bangladesh to see that the kind
of anti-Indian sentiment does not grow here as is found in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ceylon</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Friendly ties with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Bangladesh</st1:country-region> are of far greater importance than even
normal relations with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

elections to State Assemblies in March resulted in the Congress becoming the
ruling party in all the states except in <span class=SpellE>Tamilnadu</span>,
Orissa and Kerala where elections were not held, In Kerala the Congress is the dominant
partner in the coalition Ministry which continues in power in spite of the
tensions created by the agitation over the management of private colleges. In
Orissa the Congress succeeded in its attempts to create rifts in the coalition
Ministry and has become the ruling party with <span class=SpellE>Nandini</span>
<span class=SpellE>Satpathy</span> as the Chief Minister. As in the case of
Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Gujarat, she has been sent from <st1:City

Ministry as no local leader was found competent enough to hold the post. <span

holds power. But the D.M.K. has been accused the Central Congress leadership of
trying to topple it. This may or may not be true. What is true is the almost
complete hold of the Congress over the whole country. What we have is one-party
rule. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

significant outcome of this is the attempt to transform verbal socialism to

is against this background that we have to understand the excitement <span

carried on by the Congress party in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the
imposition of ceilings on agricultural holdings and on urban property in the
quarter April–June. The arguments put forward in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of such imposition were economic, political and even social. It was contended
that as a result of investment in irrigation, electric power, machinery,
improved seed, <span class=SpellE>fertilisers</span> and so on the rich farmers
have become richer while poorer ones as well as tenants and landless <span
class=SpellE>labourers</span> continued to remain poor. Tenancy legislation has
only resulted in the eviction of tenants and in rack-renting. Legislation
regarding <span class=SpellE>mininum</span> wage for agricultural <span
class=SpellE>labourers</span> has not produced any real benefit to them. If
their condition is to be improved land should be taken from the rich farmers
and distributed among the landless and those with uneconomic holdings. Moreover
land is a gift of nature and its area is limited. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Besides
this it has been argued that in rural areas the rich farmers wield all
political power because of their wealth and stand in the way of the effective
functioning of democracy. Unless their power is reduced at its source the
weaker sections of the rural society will continue to be weak. Under the
leadership of the Prime Minister the Congress party is attempting to secure a
hold over the weaker sections and be sure of their electoral support. The
distribution of surplus land taken away from the rich farmers among the
landless is considered to be an effective instrument for this purpose. The
reduction of the political power of the rich farmers is also necessary if farm
incomes are to be taxed. All along they have been standing in the way of such
taxation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is pointed out that the rich farmers invariably belong to the dominant
castes like the <span class=SpellE>Reddis</span>, the <span class=SpellE>Kammas</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Vokkaligars</span>, the <span class=SpellE>Lingayats</span>,
etc., and that a reduction of their economic and political power <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will be conducive </span>to a modification
of the rigidities of the caste system in rural areas. It is these <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>castes that s</span>ubject <span
class=SpellE>Harijans</span> to all kinds of injustice and if governmental
policies to improve their lot are to succeed, the dominance of the rich farmers-castes
should be put an end to. It is on the basis and strength of arguments like
these–economic, political and social–that opinion <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
to the imposition of ceilings on agricultural holdings has been created and
that in almost all the states the Congress party in power has placed necessary
legislation on the statute book. A few states have also evaded legislation
imposing ceilings on urban property also. An important step has thus been taken
in the direction of putting socialist policies into effect. Verbal socialism is
being transformed into socialism in action. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
all problems arising out of this legislation have not yet been solved. There is
first the problem of implementation. There is a wide-spread feeling that the
earlier legislation on ceilings has not yielded much of surplus land for
distribution because the officials whose responsibility is to implement the
legislation colluded with the landlords who were rich enough to bribe them.
Even today corruption is widely prevalent and there is no guarantee that officials
will behave better in discharging their responsibility in discovering the
surplus land. One suggestion is that Government should appoint village
committees for the purpose. It remains to be seen whether non-officials will be
less corrupt than officials. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Second
problem is among whom should the <span class=SpellE>surplas</span> land be distributed–should
preference be given to landless poor or to farmers who have uneconomic
holdings? From the point of view of production the case of the farmers is
strong. To make their holding economic will add to production. A landless <span
class=SpellE>labourer</span> to whom one or two acres of land are given may not
be able to make full use of it. Past experience shows that such persons prefer to
sell away their lands or lease them to others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
third problem is to provide the capital necessary to enable the new farmers to
cultivate the lands given to them. This calls for better organisation of rural
credit. Any failure or delay in doing this is sure to affect agricultural
production. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally
we come to a more serious problem. Farmers are permitted to own 10–18 acres of
irrigated land under the new legislation. They are expected to cultivate it
more intensively, invest more capital in improving it and produce more than
what they did in the past. But will they do this? What guarantee is there that there
will be no further reduction in ceilings in future? Many landless will ask “Why
should some have ten acres? Why not reduce the area to five acres?” In terms of
social justice such reduction is the only answer to the question. Such
questions will be repeated until all private property in land is abolished and
land becomes nationalized. Is the Congress party prepared for this? Is it prepared
to introduce collective farming as in Soviet Russia? This should be the logical
end to any legislation on ceilings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

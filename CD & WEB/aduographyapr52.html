function of biography was defined once by Sir Sidney Lee, who succeeded Sir
Leslie Stephen as the Editor of ‘The Dictionary of National Biography,’ as the
truthful transmission of personality. We know however that most biographies are
composed on the principle of <i>nit nisi bonum, </i>notwithstanding the fashion
set by Lytton Strachey of converting biography into an exercise in post-mortem
denigration of one’s older contemporaries. And with a few distinguished
exceptions, biographers have tended largely to complete the undertaker’s task,
burying their subjects in two or three volumes, as solid as tombs and as
revelatory of the inner personalities as tombstones. If purposeful and truthful
biographies are rather rare, truthful and purposeful autobiographies are rarer
still. The function of autobiography is strictly the same as that of
biography–except that the task of transmission of personality is undertaken by
the subject himself. Personality is partly consciously and largely
unconsciously revealed in autobiography. Sometimes autobiography degenerates
into an exercise in more or less unconscious hypocrisy and sometimes it rises
to the grandest heights of self-revelation, making the study of auto-biography
range between the extremes of vicious self-indulgence and ennobling spiritual
self-discipline. Autobiographies of the ennobling kind are rather few
altogether, though the few there are are among the finest productions of the
human mind, like St. Augusti</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ne’s ‘Confessions’, Gandhiji’s ‘Story of
My Experiments with Truth’ and Wordsworth’s ‘The Prelude’. There are a few
autobiographies </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of a less distinguished class, portraying not
personality of less distinction of mind or heart, but dealing with issues of
some </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>what less transcendent human significance. To this class
belongs Nehru’s Autobiography which is truly a classic of England prose.
Nehru’s Autobiography is indeed more important to an understanding of the inner
history of India’s struggle for freedom </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>than Gandhiji’s
Autobiography. But Gandhiji’s Autobiography is important for the story of man’s

is another class of autobiography, much the largest class, consisting of
reminiscences and memoirs of politicians, men of letters, lawyers, businessmen
and others. This class of auto-biographers write to justify this or that aspect
of their conduct or character, which they believe to be susceptible of
criticism, or to portray their times. Sometimes the writing degenerates into
mere gossip. And sometimes the writing becomes an irritating exercise in the
display of self-importance. Very seldom do we get honest accounts of events in
individual lives, or modest accounts of the growth of individual minds, or
truly instructive accounts of a personal point of view such as we find in
Mill’s ‘Autobiography’ or in that little marvel of self-revelation which
Professor G. M. Trevelyan gave us recently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Duography is however an innovation in autobiographical writing. It is an experiment
in the joint revelation of two personalities, or rather of two selves. Success
in this class of writing would seem inherently difficult to achieve. Rarely are
ever a happily married couple found in such a state of temperamental harmony as
to be able to submerge their separate, individual selves in a joint act of
self-revelation. Even two persons wedded to the same ideal cause seldom see
things the same way all the while. Everyone is inevitably an Indestructible
himself or herself, and the self-discipline required for even the partial
self-effacement essential to a duography is rarely achieved. But in the work
under review, the Cousinses would seem to have achieved a more than complete
harmonization of their separate and highly individual selves and to have
justified, by their success, the daring literary experiment they have
undertaken. The book tells a clear story and closely constructed. It is a real
triumph, from an artistic standpoint, for though the story is of two lives, the
blending is so close and so complete that it reads like a single whole. One has
to make a slight effort to find out at which point Jim stops the story and lets
Gretta take charge. And though there are discernible differences of style,
Gretta scoring by her pointed, direct and firm grasp of fact and feeling, and
marked clarity and concision of expression, over Jim’s somewhat looser , far
looser use of language and occasional pomposity, these differences </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Cousinses say that
they began writing this autobiography after applying their minds to Cellini’s
remark that anyone who had reached forty and had done anything worthwhile
should write it down. And while with pardonable pride they realized that they
had done something worthwhile, Mrs. Cousins in the field of the political and
social emancipation of Indian womanhood and both Dr. and Mrs. Cousins in
intensifying interest in art and culture in the sphere of Indian education,
they also realized that in comparison with what still remained to be done, what
had been done seemed as nothing. It is this disarming modesty, this humility in
their approach to India; that makes their story so extraordinarily charming.
The Cousinses came out to India not to tell India what was wrong with her and
how terribly backward she was politically, socially and otherwise, but in the
spirit of earnest seekers and servants of her best interests, imbued with a
deep and abounding humanity and with that rarest of qualities, imaginative
sympathy. They came from Ireland, which had not yet freed herself from British
political tutelage. They had played a very prominent part in the remarkable
literary Renaissance which preluded the emergence of Ireland as the free,
independent nation that she was entitled to be. Their religious and cultural
background and their early life contain sufficient indications of the probable
field of their future activity. Young Jim’s early experience of religious
fanaticism culminating in religious riots led to those honest, earnest
philosophic doubts which are worth so much more than creeds half-heartedly
held. He would seem quite early to have developed a truly universal, almost
theosophic outlook. He saw, for example, the humorous as well as the depressing
side of those who looked, as did a neighbour of his Ma, on the Lord as a
Protestant. His artistic soul early rebelled against the hideous narrowness of
this attitude, as well as the unlovely cruelty of those who invented dire
cruelties in an impossibly cruel Hell as the portion of those who didn’t
blindly feed their minds on the dogma of the Church. Young Gretta would seem to
have shown equally unmistakable indications of her future interest in Music and
Theosophy. She got her first ideas of Mme. Blavatsky from a sketch of her
published in W. T. Stead’s ‘Review of Reviews,’ which stood out then as a bold
and fearless champion of unpopular causes. The Cousinses dwell with becoming
brevity on these episode, which, significant as they were for them, have
naturally a more mited interest for us. They dwell, to our great delight, with
far greater elaboration on the part they played in the revival of poetry and
drama in Ireland. Dr. Cousins is an authentic poet and the mystical strain in
him, combined with his rich store of Irish and Indian myths, makes his poetry
very rewarding and delightful reading to those who have a taste for these
things in poetry, and indeed to all who care for real poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>To us in India, the account of their meeting with
the truly Wonderful Dr. Annie Besant is significant, because their journey to
India followed soon after that fateful meeting. This meeting was to give them a
truly rewarding field of activity. Of Dr. Cousins’s work in making Indian
education creative, and particularly in getting education to embrace art and
the things of beauty in life, there is plenty here told, with that gusto and
honest enthusiasm that are so remarkable a feature of Dr. Cousins as man and
teacher. There is also a quiet gaiety and subtle humour in the account of
various experiences of Dr. Cousins’s as an educator of <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
1.0pt'>Indian youth, at a time when Indian youth was ardent for national
freedom. Dr. Cousins’s account of the Madras University </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt'>Academic Council’s ordinary meeting, as, well
as of the attitude of the educational ‘authorities’ under the British regime to
teachers </span>who took their responsibilities to young men seriously, rings
absolutely true. It is, however, noteworthy that, friend of Indian aspirations
as he was, Dr. Cousins showed a rare detachment in dealing with a certain
Educational Officer’s demand for the dismissal on political grounds of a
nationalistic-minded member of Dr. Cousins’s staff in the institution at
Madanapalle. Of Mrs. Margaret Cousins, it need only be said that the account
here given of the generous devotion and energy she showed in the cause of the
emancipation of Indian womanhood says nothing new to those who have studied the
events of those glorious years of struggle which preceded the birth of our
Republic. Mrs. Cousins thoroughly identified herself with us in those crucial
years. It was not an impulse of the moment–a generous fit–but merely the
fulfilment on Indian soil of the mission of the Irish and English suffragette
in the cause of womanhood itself. Mrs. Cousins threw herself also into the
political struggle against the British Raj by fearlessly courting imprisonment
in the cause of free speech. Her story of these events, told with charming
detachment, makes moving<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>reading. There
have been many foreign friends of India, many generous souls moved to the
support of India’s struggle for recapturing her own national soul. But the
Cousinses and Dr. Annie Besant, Whose gift to India they were, will be
Specially remembered for the utterly simple-hearted zeal which they showed in
their <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>support of India’s cause. The
most sympathetic students of India’s history, culture, art and music, have been
known sometimes to affect a somewhat patronizing air of superiority. Of any
such air there is not the faintest trace here. We will not say the Cousinses
have penetrated the arcana of our national being. But they have come nearer to
it than any foreigners ever have to any national arcana. Altogether, there is
in this volume, an abundance of rich and vitalizing matter. There is a generous
idealism about it all which will inspire others, we trust, to look upon good
causes all over the world as their own. And above all, the book is a true book,
rich in humanity; rich in all that renders us kin with the Cousinses and with
generous souls all over the world. Everyone in India ought to buy, read and
cherish this book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

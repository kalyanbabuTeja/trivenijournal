style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two essentials of our political system are parliamentary democracy and
federalism with a strong centre. Several factors have, however, emerged,
especially in the months preceding and following the last general election
which pose a threat to these essentials. Unless steps are taken to effectively
curb them without further delay, our political system, as it was shaped by the
founding-fathers of our Constitution, may disappear, giving place first to a
period of anarchy and confusion and next to the rise of some other system not
in consonance with the modern tradition that has developed in our country
during the last one century or with the ideals of freedom which should animate all
of us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
threat to parliamentary democracy has come from what is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>called
“Direct Action” which is fast becoming a normal feature of the political
process in the country. Even in its peaceful and non-violent form it is a
menace to democracy. It has, however, ceased to be non-violent. It has taken a
universally violent form resulting in large-scale destruction of public and
private property, loss of life. Lawlessness and disorder have become matters of
course interfering with the people in the pursuit of their daily avocations.
The primary <span class=GramE>function</span> of any government–democratic
otherwise–is the maintenance of law and order and the protection of life and
property. Today in several parts of the country–the north and in the
south–governments are unable to discharge this function. Those who are
resorting to direct action invariably succeeded in getting their demands
satisfied and this encourages them to repeat their action. It is the
law-abiding citizen that suffers. <span class=SpellE>Goondas</span> and
hooligans are having their own way. If this happens for a few days or even
weeks, it may not cause alarm but it has been going on for months and there are
no signs of its coming to a stop. Governments feel helpless and do not take any
action to meet it. The police forces on which <span class=SpellE>crores</span> of
tax-payers’ money is spent have become immobile. Naturally people are asking
the simple and straightforward question: Who the rulers of the country are? Woe
to any government when people begin to ask a question like this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
causes worry and anxiety is not merely the helplessness of governments and the
inaction or ineffective action by those in charge of law and order but also the
fact that many political parties in the country have become the staunch
advocates of direct action and show a preference to it to achieve their
objectives over action in legislatures. A democracy guarantees to citizens the
right to <span class=SpellE>organise</span> themselves into associations, meet
in assemblies and give expression to their opinions with considerable freedom.
In consequence of such a guarantee political parties have come into existence
but they are using the rights granted to them by the Constitution not to
strengthen democracy but to weaken it and even to destroy it by resorting to
direct action as a normal feature of their activities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Worse
than this is the fact that such action is being encouraged by governments in
some states–notably in <st1:place w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place> and Kerala.
Under their influence several sections of the people have taken the law into
their own hands and are creating a chaotic situation which is a prelude to
taking over complete power by them in accordance with the techniques which are
a part of their creed. Nothing is more paradoxical in our political situation
today than governments in certain states conniving at lawlessness and violence.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
many countries of the world, including the highly advanced and affluent ones, <span
class=SpellE>laoour</span> <span class=SpellE>organisations</span> have been
staunch advocates of direct action in the form of strikes to gain their
economic objectives. They preferred this and they do so even now–to negotiating
with their employers round a table. The extremists among them have been
advocates of a general strike to bring to a dead stop the whole economy of a
country. But it was very rarely that they used this method to gain any
political advantage. For this purpose they relied on parliamentary action.
Unfortunately in our country <span class=SpellE>labour</span> <span
class=SpellE>organisations</span> have developed on quite different lines.
Trade unions are dominated by political parties which is a sign of the
immaturity of <span class=SpellE>labour</span>. And parties which are
interested more in gaining political power misuse the control they have over
unions for political purposes and these union, have under their influence
frequently resorted to direct action to bring pressure not on employers but on
Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another cause for alarm is the large part played by
students in the movement for direct action. The student community has become a
potent political force today. Students have ceased to be students. Educational
institutions have ceased to be the arena of their work. They are more active in
streets, on railway tracks, around police stations, Post-offices and other
Government offices. Their school or college serves for them the purpose of
enabling them to meet and to concert plans for their non-academic activities <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>elsewhere. Their hostels also serve a similar
purpose. Because of their youth they are full of energy and enthusiasm.
Experience </span>has not taught them to understand the long-period
consequences of their reckless and irresponsible <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>.
As a political force they have several advantages. Their numbers are large.
There are now more than one and half million students in the seventy
universities of the country. They are congregated in university campuses and in
individual colleges which give them all the opportunities they need to
undertake concerted action. They have their unions which have now become more
like trade unions. They have funds collected from members. Many of them are
members of several political parties, especially of a leftist character, and
they get additional funds from political parties whenever they need them.
Political parties which are behind them are ready to defend their activities
whatever form they may take and give them substantial support in parliament and
other legislative bodies. Direct action has become more of a threat as the
large <span class=GramE>body of students have</span> got involved in it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally
we come to several academicians who lend their support on what they call
theoretical and scientific grounds to direct action as a legitimate part of the
democratic political process. Most of them are fellow-travellers and they only
wear the academic cloak to avoid public criticism. In reality they do not
believe in democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
now considered who the sections of the people are that resort to direct action,
both non-violent and violent, it is necessary to understand why it is
incompatible with democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we do this we must have a clear idea of the mistaken view of democracy which
the advocates of direct action have. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>do
whatever they (the people) want them to do. Their theory is that Government
elected by the people is their servant and it is bound to carry out what is
dictated to it by them. They take refuge in that oft-quoted but thoroughly
wrong definition of democracy attributed to Abraham Lincoln that it is <i>Government
of the people, for the people, by the people. </i>The sooner we understand that
this is a wrong definition of democracy, the better it will be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Government
by the people is <span class=GramE>an impossibility</span>; even if possible,
it is most undesirable, for the simple reason that they do not have the fitness
or competence to govern. It is not possible for the millions of people in a
modern state to assemble in one place, discuss the merits and defects of any
particular course of action to be taken on a public issue and arrive at a
decision. This was possible only in the small cities of ancient <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Modern
democracy is representative democracy and it can be nothing else. What the
people can do is not to govern but to elect those who are to govern. Of course
in the interval between one general election and another they are free to
express their views on the commissions and omissions of Government and shape
public opinion, and Government watches the opinion and takes it into
consideration in arriving at decisions. In many cases it ignores the opinion
and takes the responsibility for ignoring it. It does not behave and it ought
not to behave like a mere servant. It is in the position of a leader and a
leader does not deserve the name if he blindly follows those who have to be led
by him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from the fact that Government by the people is <span class=GramE>an
impossibility</span>, modern democracy rests on an equally valid assumption
that people are incompetent to govern. Government is an art and like any other
art it requires a certain kind of knowledge, experience, skill and ability
which only some and not all possess. This is why politicians have become a
class by themselves. They constitute a profession like the doctors, the
lawyers, the teachers, and members of other professions. Moreover people in
mass are easily excitable. We know how the crowds behave. They can be easily
swayed by demagogues who have the capacity to flatter them and appeal to their
lower passions. To make them the rulers and to treat the Government as their
agent or servant is to place power in the hands of those who are not fit to
exercise it. The people have a place in democracy but that does not entitle
them to govern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
theory of direct action goes against this correct view of democracy. It forgets
that the essence of all government is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>decision-making on all
public issues. It may be the levy of one tax in preference to another, one
pattern of recruitment to public offices in preference to another, expenditure
on one item of welfare instead of another. Every public issue has a number of
alternative solutions to it. It is not like a mathematical problem which has only
one correct solution to it. Each solution may be desirable from one point of
view and undesirable from another. But some choice has to be made and it should
be done by a responsible body which has the necessary competence for the
purpose and which can calmly consider the pros and cons of each choice that is
open. From the time when civilisation has come into existence with its <span
class=SpellE>specialisation</span> of functions, it has been universally <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> that Government is the body which should be
entrusted with the function of decision-making. Democracy cannot hand over this
function to the people. Democracy only lays down how a Government should be
constituted.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us see what direct action exactly means. A number of people in a state like
Andhra demand that the fifth steel plant </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>should be located in <st1:place
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Vizagapatam</span></st1:place> and they call on
the Government to give effect to it by indulging in acts of sabotage and
destruction. They make the decision even though they have not the competence to
do it. Another group of people in another state demand the abolition of land
revenue and want the Government to immediately put it into effect without
giving an opportunity to it to consider the merits and defects of such a course
of action. A third group demands that the salaries of Government employees and
their D. A. should be raised by 20 per cent and resorts to a strike or to
pillage to enforce its<i> </i>demand. It is not prepared to listen to any
arguments that may be brought against what it demands and how it is going to
effect the general tax-payer or the other sections of the people to whom also
Government owes a responsibility. Wherever direct action is resorted to it is a
small group of people that take a decision and compel Government to accept it.
This is done on the basis of the theory that Government should carry out the
will<i> </i>of the people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
properly <span class=SpellE>analysed</span> it always amounts to rule by an
interested minority. On anyone of these and similar issues there is nothing
like a will of all the people. Decisions in all these cases are made by
irresponsible groups simply because they have the physical force to defy
Government and the <span class=SpellE>unorganised</span> sections among the
people. It is a sort of terror which they <span class=SpellE>practise</span>. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is at the point of the sword like the highway <span class=GramE>robber</span>
depriving a <span class=SpellE>traveller</span> of what he has that those who
resort to direct action behave. No more argument is required to show that it is
inconsistent with the principles of democratic government. There may be some
justification for it where government is a hereditary monarchy or an oligarchy
based on birth or wealth or a party dictatorship as is found in communist or
fascist regimes or a military dictatorship. It has no place in a democracy
where government consists of persons elected by the people themselves and where
people have every opportunity to replace one set of rulers by another in a
general election. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
point may be made clear by an analogy. <span class=GramE>Everyone</span> of
us–laymen as we are–has a right to choose his doctor, his lawyer, the teacher
for his children, the shoe-maker to make his shoes, the carpenter who makes the
articles of furniture he wants. It often happens that a patient is dissatisfied
with his doctor. Just see what he then does. He does not himself write out a
prescription and demand that the doctor should follow the prescription. He only
changes his doctor. <span class=GramE>Similarly in every other case.</span>
This is the right course for him to follow simply because he has not the
competence to do the work of the doctor, the lawyer and so on. He can however
judge whether their work is to his satisfaction. A person may not be able to
cook but he can judge whether the food prepared by a cook tastes sweet or
bitter. The same is the relation between people and the government in a
democracy. Direct action is just like a patient writing out a prescription and
asking the doctor to administer the medicine according to it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'> The other threat to democracy arises as a
result of a number of political parties in the country having no faith in it
being allowed not only to carry on propaganda against it but also to contest
elections and form governments. All Communist parties belong to this category.
They have formed a government in <st1:place w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place>
and in Kerala. They have also joined coalitions in <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>
and U. P. It is part of their creed that wherever they come to governmental
power they should use it to strengthen the Communist forces in the state and
undermine the strength of democratic forces. They make it a point to recruit
large number of communists into the state police force, into the ranks of the
state civil service, the teachers in state <span class=SpellE>scheols</span>,
and the employee in every other public or quasi-public organisation. All this
facilitates their easy-taking over of the government of the state completely
when a suitable opportunity arises. In the last stage of British rule in India
government was compelled to concede the Muslim League’s demand for Pakistan
when Jinnah resorted to direct action and one of the reasons which impelled
them to do so was the fact that a large percentage of policemen in Bengal,
Punjab, <span class=SpellE>Sind</span> and so on were Muslims who would not be
of any use in suppressing the direct action resorted to by the League. This is
the kind of predicament in which our Central Government will find itself in
states which come under the Control of communist parties as Kerala and <st1:place
w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place> have already come. The existence in the
country of parties wedded to the overthrow of democracy but enjoying all the
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution is another serious threat to
our political system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is time that the Central Government abandons the policy of drift which it has
so far been following in dealing with those who resort to direct action and who
are using their political power as partners in United Front Governments in some
states to strengthen anti-democratic forces and bring about a revolution as a
result of which democracy would disappear and an authoritarian form of
government will be established. We require at the Centre a leadership which is
capable of taking firm decisions and enforcing them. For years such a
leadership has been absent and this is the one reason why the anti-democratic
forces are gaining ground. Those who want to stage a violent revolution are
carrying on their rehearsals in the form of direct action. It is they that are
setting up local popular committees, raising quasi-military guards in the form
of <span class=SpellE>Senas</span> and doing everything possible to strengthen <span
class=GramE>themselves</span> so that they might establish an independent government
when their preparations are complete. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is this that also poses a threat to our federal system. In a federation the
constituent units have a large amount of freedom granted to them and this is
the case with the states in the Indian Union. After the fourth general election
it has become the fashion with the various non-Congress governments which have
come into power in several states to find fault with the Centre for anything
and everything and making it responsible for shortcomings and failures in their
policy. Space does not permit giving a detailed account of their policies from
this point<i> </i>of view. It is enough to note that they have been carrying
incessant propaganda among their people that for all the ills they are
suffering from, it is the Centre that is to blame. The result is that the
loyalty of the people to the Centre is being undermined and a feeling is
created among them that it would be better if their state secedes from the
Centre and becomes independent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is noteworthy in this connection that a member of <span class=SpellE>Rajya</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> from Kerala demanded during the discussions on
the Unlawful Activities Bill that each state should be conceded the right of
secession as is the case in Soviet Russia and to demand secession should not be
regarded as a crime. This is the direction in which the communist opinion in
the country has been moving and if it grows stronger it will strike a blow
against our federal system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Communist party is at present the one party in the country which stands for the
secession of states from the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>. This is
due to two powerful reasons. One is that it has no chance of coming into power
at the Centre in any foreseeable future either as a constituent of a coalition
government or by its own right. And it is not satisfied with the kind of power
which the Constitution gives to it in states. It is only sovereign independence
that will satisfy it and it is in this direction that it is moving in Kerala
and in <st1:place w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place> the only states where it
has fair chances of remaining in power. The second is that it is part of an
international Communist organisation and is anxious that the states over which
it rules should have diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. One of
the demands made by the Kerala Chief Minister after the fourth general
elections was that he should be free to import rice directly from foreign
countries. He had evidently <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in mind. It is also a matter of common knowledge that the extremists among them
are anxious to create a <st1:country-region w:st="on">Viet Nam</st1:country-region>
in <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place> and Kerala. They have not forgotten
the days when they were able to make themselves a power in Telengana in
1947-48. With independence in one state or another which would enable them to
get arms from their “fatherlands” they can spread themselves into other parts of
the country as Mao did in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after first establishing himself in <span class=SpellE>Yenan</span>. The
Communist ideology is anti-federal as well as anti-democratic. Every extension
of their power in the country will deal a blow to the two essential features of
our Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

great problem that confronts all those who have faith in democracy and in the
evolutionary process, through which it proposes to bring about all desirable
social and economic changes, should think now of the ways and means by which
the threat to democracy posed by the advocates of direct action and by
Communist parties should be met. Otherwise the country will have to witness in
a new form the anarchic conditions which came into existence in the eighteenth
century after the collapse of the <span class=SpellE>Mughal</span> Empire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

agents’ meeting came to a close and they were all dispersing with contentment
in their looks. But Iswar Rao was an unhappy exception, for he received not
even a pie as commission. He was leaving the hall with empty hands, and a
dejected countenance. Would the goddess presiding over insurance ever smile
upon him? Just as he stepped out of the hall, a servant of the company informed
him that the General Manager was calling him. Iswar Rao dragged himself to the
Manager’s table, and sank Wearily into a chair in front of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Manager, with the air of a professor of practical insurance, continued to
initiate the neophyte into the deeper mysteries of insurance. “Man, generally,
is interested in the present, and is not prudent enough to lay by something
against the rainy day. He is so self- centred that he cares a hang for the
future as well as that of his dependants. Do you understand?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he proceeded, “Mr. Rao, you must not despair. Work with a will and your efforts
will be crowned with success sooner or later. From sunrise to sunset you must
be thinking about insurance. Suppose you are travelling in a train. You have
much time on hand. You can talk alluringly about the thousand and one benefits
of insurance (to your fellow-passengers) and of the innumerable sufferings of
the wives and children of those who died without insuring their lives. Your
words will find fertile soil in the minds of at least a few persons and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rao felt pleased with the monetary encouragement. He felt that his erstwhile
failures were only stepping stones to success and that self-confidence was
returning. When others succeeded why shouldn’t he? He vowed that until he made
at least one person insure his life he would not touch food. He must succeed
this time at any cost. At Bezwada to begin with, he could fish one or two men
who were badly in need of the protective care of insurance. Grim determination
was depicted in every feature of his countenance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

agent strode to the railway station, booked his ticket, and seated himself in a
compartment which was almost empty. The Manager’s words were ringing in his
ears. He should not let slip even a moment, and could start hunting even in a
railway carriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

opposite to him was seated a young man of about twenty. He had a woe-begone
countenance, and was looking vacantly at others. From his dress and manner he
seemed to be a petty clerk in some office. His forlorn appearance inspired
Iswar Rao with new courage, and he determined to lose no time in casting his
net, for something in him told him that the youth was in dire need of an
insurance policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

idea was splendid, but this was his first case. The first blow was half the

business, and it was this consideration that weighed with him in the choice of
his profession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rao immediately rose from his seat, and sat beside the young man. He broke the
ice of conversation, and by clever question; elicited all information about his
position in life; this initial success ought to bring credit even to a veteran
insurance agent. The young mar was a poor elementary school teacher, drudging
through life. His family was small, and for the present he was able to manage
anyhow. But he would be at sea (according to the calculation of the agent) in a
few years, for with the passage of time his family was bound to increase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

long as there was the vital breath in his body, he might be able to support his
family, but if by an insidious stroke of blind fate he were to die, who would
look after his unfortunate wife and the little ones? This line of argument
seemed to be the most potent; it would bend the will of even those who were so
obstinately self-controlled as to resist the humanitarian appeals of life
insurance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the teacher did not show any signs of intelligence in his countenance. He
seemed to be suffering from a deep melancholy. He answered his questions with
uninterested absent-mindedness and vague looks. Perhaps the horrid picture of
his wife and children begging from door to door induced this fit of mental
depression on him. It was his sacred duty, as a humble servant of life
insurance, to lift people like this young man from the slough of despondency.
By drying the tears of this young man and bringing joy into his home, he would
not only serve the interests of his company, but also add to his merit in this
life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the agent, and seemed to show some eagerness to understand the mysteries of the
philosophy of life as expounded by the agent. Encouraged by this responsive
gesture of the teacher, the agent added, “Death is always near. It dogs men at
every step and assumes a thousand unrecognisable shapes. Once a bullock-cart
over-turned, and killed an innocent fellow who was passing along.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

turned pale. The agent’s harangue seemed to have produced the desired effect.
He was already halfway on the road leading to success. The teacher would surely

slackening in his efforts he continued his sermon on the uncertainty of human
life, carefully watching the changes of expression on the face of his listener.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the teacher, to the utter satisfaction of the agent, pulled a wry face. His
speech had overwhelmed him. The agent came out successful in the preliminary
part of his canvassing which was the most trying and delicate kind of work, and
it only remained now to impress upon him the necessity of buying a policy to
safeguard the future of his ‘better-half’ and children. As his prey was almost
in his grip, he did not want to waste any more time on ‘philosophy, but thought
of applying the naked grim truth of his doctrine directly and .finish him. With
an air of assumed solemnity he pleaded, “Dear teacher, pay heed to my words.
Please, don’t take them amiss. You have no property to fall back upon in times
of need. You are leading a precarious existence in a remote village on a mere
pittance, and you have no other source of income. Imagine for a moment in what
a miserable plight your wife and children will be in the event of death getting
the better of you and felling you with a cruel stroke. Ponder over this well.
They, poor victims of hunger and want, will be compelled to lead a dog’s life.”
Iswar Rao paused awhile darting stern looks at the poor teacher. The
melodramatic effect of his words sent a thrill along his own spinal cord. Even
he shuddered to think of the fate of his own wife. With a feeling of triumph
surging in his breast he scrutinised the teacher’s face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by mere lack of imagination. Even while nodding his head sheepishly, he lost

cheeks pursuing one another in a stream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

merely was to get him to agree to buy a policy for a paltry sum of Rs. 5000,

got in and sat beside the teacher. One of them said with disgust, “You silly ass!
We have been searching and searching for you, getting down at each and every

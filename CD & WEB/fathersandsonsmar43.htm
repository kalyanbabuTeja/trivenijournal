of opinion between a father and a grown-up son have always existed ever since
the dawn of civilization. We read in the <i>Ramayana </i>how Lakshmana was
wroth when he came to learn that Sri Rama, the eldest son, who was to have been
crowned Prince Regent, was denied that position by the intrigue of Kaikeyi,
their step-mother, The passage is very striking and every Hindu knows the story
of how Lakshmana was prepared to fight the aged Dasaratha and re-instate Sri Rama
on the throne. The irony lies in the fact that Dasaratha himself did not press
Rama to resign his crown, but Kaikeyi asked for the fulfillment of her boons,
which were at that juncture declared by her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the supreme authority of the father in Roman households, not only over his wife
and children but even over their children’s wives and children, in speaking of
the history of Law. We speak, again, with pride of modern. civilization which

throughout the length and breadth of India prevalent even today in this

occasions, such as marriage, or the celebration of the birth of a child. And
the elders, the father or the mother, the father-in-law or the mother-in-law
and aged relatives bless the youngsters and wish them long life and happiness.

Gorge Meredith’s <i>Ordeal of Richard Feverel. </i>My first attempt to read it
at the age of seventeen during my college days proved abortive. The entire
matter was too hard for me to understand and I could not get beyond the chapter
“Ferdinand and Miranda”. The vague recollection of ‘a System’ of education by
the father Sir Austin, of his son Richard, induced me to take up the book
again, early in the year 1908, when I had become a father, though of a
daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
principal impressions I received about English society of the year 1859 were
that in their aristocracy fathers had a hand in arranging the marriage of their
sons as in Hindu society, that mothers were as anxious to get their girls
married somehow as in India, as is evidenced in the marriage to an elderly
gentleman, of young Clare, brought about by the mother. The so-called romantic
attachment of, or the choice by, a young man and a young woman, could not be so
common as was frequently alleged to be the custom in society, according to the
impressions created in the minds of Hindu readers by the novels of Sir Walter
Scott. It surprised me that Meredith had nothing to say of the feeling of
repentance, if any, of Sir Austin Feverel, which should have been aroused in
him by the tragedy in Richard’s life caused by the latter’s temporary
unfaithfulness to his not highly intellectual wife Lucy, and by her later
death. The occasional reference in the novel to the ‘sowing of wild oats’
before marriage led me to believe that the institution and sanctity of the
family tie was beginning to break up in aristocratic English households.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
few biographies of Meredith written in 1909 and subsequently, long after his
death, reveal that certain autobiographical features are present in the novel.
George Meredith was an only son and his childhood was not quite happy. He lost
his mother at the age of five, and his father re-married when he was about
thirteen years old. He was sent to Germany for his studies at the age of
fourteen. Meredith lacked the influence of a mother at adolescence. So did his
son. Meredith’s first wife deserted him in the year 1858. Later, as if under a
law of a nemesis, Meredith’s son by that lady was alienated from him. These
unhappy reminiscent features have affected the depiction of the story, which is
an art-presentation of life as he found it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

novel begins, as in Meredith’s life, with the desertion of Sir Austin by his
wife, who ran away with a poet instead of a painter. Sir Austin’s relations
with Lady Blandish, who seems eternally waiting for Sir Austin’s asking for her
hand, are only those of a lady friend, but not as man and wife. The whole show
of silence about love in the household is given </span><span style='font-size:

Richard sees his father kiss Lady Blandish’s hand. My conviction is that the
tragedy of Richard’s life is in a sense due to his not having known the love of
a mother, who could have acted as an intermediary between father and son in
their mutual confidences. The system of Sir Austin that he should not have
allowed any chance for his son Richard, to observe the ways of the world and of
the love between man and woman, to have stopped even among servants any talk or
display of passion and that the boy should have been brought up in entire
ignorance of the human tie of man and wife, seems but an echo of the author’s
distrust of woman in actual life, though in his novels he has created so many
wonderful and fascinating heroines. Sir Austin himself, though he taught the
tenets of Christian religion to Richard, failed to show a Christian forgiveness
of his son, when the latter rushed into marriage with Lucy, simply because of
his belief that the bride did not have a decent education and a pure blood, nor
had he cared to find out the particulars of her upbringing and her genuine good
nature even when casually mentioned to him by Lady Blandish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

more observation about the hero, Richard Feverel. In Hindu society one may observe
that a father-trained boy develops none of the graces of life, while a
mother-trained boy is generally soft-hearted. So also, where the mother is a
non-entity in the household, the father-trained girl lacks the graces of
womanhood and grows imperious by example and habit. Richard’s sense of chivalry
and loveliness of character were entirely due to his calf-love for Lady
Blandish, and the latter’s love of the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affirm that the healthy normal traditions of early Rome were maintained by the
discipline of the family, resting on the supreme authority of the father, and
by the powerful influence of the mother to whom the early training of the child
was entrusted. All this was changed by the influence of Greek civilization. The
Roman citizen was confronted with new doctrines in politics and religion and
with Greek critical philosophy. Under these solvents, the fabric of tradition
fell to pieces and there arose a revolt against Roman discipline and the
tradition of self-effacement. The craving for individual distinction asserted
itself with irresistible vehemence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

thirty-five years ago, under the aegis of English education, Hindu lads were
beginning to smart under and protest against the authority of their parents,
both in the choice of the brides for their marriage and in the matter of their
intellectual or other careers in life. Those were pre-Sarada Act days. The
irrevocable betrothal of boys and girls at a very young age was quite common,
though consummation was fairly later in life in Brahmin society. The avenue of
jobs in all branches of Government service was a lure to the English-educated
youth. The desire to live sumptuously and with grandeur was taking hold of the
minds of the fathers too, of their generation, while the rising individualism
of young men was a factor in social disruption. Society had, however, not
advanced according to western standards for young men and women to meet in
Hindu society for individual choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who were anxious to get their daughters married early, were not loath to take
advantage of the rise of individualism of youth, especially when the young man
had secured a decent billet. Parents were then in a conflicting frame of mind
regarding the marriage of their sons and daughters. They understood perfectly
well that a boy’s higher education would be hampered by the married life, and
the quasi-religious feeling that a girl should be betrothed before puberty made
the parents of girls press the parents of boys to accede to the marriage of their
sons, while the parents of boys were unwilling to do so. It was to get over
this conflict caused by the quasi-religious feeling that about the year 1910,
the Hon’ble V. S. Sastri brought in a Bill in the Madras Legislative Council,
of a permissive post-puberty marriage of a girl might have led to the
pronouncement of the marriage as illegal, and to difficulties in the
inheritance of property by their children under the joint family system. This
legal measure, however, was not then passed by the Council.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recollection of an incident in the family life of Brahman society, which
happened even before my perusal of the <i>Ordeel of Richard Feverel</i>, and
which stands in strange contrast with the father’s conduct in the novel has led
me to this musing. A gentleman in Government service had a girl ward of about
fourteen years. Her father was employed as a petty Accountant in a merchant’s
business. The parents of the girl were poor, and the gentleman brought her up
in his home as he had no child for several years in his married life. He learnt
that a bright young man under twenty years of age had secured a gazetted job by
a competitive examination. He had, however, no previous knowledge of the youth,
who had just completed his education far away from the home of his father, a
school-master. The youth’s father, a couple of years previously, </span><span

his wish that he would select a bride for the young man, but the latter would
not let his father do so. The youth definitely told the parent to mind his
business as he (the father) could not know what qualities or attainments he
expected in his wife. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was not the case of ‘Protestant versus Catholic’ as in Meredith’s story, on the

when the marriage had been fixed to be celebrated, the father of the girl came
to know, only on the eve of the marriage, of the difference of the sub-sect,
and he would not give away his daughter to the youth. This development caused a
lot of distress not only to the father and to the son, but a strained relation
between them. The young man, in spite of his billet, had not even the knowledge
of the law of the land, for it was only the girl’s father, who could give her
away in marriage when she had not attained the legal age of eighteen. The son
decried to his father the prevailing social customs, which stood in the way of
his happiness, and asked if he was an enemy of society. He threatened to
embrace Brahmoism </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

independently, saying he would wait until the lady came of age. No feeling was
there in the son for all the sacrifices which the father had made for his
education. The father sorely wept that it was not for his son’s conversion to
Christianity that he had brought him up. For all the world he would not allow
the ties of blood and religion to be broken off. In the interests of his son’s
happiness and even incurring social odium, for<i> </i>the father of the
bridegroom had always an upper hand in the matter of marriage, the father went
down on his knees, and with tears in his eyes, interviewed a Judge of the High
Court of Madras, a distant relative of the girl, to interfere on behalf of his
son, and to bring round the girl’s father to the view that there was no
illegality in the proposed alliance between different sub-sects of Brahmins.
The marriage eventually took place some time later. What a contrast –this Hindu
fathers self-effacing attitude towards the son’s happiness, as compared with
that of Sir Austin, who exploiting the filial love, kept the son away from his
wedded wife, let him loose in society and exposed him to temptation, which
resulted in the son’s eventual unfaithfulness to the idyllic love and the
marriage tie!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lancashire, Manchester is a good place and the people fairly, sympathetic and
understanding. But one cannot generalise – any more than one can call Indians
good, simple or kind. And times have changed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

only the pretty faces in Britain but also the legs and the different shapes
that they are. One does not notice legs here because they are covered–often for
very good reasons–but then do legs matter so much? And as for faces, aren’t
there some very pretty ones here? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are, thanks to God’s creation, beauties the world over, and one wonders what

inefficiently, but his life would be short, because there would be nothing to
inspire him. For, at the bottom of all great art is a woman….. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a woman was Helen. She was more than twenty-one, and had the looks that might
have burnt a modern Troy, but there was about her a haughty disdain, and by her
side a dog, that looked as haughty as herself. Those who saw them felt they
were made for each other; others thought it was a fashionable idea of hers to
attract people’s attention. Anyone who saw her and the dog would reject the
second idea immediately, for neither the dog nor her mistress seemed conscious
of anyone but themselves. They were not absorbed, as children are, with
themselves and their playthings, but were sufficiently conscious of their
surroundings, including the roads and the people. The thought that therefore
struck anyone on seeing the two together was: “How they understand each other!”</span><span

the face of it, it looks absurd. But would you blame Hilaire Belloc for giving
a pen-picture, in one of his essays, of the poet and the dog that were so much
together that the poet acquired the qualities of the dog and the dog in turn
acquired his, and sighed at the sun and the moon and the stars! There is
another story of a dog and a man. But then there are so many, and friendship
between humans and animals is not a rare thing. The Arabs love their horses
more than they love their women; and there are certain places where hospitality
is so great that even one’s wife is not so much of a treasure as a quest. It all
depends on people and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

could see that Helen had changed her environment and had come to another which
knew her not. If ever you were close to her and her dog you’d realise that if
you attracted the dog’s attention, she would be upset, and if ever you tried to
ask Helen anything, the dog would look on you as to say: “Hands off! I’m in
charge of Helen, my beauty, my queen!” And you would feel by the look on the
dog’s face that Helen was safe from any harm once Ceasar was with her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

enough, a month after I returned from London I got a flat that was not only
cheap but made me feel poor. But I could not help this any more than I can my
extravagance. I had spent a good deal of my money and I was left with precious
little. So I took a job that would keep body and soul together and managed to
get a flat which others would not want. But since it was a temporary measure I
did not mind it. I would soon be getting some money from home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it was fun living there. There were all nationalities there–Poles and Irish and
Jews, Negroes, Indians and Chinese and there was quite a babel of tongues once
these nationalities got together. The Poles, by the way, came to England as
refugees and have now flats of their own and being poor and good Catholics they
see in Asians people who make good friends but are not always good paymasters.
The Irish herd together as the Chinese, Indians and Negroes do, and all work as
hard as they can and on Fridays all are so merry and wish the English people
the very best. On other days however they are all curses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

were living on the first floor. The door of her room was open and I espied the

a woman whose husband had left her the moment he had </span><span

her. She had no occupation and was on doles. Not </span><span style='font-size:

or talked to her. The dog acquired overnight a frightful personality. It was
said to have a possessive nature and that Helen could not resist it. Some went
so far as to think that Caesar was the one who once<i> </i>loved her. People
saw in them </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

wondered what the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>country was coming to if humans took recourse to
loving animals abnormally! So whenever an occasion arose the dog was shouted at
by irresponsible people and the woman given ugly looks and even abused...but
neither cared! And why should they care when there was nothing wrong in their
relationship? The look on the woman’s face, besides, showed that she knew
better and the dog </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>watching her reciprocated the feeling. He
too had good, canine </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sense! I did want to see the mistress as
much as the dog, for I had always seen them together and saw in them
personalities that were unique: the woman had as much personality as the dog,
and yet they had so merged their personalities as to feel an indivisible one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Christmas, and a happy occasion to meet anyone. So to Helen I went. I took
her a box of chocolates. I did feel for her. Maybe, she was an orphan and had
none here to go to. Maybe, she was so weary with life that she dragged. Maybe,
I’d invite her to my place and get her to eat a wholesome meal when I had
ordered for two. Being away from home does make one feel homesick. Talk with
her would have pleased me as I was not feeling too good what with the intense
cold and the fog and the mist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

tapped the door once, then again, and I heard a voice say, “ Coming!” There was
no dog, I was sure, or it would have barked. She opened the door and looked
rather surprised. “I thought I’d come and give you this box!” I said. “Happy C</span><span

ignored my salutation, took the box of chocolates and closed the door. “That’s
a pretty picture!” I thought and felt mad with myself for going to her. Maybe,
she had misunderstood me. But I should not have been such a sentimental
fool...but then we Indians, like the Irish and the Italians, were a darned
sentimental lot. But why ever did she take the chocolates? She could have been
pleasant. That look in her eyes froze me. There was the look of death in them.
There was no light in them, I knew and, for all I could imagine, she might have
been sleep-walking! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

went to my room and shut it. I fell for the meal. It was good. I drank some
wine. It made me feel good and happy with myself. Then I began to weep as
though I were a child. I had spent so many Christmases away from home and
though I was invited by friends to spend the Christmas week with them I yet
felt nostalgic about home. For Christmas was essentially a home-festival! But
there it was. I had come to Britain which was almost seven thousand miles away
from India, my birth-place and the country where I had spent some of the finest
Christmases, and then it all changed! I switched on the wireless and got
absorbed in the singing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
I heard a tap at the door. There was Helen and the dog with a ‘May-I-come-in?’
look on their faces. “Won’t you two come in?” I asked. Helen smiled and I loved
to see her smile. She looked human and lovable. She sat on a chair farthest to
me while her dog curled near her feet. “Good companion!” I ventured. “He’s been
with me since Donald left me...and that’s seven years ago.” “But you can’t be
that old,” I said, looking rather surprised. “Yes, seven years ago when I was
fifteen.” She wanted to tell me more but she broke down. She looked haggard and
the dog caught up with her looks and gave out a moan that made a cold shiver go
down my spine. “He too came with a chocolate box on Christmas morning and said
a ‘Happy Christmas and left me...I had his child and told him that, but he
wanted to hear nothing from me. I gave the child to someone who’d look after
him and I left the place with the dog he had given me. He wanted to take the
dog away but I pushed him out. He went mad because he also loved the dog. He
pulled me out and sent me flying down the stairs. He took the dog away but it
came back to me. I was in pains...but I had the dog and I loved it. At first I
hated it because it brought me memories of Donald. He was an artist and called
me his inspiration. Then he met another woman who had probably better legs and
a figure than mine. But then age heals sorrows and the dog became a part of
me.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Donald had kicked Helen on Christmas day after he had brought her the box of
chocolates! How strange men are–and how fickle! One moment they are all
adoration towards a woman and next moment they topple her down and go for
another! And what a day of the year to choose for parting! But then one could
not say much of those who happened to be good artists but no good men! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

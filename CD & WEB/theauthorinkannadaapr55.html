wonder whether I can claim to be an author by profession. I must admit there is
but little I can advance in support of such a claim. I prefer to regard myself as
a humble interpreter of authors, a harmless parasite on the Sons of the Muses.
This would be a position of vantage in the present context since–self-analysis
being a difficult job–the stamp of authorship is best understood by one who
does not belong to that category. But I am uncomfortably conscious that I shall
have to plead guilty to the charge of having perpetrated one or two things in
print. I wonder whether the organisers of this series of talks were having a
sly dig at me when they asked me to speak on the author. I mean to say–they
might be hinting that to me writing is that unsavoury thing, a profession, a
mercenary pursuit something undertaken for what is commonly referred to as
filthy lucre. If any such hint is implied, I suppose I have pocketed it since I
have consented to talk on the subject.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
mention this at the outset because it brings me to what was for long supposed
to be the main ingredient in the character of the author–an indifference to
money. I do not know, however, that the author is particularly anxious to be
saved from the temptations that filthy lucre brings with it. If I may lay claim
to a place in that august company and answer for myself, I admit frankly that I
am going to pocket the cheque given in return for this script; and I firmly
believe that other authors would do like wise. I have it on reliable authority
that Shakespeare was by no means indifferent to box-office receipts and that he
cherished an ambition for a coat of arms–a most deplorable ambition as all true
democrats would admit. I have observed that those who insist that the true
author should on no account barter the divine fire of inspiration for money,
are not themselves writers. The world in general waits for the author to bid
farewell to this world and then hastens to strew flowers over his grave; it is
not prodigal of its bouquets when he is alive. We are told that fifty cities
contend for Homer dead, through the streets of which the poet begged his bread.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Be
this as it may, indigence is certainly one of the stamps left on the author and
that is why one objects to calling authorship a profession. It is true Bernard
Shaw left an estate; but men like him are the exceptions which prove the rule.
Indigence is common to authors, and artists in other fields also. We cannot
very well object to their trying to make a virtue of it. Probably it was this
desire to take credit for what was really an unpleasant necessity that made
painters and musicians shave once a fortnight or grow a beard, live in rooms
innocent of the broom, and save on laundry bills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
suppose I am expected to speak of the authors I know,–the authors of the
Karnatak. Elsewhere we have two types of author–those who convey useful
knowledge and those who indulge in writing which they are fond of describing as
creative–poets, play-wrights, novelists and the like. We in the Karnatak do not
very much believe in the literature of knowledge, and our writers, having their
hand on the pulse of public taste, do not produce any; they plunge straight
into creative literature. These men who have taken it on themselves to people
the literary solitudes have not all the same stamp. They are drawn from two
classes. First there are the people who have had University education and are
in the services. To them authorship is no wife but a casual mistress; but as
generally happens the casual mistress is more passionately loved than the wife.
They conform to the orthodox code in their dress and manners. They wear the
regulation short coat, often with collar and tie, look scrupulously neat and
respectable. They never speak to anybody even in the railway compartment unless
formally introduced; are not seen in eating-houses. In brief they carry their
noses well above sea-level. Their dress may be the result of their education
rather than of their pursuit of literature. But the altitude of their noses is
undoubtedly in proportion to the number of books they have written. You get the
impression that they carry an immense Atlantean burden on their shoulders. They
are oppressively conscious of a mission in life and they carry it with them
wherever they go. That mission is the service of the mother tongue. They band
themselves together into associations devoted to the great cause–the cause of
Mother Kannada. She is very much the mother and they are very much the sons.
The education they have received is not education, but the breast-milk of the
mother. Their friends are not friends, but brothers and sisters of the
Karnatak. They themselves are not writers, but just humble servants of the great
mother. The articles or books they write are not articles or books, but humble
way-side flowers reverently placed at the feet of the Mother, or by a variation
of metaphor, the baby-talk which they babble at the mother’s knee. When you
hear such talk from a man, it is a safe bet that he is an author. This class
became vocal about thirty years ago and has been going strong ever since. About
the twenties they suddenly became sensitive to the glory of spring in the
Kannada Land, to the music of the song-birds of Karnatak; they opened their
eyes to the beauty of nature and went into raptures over the great sculptures
in Belur and Halebid. I do not think they let any sunset go without putting it
into metrical language. You can see them all over the land. They sit before the
mighty image of Gomateswara, for hours together, watching how the shadow
travels from west to east as the sun travels from east to west; and this
journey of the shadow is a never-ending marvel. They sit on the mountain-peak
listening to the sigh of the breeze; they sit on the palm-shaded sea-sands and
go into a trance induced by the Kannada waves beating on the</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Kannada shore; or rather, the slave-girl sea washing the feet of the great
mother. They stand on the platform giving an eager audience the benefit of
their observations. They are to be found</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

characters whose sole delight is the singing of Kannada songs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Along
with this great awakening; this sensitiveness to things in general, they
develop also a streak of psychology. On principle and in the interests of what
has almost, though not quite, become their profession, they are observers of
men and analysers of their motives. The prying suspicious creatures are always
looking at you with penetrating eyes. If looks could speak they would tell you
that it is no use your trying to hide your thoughts. The author is first and
foremost Mr. Nosey Parker interested more in men’s inner thoughts than in the
outward shows of life. What is it the critics say of Shakespeare’s tragedies?–That
it is more a record of an inward battle than of a battle of outward forces. Of
course every author has taken this lesson to heart and is duly psychological in
his attitude to life. He is on the look-out for deeper influences and motives,
and hidden meanings. This is not </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>suspicious prying. The
term for it is insight. That is what critics obligingly credit authors with, or
carpingly deny them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
characteristics are so universal among authors that at the social gatherings at
which these mighty men of letters are honoured guests, it does not take you a
minute to mark them out </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as authors. You do not even need the
assistance of the lionization they are subjected to. They have a throng of
younger aspirants in authorship in their train, who have read the author’s
works and quote snatches from them. The author of course says that those works
were his juvenilia and that he has now outgrown them, thus killing two birds
with one stone. He gets credit for modesty and also for a steadily developing
genius.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may occasionally see also a giggling girl, obviously at college, begging the
author not to put that evening’s party into his next work. I don’t think she
really dreads it so much; she is devoutly hoping that the author will interpret
her request in the proper light, and that she <i>will </i>figure in the next.
work The author smiles cryptically–it is difficult to say what that smile
means, and therein lies its charm. It may say, “Oh no, I wouldn’t dream of
doing such a thing,” or “Ah, well, I am laying the whole world under
contribution and you, my dear young lady, cannot hope to escape.” This latter
is the more correct interpretation; for the suspicion that the author looks
upon the rest of the world as ‘copy’ is, I am sure, not misplaced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is another kind of author different from, and even actively opposed to, the
University type. Indeed he holds the University man in contempt. This latter,
we now learn, is a despicable creature, a prig who prides himself on his
academic training and on his reading of other literatures. In the eyes of the
artist in letters–that is what this second type thinks of itself–the University
man is not an artist at all. The artist-author type pronounces Art with a
capital A–you can feel the capital even when the word is spoken; and the <i>r </i>in
that word Art is artistically slurred. The University man poor fool, thinks
that a knowledge of grammar and a reading of orthodox conventional criticism
equips him for creative work. The artist knows that these are really fatal to
genius–‘as killing as canker to the rose’ is the phrase that occurs to one’s
mind; these influences can only result in a hide-bound puritanical view of art.
Listen to these University men talking of the appropriate theme or the
appropriate word in a particular context! As if taboos can for a moment be
accepted in the world of art. Why, these people are afraid of the facts of
life! You can kill them with the bare mention of a kiss! We are believers in
the unfettered freedom of the artist, and we recognise no bounds which the
critic would set–neither in literature nor in life. This section among authors,
realising as it does the close affinity between authors and artists in general,
adopt those external characteristics of the artist which I have already men</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tioned,
the stubbly beard, the long hair, and the mincing gait. But I wouldn’t now
claim them as part of the stamp of the author. They have fallen into disfavour
of late. Too many non-authors stole this thunder. So now it survives not so
much among authors as among those who ply the brush or the chisel. But the
cigarette still remains a necessity, though I think that with some a powdered
Lady Nicotine finds more favour. The long hair is still visible; among us the
long white <i>jubba </i>with the pockets along the sides corresponds to the
poetical singing robes of the West.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the <i>jubba </i>and the cigarette are after all mere externals. The strong
point of the artist-author is something else. He calls it soul. The University
man also is keen on it; but he foolishly imagines, brought up as he is on
reactionary authors like Wordsworth, that he can get it from Nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The artist-author believes in this thing but his
ideology does not permit of his calling it soul. Whatever the name to be given
to it, he does not believe that Nature helps its growth. Against the fading
charms of the green grass and the purling stream may stand the vision of a
dream girl. But even the love of women is a personal affair, great though it
is. These are days when we think in terms of society. I have a notion that the
artist-author has slightly reddish eyes. The colour of course denotes what is
normally called soul–it doesn’t exist of course, but let us use the term–a soul
burning with indignation at the thought of the enemies of society who snatch
from the bleeding lips of the starving millions their meagre allowance of
bread. The artist-author holds that true creative art ought to treat of these
themes–of the enemies of society, of the rivers of blood they shed, of the
hunger of the millions and all the rest of it. All this along with a modicum of
hope; optimism you can see in the longing wistful eyes of the artist-author
which look into the future, the not very distant future, and see a land where
the capitalist and tire bourgeois cease from troubling–a land flowing with milk
and honey meant exclusively for the workers of the world.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

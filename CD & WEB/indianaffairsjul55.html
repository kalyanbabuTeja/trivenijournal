style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India
is busy now with a pre-natal examination of the second Five Year Plan. The
first has succeeded, in spite of some of its shortcomings. It has succeeded in
the sense that it has achieved some of our targets, though even then it was
pointed out that our targets were low compared with our requirements and
possibilities of achievement. But let us not forget that it was after all an
essay and an experiment in planning. We were then in a very unenviable position.
We succeeded to an economy that was shattered by war, the departing British,
and lastly by the partition of the country. We had no facts, not much of
resources, and almost none at all of knowledge of planning and experience of
administration. We had, in short, nothing but our enthusiasm of the newly-won
freedom and a sheer determination to pull through. The capitalisation of our
national will has not gone in vain and the ship of our national economy is now
definitely on an even keel, as testified by many experts, Indian and foreign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Compared
with the first Plan, we start with certain advantages for the second. We have
facts and figures, some experience in planning, and, thanks to our foreign
policy of dynamic neutrality, the technically advanced countries are more ready
to help us now, irrespective of their political complexion. Above all, we have
the success of the earlier Plan to give the necessary incentive for the part
the people have to play in the second. But, at the same time we have also a disadvantage
compared with the first. The Plan lacked a ‘philosophy’–blessed are the
countries and individuals without philosophy–while the second has. The first
was leap in the dark. We only aimed at greater production in agriculture and
industry, and we had nothing else behind it–and we have admirably achieved our
objectives. But now we have philosophy for the Plan, and this has let loose a
big controversy. We want to bring about a socialistic pattern of society; and,
except in some minor quarters, this has been broadly accepted as the common
goal. But differences crop up when we come to its meaning and the best way to
achieve it; and, though we have not yet realised it, these differences are
fundamental, and are bound to have some serious consequences for the future.
In, the previous article we tried to understand the meaning of the socialist
pattern. To the author of the idea, Pandit Nehru, it is not a new policy, but
only a restatement of the old; and also there is no difference between
‘socialistic pattern’ and ‘socialist pattern’. But others are not understanding
it to be so simple. The concept is best under</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>stood by
stating what it does not<i> </i>mean. It is not the same as Communism or its
methods; it is not the same as Capitalism, not even of the latest American
brand; and it is neither merely the old ‘mixed economy’ nor the higher and more
noble Sarvodaya. It is ‘socialistic’ in its pattern. Put in concrete terms, as
far as the second Plan is concerned, it means: (1) the raising of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>national
income by 25 per cent; (2) providing jobs for at least 10 to 12 million people
more; and (3) redressing inequalities of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>income so that the
highest will not be more than 30 times the average income of an Indian: But the
question is: what is the way to reach the targets? And it is here we meet with
serious differences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were asked to co-operate with it. Now it is going to be more a People’s Plan,

formulate schemes which will<i> </i>be integrated in the general framework.
Secondly, experts have been brought together to prepare and discuss the Plan,
and we have therefore three important documents before us dealing<i> </i>with
the Draft: the statistical framework of the Plan prepared by the Statistical
Adviser to the Government, Prof. Mahalanobis; the joint<i> </i>explanatory Note
drawn up by the Economic Division of the Finance </span><span style='font-size:

of Dissent by Prof. Shenoy. The second and the third are based on the first.

is followed by a number of statistics and details of planning based on this
statistical framework. This Draft of the Plan has received both bouquets and
brickbats in the matter of both the objectives and the manner of achieving
them. While the Panel of economic experts have approved of it in general (the
Memorandum of the Economic Division being only a sort of an </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>explanatory
Note), there is a lot of criticism in some other important quarters, some even
going to the extent of saying that </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the whole scheme is
totalitarian in conception, smacking of even Communism. The ‘Eastern

of Experts, for, it seems, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

that is true, it is really a matter for regret, for, after all, the Planning
Commission must have expected from the experts a genuinely considered opinion,

out the vague charge that it is Communist-inspired and totalitarian in
concept–both the charges were recently refuted by the Finance Minister, and we
can depend upon our Prime Minister to safeguard democracy–the other charges are
that medium industries are neglected and that the objective of expanding the
public sector was too ‘Socialist’. Critics are alarmed that Prof. Mahalanobis
uses ‘Socialist pattern’ but not ‘Socialistic’ as in the, Avadi Congress
resolution. But it is forgotten that it is the National Congress that has taken
this lead and not the Professor. The Avadi Congress gave the country the
socialistic pattern as the goal, and the Berhampore session emphasised on
employment through “an adequate, balanced and planned programme of development”
and pleaded that “the most important aspects of the second Plan should be the
establishment of heavy and capital goods industries and a great development of
small-scale and village industries which have to play a role of crucial
importance, both in relation to providing fuller employment and for the purpose
of ensuring an adequate supply of consumer goods.” The burden of the song of
the critics is that the physical planning, as opposed to planning in terms of
money and finance, is a technique largely favoured by Communist countries and
that planning based on statistics ignores the human aspect of economics. On the
latter, here is what a professor says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by virtue of their subject itself, tend to think of human beings in terms of
tidy little patterns of behaviour that can be fitted into equations and graphs.
There is also danger from their tendency to see uniformity where it does not
exist, as they are usually willing to enforce it if mere human beings do not
conform to their preconceive a notions.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

should not reject a plan merely on the ground that it is prepared by
econometricians, or by experts from the leftist countries. Look, for instance,
at the alarmist concern of Sri Jaya Prakash Narain expressed over “this highly
centralised totalitarian kind of planning, which Prime Minister Nehru is
getting done by the experts of Communist countries in the name of a socialistic
pattern of society”, or at the conclusion drawn by Mr. Chinoi, the President of
the I.M.C., that “the physical approach must logically lead to a vast
authoritarian and bureaucratic control of the social, political and economic
structure of the country, destroying ultimately the very principles of
democratic and popular </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

physical planning, as understood by the statistician and his group of experts,
there is little doubt that there is implied a replacement of the democratic
foundations of economic planning by a system or direction of resources which is
so familiar to those who have studied the economies of the Communist countries.
Destruction of liberty is inherent in this technique of planning.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from the questions whether experts from leftist countries should advise us or
not, and whether it was a technique exclusively used in Communist countries, we
must consider if physical planning will necessarily lead our country to
totalitarianism, killing all human liberties. I have been myself an advocate of
this planning in ‘realistic terms’–which is now called ‘physical planning’–for
the last ten years. It takes our existing resources into account, and plans for
prosperity based on the maximum use of these resources, instead of using a
technique–a false and illusory one–which measures the progress and economic
condition of a country in terms of bank rate, adverse balance of trade rates of
exchange, movement of funds etc:, suitable to a highly ‘monetised’ country like
England. We have resources and we want to build our economy, but we do not have
the requisite machinery and tools. These we have to import from abroad with our
limited exchange resources. If we use this foreign exchange for purchasing the
capital goods needed to produce consumer goods, we will be always doing it.
Therefore let us conserve our exchange for developing basic and heavy
industries, so that we could in a short time produce capital goods; and
meanwhile let us develop our cottage industries to satisfy our consumer needs,
and also make the maximum or optimum use of the available mills for the same
purpose, avoiding at the same time conflict and competition between cottage and
mill goods. Incidentally we will be achieving our other objectives of expanding
the public sector, creating more jobs, and reducing inequalities of
income,–thus furthering our socialistic pattern of society. This, in a
nutshell, is the meaning of this Plan, and one wonders how this necessarily
leads to authoritarianism, killing all liberty. All planning involves some
control and some direction of consumer behaviour, and to this extent we have government
control of production, consumption, and foreign trade even today. To see more
possibilities of authoritarian control of life in this Plan, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>leading
to totalitarianism, is to ignore the realities of the situation in India, the
country of Gandhi and non-violence, of a free Constitution and the force of
leadership of Nehru.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is no use giving the Plan a bad name and cursing it. Let us be realistic in our
outlook. As C.D. Deshmukh pointed out the other day, let us bear in mind that
the country has decided on the socialistic pattern of society and is determined
to go ahead. We have abolished the Zamindaris, we have increased the rates of
income-tax for higher incomes, almost abolished the managing agency system, and
nationalised the Imperial Bank. Let us not forget that all this we have
achieved </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

inequalities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

point also should be remembered. The new Plan has not altogether discarded
‘financial planning’. All that it does is to lay more stress on the need for
basing our planning on the physical resources instead of merely on the
financial aspect, as we did with the first Plan. Some of the problems raised by
our experience of the first Plan have not been solved satisfactorily and,
unless they are tackled, the results of the second may not be exactly those we
aim at.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

us here examine some of the constitutional implications of planning. As yet the
people on whose behalf we are planning for a socialistic pattern of society
have not democratically accepted the ideal,–the only way being acceptance at
the polls. But to any student of Indian affairs, it must be clear that if today
the issue is placed before the people through the ballot, it would be </span><span

a previous essay in this series, we raised the question of the exact status of
the Planning Commission and also asked whether it is a body of representatives
or a body of experts. It is no doubt a body doing excellent work, and we should
have nothing but admiration for it; but what exactly is its position that it
should take decisions on momentous issues, and pass orders of an executive
nature, when the Constitution expects the Council of Mnisters to do it? Taking
them as a body of experts–because not all of them are elected representatives
of the people–to advise the Cabinet who will advise the President, we see that
the Planning Commission itself is seeking the aid of some other experts to
advise them, and yet another set of experts to scrutinize the Plan, and so on,
until a final blueprint is made by the experts. Thus we find clear traces of a
trend towards a system of government by experts and commissions. But there is
nothing wrong with it, as long as the final decision rests with Parliament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

question raised in connection with planning is the tendency towards
centralisation. Should the Centre have the power, or should it not, to see
whether all the money the Centre is granting to the States in connection with
the Plan is being properly spent by the States, as in the case of the money
which it is giving to Central Boards like the Welfare Board, the Khadi Board,
and the Indian Statistical Institute? Should not Parliament have a greater
power of scrutiny into the working of the various State Corporations? Those who
think that the Centre is having too much power over the States will have to
recall that recently the Punjab Government refused to allow the Centre to look
into the accounts of the Bakhra-Nangal Project, and that the Madras Government
politely told the Centre that it has no power to compel it to constitute an
Electricity Board for the State. Some say that the Constitution should, if
necessary, be amended so as to allow the Centre more power, while many
constitutional pandits were maintaining from the beginning that ours is a more
centralised federation than any in the world. To me the problem seems to be not
whether the Centre should have more power or the States, but that there should
be a definite line of demarcation and fixity of responsibility. This point
requires careful consideration at the hands of the powers that be. The question
of institutions like the Boards and Corporations is different and involves a
more immediate constitutional question: Can Parliament make block grants, and
is not the Auditor-General failing in his constitutional duty if he does not
audit <i>all </i>government money?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this connection we are brought to another point that has been raised
recently,–whether the public sector in which wee repose great confidence is
after all so much more efficient than the private sector that we should
categorically make it one of our objectives, as Mahalanobis does, to expand the
public sector? But there is no easy way of comparing the two sectors. It is
possible to argue that both the private and public sectors are equally good or
equally bad. Look at the vagaries of the sugar industry in recent years in the
private sector, and at the working of the nationalised industries in England or
in India, especially in West Bengal (10 important State-run schemes of West
Bengal resulted in an estimated loss of Rs. 20 lakhs during 1954-55); and look
at the success of the Tatas in the private sector and of Sindri in the public
sector. But the question involved in nationalisation is not merely one of
greater efficiency. There are other important ones, including that of equitable
distribution. Even then, the public sector does not get away with all the
praise. While it is pointed out that in America, under neo-capitalism the
workers are owning more and more share capital and thus earning more and more
profits, in England the Conservative Party’s ‘Campaign Guide’ for 1955 made the
startling revelation that of all the income of the private sector during
1952-54, wages and salaries took 76 per cent, and personal incomes from rent,
dividends, interest, and self-employment took only 24 per cent. Do the nationalised
industries result in better distribution? Instead of answering it
categorically, let me make some suggestions for a more thorough examination.
Take the nationalised industries that run a loss. Who is ultimately paying
whom? At the most it means that after investing some crores, the citizen is
paying more for the commodity as a consumer, and paying something more to the
labourer as a tax-payer, as ultimately the wage-bill decides the cost of
production. Take the Railways that are running successfully in India, which pay
an annual contribution to the general revenues. But even here, are the Railways
paying as much as the Government would have got, had the Government lent Rs.
800 crores–the amount we have invested in Railways roughly–to private Railway concerns
<i>plus </i>the income-tax and super-taxes to the Centre, and the sales-tax and
other local taxes to the Units? Recent experience has proved that we have
reached the peak of our traffic and the Railways are getting monopoly revenues.
How could the private investor have managed under these conditions and yet paid
the taxes? Obviously, by reducing the wage-bill, and any impartial tribunal
would have agreed to it. This means that in India the consumer and the
tax-payer is paying more than he would have paid had the industries in India
been in the private sector, and that today under nationalisation the labourer
is getting more than his due–either compared with his efficiency or with what
others are getting. This is a line of thinking that requires a more careful
study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

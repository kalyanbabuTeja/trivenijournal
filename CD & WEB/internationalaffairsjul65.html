<span class=SpellE>Tse-tung</span> once said that world capitalism rests on a
single pillar: <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It is true that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is the principal obstacle to the expansion of the communist system in both West
and East. Since <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
compelled <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> to withdraw
her nuclear weapons from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in November, 1962, it has been commonly thought that their conflict, the cold
war, has come to an end. In consequence <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s European allies, who
supported her when they feared Russian expansion in the West, have felt free to
act in such a way as to weaken the alliance. They have tended to ignore the
conflict in the East, where the principal communist power, <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, has
certainly not allowed the cold war to languish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

might have been expected that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
would receive general support in her conduct of the cold war. This was not so
even, when the main theatre of the struggle was in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>:
the European public and governments always allowed themselves much liberty of
criticism, while many governments elsewhere proclaimed themselves non-aligned.
Now that <span class=GramE>the</span> <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of the
struggle is in Asia, Europe has almost become non-aligned, and perhaps in
imitation, much of <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> persists in the same
attitude. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is thus placed in the embarrassing position of saving people from a danger
which they pretend docs not exist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Tse-tung</span> has also claimed that his revolutionary
method, guerilla warfare supplemented by political <span class=SpellE>wirepulling</span>,
is capable of defeating <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>,
and his claim is being tried out for the first time in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
war in that country is therefore of key importance. During the period under
review it has grown more intense, and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> has sent many thousands of
troops and officially allowed them to take part in the fighting. But the
American President has also been greatly concerned to ward off the other prong
of Mao’s attack, political <span class=SpellE>wirepulling</span>, and has acted
on several occasions to meet criticism at home and abroad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

response to an appeal by 17 non-aligned countries, on the 8th of April he
suspended bombing for a day and offered to enter into negotiations without
stipulating that the fighting must cease his only reservation was that he would
not <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> the Vietcong as a participant. He also
offered to help finance a plan for<i> </i>regional construction, which he
suggested should cost a billion dollars. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region> rejected the offer, and insisted
that all American forces must withdraw from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Two weeks later, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region> proposed a settlement on the basis
of the withdrawal of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
and the acceptance by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> of the programme of the Liberation
Front, of which the Vietcong is the armed section. Again in the middle of May,
when the Indian Prime Minister was in <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>,
Johnson suspended bombing for five days, apparently in the hope that <st1:country-region

 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> to give a <span

decided upon at the Commonwealth Conference on June the 17th, to send a
delegation of the heads of five Commonwealth countries to intercede with the
belligerents, but <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> rejected the plan. At
the same time <st1:country-region w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region>
refused to discuss the matter with a British <span class=SpellE>Labour</span>

and the country is known to be suffering severely from the bombing campaign,
which began in February. Serious unrest, culminating in local rebellions, has
been reported. The morale of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

operating in the South is said to have shown some decline, and its offensive

Johnson probably did not expect his offer of negotiations and aid to be
accepted immediately. They were intended mainly to answer the criticisms of his
policy advanced in other countries, and by a growing body of opinion at home. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
officially supported it, but was known to have reservations. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">France</st1:country-region> openly condemned it, as did <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region> however, sent small
contingents of troops to fight beside the American forces. Some of the <span
class=SpellE>crities</span> pointed out that the Vietcong controlled half of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and inferred that the public supported them. The evidence, however, is that
most people in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are opposed to the Vietcong, who have established their control mainly by
terror. Other critics argue that <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region>
is within the natural if sphere of influence of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and cannot in the long run be
defended against her by a power exerted from many thousand miles away. But this
ignores the possibility of a balance of power in Asia: <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and the smaller Asian countries could hope to contain <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and her
communist and near-communist allies. Admittedly for <span class=GramE>the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>present</span> <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
shows no interest in preventing <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s
expansion in <st1:place w:st="on">South East Asia</st1:place>, and accordingly
appears to have no inclination to form such an alliance. Moreover, even if such
an alliance were formed, <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
is for the present <span class=SpellE>neutralised</span> by <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
thus could not exert the necessary influence. A balance of power in Asia could
be maintained only if <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
were to change her attitude to <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
and achieve <span class=GramE>a reconciliation</span> with <st1:country-region

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Towards
the end of April a part of the army of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Dominican Republic</st1:place></st1:country-region> revolted and
overthrew the President, Cabral. He had been in power only 18 months, after
deposing President Bosch shortly after his election in 1963. The new rebellion
was intended to restore Bosch to power, but the army was divided and fighting
continued, so he did not return from exile. The main part of the country is
controlled by the Government of National Reconstruction headed by General <span
class=SpellE>Imbert</span>, but a large part of the capital, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Santo Domingo</st1:place></st1:City>, is held by the Government of

the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
intervened by sending troops. At first it was announced that the purpose was to
save American lives; then it was declared that the rebels included a number of
communists, who might be able to gain power for themselves should the rebellion
succeed. Within a short time there were over 20,000 American troops in the island.
Evidently the American authorities had in mind the way in a small group of
communists had gained power by infiltrating the democratic revolution in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Bosch and
<span class=SpellE>Caamano</span> are admittedly not communists, but the
suggestion that the communists might gain power under their aegis appears
plausible. The country is far poorer than Cube. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
intervention caused much protest. <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
asked the <span class=SpellE>Organisation</span> of American States to send a
force which could take over from the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> forces and keep the
peace. The first O.A.S. units arrived on the 3rd of May, but two months later
the force was still too small for its purpose. The efforts neither of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> nor of the
O.A.S. have succeeded in reconciling the two factions, both of which remain in
the field and from time to time engage in hostilities. The slow procedure of
the O.A.S. supplies some justification for the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> action. The O.A.S. agrees that
another usurpation of power by a communist party such as happened in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> must be prevented, but if it had been
attempted in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dominica</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the cumbrous machinery of the O.A.S., acting alone, could hardly have
intervened in time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in April, and at the Kremlin dinner on the 4th cordial sentiments and

President of Pakistan had arranged to pay an official visit to <st1:country-region

end of April, and the Prime Minister of India was to pay a visit at the end of
May. On the 16th of April <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
asked both to postpone their visits to some time later in the year. The
official reason given was that the visits would be more useful after the
provisions for aid had been passed by the American legislature. Unofficially it
was said that President Johnson was too busy to give proper attention to the
visitors. Commentators guessed that what was intended was a rebuke to <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region> for her dealings with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <st1:country-region

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> no
comparable provocation, and the unilateral announcement of the postponement of
the Indian Prime Minister’s visit was considered diplomatic bad manners. The
Government of India expressed its displeasure, and declined the invitation to
the Prime Minister to visit <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>

President’s visit, and it is possible that this was one of the reasons for that
decision. America’s disapproval of her policy in this matter, and also in
relation to China, and a threat that aid might be reduced, may have influenced
Pakistan to agree, at the end of June, to the British Prime Minister’s proposal
of a cease-fire, for the agreement to cease hostilities at that point gave her
an advantage which must have appeared too slight to compensate for her
relatively big military operation. The attack in <span class=SpellE>Kutch</span>
was the culmination of a series of border incidents which in the previous few
months had become more frequent than ever before, while in May there were
persistent reports of large concentrations of troops in <st1:place w:st="on">East
 Pakistan</st1:place>. The observer receives the impression of an ambitious
military plan abandoned soon after the start for unexplained reasons–possibly <st1:country-region

to cooperate. It is too soon to say whether any permanent restraint has been

was in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the 12th to the 20th, and was treated with “informal cordiality.” However,
the joint <span class=SpellE>communique</span> which was published at the end
of his visit amounted to a statement of Russia’s policy on most topical
controversies, including even the partition of Germany, and of course the
Vietnam war, but gave India no support in relation to Pakistan or China; nor
did it mention the Prime Minister’s project of a guarantee by the nuclear
powers to the non-nuclear powers. It was announced a few days later that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> would
not give such a guarantee. The reference to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

Prime Minister’s pique at President Johnson’s treatment of him; the rest of the

economic aid which was being negotiated at the same time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in June the Prime Minister went to Canada, where the political conversations
appear to have inclined the same way: the two parties agreed, in relation to
the Vietnam war, to act in parallel “as they might otherwise give the

Since <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>

would guarantee a communist government. However, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>,

threatened with a trial, and after several days’ delay a new Government was
announced, headed by the former <span class=SpellE>Defence</span> Minister,
Col. <span class=SpellE>Boumedienne</span>. The political character of the
change is still uncertain: it is expected to bring a less vigorous foreign
policy and perhaps a less “left” domestic policy. The event surprised the
world, but ought not to have done so. Since 1954, when Ben Bella first joined
it, the Algerian nationalist movement has been distinguished by its deadly
internal feuds. Even before taking power, his party assassinated many thousands
of their fellow countrymen whose nationalist politics differed slightly from
their own, and Ben Bella had overthrown, exiled and liquidated many of his
former colleagues. Such men usually suffer the fate to which they have
condemned others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

leadership at which China aimed could have any practical significance. Their
divisions would have deprived their expressed opinions even of propaganda value.
However, it seems to be agreed that the postponement of the conference was a

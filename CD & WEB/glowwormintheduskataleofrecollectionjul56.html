fire was hotting up. Starting with a single rifle shot it had spread quickly,
left and right, leap frogging parts of the line, returning to take them in,
like dry reeds burning in a parched up marsh. The impatient stutter of machine
guns joined in with the rattle of musketry. Whether it was the real thing or
just one of those things that happen at night one could not yet tell. It was
pitch black. And cold. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a large pit in the ground, over which stood a tent, a youngish looking man sat
reading. A hurricane lamp rested on the top of a wireless set, its pale yellow
light augmented by the greenish glow of the dial underneath. A camp stool
supported the main weight of the reader’s body, back pressed squarely </span><span

the wall behind, feet on some dimly descried object in front. A thin trickle of
music issued from the wireless set, beside </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

remains of a meal. It was the Mess dug-out. And the officer, for such he was,
was the Reserve Company Commander. It was his job to stand by in the Mess till
something turned up for him and his men to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

officer read on quite unperturbed. So far from distracting him that ring of
fire around the perimeter seemed to be giving him a comfortable feeling of
assurance. No harm in a spot of firing last thing at night. The racket had
started during dinner. The others had cleared off one by one; he had just
carried on with the meal and settled down to read when that was satisfactorily
finished. Rather well organised, the whole thing. It was not often that one had
any peace in a Brigade Camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that sounded like a girl come on at the radio. And, wait a minute, wasn’t she
reciting Hindi Verse? Yes, she was. Kavyadhara; the Stream of Poetry. So
tranquil and so mysterious. The rich mellow voice filled the dug-out. Outside,
the firing continued. A couple of guns opened up lazily from the middle of the
camp. Some No. I of an L. M. G. loosed off a whole magazine for good measure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the dug-out the officer lights a cigarette; but thoughtfully. This girl seemed
to be singing with a strange, remote abandon. The theme of the composition was
not romantic, nor was it a plain devotional piece. Indeed the whole thing
appeared to be highly philosophical. Then why all that feeling, and whence the </span><span

distant mortar chimed in to echo the query. The officer listened intently. It
was about a dream; a glorious, wondrous dream, which dwelt always and for ever
in the imagination of the poet. No ordinary dream, this; because, by witness of
poetic faith, it signposted the landscape of Birth and Rebirth, like a
glow-worm wandering in the dusk, like a trail blazed in the wilderness; dear,
precious dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

out of depth. Most likely he had got it all wrong. But the meaning of the lines
did not really matter; they were great poetry whatever they meant. Whether it
actually bewitched his slumbers or not, some vision of beauty, vain longing for
it if you like, had inspired the poet. It existed in his imagination. For him
it was something true. He believed in it. What mattered was that the girl at
the mike seemed to believe in her song, too, and so in the dream. So utterly
perfect was her singing, so effortless, so full of repose the clear deep stream
of her voice. Like a note held captive on the long drawn out quiver of a
violin, so did the ‘Swapan’<sup>l</sup> ride on the tremulous voyaging of her
lines. For the moment at least the invisible songstress had made the ‘Swapan’
her own and taken it to the very bosom of her ‘Kalpana’.<sup> 2</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

telephone buzzed out a throaty protest. Shutting off the radio Ashok Kumar

then, as if to confirm how little they knew, the train, which had been ambling
quite pleasantly along, stopped with a jerk, precipitating the stout gentleman
into the arms of the occupants of another and larger tin box, dislodging a
couple of bed-rolls, and generally shaking up everybody in the carriage. Vocal
propounding of high-grade philosophy ceased for the moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ashok wondered. Karma and Rebirth are facts for the Hindu mind, not theories to
be debated. Had <i>he </i>been to the ‘Sangam’ before? Would assurance of any
former visit be vouchsafed to him on the morrow? There was nothing inherently
impossible about this; now and again one heard or read of people who confessed
to visiting a place for the first time and instantly feeling that they had been
there before, in some cases even seeing in a flash the previous scene. Would
the ‘Sangam’ have a message for him?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was more than a pleasant thought to while away the weary, dragging hours with.
It gave content to his journey. It was not the urge of piety that was leading
Ashok to the Kumbh; nor did he have any strong faith in the meritorious nature
of the simple act of bathing that people performed there. He was going because
Prayag had for the moment become the rallying point of his race and he had been
infected by the prevailing fervour. It would be a great thing to keep the
rendezvous–whatever its aim, purpose, or outcome–and so link oneself up with
the long sweep of history that the Kumbhs marked out at twelve-year intervals.
All the same, being of a sensitive turn of mind, he could not rid himself of
the feeling that he was a bit of a fraud in going. Lacking essential faith,
what else could it be? He was going to a ‘Mela’.<sup>5</sup> And he, on the
threshold of middle age, an ‘Officer and a gentleman’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rich in fulfillment was the hour at the ‘Sangam’ that Ashok had not a thought
to spare for any former pilgrimage, by himself or his ancestors, accomplished
or left unachieved. Instead he looked down the long Saga of the Kumbhs ; the
Kumbhs of Harsha Vardhan which used to be Imperial affairs, Kumbhs during
periods of disorder and political change, when neither the hazards of travel
nor deterrents such as the tax on infidel pilgrimage prevented the strong in
faith from setting forth for Prayag. There, across the water, commanding the
confluence of the sacred rivers of the Hindus, rose the strong black lines of
Akbar’s Fort. Though in his reign (and doubtless in many others) there was no
‘Jazia’,<sup>6</sup> and however true the tactical sitting of it, the fort
symbolised an aspect of Muslim Rule that there could be no denying.
There-after, for two centuries the British flag had flown over those same
battlements, and over the congregations that foregathered at their foot. And
now, after the long vicissitudes of History, once again the multitudes had
flocked to the Kumbh without let or hindrance, without injury to national or
personal pride. By train, aeroplane, motor car, bullock cart and on foot the
people had come. From the highest to the lowest. History had come full </span><span

ruminating, Ashok returned to the boat in which he had come out. It was a large

over the side, giving children their dips, putting them back on boats, and so
on. Ashok dressed and sat looking around in drowsy, blissful contentment. He
was in no hurry to get away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ashok sat up, clutching at the vanishing, flying, string of words. He had heard
that voice before. Where was she? Perhaps in that knot of people in the water.
Perhaps in that boat over there. But there were so many knots of people in the
water and so many boat-loads of them. Quite close she was, though; if only he

boat filled up and they started pulling away. Desperately Ashok looked around,
straining every nerve. Just another word, an inflexion of tone would do...They
were leaving the ‘Sangam’ now. Going, going, gone. The boat Swung round and
headed for the great black mass of Akbar’s Fort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was now about 9 o’ clock. The space between the water’s edge and the high
embankment of the river was one avalanche of humanity. The thin trickle of
returning pilgrims somehow reached the foot of the bund and there got jammed.
Ashok was not quite awake enough to care why. The mental screen had gone blank
in the boat, washed clean by the waters of the ‘Sangam’, as it were. With body
imprisoned and thought benumbed he was conscious of one thing only: mounted men
swaying over that ocean of heads. Red-turbaned horsemen on spirited chargers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

afterwards, the soldier’s eye was to discern in the picture the superb training
and discipline of the Mounted Police. But at the time he just looked on with a
strange, terrible fascination. He seemed to know who they were; those tough,
proud-looking men on great sinewy horses, frothing at the mouth. There they
were, brandishing sticks, rearing their horses, wheeling, moving, halting,
making signals to each other. Who were they? The minutes passed. Man and beast
held him in thrall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pressure eased off a little-jam-packed bodies fell loose from each other’s
grip. The horsemen advanced through the crowd. One of them bore down on Ashok,
the great hoofs of his horse pounding the earth like a piston. Ashok watched
the flushed, perspiring face approach, glint of authority in the eyes. Pulling
up sharply he called out aloud! “No, not this way. Go round by the Fort.” The
powerful mount reared. For an instant the stick hung poised over Ashok’s head;
the eyes beneath the red turban boring into his own. Then it came, like a great
steel door screeching back on its rusty hinges and crashing shut again. He saw
who he was, who they all were. They were the King’s Men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and screech of steel, flowed the notes of music that had filled the dim-lit
dug-out, voyaging through the noise of battle, years ago. “The dream, the
dream, dear, precious dream. Like a glow-worm wandering in the dusk...like a
trail blazed in the wilderness...through Birth and Re-birth. The dream.” Like a
silver thread the dream, and its Song, wove through the ancient tumult, that
hour in the dug-out, and the ringing, radiant voice that had broken through a
thousand noises at the ‘Sangam’ that morning. “Friends and the journey-mates of
the centuries...”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

try to protect oneself from the red flames or the pungent smoke, but what could
Badi Bahu (the first daughter-in-law) do? Not that she did not want to avoid
getting scorched by the heat but is it not true that sometimes we like heat?
Well, the heat may not be liked, but the effort to avoid it may mean disturbing
others. Badi Bahu was not in a position to cast herself in the role of a
stumbling block and fulfil her instinct as she knew what it all would mean. She
would hear words of reproach and humiliation. It was on this account that
though the courtyard was hot she had continued to be there: she had come to

him by his hands. As a matter of fact the waves had folded the sari for him. He
had only squeezed it and stood before her. He had gripped the upper end and
waved it in the air to remove the shrinks, and while handing it over to Badi
Bahu he had suddenly burst into laughter. His white teeth had flashed moonlight
and the red wet lips of Badi Bahu had curved in a bashful smile. Heera had felt
immensely satisfied, and Badi Bahu experienced for the first time in her life
that she was not as despicable and small as she had taken herself to be, though
she had been reduced to nursing and serving the family. She was tickled by
reverberations of a gay and tender thought that she had subdued a slender,
attractive and innocent young man through some unknown power of hers even
though her life was apparently meaningless and dull. Like a curly wave it was a
hidden, suppressed, desire that had found expression and brought about a change
in her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

undetected underneath the dusky layers of memories, but the wild flames did not
take long to break them through, and the result was that the exploded ripe and
unripe fruits had started getting scattered all around. Definitely there was
something serious in it. No doubt he was a servant, but who could deny that he
was a fast-growing youth. He was no more a child. And what a woman she

one? Out of the four walls of her house, what a world to see, but how hazy and
impervious to her! Had she ever experienced unison with it? That world was a
big wavy expanse of water on which floated lustily the heavy two-storey barge.
What if the waters were turbulent; they could only caress the barge. Badi Bahu
thought she was quite happy sitting on the barge–if not happy at least quite
satiated. The body and the mind both were fast asleep like a child under her
care. She liked actually when the barge swung to and fro. At least for some
time she had felt the excitement run through her backbone to find the water
restless and disturbed. When the body swings softly the earth and the heaven
seem to be embracing each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lighted up the wick. A thin flame rose up smokeless and fragrant. The mud
saucer looked quite safe as if the very purpose of its existence was to
illumine the tulasi plant, and that is all. Her hands folded. When she had
bowed to it her mother-in-law had drawn nearer and looked fixedly on her and
the mud saucer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had found the moon quite high in the sky–so high that its beams met her white
smile to lose their identity in them. Badi Bahu felt strongly urged to bow once
more to the tulasi plant. Who knows why that night had seemed so fragrant that
her heart had fluttered to spread over the entire sky. Everything in a heap was
placed at her feet. O God, how strong would be the heart which would embrace
all that and yet keep the tide at an arm’s length. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sleep of unalloyed happiness. The night had worn out. The dim light of the
rising sun was giving the impression of shrinks on the sheet of darkness. In
that darkness was blossoming a plant–the plant of tender morning light–and Badi
Bahu was pleased to imagine that she would see intently the aura of this plant
in the sunshine, but alas the poor soul, she could never guess that the plant
would fade at the very news of the arrival of sun. Inside her heart the layer
of blackness had thickened into a crust of rough surface which had started to

knots when Heera came in to collect gram kept in water for cattle. With a jerk
Badi Bahu sprang out of the bed to her feet the moment she heard his footfall
in the outer exit gallery as if she would find answers to all suspicions in the
face of the entrant. Heera did not speak anything. Silently he collected the
earthen pot of gram and went out. Neither was there anything new about his gait
nor was it sluggish, nor did it seem to be dragging a dead body. But she was
now sure to mark from his gait that the meteor that had broken loose that night
from the sky was the soul of a ghost, which, capable of transforming itself
into any shape, was hovering around the walls of the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the beginning her mother-in-law had not found much in her to like her. As her
hair was long she used to call her a Bengalin but Badi Bahu till then was
unable to understand the implications of this epithet. Whether it was the long
hair or something else that had roused her into this epithet she did not know.
She had not liked nor approved of the style of her anchal, she had not accepted
her habit of leaving curling tresses loose near her forehead. But Badi Bahu had
won her mother-in-law’s heart soon by her affection and devoted services.
Sometimes, as if charmed, her mother-in-law would hold the smooth, long hair in
her hand and while caressing it would mutter, “Bahu, a beautiful child...” At
this remark usually Badi Bahu’s soft red cheeks would turn red like hibiscus
and she would by and by go away. After washing her face when she saw her image
in the mirror she was not sure if she was doing her hair with her own hands. So
round, so lovely. They were borrowed hands that were running smooth through her
shining hair. Her eyes gazed into the two eyes of her reflected figure; and saw
a reddish flicker poised there in the same way as a shadow of the setting sun
lingers in a blue stream current, with the difference that here in the eyes
there was something dead, like a coral-rag which showed itself again and again
through the wavy waters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The whole day she looked lost. As she was afraid
something untoward might happen, every moment was a suspicious moment and how
secretly she had wished these moments of suspicion could nestle in the beats of
her heart and get its identity lost in it! But it was a pity that she, like a
fascinated mother, was unable to keep these fearful moments of her lap. Somehow
evening set in, and when darkness had gathered she suddenly felt that he fear
was baseless. She imagined she was now safe, out on the bank of the
unfathomable waters of deceptive fears. When again he took her folded sari from
the peg and made for the pond she found to her surprise that there was no
change in her. It was so perhaps because the imaginary pleasures of a cool bath
had relaxed her taut nerves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Nobody was there near the pond also to find in her a
stranger. The place being lonely and she being the solitary bather she could
relax fully and regain her poise. She quietly stepped into the pond. She felt
the touch of mud at the bottom but this touch was also cool and pleasant. There
is a pleasure in getting sunk in mud, she experienced for the first time, but
suddenly she found she disliked it and she moved towards another ghat where pebbles
kept the bottom dry. That day also a wavy pillar of moonlight was swimming
within whose gambit were forming circles within circles, big and small, dashing
one another into new ones. For a minute the small circles seemed determined to
erase the very existence of that pillar. She had kept her body up to the neck
in water and had been watching the fun of the beams of moon which had just
risen. By and by a couple of women came to the pond. She was not aware of the
presence till they had started whispering into each other’s ears. She turned
her eyes towards them, and could stay there no longer. With both hands pushing
the water back she came to the bank. While still wrapping herself in Sari she
heard one of them telling the other “It seems she is alone today. Who will Wash
her sari?” The other one gave a jerk to her neck and weighing morality on her
shoulders pouted with contempt “Pooh, how do people dare to do such
things?….You’ll see, it would not remain secret for long….” </p>

was the cursed name on the tip of everybody’s tongue. Lochan! He was a young
man or some twenty-six years. His cheeks were round and red. His eyes were a
bit smallish like rohu fish. And when he would sing out some folklore while
beating the tabor to its rhythm with his palm, bells jingling around the wrist,
these fishes will, as if in a blue lake, make brisk movements in the sockets of
the eyes. His eyes were really charming. Every rise and fall of his voice would
weave a world of rainbows drunk with whose beauty everyone of the audience
would wink and wink till they were lost into memories. Other senses numbed
except the ears in whose depth the jingling of bells aroused the same
sensations as would be experienced if the pictures etched on the walls of a

I was called to hear this story.” When Badi Bahu left for home she was boiling
with rage. Till now she had believed somehow that Chhote Sarkar at least would
not concede the rumour. He was not so narrow-minded...“But he, even he...” And
suddenly two drops of tears rolled down her cheeks. She came back to her room.
She felt a flame, till then closed tight in the heart-cage, was rising again
and again to embrace the whole body. She knew not how long she stood there
against the door. So she was driven out of that courtyard even. She had full
faith in her safety in that house, though for a moment when her mother-in-law
had spoken ill of her, she had felt that the courtyard had shrunken into the
size of her body and that she was exposed to her own view. But after this event
even she had found no change in Chhote Sarkar and had become complacent. As her
husband looked faithful and she herself was confident of her charm over him,
she had taken everything easy. At least there was a room in that big house, the
witness of her true love to her husband, but now? How could she go even in that
room? Such were the apprehensions of Badi Bahu when she was standing against
the door. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

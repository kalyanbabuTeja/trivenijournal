style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Was
it J. B. <span class=SpellE>Priestley</span>, who advised the admiring reader
not to meet “your <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> writer”? As a voracious
reader himself, long before he became a celebrated writer, he had gathered
enough experience in this matter to make bold to offer this negative advice
(almost Punch-like in its finality) to those less experienced and more
optimistic than himself. It was, in a way, lucky for me that I had not yet read
that thoughtful essay of <span class=SpellE>Priestley’s</span> (may be it was
not yet written, as a matter of fact), when I happened to meet one of my own <span
class=SpellE>favourite</span> writers, for the first time. It was over two
decades ago, when I had just finished writing my B. L. Examination in Madras,
and was spending the summer in <span class=SpellE>Tenali</span> (not a change for
the better from Madras in the matter of weather, by any means!) scouring the
local library for the books of Shaw, Wilde, Chesterton and <span class=SpellE>Belloc</span>
who were my <span class=SpellE>favourite</span> reading at that time. I could
only say this, without any more ado about the subject–that I was happy to have
met him and known him ever since and claimed his friendship till his death in
June 1968. Far from being disappointed or disillusioned, as one very well
might, after a personal encounter with someone whom you had been admiring from
a safe distance, I was only the more enthused by <span class=GramE>an</span>
association, which I had no occasion to regret, which had not only survived
these twenty odd years but become closer and stronger and happier with the
lapse of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
<span class=SpellE>favourite</span> writer is K. Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>,
who had written nothing, in my memory, which I preferred willingly to skip,
where I had the chance to read. Before I met him in the summer of 1946, I had
already read his two little books<i>–Sparks and Fumes </i>and <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>And</i></span></span><i> All that! </i>The
first presenting a gallery of brilliant pen-portraits of Andhra political
leaders from Sir B. N. Sharma to Sir A. P. <span class=SpellE>Patro</span>; and
the second an engaging collection of personal essays in the lighter vein on all
things from Congress Presidents to cups of coffee and such other tremendous trifles
including a tuft of hair (on male head) the sight of which always set him on
the edge. There could, of course, be many (indeed there were some, and there
are a few) other writers, more widely read, more deeply learned, more full of
ideas and more subtle in their understanding or exposition of them, than Mr.
Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>, but hardly any who could, or did, write
with a greater zest for the subject of their choice, or with a greater lucidity
of expression or a greater sense of personal style. He was among the most
readable of Indian writers in the English language–<span class=GramE>who</span>
had left their mark on political and literary journalism in recent times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a stylist, he had <span class=SpellE>modelled</span> himself on the English
masters of his early days–who had made their names immoral in British
journalism. The most striking of them who had influenced him in the formative
years of his writing career was, of course, A. G. Gardner, whose volumes of
profiles (like <i>Pillars of Society, Prophets, Priests and Kings, Certain
people of Importance </i>etc.,) he knew almost by heart, as also the books of
personal essays (of <i>Alpha of the Plough) </i>like <i>Windfalls, Many Furrows
</i>and <i>Leaves in</i> <i>the Wind. </i>T. P. O’Connor (founder-editor of the
famous <i>T. P’s Weekly) </i>was another, whose parliamentary sketches must have
inspired him to do for the leading figures of the Indian Parliament what the
former did for those of the British Parliament in the Eighties and Nineties of
the last century. A certain spontaneous symmetry (not a fashionable virtue of
modern English style), <span class=SpellE>characterised</span> by balance and
antithesis, which came to be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> as the
hallmark of his style, became almost a habit with Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>,
the writer, that he could not easily give up even if he wanted to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
remarkable feature of Mr. Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt’s</span> personality
was that the literary quality was no less evident in his personal
correspondence than in his professional writing. He was, indeed, one of the
most delightful letter-writers that I had directly come across in my life. He
would often make a joke of it and say that he was <span class=GramE>“ a</span>
man of letters” in more senses than one–because he wrote more letters and
received more letters than many of his professional contemporaries. And what
enjoyable letters he wrote! So heart-warming in their intimate and personal
tone, so vivid in their minute detail, so genuinely interested in the fortunes
of the person at the other end, as to encourage him to keep on a real and
lively dialogue. There was nothing to suggest the impatience of a hard-worked
journalist, who must needs give of his best to other forms of writing, nothing
to betray the apathy of a seasoned man of the world, who can be expected to be
full to the brim with his own personal commitments and family responsibilities
to be able to spare the time or writing space to satisfy a distant
correspondent. And the hand-writing too! <span class=GramE>Those even, bold and
well-formed characters, which seemed to flow out of the age of <span
class=SpellE>caligraphy</span>, skipping the age of the typewriters that had
intervened in recent decades, to the detriment of the former.</span> He would
always write with a steel pen and a relief nib, (and never a fountain-pen or
its cheap and glossy successors like the ball-point and such other newfangled
contraptions), reminiscent of the forgotten graces of the quill-pen. It was his
belief and experience that the ceremony of dipping of the pen in the bottle and
the flow of the ink from the nib gave the writer the time and the mood for the
flow of ideas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
many young men, who read too well, or may be only too desultorily (but
certainly not too wisely, for making the most of what one reads), I nursed the
fancy of taking to journalism, encouraged by the vague notion that a <span
class=SpellE>specialisation</span> in the study of English literature at
college could be one of the qualifications for taking up a career in
journalism. Before deciding to do something, which seemed a leap in the dark,
to all the well-wishers in the family, I made bold to write to a few
experienced journalists, who hailed from Andhra and made good in the different
parts of the world. Some wrote in a casual, evasive, or cryptic manner, in view
of the pressing demands on their time and the awkward necessity of having to
interfere in somebody else’s personal choice. I do not remember anyone had
written to me on the subject, with the same degree of refreshing <span
class=SpellE>candour</span>, personal interest and discreet encouragement as
Mr. Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>. The very first letter was aglow with
a characteristic animation–full of horse-sense and home-truths, as well as the
boyish puns and bright witticisms, of ideas to think about, of wisecracks to
chuckle over, of a personality to cherish and a friendship to nourish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
children spoke of journalism as a career, wrote Mr. Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>
(whom I <span class=SpellE>paraphraze</span>, not being able to quote, at this
point) parents shook their heads dismally. For, in this country, journalism was
not yet comfortable as a profession, let alone its being attractive as a
career. But it had its thrills and compensations (for all the kicks and lack of
half-pence) for those who felt the call for it and had the urge. But there was
no escape from the fact that some would take to ink as others to drink and, as
in hanging and <span class=SpellE>wiving</span>, it all went by destiny!
Sensing the truth about me that my craze for journalism had passed well beyond
the stage of boyish infatuation or even juvenile delinquency, he offered me the
benefit of a personal discussion and hospitality beneath his roof, if I could
manage to proceed to <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>, where he was publicity
officer, officially speaking, but actually cultural <span class=SpellE>attache</span>,
private secretary and personal friend, all rolled into one, to Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span class=SpellE>Ismail</span>, then <span
class=SpellE>Dewan</span> of that princely State. He was still able to bring
out the <i>Twentieth Century, </i>with the help of his brother, <span
class=SpellE>Ananda</span> Mohan, and friends in Allahabad, though it was
becoming more and more difficult to bring it out, let alone keep up its
original standard, what with the official duties in <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>
and cultural activities including the conduct of the Athenaeum. For some reason
or another, I was not able to make the journey to <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>,
but I got a letter from him, date-lined <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>,
saying that he would soon be passing through <span class=SpellE>Tenali</span>
on his way to <span class=SpellE>Machllipatnam</span>, there to spend some time
with his relatives. To enable me to locate his compartment, all the more
easily, he mentioned the fact that he was travelling <span class=GramE>First</span>,
though he could hardly afford it! (It was so characteristic of his humanity,
that he did not look down on some of the creature comforts and other nice
little things that made for personal happiness, but even <span class=SpellE>revelled</span>
in them with a boyish relish that could easily be mistaken for vanity by those
devoid of sympathy and understanding<span class=GramE>. )</span> <span
class=GramE>Though I had not seen him in the flesh before, I had no difficulty
in spotting him amidst the books and periodicals strewn all around him.</span>
He was chewing betel and smoking a pipe, for which I was prepared through his
calculated ‘asides’ in the letters. It was a most enjoyable half-hour that I
spent in his company in the compartment up to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vijayawada</st1:place></st1:City>. On the railway platform he
introduced me to all the members of his family–that gracious lady his wife, <span
class=SpellE>Smt</span>. <span class=SpellE>Anasuyamma</span>, something of
whose motherly affection I was later to enjoy, his sociable son <span
class=SpellE>Gopalaratnam</span>, <span class=SpellE>Babji</span> to friends,
and his lively daughter <span class=SpellE>Veni</span>–and his friend and
publisher of his first book, Mr. B. <span class=SpellE>Rajabhushana</span> Rao,
a lawyer by profession, closely connected with <i>Triveni </i>Quarterly for
some years in the past. Some time later, I happened to visit him at <span
class=SpellE>Machilipatnam</span>, where he was relaxing in his sister’s house.
Here it was that I could get to know something of his mode of living and
working–a part of his beautiful library was already in transit from <span
class=SpellE>Jaipur</span> to <st1:City w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:City> (where
he is to move, with Sir <span class=SpellE>Mirza</span>, as P. R. O. for the
brief stay at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">View</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> <span class=SpellE>annexe</span>,
made familiar to the readers of his autobiography). I could also see something
of his fondness for the company of select friends where he would revel in the
flash of wit and the flow of soul, amidst the steaming cups of coffee and
rising curls of tobacco smoke. It dawned upon me here that the writer and
journalist, who could enlist your admiration by his pen, was not always the
shy, scholarly, recluse, who preferred the closet or the chronic <span
class=SpellE>dispeptic</span> who survived on tea and biscuits, consumed in the
privacy of his bed-sitting room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
the <span class=SpellE>appetising</span> descriptions of the Lake View <span
class=SpellE>annexe</span>, with its beautiful situation, where he moved in for
a short-lived stay in the august vicinity of the palatial residences of Sir <span
class=SpellE>Mirza</span> <span class=SpellE>Ismail</span> and Sir Walter <span
class=SpellE>Moncton</span>, I could not meet him in Hyderabad during the time
he was there in that troubled State, bringing out <i>New Hyderabad </i>in the
old. Soon after freedom and the changed set-up in Hyderabad, under the military
governor’s rule before the integration, Mr. Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>
shifted to Delhi and switched back to daily journalism, as a columnist and
Sunday magazine editor of <i>The <span class=SpellE>Hindusthan</span> Times. </i>I
was then on the editorial staff of an English daily in Madras as a sub-editor,
none too happy with the daily grind of routine work. The year 1949 was drawing to
a close (by which time I had done regular subbing for a year and a half, after
the training under Mr. K. Rama Rao, for a like period, all of which seemed
enough for the disillusionment of a young man dreaming about the glories of a
writing career in journalism!) and I was already wondering how best to get away
from all this to something else more bearable. In reply to my letter written in
December that year, which must have given him more than an inkling of my mood
at that moment, he wrote back (24 December 1949), ending thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

did make the pilgrimage to Delhi, as expected, and while nothing came of the
interview, for which I appeared, I remember to have returned home and to the
job in Madras, distinctly improved in my spirits. More than once had he written
to me that the most effective antidote he knew of for the low spirits of
friends was his own company! And he was as good as his word, his optimism was
infectious and his concern for the welfare of friends, especially if they
happened to be journalists or writers, was more than formal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wrote back sometime in June 1952: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

New Year Day of 1954 was one of the proudest days in the journalistic career of
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span>. For it was on that day that he took charge
as Chief Editor of <i>Leader, </i>a paper he had served over twenty years
earlier as <span class=SpellE>Chintamani’s</span> assistant. He was now happy
to be in <span class=SpellE>Chintamani’s</span> chair. He did his very best to
put some life into a paper that he loved so well. But the paper had not many
years to live, nor the chair many months to hold him. After 15 months or more,
may be 18, he resigned </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>from the <i>Leader </i>and returned to
Delhi. The detailed letter he wrote in November 1955 told me, more than somewhat,
of his mind and his mood: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

It is now over six months, since I left the <i>Leader </i>out of concern for a
certain editorial tradition and journalistic values. I returned to Delhi
(having no other place to go to) but not to….., part of the ‘chains’ which I
refused to wear. Having courted wilderness and martyrdom, I have–temporarily –
gone into literary retirement at considerable personal sacrifice. Perhaps you
know–otherwise you should know–that I have no ancestral property of any kind,
no roof over my head, no land (unless <span class=SpellE>Vinobaji</span> gives
me!) no pension or provident fund, no insurance policy, and on the top of it
all, no bank balance or savings and that I am thus in utter readiness to

connection with the production of this book (printed in Madras), Mr. <span

do with this book, by way of going through the manuscript and passing some of
the proofs, I was meeting him almost daily, while he was in Madras, combining
the pleasures of listening to music recital and poetry recitation with the less
exciting business of revising proofs. Soon after finishing the book and going
back to Delhi, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> was in high spirits. New
opportunities came his way–like the ‘Parliament Today’ assignment on A. I. R.,
and the <span class=SpellE>Secretaryship</span> of the National Book Trust
under the chairmanship of Dr. C. D. <span class=SpellE>Deshmukh</span>. After
relinquishing this job, he started the <i>New India </i>weekly in 1961 and
struggled hard to keep it going for a few years, but had finally to wind it up.
All the while, he was doing quite a bit of freelancing, whatever be the regular
job on hand, for the time being might be. The Andhra Pradesh and other
supplements of <i>New India </i>were useful as reference material. The last four
to five years of his life were devoted to the two volume of <i>Congress <span
class=SpellE>Cyclopaedia</span>, </i>which was a commendable work, by any
account, when done by a team of writers, but a remarkable achievement, as it
was virtually done by a single man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fact, it is hard to think of any friend of his on a visit to Delhi who had not

with him. This is a point that can hardly be over-<span class=SpellE>emphasised</span>
in outlining his personality, as it is a feature conspicuous by its absence in
most others, not excluding journalists. It may be argued for some journalists,
the less privileged variety of them, that the struggle for existence is so much
on them, that the question of hospitality becomes irrelevant to their basic
economy. But even those on whom Dame Fortune has deigned to smile cultivate a
flair for playing the charming guest rather than the generous host! Some there
are who have the fear of their lives to play the host of any description. Mr.
Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> was less eager to be the guest than the
host. Of few others could this be said, in all conscience! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

like letter-writing, was another of the vanishing graces in which Mr. <span

reservations. He did not cultivate it so much as an artful diplomat, as he lost
himself in it in the company of like-minded friends. He was fond of the pun and
the alliteration, as well as the brilliant epigram and the striking paradox and
the ‘quotable’ quote. The pun may not be among the higher forms of wit, but Mr.
<span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> could never quite get rid of it, in the written
word or the spoken word. As a student, who did not do too well in his paper, he
is known to have accosted, the lecturer in the class: “You have given me no
mark, Sir only a remark!” He was hard on “the posters and the imposters of the
Indian Press.” He was fond of <i>T. C. </i>among journals and M. C. among
journalists. “Windbags” was his retort to a Madras orator, who went for the
‘Moneybags’, hammer and tongs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that Iswara <span class=SpellE>Dutt</span> had no defects, as a writer or as a
man. It is possible to find his writing wanting in depth and subtlety, if you
are a learned scholar or a fastidious intellectual. But, none can deny him the
merit of being vivid, lucid and readable. As a man, he might have paid court to
those who strode the corridors of power. But he did that with a modicum of
loyalty and was not eager to change his patrons, all too easily, according to
the changing politics of power. He might have looked up to the high and the
mighty, all too often. (He might have dropped names, but he did not drop
friends!) But he did not look down on the humble and the deserving. He was a
good companion, as well as an impressive “courtier.” He was a lively man and a
loyal friend, for all that. We can’t boast of too many like him.</span><span

at least your husband by your side, whereas Urmila has not, and cannot look to
anyone for a word of comfort. Think of it, lady. Really your husband’s
rejection of the crown has brought on you all this sadness. But Urmila’s fate
is more grievous. She may not be so much crushed under the neglect she would
have to encounter at the court hereafter, as by the circumstance of her being
rendered cheerless for quite a long period to come, in the absence of her dear
lord, Lakshmana. Ah lady, our readiness to share others’ griefs can alone make
us bear our difficulties when they come to us. I feel no other way more sure of

avoid saying something by way of commiseration to Urmila. But none cares for

the reason why people here are all in complete sympathy with Urmila? Know then
it was because Lakshmana left for the forest while all the world wondered at
his self-abnegation and choice of a career of self-less service, that people
have begun to feel more affected by the lot of Urmila. Don’t you know that the
scene of their departure to the woods has shaken Ayodhya to the roots and that
everyone was moved at the way Lakshmana made little of his home and his wife?
But can eyes, that have not seen any such moving scenes enacted, ever
understand what greater sorrow there can be in the absence of such outward
demonstrations? Say, Satyavati, whether you can think of a situation when a

Well, so long as Raghava’s arms encircle her in their embrace, Sita need have
no cause for sadness of any kind. For, does one need the comforts of a
cushioned couch for love’s satisfaction? To me when compare myself to Sita, she
appears, more lucky than I. Don’t you know all that we suffer, or enjoy in life
is rendered keener by causes for comparison existing side by side? There are
varying degrees of enjoyment and suffering one has to experience, and often it
results from comparison of ourselves with others. Depression and satisfaction
are not creations of our own. Much of it has to do with our impressions of
others placed in similar situations. Nothing of an absolute standard there is

safe in the enjoyment of a queenly life here. But alas! my lord who is a

though he stays constantly near me. Could there be a worse fate befalling a

crown when Rama himself offered it to him. He is firm as a rock. I am by his

laid my countless charges at his door. He can have only one kind of reaction
towards me. He may be wondering in himself thus: ‘Am I not mistaken in thinking
this woman worthy I of her birth in ‘Janaka’s glorious house?’ For I remember
how on finding my importunities persistent he remarked: ‘Alas, Mandavi, you do
not for a moment think of Urmila.’ Instead of listening to him, I began from
that moment hating Urmila. I berated her whose profound silence conveyed, as

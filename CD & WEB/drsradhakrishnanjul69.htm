me start with a personal confession. I am a bit of an iconoclast–(that is) one
who is more inclined, in the presence of idols, to smash them than to bow down
in abject humility before them: in particular, when those idols are living
idols, flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone. As Falstaff was given to
running away from the battlefield “on principle”, so am I, in my own humble
fashion, tempted to avert my gaze from the glittering spectacle of illustrious
personages being paraded unblushingly in full public view as though they were
so many gorgeous mannequins. In other words, I am not, any more than the
redoubtable Mr. Khrushchev <span class=GramE>is,</span> a believer in the
“personality cult”. I think I can make my point clearer by a quotation from
Thackeray. Contrasting Goldsmith with Dean Swift he said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to be sure, would I! That, I am certain, expresses the genuine democratic <span
class=GramE>sentiment</span> in a nutshell. It will be seen that I have been
groping my way towards intimating that I am more than somewhat allergic to
brazen hero-worship, to abasing <span class=SpellE>genu</span>-flexions before
those who, when all the smoke has cleared away, stand revealed to us as mere
mortals, bleeding when we prick them and laughing when we tickle them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this having been stated, however, it is incumbent on me now to hasten to say
that I must make some (appropriate) allowances: one such (appropriate)
allowance being our worthy ex-President, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, who, in sheer
intellect, in sheer mental grace (what the ancient Greeks used to call <span
class=SpellE><i>Sophrosyne</i></span><i>), </i>towers above everyone else in
the country as Everest and <span class=SpellE>Kanchinjunga</span> overshadow

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>more ably than I can
hope to do even in my wildest dreams, Dr. Radhakrishnan has led a variegated
life and has touched nothing that he has not adorned. “Versatile” is a terribly
over-worked adjective and is lavishly applied to anyone who has, on howsoever
modest a scale, “made the grade” in any branch of human <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>.
In our own hapless country, especially, it pullulates to an unimaginable
extent. This adjective, therefore, has become like a rubbed coin: whatever
significance it may originally have possessed has been considerably eroded by
its persistent and indiscriminating use. But it is the one adjective that
instantly springs to the lips in the case of Dr. Radhakrishnan: it fits him, as
the saying is, like a glove. In the (not-so-easily-forgotten) Kennedy days the
occupant of the White House was widely reputed to have surrounded himself with
the Harvard “eggheads’. Mr. <span class=GramE>opinion</span> is that if our
late lamented Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru, can ever be said to have been hemmed
in during his tenure of the highest office in the State, that unique
distinction belonged, unquestionably, to the subject of my present
disquisition. Ever since his selection as our Ambassador in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>, he had been the guide, philosopher,
and friend of Mr. Nehru: and much more naturally, after his relinquishment of
that arduous assignment. But, until and unless he publishes his <i>Memoirs, </i>the
public will be in no position to assess at its true worth, at its meridian <span
class=SpellE>splendour</span>, his sage counsel to his Chief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That,
of course, marks a sort of watershed in Dr. Radhakrishnan’s meritorious career.
Until then he had been only a savant: a scholar to the manner born. Personally
I wish he had remained such all through: politics is not the appropriate <i>milieu
</i>for one who habitually lets his imagination roam in the illimitable
empyrean, who requires for the proper functioning of his mind “an ampler ether,
a diviner air,” than politics normally provides. There is, if one cares to
delve into the past, the classic instance of the late President Woodrow Wilson:
he was a tragic misfit in that dark and dangerous realm. Fortunately, Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Radhakrishna’s</span> guardian angel has never deserted him. Being
a scholar has, in no way, <span class=SpellE>weekened</span> his position as a
politician. It may even be contended that his earlier training in “the
humanities” has consistently stood him in good stead in the trials and tribulations
of a sterner and a more practical vocation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
(more or less) the same variety of earlier training had, as indicated above,
acted so disastrously on the distinguished proponent of the famous “Fourteen
Points”, the only valid inference must be that there is something in the
temperament of the ex-Indian President </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>some
kind of mental prophylactic, if I may say so, that has steered him clear of the
manifold snares and pitfalls of politics. Never having been in the thick of the
fight, never having been in the very centre of the <i>maelstrom, </i>so to
speak, has also been of no little assistance to him. Of him it can truly be
said that, though he has been in<i> </i>politics, he has not been <i>of </i>it.
Poor Woodrow Wilson’s lot, on the contrary, had been distinctly harder in that
it, <span class=GramE>not seldom</span>, precipitated him into the toughest
spots imaginable, as at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Versailles</st1:place></st1:City>.
His life had been a sheltered one until then</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
had not been mixed up with Nature “red in tooth and claw” in the shape of the
Lloyd Georges and the <span class=SpellE>Clemenceaus</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and,
understandably, he came a cropper. But though, in the latter part of his
career, Dr. Radhakrishnan has strayed ever further and further away from the
groves of Academe, the stars in<i> </i>their courses have contrived that his
life shall continue to be a sheltered one to the maximum degree possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Which
is not to suggest that I am prepared to <span class=SpellE>resile</span> from
my stated position that a savant of Dr. Radhakrishnan’s stature should never
have allowed himself to be persuaded to step down his eerie “built in the cedar’s
top,” his philosopher’s tower, into the dusty arena of politics. Nor, to my
mind, is any useful purpose served by dragging Plato into the argument: the two
instances are not in<i> <span class=SpellE>pari</span> <span class=SpellE>materia</span>.
</i>But there is no disputing the fact that, if a philosopher <i>had </i>to be
appointed as the President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan’s was decidedly the best
choice. Certainly was a very worthy successor to Dr. Rajendra Prasad. In a
sense it can be maintained that <span class=SpellE>Amurath</span> to <span
class=SpellE>Amurath</span> succeeded: for the former is, as the latter was,

poet’s words, “looks before and after.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thus, by easy stages, I come to the philosopher “prisoned” in the ex-President
as “the sculptor<i> </i>perceives the angel prisoned in a block of marble.”
This, of course, is the aspect of him that stands foursquare to all the winds
that blow. It has been said of Socrates that he brought philosophy down from
heaven to inhabit among men: the same may, but with a slight exaggeration, be
said of Dr. Radhakrishnan also. He never seems to have regarded philosophy in
the light of a task-work: in his hands it has become a plaything, rather. Its
subtleties and intricacies have, obviously, no overpowering, terror for him.
The remarkable thing about him is that he is perfectly at ease in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zion</st1:place></st1:City>, in both Eastern and
Western philosophy. I am well aware that, in certain “high-brow” circles, he is
credited with a more thorough grasp of the latter than of the former. There is
a persistent charge against him that, for all his stupendous reputation, he is
shallow to a degree in contradistinction to some others that are supposed to be
awe-inspiringly deep. This criticism has its origin in the undisputed fact
that, whatever his theme, he writes in such a <span class=SpellE>pellucidly</span>
clear and trenchant manner that, as it were, he who runs may understand him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
addition, he has fashioned for himself an extremely flexible and attractive
style. It may be contended that that Philosophy which can be learned “without
tears” is no philosophy in the strictest connotation of the term. I strongly
demur to this. My own confirmed opinion is that a person who, whatever his
laurels in the academic field, cannot descant <i>interestingly </i>on his
subject does not understand that subject as well as he is expected to: he
merely pretends to do so. Obfuscation is not profundity: dullness is not depth.
Learning, if it is to justify its august name, must be </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>worn
lightly. This is the greatest merit of Dr. Radhakrishnan. He sheds the <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>problem

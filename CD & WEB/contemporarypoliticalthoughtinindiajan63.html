Indian Nationalist opinion, in so far it had any conceptions of what a state
should be and what governments should do, obviously struck liberal attitudes.
It was not till the late twenties that socialist doctrines found champions and
not till the forties of this century that they found significant recognition in
society. Liberalism constituted the one dominant influence in Indian political
thinking–though in various shades. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
then, what is Liberalism? The sanctity of the individual; political democracy,
with the corollary of political rights and representative institutions; from
the economic point of view, restraint from state control; and a secular
attitude to politics–these form the essentials of European liberalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
can safely be said that in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
these norms were held predominantly in political circles. The western-oriented
‘Liberals’ of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were the professed heirs to this liberal tradition. Gokhale, with his trust in Constitutionalism
and his faith in gradualism and <span class=GramE>insistence</span> on
secularism, was the doyen amongst our early Liberals. Gokhale’s reverence for
the British traditions and institutions was so fervid that Morley wondered what
a fine Liberal statesman Gokhale would have been had he been born British. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
among the Congressmen of the time there appears to be a general acceptance of
the liberal values. With the exception of the Mahatma and those who believed in
his political and social philosophy, the majority of the Congress conceived of
an independent <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
run on the pattern of a liberal democratic state wherein the freedom of the
individual is secured. While the liberal creed of constitutional agitation was
not for them, all the same, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
once- independent, should go the liberal democratic way. But this
liberal-democratic way can be best illustrated by contrast with the current
Congress creed of socialism through democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is extremely difficult to discern whether Congress political thinking had any definite
notions about the type of economy it would like to be introduced in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But the
fact that the leadership of the Congress was confined to the upper strata of
society, both from the economic as well as from the social point of view, and
the fact that capitalist support for the national movement was considerable,
might lead one to infer that the generality of Congressmen did not look beyond
an independent India, ruled and controlled by the upper classes. At least one
thing can be said with certainty. The Congress never seriously considered a
definite programme for the uplift of the masses of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and for making them real
sharers in the political power. The Mahatma’s insistence on the rural social
revolution, simultaneously with the political revolution, did not penetrate
deep into the lower ranks of the Congress leadership. To these, <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> must find
her place in the modern world, of course, with the necessary trappings of
industrialisation and technological advance. But any notion of a <span
class=SpellE>socialised</span> economy was far from their view. The attitude of
the Indian Constituent Assembly illustrates this point of view strikingly. In
spite of the Socialist Republic that the Preamble to the Constitution
proclaims, the debates on the Fundamental Right to property amply indicate the
individualist bias of most of the members, a bias that was much too reluctantly
parted with in the end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
Pandit Nehru’s rationale for embracing socialism is not so much a doctrinaire
committal to it, but the desire that the lot of the masses should never be
forgotten when once freedom became a reality. He feared that an Indian
political revolution, which did not constantly identify itself with the cause
of the masses, may degenerate itself into a middle-class hegemony in society, as
it happened in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under Chiang Kai <span class=SpellE>Shek</span>. And Nehru was aware that a
majority of the Congress had precisely such middle-class attitudes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
<span class=GramE>excepting</span> genuine <span class=SpellE>Gandhians</span>
and the few enthusiasts of socialism, Congressmen, in general, <span
class=SpellE>visualised</span> no spectacular alteration in the social fabric
after freedom. Their conception of free <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> implied political freedom
with democratic institutions, and an <span class=SpellE>industrialised</span>
society, wherein property interests will find full freedom to operate. Such a
conception, which would now be termed as conservative, now finds expression in
the ideology of the <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span> Party. </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
views of radicals like Tilak, though couched in an entirely different
terminology, do not differ very much from the liberal democratic outlook, at
least in their economic aspect. It is true that Tilak thoroughly distrusted the
utilitarian and materialistic origins of western liberal ideas as highly
injurious to the spiritual traditions of Hindu polity. His uncompromising
opposition to measures of social reform, championed by <span class=SpellE>Ranade</span>
and Gokhale, indicates his position. Indeed, it is held by some writers that
Tilak revived the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">school</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian Political</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
thought, with the concept of Dharma creating moral imperatives as norms for
political and social values. Even if we accept this view, it can still be said
that <span class=SpellE>Tilak’s</span> views on politics and society fall on
the conservative side. Tilak envisaged the ‘imperative’ in the nature of the
eighteenth century notions of natural law and natural rights. He was not averse
to the industrialisation of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on the western model. This, taken together with the fact that he was
particularly opposed to collectivist creeds like communism, warrants one to
conclude that <span class=SpellE>Tilak’s</span> economics, in so far as one can
spell it out, <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> a capitalist structure. But
here a note of caution must be added. His political ideas were the result of a
combination of his belief in <span class=SpellE>Sanatana</span> Dharma and a
more practical desire of freeing <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> from bondage. As such, while
the theocratic tendencies of his thinking can easily be discerned, it is not so
easy to identify his opinions on economics and thus to conclude whether he is
an individualist. <span class=GramE>In any case, his firm championship of the
caste institutions and rejection of social reform strike at the roots of the
principle of equality.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
leading political ideas of Tilak today permeate the policy of the Jan <span
class=SpellE>Sangh</span> and it is important to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
that this Party is extremely conservative in its social and economic doctrines.
Once again it is difficult to decipher whether the conservatism is attributable
to the religious outlook of the party or is due to the fact that the party
caters mainly to the middle classes and the upper-caste section of the society.

are very recent. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

Congress, the almost single political organisation in <st1:country-region

long time, was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>largely <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> by the
middle-class liberalism of its leadership; the radicals like Tilak were
suspicious of the egalitarian and materialistic leanings of socialist
doctrines; and finally even on the European scene socialism was then just
trying to find a footing. The Russian Revolution, naturally, enough,
sky-rocketed Socialist hopes all over–though even by then the incompatibility
between Marxism and evolutionary socialism bean to manifest itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a way the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> revolution in the Congress

suggests a socialist trend. But Gandhism can only be styled as utopian
Socialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

socialists were no less involved in the problem of adjusting the industrial and

‘peasant’ outlook “looks at all the questions from the narrow and sectional
viewpoint of the peasant class. Its tenets derived from the ideal that our
economic evolution, as the whole structure of our state, will necessarily have
to retain its specific peasant character….Such an outlook is unscientific and
betrays a mentality which may give an exaggerated importance to the small

faith in the virtues of an expanding industrial order is implied in such

attitudes, traditions and institutions. Thus <span class=SpellE>Asoka</span> <span

of renunciation is not a major obstacle to economic development, that it has in
fact been all along linked to the material side of Indian life, and that as

man, its neat explanation of the progress of history and its presentation of

temperament of Nehru. There is no doubt that this scientific spirit constitutes
the key to Nehru’s intellectual dimension’s and socialism is the result of the
manifestation of the scientific attitude in its social and economic aspects. It
was the French Materialist school’s contribution to Marxism that tuned well
with Nehru’s mental make-up. Its rejection of altruism as a basis for social
ethics, its robust trust in the human intelligence, as typified by the <span

Nehru acquired a genuine thirst for the democratic way of life and love for the

democratic institutions can thus be seen in his thought. This, combined with
his impassioned advocacy of Socialism, naturally made him come nearer <span

views of the early Fabians. Indeed the point of criticism against Nehru is
precisely this close identity of his views with Fabian thought. It can be
argued that in the twentieth century the trends of the capitalist system have
undergone so complete a transformation that a nineteenth century Fabian
perspective on capitalism is thoroughly out of date and grossly unrealistic.

acquire a universal outlook. It is also well known that Marxist and Socialist
ideologies are primarily internationalist in their character. It is this that
is responsible for his foreign policy. The impasse that is reached by the
contemporary world situation, mostly due to the cold war, evokes distress in
Nehru. But his socialist leanings and his anti-colonial convictions rule out a
pro-western reading of the situation. Indeed, sometimes, the above factors tend
to make him give the benefit of doubt to the Russian camp. On the other hand, the
scant respect for morality and the not-too-infrequent perversion of socialist

for his policy of non-alignment. His own firm conviction of the desirability of
world peace is, of course, a self-evident moral principle. And since this

is not necessary to discuss at length the development of communism in India. No
contribution worth mentioning is made by any Indian towards communist thought.
Ever since it gained some hold in India, Communism, in the name of
international loyalties, even turned a blind eye to the cause of freedom. And,
perhaps, a noteworthy step that Indian Communism took in recent times is its
acceptance to work as an organisation within the fold of the democratic
Constitution of India, eschewing extra-legal tactics. Again, it may be
suggested that the rift in world communist circles, between the Stalinists and
the <span class=SpellE>Kruschevites</span>, has its domestic repercussions
also. For long the former were a force to reckon with and the Party’s
acceptance of the doctrine of peaceful co-existence can be regarded as a shift
from the Stalinist position of aggressive and uncompromising Communism to a more
empirical interpretation of Marx and Lenin. The Communists in India are at bay
in the struggle between Russia and China and in so far as this struggle
represents a debate on ideology, Indian Communism is also seized of this issue.
But since the debate is one concerning communist foreign policy in general in
India the Communists have no alternative but to accept the Russian stand–thanks
to the Chinese aggression on the northern borders of the country! Thus, apart
from these subtle transformations in communist thinking, there is not much of
Indian contribution to communist thought. But the new creed of M. N. Roy, once
a high priest of Communism, needs special mention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

called New humanism) can inspire a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>philosophy which will
set man free, spiritually as well as socially. It is new because it is
scientific and integral; because it conceives human sovereignty not as a
differentiation from the mechanistic processes of nature, but as their highest
product. The ideas of newness being transitory, the more precise term ‘radical’
should be preferred.” He rejects the religious basis of morality and finds the
sanction of morality in the mechanistic biological functions articulated as
instincts and intuitions’. Thus ‘morality must be referred back to man’s innate
rationality, and it is not necessary to go in search of divine or
mystic-metaphysical sanctions’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with modern civilisation; it is not a ‘moralist’ admonition against the worship
of Mammon, as is the case with Thoreau, Ruskin and Tolstoy and Gandhi. It is
true that Roy argues for priorities for agricultural development, but this is
because the country’s economy is primarily agricultural in its nature, and not

charges that philosophers so far have failed to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the innate morality of man and ‘the prevailing opinion has been that man can
behave morally only under compulsion, either super-natural or social’. He
claims that Radical Humanism discovered the true foundations of ethics. But it
may be observed that quite a few socialists sought to base their views on
precisely the same factor, that is, the altruism of man. Thus the idea of
tapping the innate ‘goodness’ of man to build a just and moral social order, is
not an original idea of the Radical Humanists. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

decentralized society where power is relegated to a minimum function are all

living organisms unite. Interpenetration is complete and no element can remain
unchanged in the new synthesis.” But with the coming in of the European, and
with him Western culture, started ‘the modern ferment’. Here the three strands,
of culture, Hindu and Muslim and Western, remain untouched by each other, and
yet simultaneously acting upon individuals at different unrelated levels. “A
man who accepts Western science intellectually is steeped emotionally in the tradition
of ancient or medieval India. And to Professor Kabir, “The educational
revolution brought about by <span class=SpellE>Macaulay</span> was largely
responsible for this bifurcation of Indian society.” Thus ‘the absence of a
common system of national education’ has been one of the main reasons why
Indians exhibit even today a regional, linguistic or communal outlook. The

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
February, 1944, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy published an essay that called into
question one of the most sacred beliefs of modern Western Culture, viz., the belief
that literacy, the ability to read and write, makes a society and a people cultured
or superior to societies and peoples without that ability. The essay was titled
“The Bugbear of Literacy” and in it AKC set out to examine the assumption that
literacy is “an unqualified good and an indispensable condition of culture” [“The
Bugbear of Literacy” in <i>The Bugbear of Literacy </i>by Ananda K. Coomara­swamy
(London: Dennis Dobson, Ltd., 1949), p. 24.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

concluded the essay by reminding the reader that his concern was not with
literacy in the West but with the spread of modern Western education elsewhere,
particularly to India. He said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

then, stating his deepest fears, he concluded the essay:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
essay is one of AKC’s finest efforts, written with his usual laconic style,
brief (it’s only 15 pages long), copiously footnoted (20 footnotes in four
pages), drawing on original sources in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, French, German
and English, driven by just the right amount of anger and righteous
indignation, and pushing the point home with one quoted source after another;
all in all it is, indeed, Coomy at his best.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
yet I think that the thrust of his argument and its conclusion are mis-stated.
I don’t believe it was literacy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se </i>that
ought to have been AKC’s concern in this essay but something that may or may
not presuppose literacy. In the brief paper that follows I want to explain what
I think this “something else” is and why I think it ought to be of more concern
to us than mere literacy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Literacy
is a tool and like all tools it can be abused. Oral communication is also a
tool and it, too, can be abused. There is nothing inherently or necessarily
superior to an oral tradition as opposed to a literate tradition, and if either
is abused, i.e., if either is used abusively, then each one ought to be
criticized and abandoned. The question of superiority of the oral tradition <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>versus </i>the literate tradition does not
lie, then, in the manner communication, for both the oral and the written are
merely means of relaying information; but the question of superiority does lie
in what is communicated. If I spread wild rumours, fear and hatred that cause
suffering, agony and death to one segment of humanity, it matters very little
whether the spreading is done by word of mouth or by pamphlet and book.
Similarly, if I bring happiness, peace and tranquillity into the lives of other
human beings, it matters very little whether the bringing is done orally or by
printed word. Oral communication is not, therefore, inherently or necessarily superior
or inferior to written communication. It was merely an unfortunate accident
that oral traditions, which AKC regards as superior, have clashed in the 19th
and 20th centuries with literate traditions, which AKC regards as inferior. And
it was an accident because the quality of the information which each tradition
had to communicate was, in this case, “superior” for the oral tradition and “inferior”
for the literate tradition. That is to say, the substance of the communication,
the “what” that was communicated, ought to have been the measure of superiority
and inferiority and not the manner of that communication. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
what makes some information superior to other information? How can
communication be abused by the kind of information that is communicated? The
answer to these questions gets us into issues of human goals and ways to goals,
of societal and cultural ends and means, subjects close to the philosophic
heart of Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. What is, as he might have asked, the purpose of
a society? What worthwhile goals does it foster for the men and women in that
society? What information, finally, is needed to accomplish those goals? Let me
turn next to this issue of ends and means and their relation to communication
and information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For
AKC as well as for a host of other traditionally-minded philosophers and
theologians the primary purpose of society and its institutions is to foster
metaphysical realization, i. e., Moksha or Nirvaana. All elements of the
society could be measures in terms of whether this goal was being pursued or
accomplished and if it was not then the particular element that was failing in
that purpose could be judged faulty, poor or inferior in relation to other
elements or institutions of the society that were pursuing or accomplishing
this goal. This metaphysical pragmatism goes deep into the philosophy of the
whole notion of a traditional society as AKC understood it and it undoubtedly
seemed a novel idea to modern Western philosophers that an entire culture could
be set upon a single goal for all members of that culture. Stated quite boldly
then, the purpose of a traditional society was simply to provide all members of
that society with metaphysical realization. AKC reminds us often enough that in
the West during the Middle Ages when the Christian Church and scholastic philosophy
dominated the lives of the people and the loyalties of the state a similar kind
of theocratic society existed then as existed in traditional India, i.e., in
India before the corruptions from the modern West began to settle in. Further
these societies can be judged by the kind of persons they produce such that the
societies are superior if the citizens of those societies pursue and accomplish
metaphysical change, self-realization, within themselves. So we have identified
the goal of a traditional society, i.e., a metaphysically grounded and
self-transformational society, and we conclude that such a traditional society
for AKC is superior to a non-traditional society; in other words, the Indian
Hindu society of the 19th and early 20th century and the Western Christian society
of the 12th and l3th centuries are both superior to the modern Indian and
modern Western of the middle 20th centuries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
means by which these traditional societies accomplish their metaphysical, i.e.,
transformational, goal is through the institutions of the society, in
particular through the institution of the priestly hierarchy. The priesthood
passes on the myth that explains the origin and goal of the society, and it
preserves the sacred means to that goal, e.g., the various sacrifices, the
yogas, the secret rites and rituals, and so on. Traditional societies preserve
these means to self-transformation within their oral traditions in order to
keep the secret of the way to self-transformation from the uninitiated who
might abuse the sacred tradition. And here we come to the centre of AKC’s
concern; for a literate society always runs the risk of such abuse far more
than an illiterate society where in the former publicly publishing the sacred
materials that were meant only for the initiated and the qualified is a
constant threat. AKC’s concern is perhaps not far different from the concern
expressed by other defenders of sacred and oral traditions, in particular the
Druids of ancient Gaul. For example, if the account given by Julius Caesar is
correct, the Druids would also have attacked the spread of literacy in order to
protect their sacred disciplines: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Druids are by custom not present during war nor do they pay taxes; indeed, they
have immunity from military service and exemption from all public duties.
Inspired by such rewards many assemble together for instruction from the Druids
sent there by parents and kin. There they are said to learn by heart a great
number of sacred verses. And some remain thus in study for 20 years. Nor do
they regard it as right to commit these verses to writing, while in other
matters, in private and public business, they use the Greek script. I think
that they have established this oral tradition for two reasons: They do not
wish the sacred discipline to be carried off by the masses, and they do not
wish those who do learn to trust more to writing than to memory. For it usually
happens to very many when they have the support of writing that they neglect both
the diligence of thorough learning and the cultivation of their memories. (J.
Caesar, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>De Bello Gall. </i>VI. 14,
translated by Arthur Herman, Jr.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Druids and AKC are both of the opinion that literacy threatens and destroys the
means and the goals that the sacred or traditional society has established. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
I would contend, once again, that it is not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how
</i>something is communicated but rather <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>what
</i>is communicated that threatens and destroys traditional societies. The
means to metaphysical transformation can be as easily and effectively passed on
to the qualified pupil by the written word as by the oral. One has only to
mention the discovery of ancient texts and the resurgence of interest in their
content all quite outside the oral tradition that originally produced them to
realize that the method of communication, the system that delivers the message,
is far less important than the message, itself, to the qualified pupil. In a
healthy society it is immaterial how metaphysical knowledge is passed on; in a
diseased society, one which has lost its way because its metaphysical roots
have decayed, it is useless to speculate on whether a literate or an oral
tradition is superior. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally,
let me say that AKC’s brilliant analysis of the traditional society is somewhat
misplaced. It is not literate societies that we have to fear, nor should our
concern be with the literate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>versus </i>the
oral traditions. The world has gone too far along the literate route and we can
never return to the oral and illiterate past, though the idea of attempting
such a move is intriguing. Our attention must be placed now on the nature of
the information, the quality of the information, that the literate society or
the oral society dispense. In other words, junk literature is still junk whether
it is dispensed in writing or by word of mouth. We have to deal with the
bugbear of information and not the bugbear of literacy. We must be on guard
against those who claim that information has an absolute value, that somehow or
other, the more one knows about anything and everything the better one is going
to be. To make the point more clearly, let me conclude here by restating AKC’s
remarks quoted earlier, inserting “information” for “literacy” where such
insertion seems appropriate: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

late Sri Viswanatha Satyanarayana Garu needs no introduction. Not to know him
argues ourselves unknown. “The late” is only in a literal or physical sense. He
is alive more than most of us. To omit his name is to create a gap in Telugu
literature. His <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ramayanakalpavriksham </i>is
a worthy addition to the epic genre and a votive offering to Rama. None
understands Bharatavarsha without reading the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ramayana </i>at least in a translation. The various Ramayanas are
attempts to interpret the soul of Hindu life style and world view. The hold of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ramayana</i> is such that a king of the
South shouted for his weapons when he read that Rama marched <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>alone</i> against Khara and others. The
devotional songs of Bhakta Thyagayya and of saint Ramadas are immortal
variations of the Andhras’ love of Rama. And the various Ramayanas in Telugu
are so many prayers in Kavya form at the altar of Ayodhyapati and his consort.
It is a well-known fact that many Hindus recite the Sundarakanda daily. Without
Rama there is a vacuum in our lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sabari episode in<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ramayana </i>is one of the fruitiest in the
epic. A devotee’s vigil for her God is over and the devotee shuffles off the
mortal coil. There is no more purpose for the body after such a tryst. There is
a poem in English which tells of a mother waiting for news of her long-lost
son; she gets the news from a ship-wrecked sailor and falls asleep for ever.
Sabari’s offering for Rama fruits after tasting them to test if they are sour
or ripe untroubled by the thought that partly-tasted foods or fruits should not
be offered to a guest and to a guest who is her God shows the purity, the
innocence, the unsuspiciousness, the utter devotion of a woman forest-dweller.
Perhaps women are capable of greater faith and Devotion than men. The idea of
impurity was consumed by devotion. What is good for Sabari is good for Rama.
The fruit that does not pass the test of her tooth does not pass the test of
her devotion, cannot be offered to her God. Of course there is nothing of this
in Valmiki. Sabari says, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a Yogini who served a sage, not a mere Aranyika. Why poets invented this is
puzzling. Sabari’s story is the undying example of the Bhakti of a woman, a
forest-dweller, of a devotee’s unfaltering vigil and a shining example of God’s
acceptance of the fruit of that devotion. Sabari and Rama meet and mingle in
the fruit as the lover and his lady meet and mingle in the Flea which has
sucked the blood of both (in a poem of Donne). The fruit is blessed by the bite
of Sabari and Rama–the blessedest example of whole-hearted offer and
whole-hearted acceptance. Like mercy it is twice blessed: it blesseth her that
gave and him that took. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the three attitudes are perfumed by Sringaara Rasa. In mystical poetry the
eternal bridals are always described in terms of the union of man and woman–the
nearest intelligible approximation to that Divine bliss. There is nothing of
this again in Valmiki but the poet’s invention is in conformity with the
traditional syndrome of Bhakti. The reference to the Godavari and the Sabari
should bring the Sabari episode closer to the Andhras and the poet’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kinnerasanipatalu. </i>Knowing as we do the
poet’s love of Telugu (as seen for instance in his novel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

perhaps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ill-equipped
critics indulge in the meaningless pastime of labelling the poet traditional
and reactionary, not modern and progressive. These critics do not understand
that “modern” is a matter of critical temper, not a matter of date and that
what is modern to one may be reactionary to another. The ideas which a poet
uses are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his </i>affair; the artistic use
to which they are put is the critic’s affair. As Henry James put it “We must
grant the artist his subject, his idea, his donnee; our criticism is applied
only to what he makes of it.” One of the finest Jacobean plays deals with
incest between brother and sister. Shall we label it immoral, reactionary or
modern? The critic who prescribes a subject to a poet does not know his
limitations. A work of art need not toe the line of contemporaneity. It is
foolish to ignore the pastness of the present. If we call our grandfathers
fools, they will pay us the same compliment. “Modern,” as applied to
literature, is an arrogant word (in the words of C. S. Lewis) to judge others
from your point of view, as if it is infallible, is just like deciding that one
is beautiful because his nose resembles your nose; but whoever says your nose
is beautiful! Critics discuss Greene as a Catholic novelist forgetting that he
is a novelist who is a Catholic. In the words of Charles Williams “religious or
patriotic or philosophical poetry is poetry first and then religion, patriotism
or philosophy.”] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

someone called Rama from behind, Rama with diamond-bright eyes saw through the
breeze-disturbed leafy greener and, not finding anyone, stood there. His
brother looked behind the clumps of mango sprouts, radiant laughter spreading
over his cheeks. Sumitra’s son, with this jewel of the Ikshwaku family
enshrined in his heart, said: “O Lord! this Logos (Rama) is from the Vedas. We
have not missed the way mentioned by that Divine Being. This should be the
hermitage of Sabari preceding the region, redolent of merit, of the prince of
sages.” As he spoke, the fresh breezes blew thickly from the wave-agitated
Pampa lake, strengthened by the beat of the wings of the she-swans on the
shore. The flowery Archer, a garland of tulasi leaves round his neck and
Vibhuti on his soft body, strung his sugar-cane bow let loose on Rama, benumbed
by separation from the daughter of the Earth, a shaft tipped with the loose
petals of tummi flower. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sriramachandra spoke to Soumitri: “My mind is anxious to see Sabari of the aged
and wrinkled and delicate body as if she is stuck in me like a white-lotused
arrow.” With flowers like lightnings in the womb of a dense cloud, with fruits
of the hue of molten gold and copper in due proportion, with some flowers
nectar-wombed like the dugs of a fresh-yeaned cow, with some fruits as if
appetisingly rounded by gustatory desires, in a basket on her head came
slow-stepping Sabari like a dry tree in bloom at the top. Finding His
reflection in the eyes of Sabari, the wife-separated Lord shuffled off the pain
of separation. Sabari’s eyes, cleared of tear drops, became bright. Without
getting the basket of flowers off her head Sabari queried: “Are there in the
streets of Ayodhya people keeping a vigil for you like me?” The Lord laughing
loudly said: “Are there people like you? Put your flower basket down.” Speaking
smilingly: “I have forgotten, my Lord”, she put down the basket with “Here are
the bright flowers and honeyed fruits.” The Lord, saying “where are they?”
picked with his fingers a few flowers and sprinkled them on his pair of feet.
With apologetic “Alas! Lord”, Sabari strewed palmfuls of flowers on his feet.
From her eyes streamed down two rivulets of agitated Ganga waters. She showed
him the tasteful fruits with “For you I have brought these. Seeing your shape
is like a sight of the sky and the sea and the forests; I have slackened my
duty. It has been second nature with me from my teen age to engage myself in
the service of the family of hermits by sprinkling flowers. Forgive me for this
lapse.” Rama intervened: “In the midst of the forest you buttonhole, me with
‘Rama, Rama eat’. How can I? I have to wash my feet, rinse my eyes, bathe my
body. If asked to eat as I am I shall not say nay but why should you get the
blame for my breach of the ritual?” Then she said: “In this region every tree
is a dwelling place for me. For you where is the need for a bathe? You are the
embodiment of purity and the very ocean of Dharma. As I have hands I brought
flowers. As there are fruit-bearing trees, I brought fruits. I have come as I
am animate, and I have thought of these as I have a mind. I did not bring
flowers, I did not bring fruits, O beauteous One, I did not come either. You
did not come here like a stranger, O Protector of devotees. There is no need, O
mind-born One, to show etiquette to a maid-servant. The fruits in the Ashrama
of Agastya and other hermits have not, O Lord of my life, the taste of these
fruits. My life is a votive offering to you. You have come of your own accord,
my Lord. Here is my offering. Accept. It is as if the smoke of the fire of the
great grief because of separation from Sita has assumed your shape.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sriramachandra smilingly said: “Surpanakha (lit. one with nails as broad as a
winnowing fan) longed for me even after seeing repeatedly the beauty of Sita.
There is no mistake in your longing for me as you have not seen the beauty of
the Earth-born one. What of your age? What of your body like the slough of a she-serpent?
What of my age? What of my body like a branch of the divine tree, Santana? You
term me the God of love and Lord of your life. My mind is likewise affected
towards you. Is it good fortune–your loving me suffering from the anguish of
separation? Distress follows distress, O joyous one.” Sabari spoke, the corners
of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>her mouth raised like the crescent
tips of the young moon in the deepening evening: “Lord of my life, taste the
fruits brought by me and accepted by you.” The Master remarked, the corners of<i

creeper of moonlight of the full moon:<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>“How
can I taste them not knowing if they are juicy or not unless you taste them and
tell me so.” Sabari told him: “O Lord, from each tree it is only after I first
tasted them I brought these fruits.” Then Sriramachandra looked at Soumitri
laughingly –a soft, slow, good laugh. Sabari observed those smiles and, a bit
disturbed, uttered: “O Lord, have I done a wrong thing? How, else can I test
the taste of the fruits?” Then Rama spoke: “O well-favoured one, I do not feel
like eating alone. Let us eat them–my brother and you and I.” Then Sabari
appealed to him with “What I have eaten by way of tasting the slices amounts to
a ten or dozen or twenty-five. My stomach is full. There is no spare space. O
compassionate one, with difficulty I have procured them. Eat them. Then Rama
cutting each fruit, eating the slices, enquiring after Sabari’s story, appeared
as if he forgot the abduction of Sita conversing charmingly thus: “This is the
fruit of serving the sage by toiling in the forest till the muscles of the legs
stiffened, the fruit of procuring kusa and darbha grass and flowers for the
sacrificial fire, the fruit of drying the bark garments. Against the wind in
the rainy season, the fruit of protecting the fire carefully by covering the
dung-cakes with husk, the fruit of attentiveness over a long stretch of time,
the fruit of choosing me as her lord, her full-blown lotus eyes shining with
eager expectancy.” As the Lord was speaking thus, was eating and speaking, the
lotus eyes of the aged Sabari shone as if many Brahmas took their Birth there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

This forest superscribed with the Tapas of sage Matanga is abounding in juicy
and tasteful fruits. My name is Sramani and my devoted service to the sage has
achieved excellence. When you arrived at Chitrakuta, the Master Journeyed to
the heaven in a beautiful chariot brought by Indra sounding with the
tintinnabulation of gem-like bells. The sage has entrusted to me the rite of
welcoming you informing me that you two brothers, as bright as diamonds, would
come to these forests and instructed me to follow him. O giver, by devotedly
serving your cloud-like dusky beauty the anguish of separation from the sage is
gone. Your sidelong looks are fascinating like lightnings in a cloud. I have
given my word to the sage, my God, at his upward journey to follow him helped
by the seasonal waters of your compassion. Sir, it is a word <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>(Rama) </i>from the Vedas. The great sage
taught the parrots in each tree the divine <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Word.
</i>All over the forest vocal with the sacred logos putting on a divine shape
you are made manifest to me. It is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Word
</i>which has come in your Form. With no one to bring and hand on to him on
time materials like fruit, fuel and flower, with no hope of anyone stitching
the torn garment with thread from the lotus stalk, with no spare hand to blow
upon the cinders and set right the fire as smoke fills the aged eyes, the great
Master, gone far in Indra’s chariot in the direction of Uttarayana, will be
disconcerted. I cannot put up with delay in carrying out his instructions. I
shall join my body in the fire which is ready and go to him. Favour me, O
compassionate one.” The Lord spoke, his eyes suffused with glow like widespread
moonlight and radiating smiles: “Your amour for the sage and my amour for you
are of varying nature.” Sabari said thus: “The love of the ocean for Gautami is
of the same measure as that for Sabari. Sabari shy of the ocean lord hid her
amour behind the Godavari.” Rama said thus: “The sage beckons you to go after
him. But Kabandhu told us about the sovereign among the sages as an ocean of
greatness. I am desirous of seeing the Ashrama of the sage. I wish to see the
wonders, the marvels, the merit of that king of sages.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sabari showing the cardinal points said: “O lotus-eyed one, these are the relics
of the power of the great sage, the full splendour of the orbed moon shone in
the eyes of Sriramachandra. When Sabari added showing the trees: “For our sake
a tithe of the power of the sage’s Tapas has filled the inside of these fruits
with exceeding sweetness, the taste of the fruits eaten by the Lord revived on
the tongue. Walking with her bent body, smeared with fresh Vibhuti, full of
many wrinkles dun-complexioned, her arms ornamented with bands of leafless dry
creepers, with soft hair near the parting on the head, her eyes peering through
white eye-lashes, joyful smiles playing on the cracked lower lip, Sabari spoke
thus: “Look at this sacrificial altar of the sage. The flowers are unfading.
The sage left this that day. The brightness of the flowers has persisted thus.
The seven seas in deference to the wishes of the age-enfeebled one to protect
the sacrifice of the best of sages came to his habitation. The rush of the
ocean fascinating with massed waters does not stop even after becoming. Ponds
which do not leave out of kind nature, in spite of the cessation of serving the
departed sage. The sage ties the Valkala garments taut to the branches of the
trees. After the meritorious one has gone in the direction of the divine world,
the branches of the trees, though buffeted by the wind, do not shake violently.
The Valkala garments do not lose their deep ochre shine. The best among the
sages embodying the thoughts of my inner heart is gone; you too, the best among
men, embodying the thoughts of my inner heart, will be gone. I intend in my
mind going after the sage of great excellence if you, best among men, should
favour me. I am ripe for heaven. (I hoped to have had) on that side the sage on
this side the best of the Raghu line: On that side the best of the Raghu line
and on this side the king of the sages. But before your arrival the master of
the sages left. Why should I tarry? To welcome you there are the trees, the
parrots, the virtues of the Matanga forest. Perhaps it was meant for me that by
a sight of your blessedness the very idea of sin should vanish... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thus entered the fire and the buzzing of the bees increasing in loudness
sounded like the noise of the aerial car as Raghava gazed at the sky: “On earth
creatures grow after birth: in the heavens birth appears after growth. Sabari
appeared a divine shape fresh in garlands and unguents. It is only an
incredible thought that she and this shape are the same. Between this
effulgence of divine form and the ascetic there is no likeness.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the verses that follow, 388-390, Rama tells Soumitri how gracious it was of the
sage to have left Sabari behind to welcome them in that forest uninhabited by
men, how surprising to himself it was to indulge in badinage with Sabari
without realising her worth as an ascetic, how he felt elated, to the point of
forgetting Janaki, on seeing her, how the seven seas dwindled into ponds
because of the sage’s power and stayed there enabling the brothers to offer
Tarpana to the manes of the forefathers with the waters of the seven seas at
the same time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

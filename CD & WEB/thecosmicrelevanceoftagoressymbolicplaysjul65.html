is the “response of man’s creative soul to the call of the Real.” It belongs to
the procession of life, making constant adjustment with surprises, exploring
unknown shrines of reality along its path of pilgrimage to a future which is as
different from the past as the tree is from the seed. In other words, Man, the
paragon of all the animal kingdom, alone is given the power of aesthetic
excellence which is quite similar to that of God, in being self-creative,
self-ruled, and self-supreme. It is in a circle that man travels, from life to
death and from death to life; from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>divinity to humanity
and from humanity to divinity, acknowledging constant surprises unconsciously
created by his own self from a region of ultimate Reality. The vocation of art
is to take a creative part in the festival of life, the festival that is to
give expression to the Infinite in man. It is because of this God’s point of
view, rooted in his theory of art, that <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span>
symbolism acquires a mystic significance. But the importance of <span
class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> complete apprehension of life lies not in
universal sympathy, understanding and profound detachment as in Shakespeare,
but in the cosmic relevance he discovers even in the ordinary things of life.
Human life is at once a perfect entity by itself and also a part of the whole
process of the Universe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we discuss the symbolism in <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>, it is necessary
that we should know something about <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span>
philosophy since the former is greatly influenced by and based upon the latter.
He is one of the staunchest exponents of Indian mysticism, embodied in the
Upanishads. He <span class=SpellE>harmonises</span> the essential view that
whatever is apparent is unreal with a poet’s emphasis on the play of the senses
and the experiences of the phenomenal world. Besides, <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>
had also studied, and to some extent imbibed, the main tenets of Buddhism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> attitude
towards life was that of acceptance, appreciation and thankfulness, and not of
doubt, disgust and protest. In a way, he represents the very height of Indian
spiritual optimism, strongly supported by a rich heritage of mystical thinkers
of ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In his poetry the individual and his world (life) are given enormous importance
in regard to his relation with Godhead. He formulates a religion of his own–the
religion of life–in which the individual ego or <span class=SpellE><i>Aham</i></span><i>
</i>and the super-ego are co-eternal. Through the former, the latter is moving
towards finality–from death to birth and from birth to death. It is a mistake
to conclude that by this finality, <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> meant
anything like spiritual perfection or emancipation or <i>Nirvana. </i>It is a
movement that impels the Universe–life included–to endless expansion in itself.
The significance of <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> philosophy is essentially
based on the reconciliation he had established between the conflicting forces
of love and duty by achieving a mellowness of the heart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>According
to <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>, man’s real enjoyment consists in,
answering himself the perennial and mysterious question “Who I am?” The easiest
way of answering the question is the search by the self for permanence in love.
In fact, the entire philosophy of <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> rests on
three pillars, viz., unity, beauty, and love. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

source of endless joy for those who search for the inner meanings. It is not
restricted to a drama or a story or a poem or a play or a situation but it runs
through every sentence and phrase. Without this symbolism much of his poetry
would have been mere abstract philosophy and most of his dramas, not so
rewarding, In fact, this symbolism of a divine nature <span class=GramE>is</span>
the very basis of Indian art. His plays and poems are the sparks of the great
flame of his self-<span class=SpellE>realisation</span>, <span class=GramE>The</span>
key of his plays, especially the philosophical aspect of them, is provided in
his <i>Reminiscences, </i>where he says: “The subject matter with which all my
writings have dealt is the joy of attaining the infinite within the finite.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
in his boyhood days he found that the unmeaning fragments lost their individual
isolation, and his mind <span class=SpellE>revelled</span> in the unity of a
vision when he came under the influence of a “collection of old lyrical poems
composed by the poets of the <span class=SpellE>Vaishnava</span> sect.” When
these fell accidentally into his hand, he says, “I became aware of some
underlying idea that lay in the meaning of these love poems….” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sang of a love that ever flows through numerous obstacles between men and Man
the Divine, the eternal relation which has no relationship of mutual dependence
for a <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> that needs the perfect union of the
individual and the universal.” When he was eighteen, while observing the early
dawn (the dawn of wisdom), he suddenly came under a new religious experience.
The veil of ordinariness was lifted and he began to discover a new meaning in
men and things around. He records this experience of sudden expansion of his consciousness
in the allegory named <i>The Awakening of the Waterfall, </i>“The waterfall,
whose spirit lay dormant in its icebound isolation, was touched by the sun, and
bursting in a cataract of freedom, it found its finality, in an unending
sacrifice, in a continual union with the sea.” The allegory here, of course, is
clear. The waterfall is the poet’s soul, and the sun represents the <span
class=SpellE>esemplastic</span> wisdom, and the sea the Ultimate Reality. Thus
symbolism m <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> is based on personal experience
which he had even from his adolescence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the play <span class=SpellE><i>Sanyasi</i></span><i> </i>the dramatic interest
is in the clash of deep emotion, superior wisdom, and unattached and wide view
of life against blind orthodoxy, a narrow conception of duty and mistaken
notions of justice. The <span class=SpellE><i>Sanyasin</i></span><i> </i>reverences
everything in search of the Ultimate Reality. Overpowered with the dignity of
renunciation, he majestically says, “For me the stream of time has stopped….In
this dark cave I am alone merged in myself.” He comments on the littleness of
earthly existence, and the futility of simple human loves, and the limitations
of the human mind. When he sees misery around him, the <span class=SpellE><i>Sanyasi</i></span><i>
</i>feels that he should never return to it. <span class=SpellE>Vasanti</span>
was a forsaken flower-girl, whose father did not accept the usual. She was
considered an outcaste and the <span class=SpellE><i>Sanyasi</i></span><i> </i>gives
her shelter because he is above social ethics and orthodoxy. But the <span

into the fold of <span class=SpellE><i>Samsara</i></span><i> </i>by the
innocent pure aspects of the flower-girl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> <span class=SpellE>dramatises</span> in the
play is not the downfall of a weak-minded <span class=SpellE><i>Sanyasin</i></span><i>
</i>from a superior order of spiritual status, but the awareness of an
underlying truth or principle that is common to both humanity and divinity. He <span
class=SpellE>dramatises</span> the idea that the escapism of the ascetic offers
no enduring solution, and the real success in life of man is allured to the
spirit of nature. Man’s second and divine birth is in love. The dualism of life
and nature is a dualism of unity and love and not one of hostility and
exclusion. Man is not a feeding animal but a free personality <span
class=SpellE>realising</span> the infinite in love. Self-consciousness begins
with a feeling of separateness and is perfected in the feeling of unity with
all. “The whole object of man,” according to <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>,
“is to free his personality of self into the personality of the soul, to turn
his inward forces into the forward movement towards the infinite, from the
contraction of self in desire into the expansion of soul in love.” Here <span
class=SpellE>Tagore</span> is not merely pointing out the metamorphosis of Man
into Divinity, but he discovers <span class=GramE>a perfection</span> is man
and life, as they exist. <span class=SpellE>Rabindranath</span>, like most
significant poets in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
looking into ancient Indian literature, has found that soul and matter are both
good, both real, and that the highest life consists in the welding together of
the two, in the enjoyment of their fruit here and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>now.”

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, human life is a phase or a face of the Universal consciousness or Brahman
and it is a part essential for the enjoyment of the whole. The part (life) and
the whole (Brahman) are not so much distinct as they may appear. In the play <span
class=SpellE>Vasanti</span> represents <span class=SpellE><i>maya</i></span><i>
</i>or <span class=SpellE><i>prakriti</i></span><i> </i>and the <span
class=SpellE><i>Sanyasi</i></span><i> </i><span class=SpellE>symbolises</span>
Ultimate Reality or <span class=SpellE><i>purusha</i></span><i>. </i>The whole
universe, cosmos and chaos, <i>sat </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>maya</i></span><i>,
</i>life and divinity, self and super-self, finite and infinite, unity and
diversity–are all their eternal game of hide and seek. The experience they
derive out of the game is pleasure, which is beyond our conception of pain and
pleasure. It is <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> belief that God sought joy
in creating this universe, in establishing ‘duality’ for His <span
class=SpellE>realisation</span>. He split himself into self and non-self, into <span
class=SpellE><i>Eswara</i></span><i> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>maya</i></span><i>,
</i>for “It is the joy that creates the separation in order to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> through obstacles the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>.”
A summation of <span class=SpellE>Tagore’s</span> mysticism is that God fulfils
Himself through His creation. This asserts once for all, the significance of
life or the creative force, the annihilation of which is a negation of the

is narrative and there is not much of a story to tell. <span class=SpellE>Amal</span>,
the adopted child of <span class=SpellE>Mahadev</span>, is sick. The village
doctor orders that the child should not be allowed to go outside, and all the
windows of the boy’s room should be kept shut. The boy always dreams of the
beauties of nature outside, and likes to be entertained by an infinite variety
of people, like the dairyman, watchman, <span class=SpellE>Goffer</span>, and
the headman. The boy, out of simple vanity and pride, desires that the Royal
Physician should take care of him. At last the Royal Physician does indeed come
to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

from a literary point of view, the play is not dramatic, from a <span

class=SpellE>dramatises</span> what happened in both the western and eastern
countries for the past two thousand years in regard to religion. It is obvious
that the severe self-sacrificing <span class=SpellE>fervour</span> of the
ancient ages of India and of the middle ages in Europe, has been quite softened
gradually to humanism, as the tendency of the so-called cultured man is more of
pleasure-loving and comfort-seeking. But anyway, the final consummation is
still uncertain, as it is in the play. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

maintain that man should close the doors of his senses in order to <span

the truth, and <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span> prefers a less difficult but
more subtle one. He maintains, like Bridges and Wordsworth, that spiritual
elevation consists in man’s loving response to the beauties of nature. Anyway,
death is inevitable, as it is in the case of <span class=SpellE>Amal</span>,
and death, according to <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>, is not a negative
fact but a means of fresh creation. But, as <span class=SpellE>Yeats</span>

10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is the first really symbolic drama by <span
class=SpellE>Tagore</span>. Here the symbolism is more clear than in his other
plays. The story is purely allegorical and simple. Nobody in the kingdom had
ever seen the king. Even the queen did not see him and the king meets her
always in a dark chamber. Still there was order and peace in the kingdom. The
queen <span class=SpellE>Sudarshana</span> is somewhat egoistic and she is very
anxious to see her husband in the daylight. The maid <span class=SpellE>Suranguma</span>,
whom the king puts in charge of the Dark Chamber, knew the king well, though
she also had never seen him. There were citizens like the grandfather who
believed the king to be all powerful and there were citizens also like <span
class=SpellE>Virupaksha</span> who did not believe even in the king’s
existence. But all were given a place in the kingdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Queen <span class=SpellE>Sudarshana</span> insists to see the king, in spite of
admonitions of the latter and of <span class=SpellE>Suranguma</span>. As a
result on the day of a festival, she mistakes one pretender to be the king, and
sends a garland. The impostor king encouraged by the conspirators–the kings of <span
class=SpellE>Koshala</span>, <span class=SpellE>Kanchi</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Avanti</span>–accepts the garland and sends her another one. But
soon, unable to hide his own pretensions, the false king reveals himself. The
queen, after the recognition, feels wounded with shame and pride and forsakes
the king and goes to her father’s kingdom. Meanwhile, the conspirators wage war
against her father to seize her. But the King of the Dark Chamber conquers them
all, in time, and the conspirators, and the queen, feel repentant and bow at
his feet in humiliation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

implication that the objective study of science will be disastrous if the
scientist applies it even, to those matters which belong to the subjective
realities of man. Love is not a thing to be known, but in itself; it is an
experience. Art is no necessity of life according to the scientist. But while

endless experiences, and ever new wonders. He felt bored of its immortality and
smashed it to death. By this simple allegorical event <span class=SpellE>Tagore</span>
ridicules the foolish desire of mankind to attain immortal life. All of us know
immortality became a curse on the fallen angels in <span class=SpellE>Milton’s</span>
<i>Paradise Lost </i>and as we all know, we are no better than those fallen
angels in our desire for wealth and political power. We wish immortal life

earthly desires entangle us in the cobwebs of utilitarianism which is not at
all a means to the higher achievement of the spirit. The love between man and

which is the greatest sorrow.” What he means is that the tumultuous, self-sacrificing
nature of love may be tragic but its sorrows remind us of the greatest of all
sorrows–the separation of map from God. “The pain of desire for the near
belongs to the animal, the sorrow of aspiration for the far belongs to man.”
What distinguishes man from the immediate animal world is not the desire for
material comforts, but the aspiration for the higher orders of being which are
quite beyond his physical necessities. But the love here referred to is not to
be mistaken for simple futile love on the physical plane. It is like the

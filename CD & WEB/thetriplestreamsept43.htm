the amendments to the Delhi University Act were debated on the floor of the
Central Legislative Assembly and received due publicity, it is unfortunate that
amendments of a far-reaching character proposed to be made in the Annamalai
University Act are not destined to receive the benefit of such open discussion.
The suspension of the Madras Legislatures, where originally the Annamalai
University Bill was hammered into shape clause by clause, makes this
impossible. The Annamalai and Andhra Universities have been looked upon as
centres for fostering and promoting language and culture of the respective
areas. They are rooted in public sentiment in a sense in which older
Universities like those of Madras and Bombay are not. Their career and
complexion are, therefore, matters of great public concern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

amendments to the Annamalai University Act as published reveal a tendency to
render the administration more ‘totalitarian.’ Totalitarianism be a need, and
even a virtue, for Governments engaged in a War, but is a dangerous principle
to be embodied in centres of academic learning difficult to understand why
there should be an embargo on University teachers sitting on the Senate and the
Syndicate, as if to remind them sharply of their status as mere employees.
Freedom of growth (including ‘freedom from fear’) is the very breath of healthy
academic life–and the of opportunities to the personnel of a University to take
their proper share in the discussion of policies and proposals that affect their
task most of all is detrimental to this freedom and to the rise of the
University to its fullest heights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have been misgivings also regarding unjust communal discrimination in regard to
admissions to courses of study. It is a melancholy circumstance that while the
best mind and thought of India are chafing against discriminations against
Indians in India and abroad, the communal distemper should find a home in
University centres, which are the nurseries of the youth of the country and
also leave an unhappy legacy for the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

favour of communalism in deciding the proportions of persons in public services
so as to maintain a balance of (nepotic?) power and to see that no community
committed ‘atrocities’ against others. But to deprive young men who are
intellectually qualified, of the chances of pursuing higher studies according
to their bent of mind on the ground that they are brahmins or harijans is a
negation of the basic principle of democracy, that there should be equality of
opportunity. The youth of a country are its potential wealth and the full
growth of their talents–whatever the accident of their birth–is, or should be,
a matter of national concern. This land has always prided itself on its spirit
of tolerance and should not imitate the spirit which has actuated the lynching

Committee presided over by the Rt. Hon. M. R. Jayakar, appointed last year to
make recommendations on the constitution of Maharashtra University, have
submitted their report. Among the older Universities, Bombay happens to be the
only one that has not made way for other Universities in the Province where its
jurisdiction extends, and though there has been some amount of public demand
for Universities in the different linguistic regions that make up the
Presidency, for Maharashtra, Karnatak and Gujerat, the Jayakar Committee has
been the first officially appointed to consider and report on such course of
development. The Committee have recommended that a University may be
constituted with Poona as its centre to be called the Poona University, and not
a Maharashtra one, because the Committee are anxious that the proposed
University should not develop a parochial outlook. Poona though in a way the
intellectual and political capital of Maharashtra, is also a cosmopolitan city
and is the Headquarters of many All-India institutions. The Committee do not,
wish therefore, to make the University a merely Maharashtra body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a sound and broad view to take, but we trust this would not shelve or
prejudge the demand for the creation of another University centre in Karnatak
or in Gujerat for which there has been wide demand for some years now. It is only
in India that we are wedded to Universities exercising jurisdiction over wide
and unwieldy areas, affiliating colleges far and near, and continuing to be
examining and diploma-distributing bodies. But the time has come when
University centres should be brought into existence to foster the culture and
stimulate the intellectual and economic life of every region of India. This is
why though we are in the midst of war conditions, proposals have been made for
Universities for Rajputana, Orissa and Sind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the new age in Tamil may well see assurance of approval to their own work at
the hands of an intelligent literary public. It was the late Dr. Mahamahopadhyaya
U. V. Swaminatha Iyer who brought into vogue a style in Tamil writing which was
free from pedantry of any kind. Sri. Mudaliar not only replenishes himself from
Tamil classics but draws much inspiration from modern writings of the west, and
always gives of his best to solving many of our social evils. In other spheres
of activity, such as the Labour movement, Sri. Mudaliar has rendered great
services, which entitle him to the appreciation of a grateful public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mudaliar was a Tamil Pandit, when he heard the call for public work consequent

Movement. He was a pioneer in installing Tamil in its rightful place as a
medium for social and political propaganda, and in the mouth of this gifted
exponent, the language acquired charm and power that convinced the sceptics
that English was indispensable to give expression to the higher life and
thought of Indians. It was only appropriate, therefore, that the Madras
Corporation which honoured this good public servant presented its address in
Tamil, and Sri Mudaliar replied in the same language, an event which is unique
in the annals of Municipal Corporations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for him is life’s work. As Principal of the Madras Sanskrit College, Mylapore,
he acquired experience in managing infant institutions which stood him in good
stead when transferred as the head the Maharajah’s College of Sanskrit,

only after he was chosen with rare foresight by Sir P. S. Sivaswami Iyer, then

the east to create traditions of teaching and merge oneself in that labour of

no doubt, published many treatises and discourses if he had cared; but no such
ambition ever fired his mind. He invariably derived satisfaction in the
publications of his pupils. The only substantial monument of his vast learning

Chattarjee, the veteran journalist, in his 79th year. India and Indian
journalism have sustained a heavy and irreparable loss. Ramananda Babu took to
the editorship of <i>Prabasi </i>in Bengali and the <i>Modern Review </i>in
English as a mission in life thirty-six years ago. He gave up his Principalship
of the Kayastha Pathasala, Allahabad, to devote himself fully to this ask. His
contribution, through journalism, to the cause of Indian progress during these
momentous years has been invaluable. The introduction of art and artists to
public notice, the ushering of Tagore, large portions of whose writings were
published in the <i>Review</i>, to the outside world, scholarly contributions
on manifold aspects of Indian Culture, past and present, and the able
discussion of contemporary Indian problems, social, economic and political, are
among the achievements to the credit of this foremost of Indian Monthlies in
English. Its pages have been a treasure of information to the Indian student
and to outsiders interested in India. The copious editorial notes that
Ramananda Babu himself wrote, brief, telling well-documented, outspoken and
independent, often marked by mild sarcasm and dry humour will long be missed.

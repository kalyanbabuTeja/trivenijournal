national freedom, but it would seem in retrospect that this success only served
to obscure its cosmic significance. The tendency of the West, in particular, is
to regard the technique as the product of a clever ‘idea’ or stratagem which,
while admittedly successful in India, thanks to her peculiar conditions, could
be of little value in easing the tensions of the world today. Such, in any case,
was the view expressed by a delegate from America in a symposium on the subject

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
must be borne in mind, however, by both the protagonists of <i>Satyagraha </i>and
its detractors is the basic fact that faith in the efficacy of the thing is
itself a vital condition of its success. Gandhiji himself was never tired of
demanding this faith of his followers. Be this as it may, there can be no
denying that it would be simply unfair to Gandhiji to regard him as a mere
patriot who hit upon a lucky stratagem. What inspired Gandhiji was not merely
the freedom of his land but more a passionate devotion to something which, for
him at any rate, had a transcendent significance. His <i>Story of My
Experiments with Truth, </i>an authentic record of the genesis and development
of his personality, tells us how, when he was yet a boy, he was deeply moved by
the play, <i>Harischandra, </i>how it ‘haunted’ him so that he acted
Harischandra to himself ‘times without number’. He says, “to follow truth and
to go through all the severe trials Harischandra went through was the one ideal
it taught me. The thought of it all often made me weep”. The basic purpose of
Gandhiji’s eventful career, the one which gave a certain unity to it as well as
uniqueness to his personality, was to discover and uphold, time and again, what
he loved to call truth or, what amounted to the same thing, to find a remedy
for a problem which is as old as life, the problem of evil. For his impatience
with evil was but the negative counterpart of his devotion to truth. And it is
his unceasing preoccupation with truth and the problem of evil which gives him
a timeless significance and earns him a place among the saviours of mankind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Evil
presented itself to Gandhiji, fundamentally as untruth which, if at all, could
be dispelled only by truth. But did truth have the power to dispel its
antithesis and regenerate the world, simple truth unaided by any element of
violence? Gandhiji gained the immediate certitude of faith in this power of
truth by the ‘experiments’ which, as in a vast laboratory, he conducted in
South Africa. They gave him a serene confidence and he was already a dedicated
soul when he returned to India. A relentless quest for truth and its active
vindication became the mission of his life. The political movement for the
freedom of India, as he directed it, was a demonstration, pure and simple, of
the efficacy of truth. India gave him the opportunity to show mankind how the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>world
might be rid of all evil or untruth. And her freedom was important for him only
in so far as the manner of its attainment </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>demonstrated, beyond
any shadow of doubt, the efficacy of the new weapon which he discovered. The
national struggle throbbed for him, accordingly, with a cosmic purpose and into
the zest of the battle went, not the impatience of a mere patriot, but the
giant agony of a world striving to be born again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

self-sufficiency of truth is the cardinal doctrine in the </span><span

creed, if it may be so called, of Gandhiji. India cherishes him as the ‘Architect
of Freedom’ and the world reveres him as </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the ‘Apostle of
Non-violence’. Freedom, however, was of incidental importance to him and even
non-violence was but a necessary pre-condition of the success of his
demonstrations. It was neither a policy nor a creed but a negation which
served, however, to vindicate the positive, self-sufficient vitality of truth.
The Gandhian solution for the problem of evil demanded, not mere quietism or
passive acquiescence in evil, but active resistance to it. Non-violence was not
non-resistance. Violence was taboo because it negated the innate potency of
truth. But through resistance alone truth could become dynamic. For the first
time in the history of the human race, truth was thus made an active social
force which could be applied for a just solution of even international issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji
used the word, ‘truth’, in a very comprehensive sense. Fundamentally, he points
out in a speech addressed to the inmates of his <i>Ashram, </i>truth is <i>Satya,
</i>that which alone exists. It is more than an attribute of God: it <i>is </i>God.
He says, “It is more correct to say that truth is God, than to say that God is
truth”. Truth is, therefore, an inspiring ideal, the realisation of which is
the ultimate end of human life. “Devotion to this Truth is the sole
justification for our existence.” Nevertheless, truth is not merely a distant
ideal but a standard by which every moment of our life is to be judged. It has
its moral connotations: For, “there should be truth in thought, truth in speech
and truth in action……If we once learn how to apply this never-failing test of
truth, we will at once be able to find out what is worth doing, what is worth
saying and what is worth reading.” Through-out his active life, Gandhiji was
primarily concerned with this latter aspect of truth–with truth, that is, as an
ethical value whose emergence depended, however, on a readjustment of human
relations. But he spoke of truth as a percept rather than a concept, as
something intuited, a flash of inspiration. We can understand, therefore, what
truth meant for Gandhiji as an ethical value only by appreciating his own
peculiarities of temperament and outlook. For, in the last analysis, truth
meant for Gandhiji, in any given issue, precisely the solution which satisfied
him completely and made him happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
all really great men, Gandhiji sought to secure human happiness and believed
that this happiness depended, not of course on the possession of wealth, but
certainly on the satisfaction, among other things, of an inescapable minimum of
material needs. His thoughts often tended towards a compromise. He neither
worshipped money nor dismissed it with a lofty contempt. But his emphasis was
always on the life of the spirit, for he believed that all real progress was at
bottom spiritual. He had a stubborn faith in human nature and its
perfectibility and in the possibility of establishing <i>Rama Rajya. </i>But he
was no romantic. He was a humanist who believed in control rather than freedom,
the control of man’s self-expansive tendencies by his higher Self. He had a
profound respect for the past, a sense of tradition, and was definitely
inclined to be orthodox. He was thus totally free from the impatience of the
typical revolutionary for the millennium. He knew that “successful progress”,
to quote Prof. Whitehead, “creeps from point to point, testing each step” and
he loved to declare, in the words of Cardinal Newman, that one step was enough
for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
career of Mahatma Gandhi synchronised with a period of great social ferment in
India. Life bristled with a host of complex problems and, on each of them, he
left the impress of his profound wisdom. Still, much as we may admire and
analyse his genius, we can never quite capture the secret of his success. That
secret was inseparable from his total personality and perished with his mortal
frame. However, his example has its lessons for mankind today-perhaps more
today in the context of the current ‘ideological conflict’, than in his own
life time. First, there is something sublime in his conception of himself as a
humble votary of truth. Not a half-truth like ‘rights’, a purely secular notion
which swayed the peoples of the West and, towards the end of the eighteenth
century, shook the very foundations of their civilisation, but truth itself,
with all its moral and spiritual connotations, was his battle-cry. Like the
concept of ‘Dharma’, truth embraces and transcends notions such as rights and
duties and is binding on all alike, the individual and the group, the ruler as
well as the ruled. But faith in ‘Dharma’ or truth derives from a deeper, if
unconscious faith in life as a harmony. Pandit Nehru refers to the perfect
unity of Gandhiji’s personality. This unity is but a reflex of his steady
vision of life as a whole and as a unity, and his awareness of the relatedness
of things in time as well as in space. Finally, though Gandhiji was no recluse
and sought truth always with reference to a concrete issue, he thought that his
quest demanded a certain discipline of disinterestedness. His fasts and prayers
and days of silence helped him purge his mind of all conscious or subconscious
prejudices and study the issue before him with a rare objectivity. His approach
to life’s complexities was marked by a. strange realism and reverent humility.
He was totally free from the intellectual arrogance of our current ‘…isms’
which seek to reduce life into a neat formula quietly ignoring facts which do
not fit in. Because there was humility and objectivity in his approach he could
perceive certain values even in his opponents, values which he frankly admired
and praised. Humility gave him knowledge and knowledge gave him love, so that
he fought his battles with pity in his heart and sadness in his eyes. While he
sought to put an end to British rule in India, he had nothing to say against
the British themselves, as individuals or as a people. Speaking of the vestiges
of feudalism in Bengal, he agreed that the ‘system’ was bad but urged, in the
same breath, ‘the individuals are good’. Nothing, perhaps, is more surprising in
the Indian struggle for freedom than that a campaign of such magnitude should
be conducted with so little of bitterness and recourse to dogma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Throughout
his life, the heart of Gandhiji was swayed by issues which were far more
momentous than the freedom of his land. There is a significance in his life
which transcends the importance of his tangible achievements, one which should
reveal him not as a meteor that lit the Indian sky for a brief while, but as a
star, a lasting, beneficent influence, that has lately swum into the ken of
troubled humanity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

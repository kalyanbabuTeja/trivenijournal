NOTE: Tenali Ramakrishna is famous in South Indian folklore as a humorist at
the Court of Sri Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagara. But he was also a renowned
poet and devotee. His ‘Panduranga Mahatyam’ is reckoned as one of the five
great classics in Telugu literature of the medieval period. For choice
expression and power of narration, Ramakrishna is among the poets of the first
rank. The Episode of Nigama Sarma, taken from the Third Canto, is a vigpette of
contemporary life, and the sister who tries to wean him from evil ways, is the
ideal housewife, gracious, loving, yet firm in her attitude to her erring
brother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

covered the distance which was five <i>yojanas </i>and reached the place.<sup>1</sup>
First she endeavoured to assuage the grief of her aged parents, tossing
hopelessly on a wild sea of sorrow on account of the ignominious conduct of
their son, by her soothing acts of physical service and engaging conversation.
Then she set about to restore order in the house. She arranged for the revival
of the observance of the traditional activities of the household such as the
daily worship of the gods, and hospitality to the guests; she secured possession
of the family funds and took steps to preserve the slender remnant of the
family purse (handed over by her mother) left after the extravagance of the
dissolute young man; then she organised the work of the household, allotting to
the servants their respective duties. She redressed their grievances and won
their allegiance which was quite necessary for the furtherance of her plan.
Then she turned her attention to the family library and set her husband to
rescue the volumes from decay and danger of destruction by fire and white ants
and borrowers. Thus she restored the house to its former well-managed condition
and even revived the practice of recitation of the Vedas by the students and
elders. She succeeded also in securing possession of such lands and farmyards
(gifted to the family by kings of old) as had not been mortgaged or sold by her
brother or lost by continued neglect, and asserted the right of ownership of
the family over fields, trees, banks and garden-lands still belonging to them,
by appointing watchmen. Her eagle glance finally fell upon the young wife of
the miscreant, the worst hit by his misconduct. When she contemplated her
extraordinary beauty in all the charm and freshness of youth, and realised the
futility of it all, like moonlight in a forest or the attempts to tend the <i>palasa
</i>tree to make it blossom out of season, even her brave heart could not bear
it, and hot tears of compassion gathered in her eyes and she felt unnerved for
a moment. But just then, like a star falling from the sky, from somewhere, the
scamp appeared on the scene. He approached home for breakfast but finding his
sister there unexpectedly, he hesitated to advance and accost her out of very
shame; nor could he retreat now having been noticed by her, without being guilty
of violating the most elementary canons of courtesy and good manners. So he
stopped short at a respectable distance and saluted her with bent head. She saw
him thus for the first time after a long interval of years, noting the marks of
debauchery even on his face. She advanced to embrace him but it was such a
repulsive sight to her, and overcoming the rising physical aversion by an
effort of the will, she blessed him in satirical words, wishing him the

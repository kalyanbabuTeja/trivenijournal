finished his meal and went into his bedroom, and picking up a Weekly, slumped
into the easy chair. After a short while, his wife came there. She prepared the
bed, and going up to him, tried to hand him the letter, saying, “Your father
has asked me to give it to you. “No throw it away,” said <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span>
in irritation. “What harm is there in reading it? Read it, at least for your
father’s sake,” said she, and put the letter in his hand. He just wanted to
glance through it and throw it away, but could not help reading it. There was
nothing special in it. <span class=SpellE>Durga</span> wrote quite innocently,
as if nothing had happened. <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span> threw the
letter away on the table. He opened the Weekly again, but could not continue
it. His mind began to revolve round the incident that happened two years ago.
“What infamy has she brought upon you? What pain she gave you?” <span
class=SpellE>Mahalaxmi</span> was mumbling, when <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span>,
troubled by his own thoughts, asked her to shut up, and threw the magazine on
the table and went to bed. His wife began to press his feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
incident renewed the wound in <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram’s</span> mind. <span
class=SpellE>Durga</span> was not yet married then. Her father had worn out the
proverbial seven pairs of shoes, in looking for a suitable match for her. Owing
to his age and illness, he threw the burden on the shoulders of his only son. <span
class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span> wanted to prove himself a worthy son, by
fulfilling successfully this entrusted duty. At the very first trial, he caught
hold of an engineer who, on enquiry, was found to be his own boyhood friend.
Both the friends had a pleasant time in recollecting their childhood. At the
right moment, <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span> revealed the purpose of his
visit to him. His friend readily agreed to his proposal and came with his
mother to see the bride. He was thoroughly satisfied with <span class=SpellE>Durga</span>.
He and his mother discussed about other matters. <span class=SpellE>Durga</span>
was bewitchingly beautiful, and more than that, <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span>
was his old friend, and so his mother could not ask more than five thousand as
dowry. <span class=SpellE>Durga</span> being his only sister, and the
bridegroom, his friend, being also an engineer, <span class=SpellE>Veerabhadram</span>
did not feel it too much. His parents too felt in the same way “</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fix
up the ‘<span class=SpellE>muhurtam</span>’ and inform us,” said the bridegroom
and his mother, and went away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the marriage of his sister in a befitting manner. He was pleased with himself
for having fixed up such a high match. But scarcely a week had passed, when one
day <span class=SpellE>Durga</span> approached her brother, possibly to tell
him something. He was about to taunt her playfully, when he stopped on seeing
the expression on her face. He had never seen her look so seriously as then.
“What is it, <span class=SpellE>Durga</span>?” he asked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

startled, and for the first time, he was somewhat confused. He picked up the
daily paper, but could not concentrate on it. But the past incident and the
humiliation he suffered in those days, came back before his mind, and stirred
afresh his anger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

into his room and sat in the chair. <span class=SpellE>Durga</span> came in to
take leave of her brother. She bent down and touched his feet. Two drops of hot
tears fell on his feet. <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span> was startled. <span
class=SpellE>Durga</span> went out. But he sat rooted to his spot. As he was
thinking, with his head bent forward, two drops of tears fell on his fingers.
They were from his own eyes! He was surprised at himself. He wiped away the
tears. While doing so, he noticed, the small scar on the fore-finger of his
right hand. Suddenly something stirred in his memory. Long ago, in his
childhood, when he was only twelve, and <span class=SpellE>Durga</span> was
seven, they were playing together, when <span class=SpellE>Durga</span>
suddenly threw a toy-train at him. It struck his finger and soon blood came
out. Seeing the blood, <span class=SpellE>Durga</span> was alarmed. “Oh! you
are hurt! Please do not tell mother, <span class=SpellE>Annayya</span>! I shall
dress up the wound.” So saying, she brought a wet piece of cloth and bandaged
his finger. Their mother saw the bandage, and learning that <span class=SpellE>Durga</span>
was the culprit, wanted to beat her. But <span class=SpellE>Virabhadram</span>
stopped her. Later, when it was difficult for him even to take food, <span
class=SpellE>Durga</span> mixed the food for him and put it in his mouth with
her tiny fingers. And what pranks did she play then! She was such a naughty and
mischievous girl. How fond he himself was of her! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“Stop! <span class=SpellE>Durga</span>! Don’t go now. You must not go now. I

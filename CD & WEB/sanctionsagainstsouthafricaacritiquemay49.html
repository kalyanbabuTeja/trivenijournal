accelerated pace since Dr. D. F. Malan became the Prime Minister. The tension
between India and South Africa, which has been steadily mounting, is now
nearing the climax. It is reported that India would make an all-out effort at
the forthcoming session of the United Nations to clinch the matter finally. It

is hardly necessary to repeat here the many and humiliating disabilities of
Indians in South Africa and the justice of their plea. Even in the worst days
of British imperialism in India there was no difference of opinion between the
Government of India and the most ardent Indian nationalists on this question.
Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Linlithgow were on the same side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Since then the position of Indians in South Africa
has worsened. The Asiatic Land Tenure and Representation Act, which was enacted
by the Government of General Smuts in 1946, gave communal political franchise
to Indians to elect five Europeans as their representatives to the South
African Parliament. This provision has been repealed by the Government of Dr.
Malan. Racial segregation has recently been extended in the Cape Province, and
it is proposed to investigate Indian ‘penetration’ in the Province in order to
stop it. Residential and other segregations in other provinces are being enforced
more rigorously and ruthlessly. Family pensions, pensions for the old, disabled
and destitute, and maternity grants and children’s allowances to Indians have
been stopped. Indians are being thrown out of employment and boycotted. Greater
inducements are being offered to encourage Indians to leave South Africa, with
a view to reducing the Indian population in the Union, though over ninety per
cent of them were born in the country, and the whole Indian community is a
small, almost microscopic, minority in the country.</p>

righteous indignation against the humiliations and disabilities, and in despair
of amicable and honourable settlement by direct negotiation, India and the
Indians in South Africa launched on a policy of sanctions. The Indians in South
Africa adopted two sanctions against the South African Government. They
embarked on <i>Satyagraha </i>or non-violent direct action, and they made
common cause with the Africans and formed a non-European Front. They have not,
however, succeeded in their primary objective which was to improve the lot of
Indians. Instead, they have hardened the South African Government against
Indians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

resorted to two sanctions against South Africa. She adopted the policy of

trade sanctions against her and withdrew the Indian High Commissioner from
South Africa. Then, she took up the dispute to the forum of the United Nations

in 1943, the South African Government of Gen. Smuts enacted the Trading and
Occupation (Transvaal and Natal) Restrictions Act, extending the duration of
certain restrictions against Indians in the Transvaal and also introducing them
for the first time in Natal, there was a great agitation among Indians in South
Africa which was echoed in India. Indignation rose to white heat, and feelings
ran high. Insistent demands were made that India should pay South Africa in her
own coin, apply economic sanctions and withdraw the Indian High Commissioner
from South Africa. So great and persistent was the demand that the Government
of India under Lord Wavell was persuaded by Dr. N. B. Khare, then in charge of
the Commonwealth Relations Department, to enact the Reciprocity Act of 1943,
notwithstanding that the World War II was still on and India and South Africa
were members of the British Commonwealth and companions-in-arms against Germany
and Japan. The Act imposed on South African nationals of non-Indian origin
disabilities reciprocal to those imposed on Indians in South Africa in respect
to franchise rights and entry, and acquisition and occupation of fixed property
in India. Subsequently, in 1946, trade between India and South Africa was
banned, and the Indian High Commissioner was recalled. Of direct sanctions
against South Africa, India shot her last </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
was expected of the policy of sanction, particularly of trade and economic
sanctions, to redress the grievances of Indians in South Africa. Such competent
authorities as Swami Bhavani Dayal Sanyasi, Mr. Mahomed Ahmed Jadwat and Dr.
Lanka Sundaram had issued a memorandum in 1944, in which they expressed their
confidence that the enforcment of economic sanctions would be effective and
remedy Indian grievances in South Africa. They urged that India, which had </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
growing favourable balance of trade with South Africa, should not hesitate to
sacrifice it. Only a small fraction of the trade between the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>two
countries was in the hands of Indians and they would cheerfully forego it.
South African Indians would not mind the stoppage of the import of rice from
India for their consumption. Nor would India suffer from the stoppage of the
import of wattle products from South Africa. Swami Bhavani Dayal and friends
had no doubts regarding the desirability, the feasibility and the effectiveness
of economic sanctions against South Africa. They recalled the success of the
Indian boycott of the clove trade in Zanzibar, and asserted that “trade and
economic sanctions are the best and surest measure which India can adopt to
bring South Africa to her knees.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

purposeless and detrimental to the interest of our own people...We strongly

the 23rd March 1949, in reply to an interpellation of Mr. L. N. Sahu in the
Indian Parliament, the Government of India said that they did not propose to
reconsider the policy of trade sanctions! To vindicate the self-respect of
India, sanctions were invoked, and now no self-respecting Indian can be happy
with the outcome. The Government of India is not in a position to emulate the
Swamiji–admit defeat and reconsider. Meanwhile Indians in South Africa suffer
not only because of South Africa but because of India too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

respect to franchise, entry, and acquisition and occupation of fixed </span><span

etc. It would be interesting to know how for this Act has been effective, how
many South African whites have been denied the franchise, and how many were
permitted to acquire and occupy fixed property in segregated areas in India. As
regards the right of entry, the Government of India stated on the 23rd March
1949, in reply to Mr. L. N. Sahu’s interpellation in the Indian Parliament,
that 119 applications had been received and 103 were allowed and 11 rejected.
Admissions seem to be the rule and rejection the exception! Retaliation has not
been a conspicuous success either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

passing, it may be mentioned that the Rev. Satchell, a South African national
of non-Indian origin, recently arrived in Bombay from South Africa to work in
the Christa Seva Sangh, Poona. The Bishop of Bombay, who was to receive him on
landing, arrived a little too late. In the meantime, the Bombay Police, as in
duty bound under the Reciprocity Act, had marched Mr. Satchell to the Police
Station! They released him when the Bishop arrived and completed the due
formalities. It was discovered later that the Rev. Satchell had been a
life-long friend of the Indians in South Africa, had joined the Indian <i>Satyagraha
</i>against the Government of South Africa and had actually gone to jail in
defence of the self-respect of Indians in South Africa!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

another exhibition of her righteous displeasure against South Africa, India
recalled her High Commissioner in South Africa in 1946. It was a great
diplomatic triumph for India that so far back as 1926, when she was still a
subject country, South Africa should herself, as part of the Cape Town
Agreement, request India to send an Indian representative to South Africa, when
even the Crown Colonies, not to speak of the other Dominions, turned down the
request of India to send her representatives to them. Of the great usefulness
of the Indian representative, there were no two opinions. The recall of the
Indian High Commissioner was most deplorable. Diplomatic representatives are
generally recalled only on the declaration of war, and not when there is only a
diplomatic war of words. For some years now there has been no love lost between
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. Though they are fighting a diplomatic war of words
at the level of their Foreign Ministers and also in the form of the United
Nations, they have not yet recalled their ambassadors. India could have carried
on her campaign against South Africa at the United Nations, and yet retained
her High Commissioner in South Africa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had a chance in 1947 to rectify her rash blunder with grace when Gen. Smuts
repeatedly requested that the High Commissioner should resume his interrupted
office in South Africa. In his letter to Pandit Nehru, dated April 28, 1947,
Gen. Smuts first suggested that the Indian High Commissioner should return to
South Africa to act as the “natural and obvious medium of exchange” of views
between the two countries. Again, in his letter of June 18, 1947, Gen. Smuts
said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(the Union Government) accordingly urge once more that the Indian High
Commissioner should be sent back, in spite of objections to such a course
stated in your letter under reply. It may be pointed out that this is the
proper course under international practice and under the circumstances
connected with the departure of Mr. Deshmukh. It was not a rupture of relations
between Governments but simply a recall of the High Commissioner to report to
his Government, while his office and staff remained to function as before...
Technically we are on the footing of friendly Governments, and the Union
Government are anxious to treat the Indian Government on that footing.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seasoned diplomat that he is, Gen. Smuts refused to take seriously India’s
umbrage, did not consider it <i>infra dig </i>to request the return of the High
Commissioner, and patted her as a friendly country” in spite of India’s hostile
provocations. India would have done better if she had accepted the invitation
and sent an Indian High Commissioner. Instead, India insisted that unless and
until South Africa accepted the implied censure of the United Nations, she
would not resume direct diplomatic relations with South Africa. And now that
Dr. Malan has succeeded Gen. Smuts, there is less prospect of South Africa
repeating the request. India cannot now take the first step without loss of
dignity. Even if she did, it is very likely that she will be rebuffed by Dr.
Malan, if<i> </i>only for the reason that the UNO is seized of the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second sanction that India applied to South Africa was to bring up the question
at the United Nations. On the 8th December 1946, the General Assembly stated
that because of the treatment of Indians in South Africa, the friendly
relations between two member-States, namely, India and South Africa, had been
impaired and were likely to be further impaired unless a satisfactory settlement
was reached. It expressed the opinion that the treatment of Indians in South
Africa should be in conformity with the international obligations under the
agreements between the two countries and the relevant provisions of the U. N.
Charter. It, therefore, requested the two Governments to report at the next
session of the Assembly the measures taken to that effect. The Resolution was

majority needed to make it valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

India reported the matter to the UN in 1947. The Political Committee of the UN,

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At the United Nations, India accused South Africa of
having violated both the Cape Town Agreement and the UN Charter. In trying to
make her cause doubly sure, India lost more than she gained. For, if she won
her case with reference to the Cape Town Agreement, Indians in South Africa
would have been as well off as under the UN Charter. The UN Charter of equal
rights irrespective of race, etc., is of general application. South Africa was
not alone in violating it, nor did he violate it with respect to Indians only.
In accusing South Africa of violating the Charter, India put in the dock, as it
were, not only South Africa, but also the United Kingdom and the United States
of America and the British Dominions! South Africa was not slow to seek
security in the multiplicity of the accused. She was also able to urge, though
unsuccessfully, the plea that the question of Indians in South Africa was a
‘domestic’ issue outside the competence of the United Nations. </p>

Africa with respect to her treatment of South African Negroes; she did not
include in the charge the U.K. and the U.S.A. for their discriminatory
treatment of their non-white peoples. India did not take a high moral and

the bride’s party, as it were, while South Africa belongs to the bridegroom’s
party, to use a homely Indian analogy. There are over 250,000 Indians in South
Africa who are being discriminated against by the South African Government.
Like the Indian bride, they have to stay at the mother-in-law’s house, however
badly treated, but cannot return to the mother’s house. The Indians in South
Africa will not come to India, notwithstanding their bad treatment by South
Africa and not withstanding that South Africa wants to send them out, and is
willing to pay them to get out. They will not leave South Africa because most
of them were born in that country, and also because they are economically
better off in South Africa than they would be if they came to India. For good
or evil, Indians must and will stay in South Africa. There are no appreciable
number of South African whites in India whom India could use as a lever to
secure better treatment for Indians in South Africa. All that the bride’s
parents can, therefore, do is to persuade the mother-in-law to be gentler to
their daughter. All that India can do to help Indians in South Africa is to
persuade South Africa to act in conformity with the Cape Town Agreement. If
such a plea will not do much good, it will not do much harm. At any rate, India
will not have contributed to the worsening of the position of Indians in South

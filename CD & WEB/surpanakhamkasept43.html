mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was the third of July, 1942 the wet, very wet
July. I happened to be in my native village on family business. It was the last
day of the <i>Kuttu </i>in the local temple, and the <i>Kutiyattam </i>final was
to be staged that night. The scene proposed was the <i>Surpanakhamka </i>a
scene from the <i>Ascaryachudamani </i>of Saktibhadra, the earliest South
Indian to write Sanskrit Drama. The opportunity was too tempting to be missed
and so despite a heavy day, despite a bleak and rainy night, and despite the
prospect of standing half-naked throughout the night–for shirts are not allowed
inside the temple theatre–I got ready and accompanied by a few friends
proceeded to the temple, which we reached just a couple of minutes before the
play started.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was the same old theatre, where, during our
school-days, we had for the mere fun of it spent many similar nights without,
however, under standing much of what was taking place on the stage. The
conditions the theatre were exactly what they were, when I last witnessed a
performance there in July 1935; the same grand, but it kept, theatre, the same
familiar, but dirty, seating arrangements of a graded sort–Brahmins squatting
down on the raised flat in front of the stage and the other caste Hindus
standing on the three sides, some leaning on the pillars and others sitting in
the shadow thereof–the same feeble, apparently feeble, lighting, the same
musical accoutrements, and, what was most surprising, the same set of actors,
the principal one being kind enough to come out of green room and greet me. As
usual on such occasions there was attempt at decorating the stage–the corners
with plantains, bearing clusters of fruits, the sides with green leaves, and
the floor of the stage with geometrical designs, made of rice flour paste. The
usual instrumental music of the <i>Milavu </i>worked by a <i>Nambiyar</i>, who
sat within a railed enclosure at the back of the stage, and of the cymbal,
sounded by a <i>Nannayar </i>who sat on a mat on the floor of the stage to the
right of and at right angles to the actors, was enhanced on the occasion by the
addition of a drummer, sounding his <i>Itakha</i>, who stood at the back of the
stage in a line with the <i>Nambiyar</i>, and a bugler of a stripling lad who
stood back side, but below the stage on the floor. The first coming in of the
principal characters was marked by the presence of an improvised curtain,
behind which they performed what is termed <i>Maravilekriya</i>,–some
conventional stepping and flouncings, as the orthodox dramaturgical ritual
demanded, which it appeared to us, could well have been done in front of the
curtain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The actual acting began just a little after 10 p.m.
The piece staged was familiar to the whole orthodox people–the ravishing of
Rama by Surpanakha. The scene opens with the appearance of Rama, the hero of
the piece, who gives a picture of the happy life he is leading at Pancavati on
the banks of the Godaveri. This is termed <i>Nirvahana</i>, during which he
incidentally refers to the baseless nature of the sages’ warning, regarding the
presence of Rakshasas and Rakshasis in the region. This serves as an excellent
introduction to the audience to tune themselves up to the context of the story.
As Rama dilates on the perfect poise and happiness of his new life in those glorious
surroundings, Surpanakha enters in the garb of a siren of ravishing beauty and
makes love to him. Rama very courteously says that he is a married man living
with his wife under a vow of <i>Brahmacarya </i>and so directs her to his
brother Lakshmana. The scene with Lakshmana is not shown on the stage, but the
siren is disappointed and so returns to Rama to be sent back again to his
brother to be again refused and repulsed. Insulted by this continued rebuff,
the indignant Surpanakha decides upon abducting Lakshmana. Then the two enter
the stage, Surpanakha in her real demoniac form, the one dodging the other, and
finally the monstress catches hold of the prince and rushes away. Now Rama
enters the stage, presses his sorrow and anxiety, regarding his brother’s fate,
and wishes rush forward for his help. But Sita–this character does not appear
on the stage–pleads that she should not be left alone; Rama is now in a serious
dilemma. In the bitterness of his poignant sorrow he feels the utility of his
strength and sheds bitter tears. Happily, then, he sees his brother Lakshmana,
rushing backwards to him, his sword dripping in blood. He has wreaked vengeance
on the terrible she-monster for her wickedness cutting off her nose and ears,
instead of killing her, which is prohibited <i>Sastras</i>. Rama feels elated
and happy. But the happiness is soon broken, for terrific screams and wailing’s
reach their ears, and before the disfigured monster, bathed in blood and
swaying to and fro in anger and pain, slowly makes her way towards the
brothers. This forms most impressive and imposing part of the representation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The struggle between Suranakha and Lakshmana is not
shown on the stage. The former makes her exit from the theater by a back door
and proceeds to the southern <i>Nata </i>of the temple, in front of which to
the right stands–the theatre with its main entrances north and south. The weird
figure starts back to the theatre from there in a procession lit up by the
lurid glow of torch lights, every now and then set blaze by resin powder, and
announced by her own piercing screams and wails, which touch the chord of fear
in the on-looker. It does not enter through the main door, but through a side
entrance set in the west, facing the stage; it jumps; as if it were, into the
theatre, passes slowly enough through the very midst of the audience, seated on
the raised flat, and, reaching the stage, falls prostrate, in pain and
exhaustion, before the wondering brothers. In sheer disgust the brothers fall
back apace; their suspicions are now confirmed: they reqognise Surpanakha and
naturally are not sorry for the action taken. The revolting figure, then, tells
them in howling accents that she has mighty brothers who would not leave
unavenged the insult and injury done to her and that they shall thereafter know
no peace in their life. Very truly, no doubt, was the prophecy fulfilled. Then
the monster disappears into the green-room; and the two brothers, buckling up
for anything that the future may bring them, also leave the stage. Thus concludes
the ghastly scene which for emotional effect has few parallels on our stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

orthodox stage traditions, for the limitations of time and place, and for the
antique character of the stage equipments, the costume and make-up of the
characters and the mode of acting, the performance must, on the whole, be
pronounced to be a success: it is an unqualified success, if it is to be
measured in terms of Rasa delineation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The costume and make up of the characters that
appear on stage may now be noticed. Four characters appear on the stage: Rama
and Lakshmana and Surpanakha, first in the garb of a siren and then in her real
demoniac form. Sita plays a minor part and does not appear on the stage, in
this case probably as a matter of character economy. But it deserves to be
pointed out that even when she has a major part to play, this character never
appears on the stage: that, it is reported, is the running tradition of the
local stage. This is an important aspect, but the actors are not able to give
any explanation for this. The costume make-up of Rama and Lakshmana are alike.
The face is painted green which is given a white border with rice flour about a
third of an inch width. Black unquent is applied to the lashes and the eye-lids
are pencilled dark, while the eyes themselves are reddened. The lips are
painted deep red, and the ears are adorned with <i>kundalas </i>below and <i>cevikkuttu
</i>above, the latter representing Sirisa flower, as our actors would have it.
The head carries a two-piece head-gear, called in the local vernacular <i>Kolappura-kkettu</i>–literally
the tank-shed build, so called from its shape. It is composed of two circular
discs, each a foot in diameter, set horizontal-wise over a tight-fitting cap.
The front piece which has peacock feathers stuck into it rises about a third of
its area gracefully over the forehead, the front being decked with glass pieces
of varied hues, the whole looking like a diadem. The back disc is attached to
the front one above the crown of the head and comes down over the nape of the
neck, when the head is held erect. This head-dress which is the type prescribed
for all heroes probably imitates a helmet; it is not an erect crown, adding to
stature; but a flattened coronet, giving solidity to the character. In any
case, the head-dress sits well on the character. The arms are left bare, except
for sandal paste and <i>Keyuras </i>at the wrists and epaulettes at the
shoulders. The body has a jacket of red colour–this is the colour
prescribed–with horizontal dark stripes, and over it was worn what purports to
be a necklace–a stiff one, carrying metallic discs, called <i>Polambu</i>.
There was the inevitable <i>Channa-vira</i>, held in front by a protruding
metallic disc and over the shoulders was thrown a single <i>Uttariya </i>as
well as a garland, the latter being made of red-cloth in the case of Rama and
of <i>Chetti </i>flowers in he case of Lakshmana. Over the knickers are worn a
skirt of thick cotton. The flounces behind about the buttocks imitating
wave-crests, while in front hangs a triangular piece of coloured cotton scarf,
known a <i>Katisutra</i>. The legs are bare but for sandal paste and no anklets
are worn, possibly because in this case there are no flouncing movements of
legs and dance. Such, in brief, is the nature of the costume and make up of the
two male characters that appear on the stage. One must necessarily admit that
the facial get-up and head-dress are designed with a view to aid facial
expression of the varied emotions and are, indeed, artistic enough to please the
eye, while the flounces behind add grace and dignity to bodily movements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The peculiar feature of the costume of the siren is
the splash of deep ochre colour: the scarf over the head, the facial paint, and
the petticoat all are of the same colour. Such, I am told, is the make up of
all female characters that appear on the temple stage. The deep ochre of the
face is relieved by the dark pencilling of the lashes and eye-lids as well as
by the deep dark spots here and there on the face. Similarly, the ochre colour
of the scarf is relieved by a deep dark border. A petticoat of the same colour
covers the breasts, which is held in position by strings tied together behind.
The ears are adorned by <i>Kundalas</i>, while the hands are left bare, but for
the anchronism of glass bangles, which the actor presumably failed to remove at
the time of dressing. From the waist downwards, it was the usual Malayali
woman’s dress and, naturally enough, for women characters are generally
impersonated by women. One cannot help remarking that the costume and make-up
of the woman characters, as devised by <i>Chakyars</i>, leave much to be
desired. They are neither artistic nor graceful in any sense of the term, and
we cannot help expressing the opinion that it was thoroughly disappointing,
however much it might have been in consonance with local stage traditions. One
is here reminded of the ancient poet’s statement, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>puranamityeva na sadhu sarvam</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>On an entirely different plane and in striking
contrast to this was the make-up of Surpanakha in her demoniac form. It was a
rolling mass of dark, deep dark colour from head to toe, the blackness of the
face being relieved by white <i>Trisula </i>marks and the exceeding reddened
lips and mouth which is kept, more often than otherwise, open. The head-dress
has been designed with more than ordinary care. It is made of a particular kind
of grass, known as <i>Nannanam-pullu</i>, which is dull black in colour and
hence forms a happy contrast to the jet black colour of the face and body. The
bottom and top are squares, the lower one being smallest the upper one: thus it
presents four faces, each one being a trapeze in shape. The head-dress is more
than half a foot in height and is adjusted to a tight-fitting cap, while the
inter-space between the grass is sprayed with red and white flowers, which
sparkle in the dim light of the stage. The body is covered by clothes again
deep dark in colour, and about the bosom are held up false breasts, protruding
about a foot. The costume a make-up of this character thus are eminently satisfactory,
both intrinsically and artistically, and it is certainly doubtful if anything
more success could be devised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This character introduces two interesting
variations in our stage tradition. In the first place, this character is
impersonated by a male against the usual rule of women impersonating female
characters; and reason for the violation is said to lie in the fact that the
character has little feminine element, characterizing it. In other words, the
convention actually must have arisen as a result of the part to be played and
violent emotions which sway, and are evoked by, the character. The second
equally important feature that deserves to be noticed is the use of the local
vernacular on the stage, which is also condemned by the local stage conventions,
except in the case of the <i>vidushaka</i>, who presents to the audience a
comic version of the lyric stanzas, sung by the <i>Nayaka</i>. Why should this
character alone of all characters use the local <i>patois </i>is not very
clear? It certainly arises not out of a desire to make the utterance
intelligible to the audience, since this difficulty exist in the case of other
characters also. Even in this scene in the garb of the siren, Surpanakha uses
only the usual <i>Prakrit</i>, as she makes love to Rama. Again, the use of the
local vernacular does not serve any cosmic purpose, for the main sentiment of
the occasion is <i>Bibhatsa </i>and <i>Bhayanaka</i>. And lastly, it deserves
to be pointed out that the character uses the vernacular only in her asides and
comments, but not in the speech directly addressed to the brothers. The only
possible explanation that suggests itself to us for the use of what the <i>Cakyars
</i>call <i>Malayalam Prakrit </i>is to assume that the character is uttering
her thoughts to herself in her own language, i.e. her mother tongue. Malayalam
is a Dravidian language, and in the terminology of philologists, it is the
language of the original Dravidians of the land, to which race belong
Rakshasas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It has already been said that lighting arrangements
in the theatre are of a primitive kind, consisting of a big brass lamp,
carrying wicks all around, fed with coconut oil. But, for that reason, it is
not to be condemned. The lamp lights up the whole area with a suffused light,
and the stage proper has that amount of light essential for lighting up the
costume and the facial expression of the actors, but not more than enough. And
this, be it noticed, forms an adequate measure of protection. It is interesting
to point out that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pitham</i>, on
which the main characters sit and which serves as the throne or couch or seat,
is slightly higher than the usual seats: its height is adjusted to the height
of the lamp, so that, when a character sits on it, the light of the lamp falls
directly on the face. It appears that a better system of lighting cannot be
introduced on the orthodox stage, if the rigid conventions of costume and
make-up are to be kept up intact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is as usual the happy combination of bodily movements, facial expression, gesture
language and recitation, designed to give full and adequate expression to the
theme and emotions of the play; and these to some extent compensate for the
primitive nature of the representation, in so far as modern critics are
concerned. There is, however, a large element of the conventional in them, and
the result is that the action appeals only to a select circle. For, as matters
now stand, facial expression and gesture languages are lost upon the present
day audience, who are presumably satisfied with the realistic representation of
the story. This attitude probably accounts for the popularity of <i>Kutiyattam </i>even
today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The piece enacted is a small one, and yet the
action runs from 10 P.M. to5 A.M. that is nearly seven hours. There is
certainly no relation between the story staged and the time taken. This,
however, is the result of the <i>modus operandi</i>. As our stage convention
would have it, every sentence or statement undergoes a three-fold
representation–first <i>Angika, </i>then <i>Vacika </i>side by side with <i>Angika
</i>and then <i>Angika</i>. Since the representation has its appeal restricted
only to a select circle, this triad representation may well be avoided, though
possibly it was originally introduced to get over the difficulty of appealing
to the audience through the medium of Sanskrit language. This aspect apart, the
order of procedure could be improved, as it strikes us. The <i>Vacika-angika </i>mode
could well have preceded the <i>anigika </i>mode, for that would have put the
hearer in touch with the theme. Here also possibly the existing order may have
resulted from the difficult of language. Coming to the <i>Vacika-angika </i>mode,
one feature deserves to be condemned: the recitation has been long drawn out,
and it strikes one as being quite unnatural. Presumably it has had to be drawn
out, so that the <i>Vacika </i>expression might chime with the <i>Angika</i>.
This drawing out of the syllables and words of the text produces a very awkward
impression on the listener: it is literally murdering language, as musicians
very often do. This feeling persists, despite the fact that the angika
representation has been very graceful. I have, had occasion to discuss the
matter with the chief actor. He agrees with me that the recitation, as it now
obtains, is bad enough, but he is of opinion that it was due to lack of <i>laghava
</i>on the part of the actor in so as <i>Angikabhinaya </i>is concerned and of
training in the musical intonation of the verses. If the verses are to be
recited in the <i>Ragas </i>prescribed for them, this feeling would not creep
in, but unfortunately, he added, the present actors do not care to acquire
proficiency in either. The present day recitals may or may not be technically
correct, but they certainly are void of all musical quality: that is how it
strikes a layman. The actors can and should introduce more and more music into
their recitals. The introduction some real musical element and the cutting down
of the time of representation seem to be essential if the art is to be made
more appealing, if the art has to be revitalised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>There seems to run throughout the whole performance
one defect, and that lies in the attitude of the actors themselves and the
audience with reference to the show. The latter takes to it as a matter of mere
fun and frolic–as an opportunity to escape from the humdrum of every day life.
This attitude may not deserve so much of condemnation, particularly because the
action has its appeal only to a select circle of people. The former takes the
performance as a matter of votive offering, which they have to perform in lieu
of certain perquisites they have been receiving from the temple from times of
yore–a votive offering made in all good faith, albeit without any interest,
much less artistic interest. The actors conduct themselves as mere automatons
most mechanically, and human interest and human touch seem to be wanting
everywhere with, however, one honourable exception–the chief actor’s
impersonation of Surpanakha in her real garb. One would certainly wish that the
performance was a little more <i>human </i>and that the actors showed more human
interest in what they were acting. It seems a pity that they take so little
interest in the exquisite art, of which they and none else are the chief
custodians; and indeed, there is nothing from which art suffers more than from
the indifference of the artists themselves. True it is that they have simple
justification for their attitude–the general lack of encouragement and
appreciation, why, the lack of even an enlightened audience: but it must be
pointed out that a scholarly appreciation of their art is impossible so long as
they confine their art to within the four walls of a sacred temple, which
denies access to the general public. In any case, something more is possible,
if the actors themselves are prepared to move a little forward even within the
limits that a rigid convention has imposed upon them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We have in the preceding pages described the local
acting of the <i>Surpanakhamka</i>, as we saw it and as we felt about it. What
is the artistic value of the representation? This is a question that I asked
myself as I returned home in the small hours of the morning,–indeed an
important question, particularly because in <i>Kutiyattam </i>is preserved for
us the earliest form of dramatic expression we have available in the whole of
India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The answer to this question, however, depends upon
how we interpret the nature and value of artistic expression. Fine arts, we
hold, transfer to and re-create in the critic, through the help of a specific
medium, the emotions experienced by the artist. The artist may or may not in all
cases be conscious of the communicative value of his expression, but, in so far
as the dramatist is concerned, he is fully and acutely conscious of the
communicative value of his expression. The choice of the medium of expression
is decided by the genius of the artist: he may choose language, stone, canvass
or his physical body, and, according as the medium differs, the sensory organ
appealed to also differs. Emotion is aroused by an appeal to one or other of
the sensory organs, and, the greater the number of organs, appealed to, the
greater and the more successful is the appeal. Of the varied organs of sense,
the sense of touch and smell and taste do not generally come within the purview
of fine arts generally, whether of expression or reception. These have their
appeal to the other two organs of sense, the sense of hearing and of sight.
Some arts appeal only to the sense of hearing, others only to the sense of
sight, while still others appeal both to the sense of hearing and of sight.
Drama belongs to the last category, and in this respect it stands superior to
other arts. Whatever the medium chosen and whatever the sensory organ appealed
to, the artist’s expression is conditioned by the conventions and the technique
of expression in that particular medium. Thus, in the realm of poetry, the poet
is a victim to the theories of poetry, even if it be only to a certain extent.
Similarly, the dramatist is a slave to the theory and practice of dramaturgy;
and his art is further conditioned by the equipment of the stage for which and
the standard of culture of the people for whom he intends his work of art. Thus
every variety of art has certain restrictions imposed upon it on the creative
side. It is equally restricted on the receptive side: for a knowledge of the
technique through which and the limitations under which the artist works and
expresses himself is essential for the critic, if he would have the artist’s
experiences transferred a recreated in him in any really appreciable measure.
Thus every variety of art-expression is restricted both on the expressive side
and on the receptive side. And, consequently, art has its appeal always limited
to select circle: it appeals only to the <i>Sahrdaya</i>–one who has proper
training in the art and its technique and who, by continued practice, can tune
up his mind to receive the artist’s experiences conveyed in that particular
mode of expression. And this, be it noted, is especially true of dramatic
expression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>With a view to make his expression as complete and
rich and wide as possible, the dramatist introduces certain adventitious aids
in furtherance of his expression. Thus, he makes his characters re-live in
flesh and blood, their costume and make-up suggesting their rank in life, their
outlook on life, their dominant trait of character, and their greatness and
nobility or their depravity and meanness. He introduces music and dance to
render pleasing the communicativeness of the activity. And, lastly, he
magnifies expression of ideas and emotions by a three-fold repetition–by the
language of poetry, by the language of gestures and by the movements of face
and body. With these aids he tries, and that successfully, to make his art
appeal to the eyes and ears simultaneously, though at the same time, this
method tends to curb the play of the imagination on the part of the critic; for
it converts the ideal into the real, and in all such conversion there is
curtailment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Against this theoretical background we may view the
staging of the <i>Surpanakhamka</i>. Here was a representation of one incident
in the life of Rama, as the poet conceived it. Three characters appeared on the
scene who re-lived their lives. Their dress and make-up, their actions and
activities, their ideas and ideals, their outlook on life–all these are shaped
by the artist, who is conditioned by the traditions and conventions of the
local stage-art handed down from a remote antiquity and continued even today in
more or less the same primitive form. And the life they are made to re-live is
not the usual one: like everything else on the stage it is unreal, non-normal <i>alaukika.
</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Again, their ideas and emotions are
expressed in a two-fold way. The ideas are first expressed in the language of
poetry and then again in the language of gestures, and the emotions, first by
facial expression and then by bodily movements; and both these are later
emphasised and magnified by the repetition of the words, the set against an <i>alaukika</i>
background. The different modes of expression of the ideas and emotions, <i>which
stand in the relation of cause and effect </i>usually not noticed, at least not
realised as such, re-create in the <i>Sahrdaya </i>emotional experiences,
similar in kind to those originally experienced by the artist himself, and he
becomes steeped in pleasure, in ecstatic bliss of the successful blending into
a unified whole of the different media of language and of gestures of face and
of body, into one expression, which combines in it the music of voice and the
grace of movement, all set in the world of the stage. Divorced from the everyday
realities of life, each one of these is in itself a source of pleasure, of
course with an intellectual bias, and their successful blending produces
emotional or aesthetic bliss–in which process the intellectual element recedes
into the background: but at the same time its presence in the background
prevents the recreated emotional experience from losing itself in sensuous
indecision. The value of this emotional experience is enhanced by the fact that
here there is a process of edification, for emotional experiences tend to
purify the emotions by the process of <i>catharsis</i>, as it is termed in the
west, or <i>Sadharanikarana</i>, as it is known among Indian <i>Alamkarikas</i>.
And, indeed, in this particular case, the process of recreation has been
rendered much easier, since the representation has been hung on to a <i>Pauranik
</i>incident, well-known to the audience; and this enables them to concentrate
better on the art of the artist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>If then, from the final unity of the impressions
produced and one’s responses to the same, one may generalise <i>Kutiyattam </i>immerses
the audience in pleasure by the process of recreating in them certain
experiences of an emotional character by the presentation in time and space of
a dramatised version of <i>Pauranik </i>incident in a garb and form that is non-normal
and for that reason more pleasing to the Hindu audience. This pleasure is <i>intellectual
</i>in character to those who are not well trained in the <i>modus operandi </i>of
the local stage and the local technique of the professional actor; but it
becomes raised up to the <i>emotional </i>to those who are well-versed therein.
And, indeed, this judgment cannot be too wrong for every work of art is a
particular case and has to be judged as such. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We shall not better conclude this short notice than
with a reference, to <i>Kathakali</i>. Even a cursory glance would convince one
that the make-up and costume of the <i>Kathakali </i>actor are based upon the
simple mode of the <i>Cakyars</i>, only it has been made more impressive and,
if we may say so more ponderous. The facial get-up has been made very complex
by the addition of white paints in <i>relievo </i>and of knobs to emphasise the
dominant traits of the various casts of characters; and this has been rendered
possible since the <i>Kathakali </i>actor has not to open his mouth. The head
gear which of the standing erect type, as compared with that of the <i>Cakyar</i>,
adds certainly to the stature of the character and has been necessitated by the
facial get-up. The costume and ornamentation have been considerably increase to
make up for the increased stature, though one might suspect that wealth and
richness of the same probably hamper free movements. The skirt of the <i>Kathakali
</i>actor is no doubt more attractive and afford better scope for flouncings,
and this is naturally essential in view of the larger element of bodily
movements in the art-expression of the <i>Kathakali </i>actor, while the use of
the silver nails on the fingers adds greatly to the grace and beauty of the
gestures. On the whole, the costume and get-up of <i>Kathakali </i>actor better
capture the attention of the audience. As compared with this, those of the <i>Cakyar
</i>is much simpler and less conventional. Naturally, the former involves
greater physical strain for the actors, and hence we find certain innovations
made to minimise it, chiefly in the development of the musical accoutrements.
In the <i>modus operandi </i>also there is a specific difference. The <i>Kathakali
</i>actor never opens his mouth except to utter his war-cry, and he naturally
cannot open his mouth on account of the larger element of facial make-up–paints
in <i>relievo</i>, borders and knobs. As a result, all linguistic expression is
done by the musician and, because he is a professional, it is done in a musical
way. The actor confines himself to the expression of ideas and of emotions. The
former he does by means of the gesture language and the latter by facial
expression and flouncing steps and bodily movements; and these have been
naturally elaborated. The language of the hands he was considerably improved,
rather magnified, by the introduction of symbols for nicer and finer shades of
meaning and the extension of the space within which his hand poses work. His
hand poses which extend to the area within his extended arms, instead of the
elbow limits, and the dropping out of the <i>pratyayas, i. e., </i>conjugational
and inflectional terminations, these have helped him to keep pace with the
musician’s musical recital of the poetry of the drama. The elaborate
ornamentation of the face, which is different for different primary emotions,
helps emotional expression by the face to a greater degree. Hence the blending
of expression, both of ideas and of emotions, has been magnified, not by
repetition but by extension and elaboration, and this has helped the
re-creation of the emotional experiences in the audience to a greater degree.
Thus in <i>Kathakali </i>we find a deliberate attempt to make the stage more
and more pealing to a wider circle of audience, to lift the art from the select
circle the orthodox and make it more entertaining and popular. And this has
been rendered easier, since the language has been simplified to some extent by
fusing Sanskrit and Malayalam into the happy blend or alloy, called <i>Manipravalam</i>.
The progress of the art has been so phenomenal the first hundred years of its
existence that, in due course, this became more conventionalised than even <i>Kutiyattam
</i>and would have become bracketed with it, but for the new lease of life
given to it by the <i>Kerala Kalamandalam </i>under the lead of our great
national poet-critic-artist, Vallathol. It is to be hoped that <i>Kutiyattam </i>also
will ere long be lifted out of its narrow groove and exclusive environments and
made to claim its rightful place among the sister arts of the land. May that
day dawn in the nearer, than in the remote, future is the prayer of the writer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

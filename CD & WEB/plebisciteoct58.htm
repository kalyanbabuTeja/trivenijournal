is a most significant method adopted for the <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span>
of states as well as governments, for the abolition of an existing system or
for the creation of a new system. It has been commonly held as an ultra-democratic
device and a means for the expression of popular sovereignty. Strange as it may
appear, the plebiscite method has been hailed and adopted as an instrument of
decision by democrats as well as dictators. A historical investigation of its
results reveals that it enabled the creation of democratic states and also
placed dictators in power; it was instrumental for the creation of Republics as
well as Empires. Plebiscite thus acted as a two-edged sword and has done good
and bad alike. Its results depended largely on the political climate under
which it was put into operation. Plebiscite as such can hardly produce good
results, as if by a miracle. The good or the bad results that it produces
depend on the conditions under which it is applied. So it is necessary to view
it only in relation to the time and place of its application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the baffling problems in politics is the absence of precise terminology, the
<span class=GramE>same</span> word being used in different meanings by
different writers and at different times. In the past the word “plebiscite” was
understood as one enacted and established by the plebeian members of the
community and not by the whole body of people. </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The present
usage of the term is borrowed from the French. In </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>modern
politics it means a vote of all the electors in a country or given area taken
on some specific question. It is a device to secure a direct popular vote on
any matter of great political importance, to determine the destiny of a
country. It has further come to mean “a public expression, with or without
binding force, of the wishes or opinion of a community.” So plebiscite is not
legal in its character. “Though not binding, it generally determines the policy
of the government.”<sup>1 </sup>Plebiscite differs from referendum. While the
popular vote under the former may not be legally binding on the government,
under the latter it is binding. Moreover, referendum is concerned with general
legislation while plebiscite is used “for creating a new and more or less
permanent political condition.”<sup> 2</sup> So while referendums may be held
frequently plebiscites are held on few occasions in the history of a country.

them. “The water must be drawn fresh from the spring among the rocks, not from

of the chief problems in politics is the variance between the apparent and the
real. Methods that are most advocated are least <span class=SpellE>practised</span>,
for they appear attractive on paper and prove unworkable in practice.
Plebiscite is one of such. Democracy may prove dangerous if it means direct
decision by the people over complicated and controversial problems. The mass of
voters are unfit to express their views on difficult problems which require
careful study and calm action. The busy ignorant voter possesses neither the
knowledge nor the time to deal with important issues. Democracy in its true
sense should be understood as government of the people under the leadership of
the best and the wisest. Dr. Arnold <span class=SpellE>Toynbee</span> argues
that progress and change are due to the work of “creative individuals” who form
a small minority in society. So for the successful working of democracy we
require right leaders having “vision, moderation, perseverance and patience.”</span><sup><span

participation by the people in the affairs of the state is unsuited to the
modern times. A new ideology is necessary to a new age and the application of
old methods under changed conditions way prove anachronistic and dangerous. In
the present age few problems are purely local in their nature as the
inter-state relations are inextricably interlocked. As politics ceases to be
local in its character, the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>people of a particular locality cannot be
the determinants of the Destiny of the place. For example, in the wider
interests of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> the
people of <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Goa</span></st1:place> cannot
have the liberty of deciding the question of accession. The merger of <span
class=GramE>Foreign</span> settlements like <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Goa</span></st1:place> must be viewed from the administrative and
not purely from the political standpoint. Speaking of the French possessions in
India, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru remarked, “the question of taking a referendum in
three or four villages in the middle of India as to whether they should be in
the Indian Union or not is rather odd, as if three or four villages in the
heart of India or any village in the heart of a country can decide that
international question.”<sup> 8</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
applicability or usefulness of methods like plebiscite <span class=GramE>have</span>
to be judged from the new political forces that have come into prominence. The
20th century is an Age of Propaganda, and political parties are the chief
instrument of propaganda. The parties constitute such a vital organ in the body
politic that the voice of every state today is not so much the voice of the
people as that of the dominant party in the state. Modern governments are only
party governments. In the legislature, party mandate carries greater weight
than public opinion in the enactment of laws. Members in the legislature as
well as the people at large think and act on party lines. As such plebiscite
becomes farcical. It is not public opinion but party opinion that prevails.
While dealing with the methods of direct democracy Mac <span class=SpellE>Iver</span>
observed that every democracy requires and develops a party system, and methods
of direct democracy “are of little avail in respect of questions on which party
lines are already formed.”<sup> 9</sup> Political parties and pressure groups
in a modern state hardly provide an atmosphere for sober thinking and calm
judgment. It is well remarked that “time was when political parties would place
their particular programmes and policies before the public, discuss their
relative merits and ask for a dispassionate verdict. That time is no more. The
present practice is to raise irrelevant and irrational emotions, to appeal to
sub-human collectivist impulses and thus to sway the electorate as a mass, on
the one or the other.”<sup> 10</sup> Under the present system of parties,
plebiscite is a convenient instrument for the party in power to fulfill its
objectives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Prominent
writers on politics today are of the opinion that several of the riddles in
politics can be solved by the application of the psychological clue. The modern
psychological theories of the “group mind” and “mass psychology” necessitate a
revision of the prevailing opinions about the usefulness of methods like
plebiscite. The theory of the “group mind” reveals that the mental working of
an individual as a member, of a group or a crowd is different from that as an
individual person. As an individual, one is amenable to reason, while as a
member of a group he is led away by emotions and instincts. The bigger the
group the greater is the possibility for emotions to prevail. The “general
will” of Rousseau is a theoretical abstraction and what we find in every day
life is not public opinion but public emotions. At the time of the public poll
people are motivated not by reason but by prejudice fear or selfishness. Prof.
Frederick L. <span class=SpellE>Schuman</span> observed that “although the
plebiscite method commends itself to idealists, it is fraught with dangers and
difficulties. Even when adequate neutral policing is provided and satisfactory
suffrage qualifications and electoral procedures are devised, the referendum
itself embitters national feeling, creates temptations to bribery, coercion and
terrorism on both sides and offers no assurance that the voters will record
their permanent national preferences, rather than their fears, prejudices and
economic interests of the moment.”<sup> 11</sup> The common man is at best
capable of choosing a representative; decision over an important problem is beyond
his comprehension. What would be the result of a plebiscite in the southern
states of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S. A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
over the racial question? The decree of the people would certainly be at
variance from the present policy of the Administration. As the people are led
by emotions they decide the same issue at one time in one way and at a
different time in a contrary way. In 1935, by a plebiscite, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region> got the <span class=SpellE>Saar</span>
territory with 90 per cent of the votes in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of
union with <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>, and in
1947 the same <span class=SpellE>Saarlanders</span> voted for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In
March 1925 the dethronement of King George II of Greece was endorsed by a
plebiscite, and in 1935, again by a plebiscite, George II was recalled to the
throne. Plebiscite is only an instrument of the politicians and <span
class=SpellE>partymen</span> to trade on the emotions and passions of the
masses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
plebiscite as a system is of doubtful value, its applicability in a modern
state is not feasible. The machinery of the modern state has become so
complicated that the common man can hardly express an opinion over several of
the problems connected with the state. It may be argued that the mass of people
will have to express an opinion only over general policy and not on
administrative details. The former, it is said, is within their competence. But
in a modern state, even matters of general policy have grown too technical to
be easily understood by the man-in-the-street. For example, how many people can
express a sound opinion over an issue like, “should <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> be a republic or a monarchy?”<sup>
12</sup> People are not only ignorant but also the slaves of sentiment and
tradition. So plebiscite may hamper progress. For example, if a plebiscite was
taken in Orissa over the abolition of the old feudal system, the popular
verdict would have been in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of its retention.
This is amply proved by the success of members belonging to the old feudal
families in the general elections. From this it can be said that plebiscite
will produce good results only under certain conditions–the time of its
application and the nature of the society have to be taken into account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
historical study of plebiscites held at different times, and in different
countries, indicates that they served as a useful instrument for dictators to
come into power. On almost all occasions it resulted in the overthrow of
democracy and the establishment of dictatorship. In 1802 a plebiscite was
conducted in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and it had bestowed the consulate on Bonaparte for life. Napoleon, the child of
the French Revolution, turned into its destroyer. He flouted the ideals of
liberty, equality and fraternity and established a military dictatorship which
was sanctioned by a plebiscite. In 1804 by another plebiscite the office of the
Consul was made hereditary and a change was made in the title of Napoleon as
Emperor. The events during the post-war period (1920-’39) testify to the fact
that plebiscite is a weapon for the dictators to sanctify their actions. In
1933 Hitler held a plebiscite over <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>’s
withdrawal from the <st1:place w:st="on">League of Nations</st1:place> and <span
class=GramE>“ 40½</span> million Germans voted yes and only 2 million voted
no.”<sup> 13</sup> Thus Hitler could undermine the strength of the great
international organisation which was formed to serve as a bastion of peace. In
1928 Mussolini could establish his Fascist dictatorship in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region> by means
of a plebiscite. In the Baltic States, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Latvia</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Estonia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
radical democratic constitutions which had been adopted just after the <span
class=GramE>world war</span> I, were overthrown in 1934 and dictatorships were
established and they were ratified by plebiscites. The Peace Conference of 1919
proposed the taking of 17 plebiscites to settle different national questions,
of which eight were actually held. In several cases the results proved that a
plebiscite was nothing more than a farce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
this it becomes evident that plebiscite by itself does not produce good
results. Nay, under <span class=SpellE>unfavourable</span> conditions it may do
immense harm. So the proposal to hold a plebiscite over the so-called <st1:place
w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> issue has to be viewed in the background of
several factors–political, economic and psychological. On Oct. 23, 1947 the
ruler of Kashmir announced the accession of the State to India and thereby
constitutionally it became a part of the Indian Union. In January 1948 India
made a complaint to the Security Council to check the Pakistan raiders over
Kashmir and this led to the arrival of the U. N. C. I. P.<sup> 14</sup> into
Kashmir. According to the resolution of the U. N. C. I. P., India had to hold a
plebiscite after the total withdrawal of the Pak forces from occupied Kashmir.
But even to this day Pakistan has not satisfied the condition precedent for the
holding of the plebiscite. Nor has the Security Council taken active measures
to remove the illegal occupation by the Pak armies of a part of Kashmir, which
legally forms a part of the Indian Union. Neither Pakistan nor the Security
Council has a constitutional right to ask India to hold the plebiscite; it is
for India to decide it. She made a promise ten years ago under certain
conditions, and now an entirely different situation exists. Plebiscite is not
an academic issue and its value has to be judged with reference to the time,
place and circumstances. An offer cannot go on for generations and forever.
During the last ten years the face of Kashmir has completely been altered by
certain significant developments within and outside Kashmir. The Constitution
prepared by the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir came into force on Jan. 26,
1957, and it ratified the accession of the State to India. It can be said that
the purpose of the plebiscite has already been served, for according to
democratic tradition, the voice of the Constituent Assembly is the voice of the
people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
internal developments make the plebiscite redundant, external conditions have
created a very <span class=SpellE>unfavourable</span> climate for its holding.
An atmosphere of calm and <span class=SpellE>comradery</span> is the condition
precedent for the conduct of any democratic experiment. “Democracy is the child
of peace and it cannot live apart from its mother.”<sup>15</sup> Since the past
ten years Pakistan has been striving to increase her military might so that she
may frighten the <span class=SpellE>Kashmiris</span> and coerce India into
submission. She has also intensified insidious propaganda against India to
rouse the religious passions and emotions of the people in Kashmir. Advocacy of
democratic principles and practice of Fascist methods are only indicative of
hypocritical <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. Plebiscite under popular
passions, in Kashmir or any other part of the world, will produce diabolic
effects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
all democratic methods, plebiscite also requires certain conditions for its
successful operation. In the absence of an educated and enlightened people,
sound judgment on great issues can hardly be possible. An illiterate and
ignorant people can never shoulder heavy responsibilities. Further, democratic
methods generally founder on the rock of popular passions. Dictators like
Hitler and Mussolini could thrive by rousing emotions and passions among their
people and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by creating fear and hatred of other people.
Under such conditions democratic methods like plebiscite only strengthen the
undemocratic forces. Calm consideration and reasoned thinking which form the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>basis
of democracy are an impossibility in an atmosphere surcharged with tensions and
pressures. Conditions of peace and good-will are the <i>sine qua non </i>for a
plebiscite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

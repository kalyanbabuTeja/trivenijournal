Siru, the eldest of the Moolchand brothers, recently tried to commit suicide,
and for reasons that had nothing to do with money, people said he must have
become unbalanced, perhaps been not quite normal to attempt so tragic and
violent a death by<i> </i>his own hand. Had he speculated heavily on the Stock
Exchange and lost, or been involved in some unsavoury financial scandal and
chosen suicide as the way out, there would still have been talk, but people might
have understood his behaviour in the light of his mis-fortune or disgrace. As
it was, there had been no scandal, the Moolchand brothers enjoyed the highest
reputation in business circles, and Siru himself was the mildest, most
non-violent of men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
he was normal at the time or not it would be impossible for anyone to decide,
since normal is a treacherous word at the best times, and never easily defined.
What I considered my own depressingly normal, average life was to Siru a riot
of extremes. My simplest habit was by his standards an indulgence, and some of
my views, I am sure, not far from depraved though he was too good-tempered to
say so outright. What stunned me most about his faction was the thought that he
who had never attempted any venture alone or faced a situation unaided, whose
entire life had been moulded and conditioned by his joint family, should have
felt so suddenly and desperately isolated after all. Moments of longing, fear,
and frustration come and go in the course of a lifetime, sometimes leaving
their scars, but when the inadequacies of a lifetime are </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rowded
into a single mocking moment, they may, in this concentrated form, be too much
to endure. I did not realize this till Siru was able to tell me about it
afterwards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
had known the Moolchand brothers a number of years. I dined with them
frequently whenever I was in Bombay. They lived in a compact pink mansion in a
wealthy residential area which, though it abounded in smart new apartment
buildings with soaring rents had very<i> </i>few houses. The Moolchands who had
acquired </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>their plot when land was cheap were proud of
their home. It was called ‘Moolchand House’ after the princely residences in
the city, and though this sounded somewhat pretentious, there was nothing
ostentatious about the brothers themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lived with their mother, their wives, and children under the same roof. The
three men were remarkably alike: tubby, short, plump-faced and complacent, with
comfortable little paunches and healthy appetites for the excellent vegetarian
dishes that were served in such quantity at their table. Their wives, on the
other hand, were all wand-thin and meek-voiced, with shallow complexions and
poor appetites. The brothers and their wives seemed to meet only for the
evening meal because they even slept apart, the men in a row of beds on one
verandah, the women on another, in the manner of old-fashioned joint families.
That there were large numbers of children all over the house mystified me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mild
and cherubic as the men were, it was hard to believe they were astute men of
business and a considerable power on the Stock Exchange. Their devotion to
their millions was total and sincere. It left them no time for the enjoyment of
the things money could buy. Their wealth was an end in itself, even their home
showing few traces of it. One felt that such evidences of it as there were had
been almost apologetically placed there, and not with the intention to adorn,
few, really, could have been called adornments. In their immense drawing room,
solid gold cigarette lighters, and photographs in ornate gold and silver
frames, stood side by side with bright red plastic articles and shiny chromium
ones, showing complete innocence in matters of taste. So utterly did the
brothers lack distinction that I thought of them merely as three nice little
men who happened to be enormously rich. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Moolchand Enterprises necessitated a good deal of travel and the brothers made
regular trips to Europe and North and South America. Yet their travels left
them curiously unspoiled. Even at the Waldorf Astoria where they stayed when in
New York, they had a standing order of Vegetable Plate (without the poached
egg) twice a day. When compelled in the interests of business to visit a night
club they kept their gaze averted from the beauties of the cabaret. The story
is told that once a chorus girl perched on Siru’s lap during a cabaret only to
be met by a look of such genuine consternation that even that hard-boiled young
woman t</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ook pity on him and left him for more suitable
quarry. The </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brothers did not smoke, touch meat, alcohol,
eggs or onions. Brought up by stern parents and married while still in their
teens, they were dutiful sons and kindly husbands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was dismaying to speculate how few everyday temptations life held for them. How
safe they must feel, I often thought enviously, never in a moment of
nervousness or agitation to crave a cigarette or a drink, never to feel a
mouthwatering hunger at the smell of roasting meat, never to fall in love
beyond reason. For though they were fond husbands, I could not believe their
relationship with their docile wives, whose beds were on a different verandah,
had anything to do with love. I could not imagine the Moolchand ladies in a
state of abandon or disarray any more than I could picture the brothers other
than neat and blandly self-possessed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were always referred to as the Moolchand brothers, never as Siru, Hira, and
Manohar, and they seemed to have no separate identities. I wondered what would
happen if circumstances forced them to live and work separately, and conduct
distinct, individual lives. One night after dinner at their house Siru and I
talked about this and Siru told me he saw no need for this situation ever to
arise. He defended the joint family as providing a solid bulwark against the
very things a man on his own might be prey to–loneliness, loss, financial
straits. It was a refuge in time of need and a benefactor at all times. It had
been for centuries. It was the very core of Hindu life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

told me of his early married life when the need to meet had been more urgent.
He and his wife had chosen the roof of the house as their place of meeting,
stealing up there after the rest of the family had fallen asleep. I could not
help wondering what would have happened if the other two brothers had one night
by chance chosen the same rendezvous, and all three amorous Moolchands had
converged on the roof with the same idea in mind only to disperse hastily
again. As an exercise in ingenuity, patience, and self-control, the system had
its advantages and the Moolchands were well-known for all the three virtues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

talk of breaking up the joint family,” said Siru, “in my grandfather’s, and
even in my father’s time such talk would have been blasphemous. My father
started life as a poor man. He was barely literate when he came to Bombay from
his village in Marwar. He started in business by setting up a small provision
store, living in the room behind the store and he taught himself to read by the
light of a kerosene lantern. But he would rather have died than turn away even
a distant relation who came to him for shelter. Family counted for more in
those days. It’s true times have changed. My own children’s upbringing is very
different from my own. I went to the local municipal school and did my lessons
on a slate. They are going to an English school. Some of these changes are
necessary, of course, but if we undermine our joint family system we strike at
the very heart of our social structure.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been accepted. Similarly he had taken others at their Word and it was part
of his genius that he had seldom made a mistake in his assessment of any man
who did business with him. He had always regarded Bombay as mononstrously
artificial, a barbarous jungle of granite far removed from the values he had
been taught to revere. He had used it as he thought fit, and scorned compromise
with the society it represented. People who had done business with him had had
to sit on the floor beside him and make the best they could of his stumbling
English. He had spoken it when he had been compelled to, but he had made no
effort to improve it. He would not have sympathized with his sons’ attempts to

beneath were like and what they might develop into without the towering
personality of Maganlal in the background, or each other to bolster it. Or
perhaps I thought so because they looked so austere. There is really no reason
why a rotund man should not have the deepest religious convictions or value the
things of the spirit. But I continued to feel that the younger Moolchands were
wrapped cocoon-like in a shell chosen for them and seemed unable to emerge from
it. Their pink mansion was a concession to the luxury expected of them by the
circles in which they moved, while the comparative simplicity within was a
homage to their father. I don’t know why I pictured them more easily than as
they were with fat little cigars in their mouths and plates of delectable

sake, because the Moolchand ladies, though they themselves dressed with drab
simplicity and used no aids to beauty, enjoyed watching the elegant and
frivolous fashions that vied with the horses for attention. Many a man found it
difficult not to stare at a pretty face or an unusual fashion, but none of this
diverted the young millionaires. They smiled genially at the colourfully

seeing Siru walking along Marine Drive by himself one cloudy night last July.
It was about ten o’clock and a storm was threatening, so the pavement was empty
of its usual crowd of strollers and peanut and coconut vendors. A strong wind
whipped giant waves to a frenzy against the sea wall. Except that his suit was
damp with sea spray, Siru looked his tidy self, the wind not having succeeded
in dislodging many strands of his well-oiled hair. He looked scarcely
believable. It was almost symbolic that this tubby immaculate figure should
remain undisturbed by wind and weather. He had, I supposed, to a great extent
conquered his environment, or at least succeeded in ignoring it so that it did
not encroach upon him very much either physically or emotionally. But this was

her stay on since the cousin’s visit was temporary, and the shortage of nannies
chronic. She was a useful girl, willing to do other jobs about the house

girl, and his unmannerly cousin, had destroyed all that between them, sweeping
away all decency by making love in broad daylight on the sofa in his study. The
very thought of it nauseated him, and he was repelled by Vinno’s nonchalance.
His brothers, instead of supporting him, had sniggered and talked nonsense
behind his back. For the first time, he felt, they were ranged against him. It<i>

Vinno would think nothing, even now, of defying Siru’s authority, or ridiculing
again in front of his brothers. That he had behaved in a disgraceful way, did

dismissal. Then he would feel justified in allowing her to remain, once the
cousin had departed, life would resume its quiet tempo and go on as before.

win over. One evening he took us all to the cinema, and after the show we
dropped in at a small restaurant for refreshment. It was crowded, and we
squeezed around one of the few empty tables, and gave our order. The ladies
asked for milk shakes, the men ordered orange </span><span style='font-size:

a roving eye and he soon fixed it on a young and strikingly pretty girl near
us. He did not stop smoking or remove his hands from his pockets to raise his
cup to his lips, and there was a deliberate in the glance he directed towards
the girl. Hira and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Manohar followed it guiltily, and agreed
that she was attractive while the ladies discussed her fashionable bare-backed
blouse with animation. The girl, realising she was the focus of attention, kept
glancing toward Vinno almost against her will. There developed between them the
curious silent flirtation found in countries, where men and women share a very
limited common social life, and where the most smouldering glance need never
have a sequel. This, far from lessening its intensity, seems to heighten it,
since all passion must be channelled into a brief interval and must depend for
its fervour on the language of the eyes alone. It had all the qualities of a
duel, set in motion by Vinno’s challenging look. The young people took expert
measure of each other, and then the sparring of their glance began, careful at
first, and later growing bolder and more frankly sensual. Hira and Manohar
joked about it while Siru was goaded into discomfort. Vinno, equally
unconscious of both reactions, continued his game. His flagrant exhibitionism
annoyed, but did not anger me, and I was surprised at Siru’s tight-lipped
expression. We drove back through driving rain, Siru silent all the way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to a private life, unaccustomed even to private thoughts, Siru found he had to
share them with someone, and he spoke to me about what he considered his
deplorable weekness in letting Vinno’s offensive behaviour continue. The boy,
against Siru’s express wishes, had brought alcohol into the house, and kept a
bottle of whisky in his bedroom. Though Siru never saw it he felt it
constituted an impertinent rejection of his authority. He was also afraid it
might lead to more trouble with the nanny. The thought of finding her alone and
having a talk with her became an obsession with him, and yet he invented obstacles
for himself and postponed the issue, uncertain of his ability to cope with it.
In the end, to reassure himself he was still master of the house, he did seek
her out. It was a Saturday afternoon and the other members of the family were
in their rooms. Walking past the nanny’s door, he heard her singing inside, and
pushing open the door, went in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was a clear afternoon during the monsoon.
Sunlight streamed into the narrow room, flecking the Goan girl’s dark skin with
gold and gilding the crucifix above her bed. The sun glinted in a small mirror
above the bureau and dappled the dusty floor. Siru noted these little details
with a sharp sense of delight. After days of ceaseless drumming rain and the
noisy upheaval of thunder, the room bathed in light looked restful, and he was
filled with peace. He did not know it was the girl’s afternoon off, and that
she was getting ready to go out. He only saw that she looked different and he
wondered at her beauty. She had on a flowered cotton dress instead of her uniform,
and her black hair, unbound, hung in a tangle of curls to her shoulders nearly
hiding the rings she wore in her ears. His sudden appearance so startled her,
she dropped the bottle of cologne she was holding, and it broke on the
uncarpeted floor, permeating the room with its cheap, sweetish scent.</p>

stopped her as she was about to bend down and retrieve the pieces. He was
seized with a terrible longing to take this warm-skinned girl in his arms, to
hold her for a moment in that sunlit room. There was a fragile tenuous quality
about the stillness which the shattering of glass had not been able to dispel,
and he scarcely dared breathe, for fear of destroying it. He took her arm and
led her to the bed, sitting down beside her. She looked nervous but said
nothing, waiting for him to speak. But Siru could not speak. If there were
words to describe his joy at having found her alone in the golden afternoon, he
did not know them. He knew nothing except that she was near him and he could
lose his fingers in her thick black hair and trail them over her incredibly
warm, soft skin. Her bewilderment changing to shock, the girl stammered that he
should go away, and tried to get up. Siru’s fingers tightened on her arms and
he pressed her back on the bed. She struggled, pushing him away, and Siru
sliding off the slippery coverlet, grasped her ankles, refusing to be shaken
off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Looking
down at the little man so ludicrously crouched at feet, his plump hands glued
to her ankles, the Goan girl, fear forgotten, began to laugh softly. The sound
jarred on Siru. It threatened the peace and serenity of his mood. He looked up
at her in anguish, beseeching her to, stop, but the sight of his face seemed to
send her into fresh gales of laughter. She should have been lying in his arms,
not laughing at all, he thought confusedly. With sudden cruel perception he saw
himself as he must appear to her. She did not look upon him as a lover, but as
a clown. There were bits of broken glass lying about on the floor, and picking
one up, he slashed it across his face and neck with deliberate savagery. He
heard her screaming but he had fainted before the others arrived to carry him
to his own room.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:60.0pt;

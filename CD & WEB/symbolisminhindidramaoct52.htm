<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
traditional form of symbolism still remains the poetic. ‘Jyotsna’ (1934) of
Sumitranandan Pant, immediately following in </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the wake of
‘Gunjan,’ is an excellent manuestation in symbolic terms of the poet’s
stupendous structure of his Philosophical ideology. One cannot agree with what
Pt. Ram Chandra Shukla expressed about it saying, “What is this all, he has not
been able to understand.” It belongs to that highest order of imaginative work
which includes the ‘Book of Job,’ ‘Faust,’ ‘Paracelsus’ and claims as its
greatest example the ‘Divine Comedy’ of Dante. </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like Spenser’s
‘Faerie Queene’ it is symbolic. But whereas ‘Faerie Queene is an allegory,
‘Jyotsna’ is a genuine nature-myth. An </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>allegory is reasoned
and labored, a myth is instinctive and spontaneous. In allegory there is a
systematic formality, which in myth is replaced by the large, divinely simple
significance of the very symbolism of nature. An allegory is the result of
experience, a myth of intution. A myth is entirely confined to the childhood of
the race. It is an unconscious form of art, and unconsciousness belongs to
childhood. ‘Jyotsna’ possesses the wide-eyed, reverent </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wonder
of the child at the world of beauty and mystery, ‘peopling it with spiritual
creations that press everywhere through the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>material veil, as also
the instinctive faith which cannot survive the scientific temper of maturity.
It is, in all essentials, an original conception. The impression that the study
of the play leaves upon the mind is one of youth, of freshness, of exuberance
of life. It is marked by the tone of wonder, of fullness of life, of eagerness,
an exuberant outburst of joy or pain, or both, distinguishing it from the exhausted
verse of the preceding age. The story is little, characterisation nil. For,
that had not been the design of the playwright. For an examination of its
charm, we shall have to go elsewhere. There, are other things, its music,
color, atmosphere, and Philosophical import, which arrest our attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
story relates to the intention of the Moon to entrust the responsibility of the
administration of the Universe to his Chief Queen, introduced in the play as
Jyotsna (moonshine), after whose name the play is named. This decision has been
taken by him after he has seen so much destruction, waste, destitution, and
monstrous struggle in the world. Jyotsna is ordered to establish, with the help
of her attendants, Svapna (Dream), Kalpana (Imagination), Pavan (Breeze) and
Surabhi (Fragrance), to establish a heaven of love, irradiated by beauty and
complete understanding of ideology. The play contains five Acts. The first Act
my be entitled ‘Towards the Light.’ The dialogue between Chaya (Shadow) and
Sandhya (Evening) reveals the decision of Indu (Moon) and suggests the
beginning of a new ideal world, such as had not been witnessed before. The
second Act may be called the ‘Parting of power.’ Indu parts with his power and
authority to Jyotsna, who, inspired by his resplendent glory, would descend
upon the earth from the skies to scatter grains of goodness, peace and beauty,
where there had been superstition, blind faith, conventions, self-conceit,
selfishness, greed of power, and other evils of that sort. The third Act is the
‘Journey of Jyotsna.’ She descends on earth, where she is informed of the
actual conditions on earth by Pavan (Breeze) which is corroborated by the
grating tones of the cricket. Pavan and Surabhi are transmuted by Jyotsna’s
magic touch to the dainty shapes of Svapna and Kalpana, who are ordered by
Jyotsna to create a world of man’s feelings with the help of beauty and art, so
that man may be led on from darkness to light, from body to soul, from outward
form to inward emotion, from concrete to abstract. A dome of many-colored
glass, standing on the tremeulous, gentle and healthy feelings of man like
Bhakti (Devotion), Shakti (power), Daya (Pity), Satya (Truth), Samtanuraj
(Feeling of equality), Sneha (Love), Kala (Art), Nishkam Karma (Dispassionate
Action), Sadhana (Discipline), brings about a revolution on earth, where the
whole world is knit in ties of brotherhood and cosmopolitanism. In this Act the
playwright’s views on politics, art, society, and ethics are suggested deftly,
so that the whole sounds like an acted Sermon. This is followed by Jyotsna’s
departure to Heaven. Her task </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>being over, she has no business to stay
any more on earth. The fourth Act, which may be regarded ‘Act of Fulfillment’,
is a trium</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>phal chorus of rejoicing, as gradually the
embodiments of evil are on their heels after this establishment of the reign of
goodwill on earth. The fifth Act is the ‘Act of Liberation’ of earth from
darkness and eternal conflict. All powers of earth and air,–dew, butterfly,
wave, dawn etc., of the natural and the spiritual world unite in a wondrous
paean that, for depth and variety of music, for beauty of imagery, for the
expression of rapturous gladness, finds no parallel in Hindi Drama. Some
critics of the play might say: “The drama is woven out of dreams, it is a maze
of color and music devoid of definite structure and meaning.” It is, of course,
true that much is crude and weak here, much is held in the immature intellect
and not fused by imaginative passion into art; weak, sentimental, empty,–guilty
of that worst aesthetic sin, prettiness. Nevertheless, the eternal value of
‘Jyotsna’ lies in its aspiration towards a universal love, its passion for
freedom, its poignant melody, its exquisite imagery, in the wondrous beauty of
fragments scattered here and there through the drama.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
the making of ‘Jyotsna’ has contributed all that heritage of English
Literature, which Sumitranandan Pant imbibed from his Professors of English
Literature, when a student at Allahabad. The impress of Shelley’s ‘Prometheus
Unbound’ is fairly visible in this play. Pant and Shelley resemble each other
so much. Both are pure idealists, intensely sensitive, highly strung, smitten
with a passion for change, and possessed of a marvellous fineness of perception
responsive to subtle sense impressions; both are the poets of half-tints and
passing moods and glancing restlessness; both love beauty with the devotion of
a saint and the vision of a seer. Even without this conscious influence of
Shelley upon him, and merely on account of this close resemblance, one would
have certainly mistaken some of the traits of Pant as having been emphasized,
if not altogether imbibed, by his study of Shelley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first point of influence of Shelley that strikes one is the technique of songs
introduced in both. The supreme aesthetic glory of the ‘Prometheus Unbound’ is
in its music. The variety of metres is marvellous. So various are these songs
in their tone and coloring that it can almost be said about them that they are
different from one another. The verse varies with the sentiments that are
expressed by the speaker, or by the speaker himself. It rises into the long
passionate swing of the anapaest, or is broken by the flute-like notes of short
trochaic lines, or relieved by the half-lyrical effect of rhymed endings. That
it has been possible to draw different kinds of music by one instrument can be
seen, comparing the opening soliloquy of Prometheus, in Act I, with that of the
opening soliloquy of Asia in Act II. The sternly repressed passion of
Prometheus is expressed by means of a sonorous pomp, and austerity of epithet,
consonants striking upon consonants with cold and scant vowel coloring; but, on
the other hand, Asia’s melody has a prolonged and gentle sweetness, the sparkle
delicate life animating the whole, and the soft air and light air of the
spring-tide she sings. Jupiter’s utterances have a certain metallic ring and
harshness of tone. Almost all the characters have an individual accent of their
own. Songs are onomatopoeic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pant,
like Shelley, approximates in his songs of ‘Jyotsna’ the sentiment expressed
therein to the nature of the speaker. He has suggested, by the modulation of
sound and the subtle assonance and fine alliteration, the glimmer of the
fireflies in the song which </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>begins thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sound suggests the meaning, and, here, the whole atmosphere. Similar effects
have been attained in the song of Dew and Breeze, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
Wave and Vibration of the Breeze. Like ‘Prometheus Unbound,’ ‘Jyotsna’ presents
an arresting sweep and variety of direct lyrical modulation. The songs in both
have the same light movement, redolent with fairy suggestion; they have the
same elusive and dainty grace. Characters are also suggested by analogous
effects of symbolic suggestion, vivid picturesqueness, and sound echoed b</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Secondly,
in the second decade of this century poets in Hindi </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>became
colorists, and Pant is one of the greatest of them. ‘Jyotsna’ is a great play
so far as the use of light and color are </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>concerned.
Rainbow-lights, keen, swift and pure, play through ‘Jyotsna.’ Obviously the
influence in this respect again is of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Prometheus Unbound’
in which the color scheme is shaped into an organic whole. Various examples of
splendid display of colors are Interspersed throughout the drama. We are taken
from faint light to darkness, from darkness to semi-light, from semi-light to
complete darkness, and from darkness again to the fresh light of morning. Color
is the ineffable, subtle atmosphere of the play, helping us to understand the
meaning of the play. Again, Jyotsna, bringer of light into darkness, life of
life, the Light of Life, the highest embodiment in the drama towards which the
worship ever ascends, reminds us of Asia in ‘Prometheus Unbound’; through
Jyotsna, as through Asia, the redemption is intended to have been worked. Pant
again, has taken the symbol of darkness as an indication of evil and imperfect
conditions in the world, and that of Light or Dawn to signify peace, order and
settlement on earth. If the speed of the Hour speeds to proclaim redemption
over earth and sea and land in ‘Prometheus Unbound,’ in the fifth Act of
‘Jyostna’ the bird swallow proclaims the coming of dawn, and with it </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>all
that it stands for in the drama. The fresh light of morning<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>shines more clearly and constantly as the
action marks a progress</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ion. An examination of the last Act of
both the dramas reveals an astounding similarity. All powers on earth and in
Nature are joined in a chorus of triumphal rejoicing on the new conditions
having been ushered on earth. Shelley expresses the joy, the triumph, the
delight, the madness, the boundless, overflowing, bursting gladness, through
the dialogue between Earth and the Moon, in which is suggested that the whole
of God’s creation is wrapped in an animation of delight on account of the
interpenetration of the spirit of Love. Pant invites all the objects in Nature
and on earth to join the universal ‘Song of Honour’ to describe the new change
in creation; there is the dew, snowdrop, violet, tulip, potentila, sweet-pea,
forget-me-not, daisy, carnation, honeysuckle, iris, lily, rose, <sup>1</sup>
butterflies, dawn, almost every object that the playwright can conceive of. The
intention of the playwrights in both is the same: expression of change from the
old convention-ridden world to a world ruled by Beauty and Art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
examination of the thought-content of the two will also suggest some
resemblance in their philosophical aspect. Shelley is a thorough-bred democrat
and communist, even before Communism in its present form was born, and
‘Prometheus Unbound’ is the most profound expression of Shelley’s democratic
ideal, his profound love for humanity, a sympathy for all the woes of the
suffering world, a passion for freedom, and a spirit of a deathless hope. It
was Shelley’s belief that evil is an accident of the outer life, and thus
dwells in that outward authority which checks the free play of impulse. Over
the ashes of tyranny Shelley intended to build a regenerate world of pastoral
innocence, with Love as the supreme and eternal power to help bring in such a
state. Pant is also aware of tyranny and its attendant ills, and with the help
of Jyotsna, the spirit of Light and Love, he also, like Shelley, has a purpose
to build his golden age, of unbounded peace and prosperity. Leaving aside
details, in general outline the thought of both Shelley and Pant is the same,
enabling us to conclude that Pant was influenced by Shelley’s ‘Prometheus
Unbound’,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Besides
the influence of Shelley on ‘Jyotsna,’ there is the influence of Keats too.<sup>
2</sup> Sensuousness is admittedly the most prominent quality of Keats’ poems.
Beautiful sounds and beautiful pictures are more than a poetic ornament with him.
They constitute a delight in themselves. Sweet sensations are a fascination to
him, and he yearns for them. He approached Nature and life, through the senses.
Music, color, flavour, fragrance, sympathy and friendship, warmth and love,
greatly appealed to his heart. There are sensuous pictures of Keatsian type in
‘Jyotsna’ and their number is legion. Particularly, in pictures of Jyotsna and
Indu there is the Keatsian touch. The influence is only of flavour and tone
rather than of thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are examples of incidental symbolism in modern Hindi playwriting, where
dramatists are inclined to resort to symbolical devices in order to project
values that do not seem to emerge with sufficient distinctness and force from a
merely realistic representation of human affairs. The use of this type of
symbolism in plays otherwise realistic, demonstrates the very close influence
of Western playwrights, like Ibsen, Galsworthy, Shaw, who employ symbolism
exactly for the same purposes. This steadily increasing incursion of symbolism
into the burgeois realistic drama has been the result of the Hindi playwrights’
study of these dramatists of the West.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

consternation of the proprietor of the shop. The Epilogue reveals the havoc
which the admission of the bull has brought about in the shop. Prakash is the
bull, who brings ruin upon the affected, dissimulating and artificialised
persons inhabiting the city. The use of symbolism of this kind is just like
Ibsen’s in ‘The Wild Duck,’ where the figure of the duck, besides being used to
suggest to the imagination the ironic plight of the Ekdal family, is also
introduced as an important element in the development of the plot,–an attempt
at symbolic representation which may be admired for its boldness rather than
for its plausibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘Chalna’ a cat is introduced at various places. It has been done, not for
nothing. The cat is brought upon the stage at a critical time, when either of
the characters present upon the scene begins to talk to him in such a way that
startlingly, but quite unconsciously, great truths are revealed and the
relations that exist between the characters are exhibited. Or the cat has been
brought upon the stage for the sake of greater emphasis, as when it is
discovered sleeping with beggars on the footpath under the same blanket. This
is done to set off, by a contrast, the wretchedness of their condition; these
beggars are worse off than cats and dogs. It is also used at a time when, on
account of a tense dramatic situation, it is not possible for the character to
speak, and it speaks on behalf of the character. John Galsworthy has used with
remarkable success such a symbolism, whereby the whole play is symbolically
represented before the audience by a simple and pregnant device of such a type.
In ‘The Eldest Son’ of Galsworthy, the head-keeper, at a critical point in the
play, produces two puppies from his pockets and talks to them in a way which
startlingly brings out the relations which exist between the two betrayed
girls, Freda Studdenham and Rose Taylor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by Ganesh Prasad Dwivedi is a domestic Tragedy. It deals with the problem of a
woman, who, bereft of the sweet company and love of her husband on account of
an incompatibility that exists between them, is on her way to a slow death. But
before the lamp of her life fades into the darkness of eternity, the arrival of
a young man for whom she develops a silent and subdued admiration, lights her
life by his stay for a few days but never to return again. Kali Babu, the
husband, does not probe deep into–he does not even know–this mentally torn
condition of the wife. The lady dies, and Kali Babu from the burning ghat
brings forth a bone of his wife to treasure it secretly as her sweet memory. On
his opening the suitcase of his wife, he discovers a letter written by his
deceased wife to the young man, whom she silently admired in her state of
mental repression, but which was never intended to be delivered to him. This
letter gives the greatest shock of his life to Kali Babu, from whose hands,
un-awares, the bone of his dead wife falls on the ground, and a cat, which
happened to arrive there, begins to play with it. This subtle symbol is
introduced by way of a warning to the man that, as it is too late now, there is
no use crying over spilt milk, or it is introduced to intensify the bitterness
of his mind by way of contrast. So great is his shock that, in his agitation,
he pays no attention to the only memento of his dear wife. This symbol is also
in the tradition of Galsworthy’s symbols, which he introduces to reinforce some
special emphasis or state of feeling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by Govind Das Seth is an example of the technique employed by John Galsworthy
to describe the innermost feelings of his characters. The man in this play
finds a response to his feelings in the wordless groans and mute whispers of
the horse, after whom the play is named. The horse is the leader and the
philosopher of its rider. In the horse he hears the eternal music of nature; he
harps upon the song of the Almighty in his heart. He has been his constant
companion, and the humanitarian impulse of the rider of the horse, only on finding
an affirmation in its neighing, urges him to give to the poor what he has
robbed from the rich, since all their money had been amassed by exploiting the
poor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

delicate use of symbolism has been made by Govind Das Seth in his ‘Pralaya and
Srishti’ (‘Destruction and Creation.’) The playwright’s purpose is to build a
new order of society over the ashes of the old. He advocates a complete
adjustment of society to suit new conditions. ‘Pralaya’ stands for destruction
of the ‘old’, ‘Srishti’ for the regeneration of the old in an entirely new
garb. The poor people have suffered for long. Is it not the time now to improve
their lot? It is undoubtedly possible by a re-orientation of values in society,
politics, literature, and economics. The young man’s reflections on the various
aspects of life in the play reveals the harm done by Capitalism. Hence, instead
of it, a new order of things, in which a fillip will be given to lobourers and
the poor people, is desirable. The play ends in symbolism. In the upheaval
caused by an earthquake, followed by the tottering of buildings, symbolic of
Capitalism, the man, having sympathies with the laboring population, also falls
down, as the upper storey of his house comes down. In this struggle, which the
earthquake symbolises, labour would come out triumphant eventually, in spite of
its temporary overshadowing in the great struggle which is suggested by the
fall of man in the end. Ibsen’s plays embody great and profound spiritual
truths expressed symbolically, as in his ‘When we Dead Awaken,’ which ends in
symbol and mystery. Irene and Rubek prefer to face the danger of death in order
to reach the mountain top which symbolises the promised land of the spirit,
where, through the mists, life may be transfigured by sunshine. The storm,
however, continues, accompanied by the peal of thunder, but as the avalanche
descends with terrific speed, they are buried beneath its enormous mass, and
the play ends with a message of peace and repose. Ibsen’s play has been
mentioned, to point out the nature of the symbolism in the play of Govind Das
Seth. In cases like these, of course, there is no question of a direct
borrowing. Nevertheless, it will not be far from the truth to say that the
atmosphere and tone conveyed by both is similar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ask, too, has used symbols in his plays to convey more than, on the surface,
meets the eye. His plays, like ‘Devtaon Ki Chaya Main’ (‘Beneath the Shadow of
gods’), ‘Lakshmi ka Svagat’ (‘Welcome Lakshmi’), ‘Adhikar Ka Rakshak’
(‘Protector of Rights’), make an incidental use of symbolism, combined with a
bitter irony in its use. The names of these plays are symbolic. Lakshmi in
‘Lakshmi Ka Svagat’ does not stand for wealth, for the newly-wedded bride, who
is taken as ‘Lakshmi’ (Goddess of Wealth) by the bridegroom’s father. The
storm, accompanied with rain, symbolises the agitation in Roshan’s mind at the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>time,
when his son by his first wife is dying and his parents are planning and
forcing him to marry again. In the parents the playwright represents the
merciless tyranny of a social system, which has devoured his son, and which is
preparing to manacle him in its iron chains. The play ends with a symbolic
utterance of Surendra to Roshan’s mother–‘Bring grain and arrange a lamp’–which
means in the Punjab that someone is dead. Arun’s death is symbolised in the
fall of the glass-hanger. In ‘Devtaon Ki Chaya Main’ the playwright deals with
the inroad of town-life, with all its evils, as a force which, under the
semblance of providing work to the simple folk of the villages, is making their
condition hopelessly wretched. It takes a heavy toll of life. Even their milk
is taken away from them. In the death of Sadiq and in the grievous hurt
received by Rahim, he represents the sufferings which the deaf tyranny of the
Capitalism of the cities is causing in the villages. The news of the fall of a
huge building where Rahim was working displaces the mental equilibrium of the
lady, which the playwright shows by the quivering of the tree and the blowing
of the ashes in the hearth. The device to symbolise an evil in society as a
force is taken by Ask from the English play- wrights who make their
protagonists not men, but unseen forces. The heroes of Galsworthy’s plays are
the unseen fates of modern existence, against which the poor mortals can but
pitifully cry in moments of desperation and horror. Like the waves dashing in
ceaseless fury through Synge’s ‘Riders to the Sea’ or the bleak expanses of
landscape in Miss Sowerky’s ‘Rutherford &amp; Son’, Upendranath Ask, too, consciously
or unconsciously employs one of the surest means of raising apparently sordid
subject-matter on to a higher, and truly tragic, plane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

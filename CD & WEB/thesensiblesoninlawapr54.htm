style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
moment Sitapati set foot in his house his wile Sundari swept into his presence
from the kitchen where she had been in tantrums, evidently, for some time. She
peered into his face <span class=SpellE>scrutinisingly</span>, curled her lips
and returned to the kitchen. Sitapati paused at the doorstep for a moment,
mystified by this unusual greeting and walked slowly into his room. He first
unbuttoned his coat and hung it on the stand. Significant sounds of falling
vessels assailed his ears. He dropped down on the worn-out tape cot staring
hard at the wall that stood between him and the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
could be the reason for this mood of Sundari? He had not uttered even a single
word to provoke her since daybreak. He recollected the smile on her face with
which she had sent him off to the office in the morning. ‘What could have
occurred subsequently to put her out? <span class=GramE>Perhaps, the mischief
of the children.</span> No, anything so simple and normal could not <span
class=GramE>account</span> for this extraordinary demonstration. He began to
revolve in his mind all the conceivable possibilities. But he could not arrive
at a satisfactory explanation. The problem, unsolved, developed into a
headache.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘With
all our efforts and economies, our earnings suffice at best to make both ends
meet. We are never able to spare anything for satisfying the fancy of the
children even once in a way.’ Such words also found their way to his ears, from
the other side of the wall. He felt mortified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quite
true!’ he reflected. ‘My meagre earnings enable me just to carry on somehow,
with difficulty.’ His glance rested on the thread-bare coat on the stand, with
the big patches at the elbows and the loose <span class=SpellE>fibres</span> at
the edges, and the button-holes gaping at the vacant button-places. The <span
class=SpellE>colour</span> of the cloth had long ago changed into a dull grey.
This remnant of an ancient coat, he reflected with gratitude, contrived to
serve heroically to preserve his respectability, concealing from exposure the
tattered shirts underneath. From the coat, his gaze strayed to the sandals
below it. As he jerked them off his feet on entering the room one of them had
fallen upside down showing the ugly pieces of cardboard with which the sole was
stuffed. It was a revolting sight. ‘We have served you loyally for so many
years. We have been crushed under your feet every day. We are quite done up. Is
there no release for us?’–they seemed to plead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
cobbler demands a rupee and four <span class=SpellE>annas</span> for repairs.
Where to find so much for this single item?’ reflected Sitapati and tried to
stretch his back full on the cot. The worn-out tape snapped at once. Everything
in the house, every individual object seemed to him to bear eloquent testimony
to his incompetence. ‘This tape is really very old. How long can it serve? <span
class=GramE>reflected</span> Sitapati very considerately, in an attempt to
reconcile himself to his irremediable position. Meanwhile the noise in the
kitchen also appeared to have died down. ‘Where is the alternative if I refuse
to be provoked and refrain from retorting?’ observed Sitapati in a mood of
self-congratulation. This wisdom Sitapati had acquired even before the end of
the first year of his married life. Otherwise, if he took notice of the
perpetual grumbling and frequent exhibitions of temper of Sundari, where had
they been by now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should be a fool to expect coffee today, considering the storm in the kitchen
all this time,’ he thought, and rose from the cot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tomorrow
is the last day for payment of school-fees. Names of defaulters will be struck
off the rolls.’ <span class=SpellE>Prasad</span> burst in with this comforting
intimation. Sitapati began to scratch his skull, by way of reaction. <span
class=SpellE>Prasad</span> repeated his courteous notice, still in doubt
whether his jaded father had grasped the significance of the announcement. ‘All
right, we shall see about it,’ drawled out Sitapati at last, listlessly, as he
stepped out of the room. It was unbearable torture for him to stay in the
house. He was only waiting for the coffee, to gulp it down and escape into the
street. But now he suddenly recollected: he had himself declared last night, as
a measure of economy to balance the tottering budget, that coffee in the
evening should be scrapped. He was really a fool to have waited so long. He
thrust his feet into the tattered sandals and stepped out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was walking along the road briskly, but his mind was all in a whirl. Many
agitating thoughts rushed through his mind one after another in quick
succession. Many times he asked himself: ‘How long am I to endure this life, so
full of woes and only woes?’ He could formulate no answer to the question and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>therefore,
perhaps, he came to it again and again. Somebody wished him. He could grasp it
only after be had passed along and out of his sight. He was surprised, at his
own absent-mindedness. His glance rested on the big ‘Grow More Food’ poster on
the wall opposite. With a smile of derision he commented within himself.
‘Perhaps more food will grow by fixing huge posters on walls in towns at a cost
of thousands of rupees!’ He came to the crossroads. He paused for a moment to
choose the road he should follow. ‘One may listen to the radio in the public
park,’ he thought and took the road to the park. He passed by a Government
office. He found, in the yard enclosing it, a number of saplings, planted in
lines at regular distances. Each was carefully fenced round, for protection
from animals evidently. But the plants within were withered and drooping. ‘This
is the result of the tree planting festival (<span class=SpellE>Vanamahotsava</span>)...Thousands
of trees planted in a fit of enthusiasm and most of them, like these, withering
for want of proper care and nourishment! Who is to blame for this colossal
waste of public funds and effort? At this rate how can the movement progress
and the ideals bear fruit?’ He reached the park by this time, entered and
squatted on the sward in a secluded corner. The radio was pouring out a talk on
‘The Grow More Food Campaign’. <span class=GramE>‘Why this obsession with the
campaign to grow more food?</span> How is it, no one bothers about fair
distribution and healthy consumption of the food that is produced!’ he
wondered. The lights were on. It was pleasant to sit on the sward listening to
the radio and pursuing <span class=GramE>his own</span> thoughts. But he felt
hungry. ‘God could create man but He could not free him from hunger and thirst!’
he reflected, got up reluctantly and proceeded homeward slowly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
meals in the night Sitapati scrupulously maintained a discreet silence.
Sundari, however, resumed her grumbling, with insinuations and innuendoes aimed
at him, every now and then. He felt it rather hot every way. He swallowed a
glassful of water, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>complained of excess of pepper in the
sauce and asked for a little extra ghee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is the ghee for extras?’ snapped Sundari. ‘The half a seer you brought the
other day was over long ago. It was literally the last drop that I flicked on
your plate today.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘True,’
Sitapati admitted to himself. ‘How long could half <span class=GramE>a seer of
ghee go</span> for a family of half a dozen members? It is creditable on the
part of Sundari to have stretched it to go for a week,’ and he kept mum. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

retort, it would end in a regular scene; he finished his meal quickly and
retired to his room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lifted the bed sheets from the cot, and attempted to mend the broken tape. At
last he managed it after a lot of effort, made his bed and reclined on it.
Meanwhile Sundari had finished her work in the kitchen and she now approached
the cot, placed a vessel of drinking water under it, and sat at the feet of her
husband. Sitapati slyly peered into her face and assured himself that her bad
temper had at last subsided.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

him the new clothes purchased by her father for presentation to them on the New

out your legs, Father. Let us bow before your feet and receive your blessings,’
said Susila. ‘Why so much </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

stretched his legs as desired, nevertheless. Daughter and son-in-law bowed and
he blessed them heartily. Susila departed immediately in response to a call
from her mother in the kitchen. Syamala Rao also followed her to the door. The
gaze of Sitapati involuntarily strayed to the patched-up coat on the coat-stand
and the tattered sandals below it. He was startled by the word, ‘Father-in-law,
sir,’ from Syamala Rao at the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a hundred-rupee note. I have been commissioned by my parents to hand it over
to you. It was proposed to present clothes to both of you if you went over
there to invite us for the festival, but you did not, and we are obliged to
adopt this method,’ and he approached him holding out the note.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was stunned. It was so unexpected. There was no such convention, so far as he
knew. And if Susila had known of this strange commission from her
father-in-law, she would have surely given him an inkling of it in advance.
Evidently she did not know. Perhaps the present was only from his sensible
son-in-law, Syamala Rao. He must have guessed the real state of affairs here.
It was so lucky, after all, and the amount was a godsend. He could clear the
new loan altogether with it and the visit would have cost him nothing. But how
could he take advantage of the generous impulse of a young man? It was not
proper for a father-in-law to accept a present from his son-in-law on the New
Year Day. ‘There is no need for any such thing,’ he said aloud, at last. ‘It is
not at all unnecessary, nor is there any impropriety in it. Please take it.
Susila may come back any moment,’ said Syamala Rao and he handed over the note.
Sitapati was in a fix. His heart was in a flutter. He stretched his trembling
hand and took it.” Syamala Rao was moved by the sight. The poor gentleman was
agitated on receiving money from him. Perhaps he had done wrong in causing him
so much mental suffering, through misguided sympathy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the call came from the kitchen for the evening tea. Syamala Rao went in and
Sitapati followed a moment later, putting the hundred-rupee note in his pocket.
He was still </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

how can I </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

extremely lucky in my son-m-1aw. Such a sensible and considerate son-in-law is
indeed a rare phenomenon,’ he reflected and tears of Joy gathered in his eyes.
He had never relished his tea so well as on this New Year Day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>LOGIC and consistency, said Samuel Butler, are
luxuries which should be reserved for the gods and the lower animals. But the
history of thought has been a persistent attempt to convert this luxury of the
lower man, whose life is a compromise only because it is a muddle, into the
necessity of the truth seeker. A rigorous intellectual discipline becomes
necessary when one takes all knowledge for one’s domain. Many specific problems
which troubled the mind of the ancient world have now been relegated to the
realm of the pseudo-sciences. New sciences have developed. But it is true now,
as ever before, that the seeker after light cannot afford to cherish some
private darkness, or lead a life which is at variance with itself. That is why,
as in the peace-chants of the Upanishads, even physical well-being is
integrated with the quest of the <i>summum bonum</i>, the general aim being to
make a man a <i>Jnana-thriptha</i>, and give him a sense of realised
satisfaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This is perhaps best illustrated by taking a few
concrete examples. The <i>Prasnopanishad</i>, for example, poses a series of
questions. What is the origin of life? How did life enter the body? What
happens to man after death? How many gods are there? What is the relationship
between man and the ultimate reality? Obviously, these are problems which do
not lend themselves to the method of experimentation. Although the method of
experimentation is not altogether lacking in the ancient world, they are in the
main used to make the problem more concrete, and to that extent may be regarded
as experimental analogies. They may be said to form the poetry of science. The
synthesis of life is expressed, for example, by a Homeric simile, “As the
flowing rivers that tend towards the sea having reached it, merge in the ocean,
and all their names and forms disappear, and people speak only of the ocean, so
the sixteen <i>kalas </i>of this seer, resting in Him alone, having reached Him
disappear in Him.” An analogy may enforce a conviction, but is not itself an
argument. A more common method adopted in the quest of truth is the ancient
Socratic method of disputation. But the defect of the Socratic method is that
it is an unequal combat between an able dialectician, and a novice whose ideas
are diffuse and whose expression is nebulous. There is a slight shifting of the
ground, and the defeated party is not necessarily convinced, though he is often
silenced. Starting with the question what is it that shines by day, when one
arrives at the conclusion that the light of the spirit shines by day and by
night, one feels at times that the conclusion is not on the same plane as the
premises. There is a gradual switching off, of the lights, but that does not necessarily
make for illumination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A more common and a more satisfactory method is the
heuristic method, the method of discovery. To the enquirer who desires to know
the nature of the Eternal, he is asked to wait and brood over the problem until
the sleeping spirit of truth is liberated. This is compared to a churning of
the fire-sticks–where the latent spirit of fire in the fire-stick leaps forth
into a flame.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>If this Promethean ideal which gives to us the
emergent value of life, and transforms existence into a thing of beauty, is not
to be a mere freak of individual achievement, but an objective heritage in
which every one can participate by a realization of one’s own wondrous own, the
unique value of the spirit must be gained by a method which is as sound as the
goal that is reached. In any sound system of thinking the method is as
important as the goal, for that alone assures us that there is no snag in the
argument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The importance of right method has been associated
with the name of Descartes in the history of thought. Method in philosophy is
what a dictionary is in literature. It stands as the common medium of thought.
Bacon too desired that all personal, racial, and popular pre- possessions of
the mind should be eliminated before the mind becomes a fit instrument of
discovery. But it was Descartes who taught men to reject all <i>prima facie </i>conclusions
by a process of negation. He gave to doubt the precedence over assertion. In
the Indian system of thought, this process of verification and rejection is dramatised,
by giving the <i>purva-paksha </i>to one person and the <i>siddhanta </i>to
another. In both cases nothing is accepted un-examined, although in the
process, the Cartesian maxim <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>, is inverted, like an
hour-glass drum, into a not less valid, <i>Sum, ergo cogito</i>. If, in spite
of this method of doubting everything except the doubter, of many a proposition
over which schools of thought have put their Q.E.D. have now become fresh
subjects of discussion, it either means that the fringe of ignorance over the
bounds of knowledge have not been completely lifted, or that something more is
necessary than right method. Just as in economics money is not a mere medium of
exchange, but has its own intrinsic value as metal, and this in turn influences
prices, so also in all philosophical discussion, the mind is not a mere
instrument of cognition. It has its own scale of values. “The mind is its own
place, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.” It affects
our ethical conceptions also. “There is nothing good or bad but thinking makes
it so.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The new psychology takes precedence over older
schools of thought because it insists upon an exact study of the mind, the
foot-rule of thought. The name of Freud is specially associated with the
discovery of layers of consciousness. He distinguished four layers of
thought–the fore-conscious, the subconscious, the unconscious, and the primary
unconscious. The fore-conscious gives to us the superficial aspect of life. The
subconscious contains all that we have thought and known. The unconscious is
the home of repressed thoughts and feelings, which come out in dreams. The
primary unconscious connects us with racial heritage. All these are matters of
familiar knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Indian thought, like the new psychology, insists
upon an exact assessment of the measuring rod, the mind of man, and would fain
strip thought of all the colouring which the mind gives to it. Indian thought
differs from Freudian psycho-analysis in that it would fain regard these levels
of consciousness, as a sequence in time also. Further, while Freud gives to us
only two stages of consciousness, the waking and the dreaming, Indian thought
insists that a plane shall have three points of agreement, and adds to these
two sleep-consciousness also. Indian thought agrees with Freud that the dream
is often a concatenation of the day’s events where the spirit “sees all that
has been seen and unseen, heard and unheard, perceived and unperceived, real
and unreal.” But it goes beyond Freud and gives to sleep that importance which
Shakespeare recognised when he called it ‘Nature’s soft nurse’ and ‘the balm of
hurt minds.’ It is not regarded as a blank space of the mind, or a mere hyphen
between two activities, but is regarded as part of the continuity of life and the
home-coming of the spirit, the bird going to the tree to roost. The <i>Prasnopanishad
</i>says: “The mind and what can be thought of, the intellect and what can be
comprehended, the ego and the object of egoism, the memory and its object, the
light and what can be lighted up, the <i>prana </i>and what is to be
sustained–all these rest in the superior Atman in deep sleep.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This has far reaching consequences. This
three-plane study, by showing to us a stage of endurance where the personality
survives though the mind as such is absent, reduces the mind of man from the
level of a cogniser to the object of cognition. It makes the mind of man, as
Wordsworth did a part of Nature and adds it to the Sun and the Moon and all
that we behold on this green earth. Further, Freudian thought, in so far as it
recognises only two planes of thought, the waking and the dreaming, tends to
explain what is higher in man in terms of the lower, intellect in terms of sex.
It is guided by a law of parsimony. Whatever lies beyond it is regarded as an
illusion and to this realm is relegated even the consciousness of the divine.
Indian thought on the other hand feels that the existence of the sub-conscious
implies a super-conscious, just as in light the infra-red implies the existence
of the ultra violet. If the mind is to be a thermometer of truth, it should be
graduated not only at the freezing point, the sub-conscious, but should also be
graduated at the boiling point, the super-conscious. It is only in relation to
these two that normal consciousness is normal. It is only then that the pursuit
of truth becomes identical with intellectual rectitude. “The pure world of
Brahman belongs only to those in whom rests not falsehood, deceit, and guile.”
Looking at it from an opposite point of view, the <i>Prasnopanishad </i>also
says: “He who tells a lie perishes root and all. So let us not tell a lie.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is only when the mind of man becomes a precision
instrument characterised by intellectual and moral rectitude, that it can
balance the cosmos. With a clarified sense of awareness, knowing the range of
the mind, and the method to be pursued, let us turn to the questions originally
propounded. Whence are we? Of what scenes the actors and spectators? What is
the relationship between man and the ultimate reality?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The one-pointed quest of life becomes identical
with the one-pointed goal of life. “The supreme undecaying One he verily
attains who knows the indestructible, the pure, without shadow, colour or
body.” Knowing is thus identical with being, and the being is also a becoming.
Apparently it looks absurdly simple, as though one were to say, “he who knows
that there is money in the bank becomes a rich man.” But the proposition means
something more profound than that. It means that true knowing is an awareness
in the eternal Now. If the Prasnopanishad gives to us peace with understanding,
it is because, as it says, “For them verily is Brahmaloka, who have penance and
abstinence, and in whom truth abides.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

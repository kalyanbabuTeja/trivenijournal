class=SpellE>humour</span>–or his mirth, as Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Sarojini</span>
<span class=SpellE>Naidu</span> prefers to call it–was always to the point, it
was sometimes sly but quite without malice, sometimes whimsical, and sometimes,
when he made a joke to cap a discussion on a question of morality or ethics, it
was inclined, as Mrs. <span class=SpellE>polak</span> has told in “Gandhi the
Man,” to leave his questioner feeling baffled if not exasperated. He made no
jokes about people which could not be repeated in their presence without giving
offence. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>His readiness to laugh endeared him to people of all
ages and outlook. As with all people of a happy disposition, he liked human
company. He liked people who had a sense of fun and could see the funny side of
things. It was in a burst of mutual laughter that the long and intimate
friendship of Muriel Lester and Gandhiji began. </p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> said in a B. B. C.
programme, “Talking of Gandhi<span class=GramE>”, that</span> “he was a very
companionable man, and he liked company very much. He was a <span class=GramE>man</span>
who liked to laugh, and he liked people who laughed, he liked children, he
liked women, he liked good and cheerful company.” <span class=SpellE>Rajaji</span>
called him “a man of laughter”, and this is how millions remember him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his <span class=SpellE>humour</span> was often touched off by given situations
or what was said to him, it cannot be fully appreciated unless the setting is
kept clearly in mind. If this is done, it is possible to <span class=SpellE>savour</span>
the depth and keenness of his <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, and to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> why the people who were involved in his flashes of
fun never forgot this lovable quality of his mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

who knew him recall how he could crack a joke even when the outlook seemed
gloomy. During the Round Table Conference in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>, for example, he was asked how he
would spend his approaching birthday. Gandhiji burst into laughter and
remarked, “I will eat, drink and be merry!” He said he had no plans, but if as
contemplated by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fenner</span> Brockway, M. P., and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>other
friends, a dinner was held to celebrate the occasion, he might attend it and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the return Voyage in the “<span class=SpellE>Pilsna</span>” he had spent
Christmas rather alone, which was unusual. Landing in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, he
expected before the week was out to receive some gifts from his Christian
friends for having lent his presence to the Round Table Conference. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Instead,
the Ordnances were promulgated, which provoked Gandhiji to make the ironical
comment that they were “Christmas gifts </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>from His Excellency the
Viceroy”. There was nothing bitter about this wise-<span class=GramE>crack,</span>
it was a typical example of the wry element in <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji’s</span>
<span class=SpellE>humour</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
many great men, Gandhiji had trained himself to need the minimum amount of
sleep. Once, when he was in hospital, his doctors asked whether he could sleep
well at any time and keep his mind blank and free from worrying thoughts.
Gandhiji wittily replied, “Napoleon used to sleep on horse-back: I can sleep on
the back of a camel!” He added, “Yes, I can sleep without having any dreams and
without any thought whatsoever in my mind.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
was seventeen when I first met Gandhiji, and he captivated me at once with his
beaming smile and his sense of fun. I always remember him as ‘The Smiling One’.
He had just returned to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
after the <span class=SpellE>Vykom</span> Satyagraha during the early part of
1925. I was sitting by the side of a wall pillar of <span class=SpellE>Sjt</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Srinivasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyengar‘s</span>
mansion, hoping to catch a glimpse of the already famous Gandhiji, when I saw
him getting out of his car after a visit, to a spinning school. He was then
already the figure the world came to know</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was <span class=SpellE>Rajaji</span> who helped me then to meet Gandhiji. When
I told the Mahatma, in tones of awed respect, that I had come from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ceylon</st1:place></st1:country-region> to have
his <span class=SpellE><i>darshan</i></span>, he patted me on the shoulder and
jocularly quoted Heber’s lines, “Oh then, you come from a land where ‘every
prospect pleases and only man is vile’!” His tone of voice and his beaming
smile showed that he was pulling my leg, and I laughed with him. I then asked
when we would have the pleasure of seeing him in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ceylon</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and he said he had a great
desire to visit “that beautiful island” but he did not know when </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>it
would be possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Gandhiji came to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ceylon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
I was present at one of his auctions for the <span class=SpellE>Khadi</span>
Fund held in the <span class=SpellE>Vaideesvara</span> <span class=SpellE>Vidyalayam</span>.
I gave for auction the gold ring that belonged to my late father. <span
class=SpellE>Rajaji</span> was the auctioneer. I bought the ring back for <span
class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 45, but as he handed it to me <span class=SpellE>Mahatmaji</span>
said with a laugh, “Why don’t you let it be auctioned again?” I did, and again
made the highest bid. Gandhiji again handed me the ring, his face wreathed in a
smile, and quipped, “Don’t try your luck a third time!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was ready to joke even when the situation was serious and his intimates and
friends, not to mention people in general, were anxious on his behalf. At his
first meeting with the Press after he had entered <span class=SpellE>Yeravda</span>
“palace”, just after beginning his historic fast, he characteristically said
that he was an irresistible optimist and that everything would come off well
unless God had forsaken him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was extremely cheerful while being questioned by the newspapermen and often
broke out into boisterous laughter. When one of the pressmen suggested that he
should allow himself to be photographed, Gandhiji quipped “Do you expect that I
am going to die and be buried inside the jail!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was probably the <span class=SpellE>mis</span>-reporting abroad of his humorous
approach to serious situations like this which caused some of his critics to
cast doubt on his sincerity. They could not understand, as we could, that
without a strongly developed sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, a
capacity to see the funny side of grim reality, Gandhiji might not have been
able to endure the trials and tribulations of the spirit and the flesh which
destiny had prepared for him. As Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Sarojini</span> <span
class=SpellE>Naidu</span> well put it, “Few people <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
that Mahatma Gandhi’s laughter was the only relieving factor in his life and he
needed to laugh because he was wise. He needed to laugh because he was called
upon to bear the world’s burden.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji’s</span> English friends once sent him five
questions, one being whether he thought a sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
necessary in life. <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji’s</span> revealing reply was
that, if he had had no sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>, he would long
ago have committed suicide. He was a modern saint with a sense of <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>, a rare combination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
reflected in his eyes more than any other man the agonies of the world, thought
Robert <span class=SpellE>Bernays</span>, but he could joke about little
inconsequential things as though without a care, or jest about his </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>own
fate. He rarely played with words, but on one occasion he punned with the
expression “yarn spinning.” Speaking about the need for spinning, he remarked
that they had “spun” many a “yarn” on Congress platforms, but had yet to begin
to spin real yarn for Indian Swaraj. Another time, speaking of the need for
work rather than speech-making, he said, “Next I come to my ends friends who
talk, but who ‘toil not, neither do they spin’!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are numerous about his merciless extraction of money and goods from individuals
and crowded gatherings for his <span class=SpellE>Harijan</span> Fund. We can imagine
the Mahatma, <span class=SpellE>travelling</span> third class as usual on the

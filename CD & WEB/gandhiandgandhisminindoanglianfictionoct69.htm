Gandhi it may be said without the fear of exaggeration: he carne, he saw, he
conquered. His arrival on the Indian scene: marked the beginning of a new
political era and the <span class=SpellE>smouldering</span> national
consciousness leapt up into a mighty flame. He had already perfected his
instruments of social action in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region> and was sure of their efficacy in the
Indian context. The gift of <span class=SpellE><i>abhaya</i></span><i> </i>that
he gave made the servile Indian people rise to their full stature and the
nation was firmly poised on its march to freedom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ethic was no more than a restatement of
values preached and cherished from times immemorial, but the unique power lay
in the peculiar synthesis evolved to suit the demands of a specific situation.
He truly belonged to the masses and was the one leader who succeeded in
striking the right chord in the heart of the common man. It was through a
process of trial and error that he evolved his policies and programmes, and
thereby himself, and his ‘inner voice’ was always paramount to him.
Steadfastness to principles did not mean <span class=GramE>inflexibility</span>
and he was always willing to alter his stand if such was the prompting from
within. Personal salvation lay for him in service to the people and he was able
to see God as Truth–as an intuitive perception within himself and as a
realisation in life without. Gandhi, however, cannot be imprisoned within any
system and he evades the grasp of any so-called intellectual analysis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> revolution was like an earthquake which
shook the entire nation and every aspect of the life of the people received the
impact. Literature too was deeply influenced by Gandhism. In almost all the
regional literatures the writers tried to articulate the new idiom and herald
the new era. Literature acquired a fresh vitality and a social purpose, and
became an engine of revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

himself was a great practitioner of the written word, although writing for him
was not an end in itself but a prelude to action. He believed that art did not
have autonomy but was meaningful only when it served a concrete social purpose,
firmly ‘committed’ to the values of ‘good’ life. This does not, however,
diminish the importance of Gandhi himself as writer and his <i>Hind Swaraj </i>is
universally valued as an English <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>classic,
while his auto</span>biography is one of the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>priceless treasures of English literature, not to mention the many
other treatises and speeches which are alike memorable for the beauty and </span>power
of style. The force of style is verily <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the
result </span>of the force of the soul and the words wing their way to our
hearts. Apart from his own contribution, which is certainly quite considerable,
Gandhi was responsible for influencing many of the Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span>
writers who viewed the country’s situation with concern and concentration and
attempted to portray the <span class=SpellE>tranition</span> of the ‘heroic’
age in their work. Some of these examples are dealt with here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

influence was felt by the different literatures in various aspects and
intensities, even as his impact on the nation was many-sided. The tendency was
in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of simplicity in style and the writers
turned their attention from the elite of the cities to the common people of the
rural areas. The <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ethic had to combat
opposition at different levels and this clash forms the motive force for the
writing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there <span class=GramE>are</span> poets and dramatists also who creatively
responded to the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> impact, it is perhaps in
fiction that one finds a satisfactory expression of the whole range of <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> revolution. K. S. <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani</span>,
for example, is one of the earliest and most notable interpreters of the <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ‘heroic’ age. His two novels <span class=SpellE><i>Murugan</i></span><i>
the Tiller </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>Kandan</i></span><i> the Patriot </i>are
remarkable expositions of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> economics and

friends, <span class=SpellE>Ramu</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kedari</span>,
whose different roads finally lead them to the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Rome</st1:place></st1:City> of rural reconstruction. <span
class=SpellE>Ramu</span> follows the humble, if also humdrum, way of a clerk in
Government service and achieves goodwill and recognition through steadiness and
sincerity. This, of course means the gradual snapping of his rural ties, but <span
class=SpellE>Ramu</span> takes it all in the stride because he knows that once
the game is begun it has to be played till the end and that the long and hard
way is the best way to be educated. His friend, <span class=SpellE>Kedari</span>,
however, is made <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>different
stuff and wishes, as a lawyer, to achieve speedy success and prosperity. At the
height <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>worldly success, he
suffers a fall and pays the price of being adventurous. Even <span
class=SpellE>Murugan</span>, the tiller of <span class=SpellE>Ramu’s</span>
fields and gardens, who was given an opportunity by the latter to lead an
honest life of bright possibilities succumbs to evil influences and makes a
mess <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>his life. Quick
financial gains turn his head and he is caught up in an unseemly situation that
leads him behind the bars. He escapes and joins the outlaws in the hills. It is
finally <span class=SpellE>Ramu</span> who has to rehabilitate both <span
class=SpellE>Kedari</span> and <span class=SpellE>Murugan</span> as the author <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the ingenious scheme <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>building a reservoir across the
river <span class=SpellE>Arni</span>. He also strives to secure citizenship
rights for the outlaws of the hills and turns them into constructive social
workers. He is himself prepared to share their lot and live as one among them
working for the common weal and refuses to be lured by the offer of a
Collectorship. It is not this exalted office but the new village, <span
class=SpellE>Meenakshipuram</span>, which is his true <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>.
Probably <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani</span> was influenced in this by the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:place></st1:City> settlement and
the Tolstoy farm of Gandhi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

political message notwithstanding, the novel is a true and effective picture of
Indian village life. The scenes are familiar and the characters are typical.
The river scene at <span class=SpellE>Alavanti</span> is a kind of running
commentary on the happenings of the novel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The second Round Table Conference was attended by Gandhi as the single
representative <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>the Indian
National Congress and proved a failure. There was a resumption of the Civil
Disobedience movement which resulted in large-scale repression and mass
arrests. The novel came out serially in the <i>Swarajya, </i><span class=GramE>then</span>
a daily edited by the great Andhra leader, the late Sri <span class=SpellE>Tanguturi</span>

gives up the coveted I.C.S. His mental <span class=SpellE>calibre</span>
reminds us of <span class=SpellE>Kedari</span> and his humble and total

One finds all the peculiar features of a village–a toddy-shop that is the haunt
of the villagers, a <span class=SpellE>zamindar</span> who has a natural sense
of authority and tries to do things as he <span class=GramE>likes,</span> a
small railway station with a junior station-master, etc. One also has clear
glimpses of the imposing <span class=SpellE>Adyar</span> guest house, the busy <span
class=SpellE>Egmore</span> station and the crowded Boat Mail. The remarkable
excellence of the novel is that each scene and every character have their
specific significance in the total context of the action. <span class=GramE>The

the numberless <span class=SpellE>Satyagrahis</span> gather for a public
meeting in defiance of prohibitory orders.</span> The crowd is asked to disperse
in two minutes–an order impossible to obey–and when that is not done there is <span
class=SpellE>lathi</span> charge and firing. A stray bullet kills <span
class=SpellE>Kandan</span> and he dies a martyr. In the end all the characters
undergo a translation of roles and there is the hope expressed that the freedom
of the country would soon be a reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

action of the novel which races at a breath-taking speed has a splendid unity
about it. Certain words and phrases are used in more than one sense. Thus the
word ‘collision’ is applicable to a variety of contexts. The log of wood that <span
class=SpellE>Kandan</span> pushes into the river is symbolic of the predicament
of the country, which too is in need of a purposive push. <span class=SpellE>Kandan</span>
dies thirsting for water and this thirst is referred to as one for freedom.
These similes and symbolic extensions fit so aptly and effortlessly into the
context and add to the charm and depth of the novel. The titles of the chapters
in both the novels form an interesting subject for examination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is, however, an extension to the novel in
which Gandhi is himself introduced. Three different cures are suggested to
tackle the malady of untouchability. The first is the way of Colonel
Hutchinson, the Salvationist, who ,promises to <span class=SpellE>Bakha</span>
Christ’s compassion, but somehow <span class=SpellE>Bakha</span> does not
understand why he should regard himself as a sinner. Then he hears Gandhi’s
soothing words in the park on the theme of <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span>.
The very word ‘<span class=SpellE>Harijan</span>’ electrifies him and he hears
Gandhi with rapt attention, although he does not fully follow the meaning. He
is thrilled when the Mahatma declares that if he should have another birth, he
would prefer to be born a <span class=SpellE>Harijan</span>. Gandhi further
points out that the <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span> are actually responsible
for cleaning the Hindu society and adds that they should clean themselves too
by getting rid of evil habits like liquor and gambling. In other words Gandhi
states that it is for <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span> themselves to achieve
their emancipation. <span class=SpellE>Bakha</span> is deeply moved by what
Gandhi says. He is horrified that the caste Hindus should have perpetuated such
a great discrimination, which was actually not religious in origin. But soon he
has a third experience and that is with the poet, <span class=SpellE>Iqbal</span>
<span class=SpellE>Nath</span> <span class=SpellE>Sarshar</span>. For him the
answer to <span class=SpellE>untouchability</span> lies in the Machine–the
flush system. Then the so-called untouchables would assume their legitimate
dignity and lead the lives of useful members in a casteless and classless
society. The tow approaches of Gandhi and the Poet profoundly influence <span
class=SpellE>Bakha</span>; Gandhi’s approach is aimed at correcting the present,
the poet’s approach presents for the bright vision of the better future.
Commenting on this E. M. Forster points out in the preface, “Some readers may
find this closing section of the book too voluble and sophisticated, in
comparison with the clear observation which has preceded it, but it is an
integral part of the author’s scheme. It is the necessary climax, and it has
mounted up with triple effect. <span class=SpellE>Bakha</span> returns to his
father and his wretched bed, thinking now of the Mahatma, now of the machine.
His Indian day is over and the next day will be like it, but on the surface of
the earth if not in the depths of the sky, a change is at hand.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In an illuminating
article, <span class=SpellE>Mulk</span> <span class=SpellE>Raj</span> <span
class=SpellE>Anand</span> throws a beam of light on the biographical context of
<i>Untouchable</i>. He tells us how the “book poured out like hot lava from the
volcano of my crazed imagination, during a long week-end.” He was influenced,
as far as the technique was concerned, by Joyce’s <i>Ulysses</i>, and though
that it was possible to probe the life of a single character in a single day,
that the stream of consciousness method could be used to suggest value
judgments about the characters and finally that there could be a novel on
anything provided there was a pattern. He chanced to read about Gandhi’s
concern for the outcastes and decided to set him and read out to him portions
of his novel. He went to Gandhi, stayed in the Ashram and participated in
latrine-cleaning. This too had its impact on him and it gave him the necessary
spiritual training which made him look upon all work as worship. He was somewhat
transformed from the Blooms-bury intellectual to a more ‘emphatically
self-conscious Indian.’ His life was simplified and he decided to write about
the poor. All this had, of course, something to do with his general attitude as
writer, but one finds in <i>Untouchable </i>the clear impact of his encounter
with Gandhi. The novel gains in intensity with the physical participation of
Gandhi himself in the action. It is the moving cry of an <span class=SpellE>agonised</span>
soul that in truth there is nothing like caste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

drifts along the flood of revolution which leaves a trail of destruction. In
this novel too the introduction of Gandhi is significant and yet another of his
cardinal principles is stressed. One’s fiercest enemy is one’s fear and that
should be eliminated if freedom is to be won. The revolutionary who does not <span

evolution but depends on physical force careers only to confusion destruction.
The consistent touch of sharp satire highlights the futility of the
revolutionary creed. Here again, Anand gives us not a mere political document

one of the confused and tumultuous phases of Indian history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

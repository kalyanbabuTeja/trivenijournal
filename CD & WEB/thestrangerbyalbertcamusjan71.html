Camus belongs not only to France but to the world. His untimely death in an
automobile accident in 1962, has removed from us a great literary figure and a
man of considerable authority deeply concerned with the spiritual dilemma of
our age. Camus’ assumption that life has no ultimate meaning, his determined
refusal of hope exactly fit the mood of our times. He is eminently fitted for
the task of presenting the current crisis in human affairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Camus’
work has a special appeal for the reason that Camus is a humanist with a deep
sympathy for mankind. His sympathy springs from a full and often poignant life.
He worked in close company of other men and women in an ardent common cause–the
Resistance Movement–and he suffered deeply in his personal life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
approaching Camus’ work it is necessary to bear in mind the two complementary
themes with which Camus’ name is associated: the theme of Absurdity and Revolt,
treated in his essays; the Myth of Sisyphus and Revolt. The word ‘absurd’ is
misleading if rendered literally into English. The best English equivalent
would seem to be ‘futile’ or ‘purposeless,’ though even these words do not
convey Camus’ meaning accurately. The state of absurdity results from man’s
desire to understand his destiny and the limitations of his intelligence to do
so–from man’s aspiration towards immortality and the realization of mortality,
from his desire for achievement and the vanity of all human aspiration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
concept of absurdity became essential to Camus. A robust, athletic youngman
confident of the future, Camus suddenly learnt that he had tuberculosis and
most of his hopes were blighted. Soon after this came Munich, the European war and
the collapse of France. The young Camus was suddenly confronted by a wall of
the absurd. <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>It<b> </b></span>seemed to
him that Man wants rationality but he is faced everywhere by the irrational.
Man is impelled by the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>will </span>to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>control </span>and steer his fate <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>but </span>he is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>powerless </span>to do so. He <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>longs
</span>for freedom, fraternity; everywhere he encounters a selfish social
order, a dried up bureaucracy, a mechanized <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>world </span>on the brink of another impersonal mass-slaughter. Camus
refused to take solace in the idea of some comforting transcendence. It is that
atheistic attitude which draws Camus <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>strongly
</span>towards the existential philosophers. But as Satre has pointed out Camus
is not an existentialist. It is true that he shares many of their views. Like
them, he too finds it impossible to take up an attitude of easy optimism. As
Camus had said on one occasion “it is impossible for anyone of the generation
which had grown up to the drum beats of the First World War to be hopeful.” Our
history since then has been a continuous <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>tale
</span>of murder, violence, and injustice. As such, it is not surprising that
we find Camus writing repeatedly about death, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>violence, </span>the utter absurdity and incoherence of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was with the publication of his <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>novel,
<i>The Stranger</i>, </span>in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>1942, </span>that
Camus first became one of the best known French writers. The <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>novel </span>provides not the demonstration
but the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>feel </span>of the absurd–as
Camus conceives it. In this brief <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>novel
</span>Camus presents a hero hitherto unknown in fiction–a fusion of Camus’
metaphysical ideas and his observation of human conduct. Meursault, an Algerian
clerk, is indeed an outsider, a stranger <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>alienated
</span>not merely from society but also from himself. He lives from day to day,
almost hour to hour, without any <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>beliefs
</span>and motivations. He has no purpose <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>in </span>life and no ideal to give definition to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his </span>actions. Indeed, no single or
particular action seems to him more essential than another. To give an <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>example, </span>in the opening pages of the
novel Meursault receives the news of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his
</span>mother’s death. The thought of her death and the faint annoyance he <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>feels </span>at having to ask for two days
casual leave to attend the funeral weigh equally with him. Similarly in the
office the pleasant dryness of the towel at midday and its clamminess in the
evening seems to capture <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his </span>attention
more than the prospect of a transfer or promotion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>life </span>is a drab and uneventful
one. He <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lives </span>a singularly
detached, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>unemotional life. </span>His
first conflict with the code of society occurs at his mother’s funeral. His
calm air of detachment, and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lack </span>of
expression of grief shock the inmates and officials of the home for the aged
where <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Meursault </span>had placed his
mother three years <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>earlier </span>since
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>they </span>had <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>nothing </span>more to s<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>ay to </span>one another. Meursault
experiences things vividly enough on the physical plane. He notes with a kind
of clinical detachment such details as the colours of the nurses’ dress, the
newness of the nails in his mother’s coffin. While his senses are finely
receptive of his experience, his mind gives it no total meaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

goes swimming the next day with a girl called Marie, takes her to a movie and
goes to bed with her that night. When he meets her again, Marie asks him
whether he loves her. The question is meaningless to him and he says as much.
But he agrees to her suggestion that they should get married with a typical
remark that it is all the same to him. He next becomes involved in an
unpleasant brawl with some Arabs because of his acquaintance with a rather
unsavoury neighbour, Raymond. In the course of the brawl Meursault sees the
glint of the sun on the Arab’s knife, pulls the trigger of the revolver which
he is carrying and kills the Arab-without understanding why or even caring to
enquire into the reasons. His only excuse is that the sunlight dazzled him and
produced a momentary hallucination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is when Meursault is brought to justice that he comes into conflict for the
second time with conventional ethics. The Judge and Jury attach greater blame
to his callous behaviour at the time of his mother’s funeral than to his actual
crime. Meursault feels strangely remote from their strictures like an outsider
at the trial of a stranger. He is condemned to death. The passivity with which
he greeted all that had happened suddenly breaks down at the prison chaplain’s
visit. The chaplain’s prayers and the consolation he offers of another life
sting Meursault into a violent affirmation that his life alone is certain. It
is a moment of illumination. When confronted by death Meursault is forced to
evaluate experiences which will be denied to him forever. To the surprise of
the readers Meursault realizes that he has been happy in his life and that he
would like to live it all over again. He hopes that at his execution there will
be many people who will greet him with cries of hatred. At a first reading this
ending is incomprehensible. But in this outburst Camus is, as it were,
providing a justification for Meursault’s apathy throughout. For Meursault the
absurdity arises out of his realisation of his own mortality. As he says, “What
did other people’s death matter, what did love for my mother matter, what did
his God matter, since one fate would single me out and together with me a
million others?” Thus one reason for Meursault’s apathy is the continuous
prospect of death–it is one aspect of the absurd. The absurd also frees man
from all feeling of responsibility, annihilates the future and leaves only one
certainty–the sensation of being alive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reading the novel one finds oneself asking the question, in what way is this
man Meursault relevant to us and to our times? Meursault obviously symbolises
modern man who is a product of science and technology, one without a moral or
religious purpose, in short, the pattern of thousands of twentieth century
people who do not believe in anything outside the boundaries of their own lives.

a working out of Camus’ belief that human destiny, with all its contradictions,
must be accepted as it is and life must be lived accordingly. This life need
not be transcended but it has to be lived. Although Meursault appears as a
stranger to society and himself, he is not completely indifferent to the world.
Meursault’s domain is the physical world. To swim, to walk, to feel the sun on
the face and to make love–it is these experiences which have given him
happiness and which make him wish to live the same life again. Indeed Meursault’s
awareness of the colours, lights and sensations of the external world is so
acute that at times it seems to recall a mystical experience. Camus does not
mask the despair inherent in the human condition. Through Meursault’s
characterisation he shows us that the absurdity of the world is paradoxically
enough, an invitation to happiness. As Camus puts it, “death comes to everyone,
but after all, the sun warms our bodies despite everything.” It is an
acceptance of the tragic dualism of life. Camus seems to believe in a life
given over only to the present without myths, without the consolation of
traditional religious or moral beliefs. Camus is an optimist about the value of
man though a pessimist about his destiny. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

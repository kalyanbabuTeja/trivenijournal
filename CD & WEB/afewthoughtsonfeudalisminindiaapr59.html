style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
mankind passed through several distinct stages in the development of the means
of production. In the infancy of civilization, every group of mankind passed
through the nomadic, the pastoral and the agricultural epochs. Clans and
tribes, knit together by blood relationship, living by hunting and fishing, had
common property in hunting grounds and in fishing waters and in places of
shifting habitation; and they moved with their herds and flocks compelled by
hostile tribes or by the diminution or scarcity of food and fodder. The growth
in numbers of the tribe and the formation of large family units, after the
disappearance of <span class=SpellE>nomadism</span> and promiscuity, and after
the emergence of the field and the family, necessitated the settling down on
fixed habitations, the villages. The transition from food-gathering to
food-growing, from the stone and the arrow to the plough, was a step towards
the formation of families which were undivided for generations together as
social and economic units. The German <i>Mark, </i>the Russian <i>Mir </i>and
the South Indian <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><i>Ur</i></st1:place></st1:City><i>
</i>had one common characteristic in ancient times, namely, the institution of
common property in land for a number of blood-knit <span class=GramE>families</span>
who tilled the land in common, and who divided the yield more or less equally
among all the related inhabitants of the settlement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
idea of communal property was constantly referred to by Hindu law-givers and
Hindu commentators: like Manu, <span class=SpellE>Yajnavalkya</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Apastamba</span>, <span class=SpellE>Gautama</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Sayana</span>, <span class=SpellE>Savara</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Jaimini</span>. All of them expressed the view that the king was
entitled to a share of the produce of the land in return for his protection of
the life and the property of his people. The king was never empowered to sell
the peasant’s land for default in the payment of his revenue. Broadly speaking,
the <span class=SpellE>distraint</span> or the sale of land was alien to the
Hindu code of property. (‘Land Tenures in the Madras Presidency’, by <span
class=SpellE>Soundararaja</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>, pages
11-12.) That land was originally owned by groups and not by individuals, and
that individual proprietorship came into vogue at a very late period have been
proved by the investigations both of <span class=SpellE>Vinogradoff</span> in <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> and of Sir Henry Maine in the East. The ancient
village community in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was a patriarchal society consisting of co-proprietors of land. It was a
brotherhood of peasants who acknowledged the tie of common ancestry, and who
maintained the common management of arable fields and pasture lands for many
generations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was tacitly understood that each head of a family unit, in the tribal
brotherhood; should hold, in separate possession, the land on which his own
family expended <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, and should enjoy the, results
of the family’s <span class=SpellE>labour</span>, as long as he and his family
contributed their share of revenue to the larger pool that was paid to the
sovereign. It was inevitable that the tribal brotherhood should soon split into
such units, these units having lived together generation after generation, till
they became unwieldy for a single roof or for a single kitchen. Each family
inherited a unit of ancestral property which it did not think at or once of
getting separated from the property-units of the other families. It was partly
time-<span class=SpellE>honoured</span> custom, and partly the consciousness of
the economic advantage of collective <span class=SpellE>labour</span>. Sir
Henry Maine said: “As a fact, however, a division rarely takes place even at
the death of the father, and the property constantly remains undivided for
several generations, though every member of every generation has a legal right
to an undivided share in it.” <span class=GramE>(‘Ancient Law’ by Sir Henry
Maine.)</span> It could be stated as a general rule that each original village
community was founded by a single assemblage of blood </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
spite of the admission of strangers into the community, and the division of <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> arising out of the differentiation of occupational
groups (which later hardened into castes), the tradition of common ancestry is
still preserved in the memory of many a village community. <span class=SpellE>Mountstuart</span>
<span class=SpellE>Elphinstone</span>, who studied South Indian communities in
particular, expressed the view that, in a large number of villages, there were
only single families of landholders who branched out into more members; their
rights over lands were collectively held; and no landholder could sell or
mortgage his rights without the previous consent of the entire village; and the
share of an extinct family returned to the common stock. (‘History of <st1:country-region

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Thus,
the prevalence of co-ownership marked most of the village communities in
ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
These proprietary brotherhoods had grown and expanded in North and <st1:place
w:st="on">South India</st1:place> more or less on a similar pattern. And it has
been said that the Russian village was also organized just like the Indian
brotherhood, but with one difference. In spite of the co-proprietorship of the
village land, the separate rights of individuals continued indefinitely in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>; but in a
Russian village, after a given period, separate ownership was extinguished, and
the land of the village was thrown together and redistributed among the
families composing the community. The tradition of such redistribution and
interchangeability of land-holdings has survived in many parts of Andhra till
the beginning of the nineteenth century, in the form of the <span class=SpellE><i>visapadi</i></span><i>
</i>or <span class=SpellE><i>visabuddy</i></span><i>; </i>it has been handed
down in the form of <span class=SpellE><i>mirasi</i></span><i> </i>tenure in <span
class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span>. Sir Thomas Munro has described <span
class=SpellE><i>visapadi</i></span><i> </i>as follows: ‘The land and rents were
divided into sixteen shares. When the season of cultivation draws near, all the
<span class=SpellE>ryots</span> of <span class=SpellE><i>visapadi</i></span><i>
</i>villages assemble to regulate their several rents for the year. They
ascertain the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>amount of agricultural stock of each individual,
and of the whole body, and the quantity of land to which it is adequate; </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
they divide it accordingly, giving each man a portion which he has the means of
cultivating, and fixing his share of rent; and, whether his share be one or two
sixteenths, he </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pays this proportion, whether the whole rent of
the village be higher or lower than that of the last year.’ ” (The Gazetteer of
<span class=SpellE>Cuddapah</span>, pages 146-147.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The original organization of production
was within the framework of the caste system which, historically, was the
Indian version of a class structure, and which was part of Indian feudalism
while it , lasted, as well as part of its sequel in history when feudalism
began to split and burst. The privileges of some and the penalties of others
prescribed in <i>Manu <span class=SpellE>Smriti</span> </i>clearly reveal the
status once enjoyed by </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the privileged classes, <span
class=SpellE><i>vis-a-vis</i></span><i> </i>the producing classes in a feudal
order. The Indian social scene still carries with it the historical residues of
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>these privileges and penalties. The ruling castes–the
Kshatriyas and the Brahmins–had rights over men and things, with little or no
corresponding duties, comparatively speaking; while the producing classes–the <span
class=SpellE>Dasas</span>, the <span class=SpellE>Sudras</span>, the <span
class=SpellE>Chandalas</span>, the Pariahs, etc.,–had duties, with little or no
corresponding rights, comparatively speaking. The caste system, which was the
basis or the background of production, consumption, exchange, and distribution
in ancient Indian Society, certainly, for a long time, contributed to the
development of the productive powers of society. It was a partnership of the
Monarchy and the Church in<i> </i>a protracted phase of Indian feudalism. By
supervised agriculture and supervised industry, in their primitive simplicity,
the village community, in supporting Indian feudalism, supplied the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>surplus
necessary for the state apparatus: for the maintenance of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>public
works, and for the patronage of largely religious architecture, largely
religious art, and largely religious literature. The hereditary division of <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>, based on the inequitable <span class=SpellE><i>Varnasrama</i></span><i>
Dharma, </i>with its legal immutability aided by the immobility of social
classes the autonomous and self-sufficient village communities in their
seclusion, cherishing, and crushed under, the tenets of an unchanging <i>Dharma;
</i>the outcastes, the possible relics of cross-breeding, suffering with mute
resignation the disabilities of slave, serf and <span class=SpellE><i>chandala</i></span><i>
</i>rolled into one: these were the basic characteristics of the historically
not-so-distant primitive Hindu society. The priest and the patriarch, the Brahmin
and the <span class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span>, who lived on the surplus <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> of the rural artisans and peasants, represented the
main exploiting classes. To these were added, in succeeding chapters of Indian
history, wherever Kshatriyas did not exist or Kshatriyas ceased to rule, rulers
and leaders of men who belonged to the Sudra caste, who displaced or
supplemented the Kshatriyas, who behaved exactly like the Kshatriyas, and who
exploited the <span class=SpellE>labour</span> of others exactly like the
Brahmins and the Kshatriyas. It was easier to displace or to supplement the <span
class=SpellE>Kshatriya</span> than to displace or to supplement the Brahmin in
the early feudal epochs, but that too was done in several patches of the Indian
continent, and Sudra spiritual leaders held the souls of their fellow-men in
fief, and joined the historical exploitation of the <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
of others. This socio-religious fabric of caste ideology was the breeding
ground of Indian feudalism in which men, of whichever caste, who could exploit
the <span class=SpellE>labour</span> of others did not scruple to live by such
exploitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every
ruling class has its own methods of creating an institution of servile <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> for exploitation. Long before the outcastes had been
brought to serfdom there was some type of slavery in ancient India. Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Winternitz</span> says that, though <span class=SpellE>Megasthenes</span>
emphatically states that there was no slavery in India, “both the <span
class=SpellE><i>Artha</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Sastra</span> </i>and
the <i>Dharma <span class=SpellE>Sastras</span> </i>know different kinds of
male and female slaves.” Law-givers like <span class=SpellE>Apastamba</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Gautama</span>, <span class=SpellE>Narada</span>, Manu, <span
class=SpellE>Yajnavalkya</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Brihaspati</span> <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> the existence of this institution, and laid down
regulations for it. We have many references to slavery in the <span
class=SpellE><i>Jatakas</i></span><i>, </i>and in the <span class=SpellE><i>Artha</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Sastra</span>. </i><span class=SpellE>Shri</span> <span
class=SpellE>Radhakumud</span> <span class=SpellE>Mukherjee</span> noted in his
‘Hindu Civilization’ the following types of slaves: a captive in war <i>(<span
class=SpellE>dhvajahrita</span>), </i>a slave for food <i>(<span class=SpellE>bhaktadasa</span>),
</i>a hereditary slave <i>(<span class=SpellE>grihaja</span>), </i>a slave
acquired by purchase <i>(<span class=SpellE>krita</span>), </i>by gift <i>(<span
class=SpellE>datrima</span>), </i>or by inheritance <i>(<span class=SpellE>paitrika</span>),
</i>and a slave under debt <i>(<span class=SpellE>dandadasa</span>). </i>“Every
slave, penal included, was allowed to work out his ransom... The <span
class=SpellE><i>sudra</i></span><i> </i>helot had come into his own, under
state control, to make large scale chattel slavery unnecessary for food
production.” (‘An Introduction to the Study of Indian History’ by <span
class=SpellE>Kasent</span>, page 120)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the course of the development of Indian feudalism, the tribal chieftain
(belonging to any of the castes) gained predominance over hundreds of villages,
by virtue of military prowess or seniority of leadership in patriarchal
society. By virtue of this ascendancy he acquired the right to a contribution
from the wealth the villagers produced. Whether it was blackmail or tribute, he
robbed the village communes of a goodly portion of their produce, and used it
to perpetuate his ascendancy over them, and to wage wars on his rivals within
and without his dominion. When larger areas came under his control he delegated
his power to lesser chieftains or he farmed out the revenue to contractors.
Instead of paying them monetary allowances for their services, which was not
feasible in a predominantly agricultural economy, he simply distributed the
authority to collect revenue and to retain a portion of it as remuneration. The
vanquished chieftains were allowed to pay tribute which was a percentage of the
revenue collected by them. Thus, these intermediaries who owed fiscal and military
obligations to their super-lord became the overlords of areas and parts within
the kingdom. The authority of these intermediaries was derivative and dependent
on the fulfillment of certain prescribed conditions. So long as they conformed
to the conditions and terms of the commission and transmitted the stipulated
portion of the proceeds, they enjoyed their suzerainty over the village
communities. If the intermediary found himself oppressed or humiliated, and was
strong enough to challenge the super-lord, he raised the banner of revolt and
carved out a kingdom of his own. Else he kept faith. There were innumerable
feudal wars with their source in feudal ambitions. This process was in

England the king was both landlord and sovereign. And the barons were not only
landlords but a combination of legislative, executive and judicial authority
within the area of the feudal estate. There was no clear-cut distinction
between taxes and rents. The position was no doubt gradually altered between
the thirteenth and the seventeenth centuries. From the signing of the Magna <span
class=SpellE>Carta</span> there broke out a series of revolts which compelled
the king to recognize the rights of the tenants as proprietors. The barons
collectively fixed their cash payments to the king, and transformed the
arbitrary rule of the sovereign into a system of common law, hammered out in
the baronial struggles. The king ceased to be the landlord, and became only the
sovereign who ruled with the consent of the barons. The rent charges were fixed
as definite taxes payable according to contract. These collective, economic
struggles of the barons gave rise to constitutional rights which, through the
centuries, evolved into the fabric of the British Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

European manor was an organization which regulated the rights of the village,
the rights of the separate peasant-holders and the rights of the overlord. The
peasants were bound to the overlord through the obligations of personal service
to him. He was sovereign of the estate, and took a personal interest in the
agricultural process and regulated its operations constantly to his advantage.
The rights of the overlords always came into conflict with the rights of the
peasants. As a result of struggles like the Peasants’ Revolt, and by reason of
the development of the money economy, personal services were commuted into
money rents, and the serf became a tenant. The enclosure movement in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was another factor which transformed medieval
agriculture in England. And thereby the rights and obligations of peasants
underwent another transformation. The open field system was superseded, and the
modern rural hierarchy of land-owners, tenants and agricultural <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian
feudalism was based on a different conception of sovereign authority. The
European monarch passed on to his barons power over persons as well as power
over property in land, in return for allegiance and military services. This
Roman conception of <i>dominium</i> was alien to India. The king here never
created subordinate barons with proprietary rights over land, for, in theory,
the king was not a supreme owner of land. He was the lord of the earth, not a
proprietor of the soil. What he delegated was the revenue-collecting power. And
even that power was not hereditary, for the intermediary could be removed at
the king’s sweet will and pleasure. The king was not <i>primus inter pares, </i>and
the baron was not a partner in sovereign authority. There could, therefore, be
no baronial struggle, and the barons never combined to fight for their
collective rights. The Indian baron could take up arms and repudiate loyalty to
the king, and if he was powerful enough he could defeat royalty, and assume the
insignia of royalty himself. Thus the conflict of interests, when it arose
between the king and the intermediary overlords, did not produce constitutional
and political developments. The Indian overlords could never oppose the
sovereign, acting in unison as a coherent body, for their position had no legal
sanction nor basis in contemporary and customary jurisprudence. They were of
different grades, had no standing armies, rarely met together to discuss
affairs of state, and had not sworn common allegiance to a single sovereign.
The geographical vastness of the open Indian continent, compared to the small
sea-girt area of England, and the incidence in Indian history of perpetual
invasion of local sovereignty by external authority, compared to the seclusion
of Britain after 1066 A. D., contributed to the absence of the factors of
baronial solidarity and of monarchical continuity in India, and there was no
appropriated power, which an evolving State could constitutionally inherit,
consolidate and increase in India till the British left in 1947.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

European manor consisted of both the peasants’ lands and the overlords’ domain,
and the overlord constantly depended upon the peasants and the serfs for
various services in his domain. Indian feudalism, on the other hand, was merely
fiscal and military. The peasant was not the direct serf of the overlord, and
was not bound to offer all kinds of services at his beck and call. He was a
member of the village community which enjoyed autonomy, and regulated the
rights and obligations of its members, without outside interference, and the
community was under the guidance of its village elders. When the overlord or
revenue-farmer was oppressive in his demands, the peasants non-co-operated, and
even left the village to settle down in a distant part of the country, for the
land was abundant and their freedom of movement was not restricted by customary
law. Normally, the overlord demanded a small share of the gross produce of the
land, though, in times of war, the sovereign directed him to collect more,
regardless of the interests of the peasants. The revenue-farmers had their own
land which was cultivated by hired <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and by
slaves, for the overlord had to be sure of an uninterrupted supply of food
grains in times of famine, drought or other calamity. And when the sovereign
required land for his own purposes he bought it from the villagers. “That the
ownership of the soil was not vested in the sovereign is proved by a variety of
arguments. One of these is remarkable, being drawn from the fact that the
emperors purchased land when they wanted it. <span class=SpellE>Akbar</span>
purchased land for the forts of <span class=SpellE>Akbarabad</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Illahabad</span>; Shah <span class=SpellE>Jahan</span> for the

the land belongs to the <span class=SpellE>zamindar</span> and the revenue to
the king. And, according to <span class=SpellE>Mahommedan</span> law, the
sovereign has a right of property in the tribute or revenue; but he who has
tribute from the land has no property in the land.” (‘Field and Holding,’ page

produce of the soil to the overlords or revenue-farmers who exercised their
power by virtue of their military force. Though this super-imposition of a
military hierarchy over groups of villages was common to both European and
Indian feudalism, India did not witness those economic and political conflicts
between baron and king, or between baron and peasant. Most of the conflicts in
Indian history had for their objects the exercise of rights over the village,
not the exercise of rights within the village. Unlike European overlords who

by the East India Company in the nineteenth century land in India was not a
commodity with a saleable value, for private property in land was rarely
desired or accumulated by the peasants due to very high assessment. Land could
become saleable only if it yielded a surplus or rent to the proprietor after
meeting the cost of cultivation. The assessment in India was always high, and
most of the peasants lived at a bare subsistence level; “In the northern
portion of the (Madras) Presidency, comprising the Telugu districts, there is
no reason to suppose that the conditions were originally different from those
that existed in other parts of the Madras Presidency. These northern districts
were the first to be occupied by the <span class=SpellE>Mahommedans</span>, and
formed the seat of their government, and, on account of the high taxation
levied by them, the lands lost their saleable value; and the continuance of
that state for centuries effaced all traces of disposition of lands from the
memory of men. Therefore, at the time when those districts came first under the
power of the English, no traces of sale or other disposition of lands could be

English laws and usages, the Company conferred proprietary rights over

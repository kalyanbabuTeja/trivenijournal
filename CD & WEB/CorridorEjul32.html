<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[Private room in a hospital. Hospital bed, screen, chair, bureau. The</I> <I>screen is in front of the bed, so that the patient is not seen by the audience].</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Time: Evening</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>(Entering after the curtain rises. She studies the chart.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>(Entering shortly after, a middle-aged and sympathetic woman. In a whisper)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is she still asleep?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think so.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What kind of an afternoon did she have?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Restless and nervous.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She's all right physically, but her nerves have gone to pieces. Her husband's death nearly killed her.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SEMPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sad for one so young.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>

<P>She hasn't the will to live. That is what is making the situation serious.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SASTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctor said it is imperative we do everything to keep her cheerful.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRs. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will take her a long time to recover from the shock. They adored one another. He was really a very good husband. Tragic, wasn't it, to die like that overnight.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was, indeed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have you ever been in love, Sister?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Amused)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Me? Oh, no, no! Not I! But I understand all the same. I can imagine a great deal about it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's been so long since I've been in love. I've almost forgotten about it. It never seems right for young people to be torn apart. I wish they could have had each other a little longer…. Has she had any pains yet?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(She begins to straighten the room.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Too bad! She's becoming more and more restless. These last hours are the worst. I'm a wreck myself, but I try not to let her see it. Well, guess I'll sit down<I>. </I>I won't remain long. I promised her I would drop in this evening, so I came back, even though it is such a warm night...<I>..</I>How is that English woman's baby? Can they save it?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope so<I>. </I>Dr. Bakerfield is working hard over it. If anyone can pull it through, he can.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't you get upset by the continual tragedies you see around you?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SITER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Serenely)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I accept God's will. I do my best, He does the rest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I envy your serenity. I’d go to  pieces in your place. I can't bear to see people suffer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life is a good teacher of philosophy. We see life in a hospital, plenty of it.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm glad my daughter is in this hospital, for it's the best equipped in town.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SITER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We try to keep it so. Where human life is involved, no expense is too great.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(She starts to go.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Stopping her)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's what I've always said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sister......No, run along, I won't bother. I'll sit here quietly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE </P>

<P>I'm in no hurry. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the doctor call during my absence?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear me, he doesn't call often. I hope he can be found when we need him. That's the trouble with these big specialists, there’s no chance of ever getting hold of them. And I encouraged her to choose Dr. Bakerfield. I wonder whether I was righht in doing so?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Rather reprovingly)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was here this morning, Mrs. Allen, and we are in constant communication with him. He is keeping careful watch over the case.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know he is, and don't misunderstand me, I have full confidence in his ability. Only I would like to have a chat with him, every now and then. What is the use in being sick, unless on can talk with one's doctor?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Faintly)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sister......Sister......</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Going to the screen and pushing it gently aside)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You called?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes......I've been asleep, haven’t I?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish you'd put some <I>eau de cologne </I>on my handkerchief. Has my mother come?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She arrived a few minutes ago.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Push away the screen, will you? I won't mind the light. Oh, I'm uncomfortable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Sister Seraphine removes the screen to another part of the room.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish you'd bring me a glass of water. I'm terribly </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Sister Seraphine exits.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Approaching the bed)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Petulantly)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No......I don't think I slept much. I can't stand this waiting any longer. I'm so uncomfortable! –I don't want a baby. Why do I have to have one!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Drawing a chair near to the bed and sitting down)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now darling, don't talk like that! You will be happy as soon as it comes...It's restful here, after all the rush of the street, and cool. I had a nice shopping trip, only the crowds were worse than ever.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm hot. I wish there were an electric fan in the room. Did you buy anything?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Yes, a table-lamp.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought you wanted an umbrella.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the lamps were on sale and the umbrellas were not.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh, mother, how incorrigible you are! Nothing weakens your will power as much as a sale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's right, scold me. I know I deserve it. But shopping is the greatest fun I have! If I had more money I'd be down town every day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mother......before I was born......did you dread having a baby?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hardly remember. In my day, we used to take babies as much for granted as people now take vacuum cleaners. Every one had them, and that's all there was to it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish I weren't going to have a baby!......perhaps something will happen, and I'll die......I’ve thought a lot about that recently……I don't care though, it doesn't matter now that Frank is gone. I don't want to go on living without Frank.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear, you promised me you wouldn't allow such thoughts to come into your head any more. You know everything is going to be all right. You're not going to die. No one dies nowadays in child-birth.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Simply)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The woman next door died.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh…I didn't know that!...But her case was different from the beginning. Poor thing, the doctor advised her not to have a baby, only she wanted one so badly. Why don't women listen to doctors anyway? I always believed everything mine told me! She had complications, and should have heeded him. You, however, are in fine condition, and have nothing to worry about; the doctor told you so.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If only Frank were here, I wouldn't care! I'd want a baby, I don't want one without him. I feel so alone. You had father near when I was born.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, but he didn't help much. (Tenderly) Please don't feel alone, dear. I love you so much.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know you do, mother dear. I suppose I will love my baby after it's born. They say all mothers do......It's hard to believe that this little being so close within me will be even closer, when outside in my arms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I saw a delightful baby chair today.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Teasing)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On sale?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, only as it was for a baby two years old, I did not buy it. And I saw the most charming little blue jacket! I shall have to knit one like it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You're so excited you're going to have another baby to play with, you don't know what to do with yourself!……Do you remember the stories you used to read me when I was a  little girl?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should say I do. I can see you now, looking at me with big eyes, drinking in every word I said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you remember the one about the poor Hindu girl who was to become a mother? Her own mother lived far away in a village and had not yet arrived when the agonies of birth began? But the Virgin, who watches over all women in child-birth, and sends them courage with which to endure the pain, came in the likeness of her mother and guided her through the sacrament of birth? And then just before the real mother arrived, she vanished, and the young mother had no realization of what had happened?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I've forgotten that story.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But how could you, it was so charming. Don't you remember the girl thanked her mother for the marvellous tenderness shown, and the older woman to her astonishment replied that she had not shown any tenderness, as she had not arrived in time. Then only did they understand what had taken place, and both were overcome with gratitude.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All I remember is that &quot;Alibaba and Forty Thieves&quot; was your favorite story. You adored when I would say in a deep voice: <I>&quot;Open Sesame; Close Sesame.&quot;</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It gave me gooseflesh. I could never wait for the forty thieves to be trapped in the jars of oil! I guess most children have morbid curiosity......Did you bring my pink negligee?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, dear, I put it on top of the bureau.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(For the sake of making conversation)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did Sister Seraphine tell you that Naomi Moore, the actress, is in this floor? I think that's wonderful.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm crazy to see her. They say her baby is awfully cunning. It’s a little boy and born two days ago.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Eaters with a glass of water)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh, Sister Seraphine, tell me......is Naomi Moore's baby put in the glass case with all the other children at certain hours of the day?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Slightly amused)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, we make no discrimination with any baby. All are there at certain hours, It's the rule of the hospital.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can't believe it. That's democracy for you! Just imagine such a baby being put without distinction right by the side of any other. I think it's wonderful!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are always dozens of visitors to see the babies, and this way they are in no danger of picking up germs, because they can’t be touched.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Imagine how my son would have felt if he had been bathed, weighed, and put to sleep next to President Hoover as a baby!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(To Patient)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would you like something to eat, or a glass of milk?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing, thank you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'll be in the hall fixing reports. The evening is the best time to get them ready. Ring if you need me, and I'll return immediately.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Exits)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Isn't it wonderful the way these nuns run the hospitals? They are most efficient.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have an extraordinary system.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Now in her element)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They certainly serve wonderful trays! That was, delicious soup you had at luncheon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why didn't you take some? I asked if you weren't hungry. You said ‘no,’ you old darling.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't worry, next time I will!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm ashamed to be so on edge, when the nuns are so gentle. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Emotional again)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But sometimes I can't bear to go on living. I feel I'm going crazy. When I think of bringing a child into this terrible world, want to......I want to......No! I can't go through with it!...it's awful! Oh, mother, I am so tired, so weary, I wish you could stay me all night.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There, there, dear. 1 know you're tired, but soon it will be over, and you'll forget all about the discomfort, and even laugh about it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'll never forget about Frank. If only I weren't alone! It's terrible to go into the Valley of Death alone.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You won't be alone, dear, I'll be with you. And when your time really comes, a marvellous strength will pull you through. Supernatural courage is born into women at such times.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The loneliness is almost unendurable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear, we are never alone. Someday you will learn that. You're tired, that's all. The long months have worn down your resistance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm scared.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My little girl really isn't scared. She's braver than most women. Did Sister Seraphine tell you of the gorgeous flowers that movie actress is receiving?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her room is loaded with them. I think it is ridiculous the<I> </I>way those people spend money!</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would not! I certainly think it is wrong for one person to be smothered in roses, while others haven't even a cactus! I'm beginning to sympathize with the Socialists.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm glad! The father is a young college professor......they adore one another......he reminds me of Frank..... </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Agitate, trying to change the subject)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now dear, be calm! It's nothing, dear. You're just tired, that’s all. Mrs. Roberts has learnt a most wonderful new crochet stitch. I shall use it on the blue jacket. They showed it to her at department store. Department stores teach all kinds of things. They’re really getting to be like drug stores.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Friends should never be allowed to talk to pregnant women! I suppose Mrs. Oliver has been to call again. I particularly did not want her to see you the other day. What did she tell you?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A mouthful!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Annoyed)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And she's never even had a child! That's the way of it! She doesn't know what she is talking about! I asked her to be careful. She has a tongue as long as a railroad train, and as rattly as an egg-beater.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lying idly in bed, I can't help certain thoughts pressing into my mind......</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I don't!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You ought to! Why, what's the matter with you! You really shouldn't talk like that, dear. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I've been wondering a lot about God recently. <I>I don’t believe Him!</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">(Defiantly)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he exists, why does He allow so much suffering in the world!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I don't know dear, I don't know anything about the ‘why of the universe. But I do know suffering has never harmed anyone. Look at the people who have never suffered, and you'll see they have little understanding and sympathy. Perhaps it is God's wish that we develop understanding, and therefore He gives us suffering. That may be the answer.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear, you're overtired! Once, I too thought there wasn't much<I> </I>left to live for. I didn't actually want to commit suicide, but wanted to stop fighting. The temptation was, oh, so strong! Then suddenly I took myself in hand and said. &quot;No!......God put me here. As long as I can breathe I Can fight. It is no sin to be a worldly failure in life, but it is a sin not to fight.&quot; And I forced myself to become full of faith. Why should we <I>choose </I>to look upon the bad side of life instead of the good one?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suppose so. I know you're trying to help me–but I'm not in Sunday school.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me feel your head.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your forehead is hot. Wouldn't you like mother to comb out your hair?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(She rises, gets the comb, and begins to comb out her daughter's hair.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What beautiful hair you have! When you were a little girl, I used to comb it out every night. Then I would braid it, and we would begin the fairy stories. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Her eyes half-closed)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wanted you to have curly hair, I was disappointed when you hadn’t. If only I had known of permanents what worry I would have saved! </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Seeing her daughter is about to fall asleep, she continues in a monotone)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The painter finished your room today. The woodwork is a particularly nice shade of tan. The gardener is going to put new geraniums in the window boxes.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tell him to put pink ones this time. I'm awfully tired of red My, your touch is soothing!......You're the sweetest thing to me......I think I'll go to sleep now.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there's anything you want in the morning, phone before I leave the house......How silent everything is! Difficult to realize this is a hospital.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(She adjusts her hat at the mirror, and notices a book on the bureau.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This book has a most amusing chapter about Americans in Europe, I shall read it to you in the morning.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know everything will be all right, and I'm not going to worry. By the way, Sister, do you leave flowers in the room over night?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(With a slight smile)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, indeed, we're not allowed to. I shall remove them presently. We have a special room where they are kept at night.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What a lot of extra work flowers give you nurses!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh, no, it doesn't. It cheers up the patients. We want them to be happy. Considering the pain endured, the little extra trouble is as nothing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MRS. ALLEN</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well...guess I'll really have to be moving. Watch over my darling carefully...There are two magnificent, awe-inspiring moments in life...one is at birth;–the other at death. What mysteries they are! Well, well, I must be the last visitor, everything is so quiet. Goodnight.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Exits)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Sister Seraphine straightens the room. The curtains are pulled shut, the book is re-arranged. The medicine bottles are put in order. The knitting  is discovered on the floor.

<P>&#9;I guess I fell asleep while she was talking. Well no matter… I’m frightfully uncomfortable, sister.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">SISTER SERAPHINE</P>

<P>&#9;You’ll be asleep soon, and won’t know it. I hope have a good night.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(The patient closes her eyes. The light from the hall slightly illumines the room, and falls upon her face. Sister Seraphine takes the chart from the foot of the bed, and reads it in the doorway, where there is more light. She then returns it to the foot of the bed, looks at the patient, gently fixes the covers, and exits.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(All is still.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(To indicate the passage of time, a clock strikes one, for the half hour, and a short while it chimes eleven. The patient breathes heavily, with an occasional moan.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh, God! Help me!......Oh, God, don't leave me alone like this...Oh, God, have pity!... (She sobs.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A Nun appears silently in the doorway. There is a strangely impressive quality about her bearing. She is tall and carries herself with grace and dignity. She pauses in the doorway, and gazes over at the patient. The Nun moves out her arm as if to comfort her. She takes a few more steps and stands silently at the foot of the bed, looking at the Patient with compassion. Then slowly she moves to the back side of the bed, so that she is facing the audience.)</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PATIENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Almost hysterical)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I don't want to die yet. I'm so frightened! I'm so tired; Why did they tell me such terrible thing!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is it, Sister?.....I did not ring for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I used to find this peace near my husband......we were extraordinarily happy together......and so joyful making plans for the baby to come……Don't you see, Sister, it's not fair that he should be taken from me at such a time!</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(A pause)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You're so full of love......there must be magic in your hands……suddenly I feel better……You're like the mother of all the world......I see all it can mean to be a mother......I won't any longer be afraid of the pain......it's worth the sacrifice......You know, it’s strange, but I almost see angels around you as you stand there……You're wonderful, I think you understand all pain……you understand my anguish about frank, mother never has......I've never known anyone as full of love as you are!</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">CURTAIN</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[<I>Notes for Amateurs:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This play is simple to produce. One should strive particularly at the end to create a beautiful atmosphere. The light changes can easily be mananged; an electric light off-stage can be shielded so as to throw an effective light on the Virgin's face.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sister Seraphine can be of any age, but should be placid and serene of temperament.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Allen will prove effective, and bring contrast to the play, if she is played with a little touch of comedy. She is a nice well-meaning woman, but not especially intuitive. The fact that she does not entirely understand her daughter, makes the Virgin's sympathy shine out with greater force.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Patient should be played with emotion and a touch of hysteria and fright. She has been under a heavy strain for weeks, and is about to break. She should have a tremendous spiritual reaction to the Virgin, and play with mysticism. Her long speech at that time is intensely moving if rightly done.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Virgin should preferably be tall. She should have magnetism so that she dominates the scene, even though she never says a word. Lady Diana Manners in Reinhardt's &quot;Miracle&quot; has the quality I mean. She must feel love and project it, and move with exquisite grace.] </P>

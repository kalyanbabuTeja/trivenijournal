Sri <span class=SpellE>Mukkavalli</span> <span class=SpellE>Suryanarayana</span>
who retired as Professor of English from the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Presidency</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

Sanskrit as well as English literature. The brief survey of Indian Literary
Criticism printed below is made up of extracts from the introductory chapter to
an unpublished treatise of his on Indian Poetics found by his family among his
notes and papers in manuscript and typescript left behind by the savant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is now beginning to be generally felt by the more thoughtful among us that the
study of literature cannot bear fruit unless it be properly guided, and that
however great a literature may be, it has small chance of being adequately
interpreted, except by people who are fairly conversant with the true
principles </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and methods of literary criticism. Generally
speaking, our Pundits cannot lay claim to such <span class=GramE>a knowledge</span>.
We have innumerable </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>treatises in Sanskrit on <span
class=SpellE>Alamkara</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastra</span> or the Art of
literature. But the use we have made of them has <span class=GramE>not</span>
been a wise one. We have forgotten that they were written by men who lived long
ago, and hence were ignorant of the altered conditions of modern life and of
the peculiar demands they make on both authors and their readers. Nobody can
deny that some of the <span class=SpellE>Alamkarikas</span>, such as <span
class=SpellE>Vamana</span> and <span class=SpellE>Mammata</span>, were great
scholars and <span class=GramE>thinkers,</span> and that their teaching was in
the main sound; but unfortunately, they have been misunderstood and
misinterpreted, much as Aristotle and Horace were, in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the
18th Century. An attempt, therefore, to exhibit the significance of the <span
class=SpellE>Alamkara</span> literature in the light of later scholarship
should be of great interest to modern readers; the more so, because it throws a
flood of light on problems with which modern criticism has busied itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
seems to be a general opinion among Sanskrit scholars that the history of
Indian criticism begins with <span class=SpellE>Bharata’s</span> <span
class=SpellE>Natyasastra</span> which, according to them, was composed in the
5th century A. D. But I believe that, just as the study of Greek and Roman
classics led to the development of English criticism, the study of the Vedas,
long after Vedic Sanskrit had become practically unintelligible, <span
class=SpellE>favoured</span> the rise of the <span class=SpellE>Alamkara</span>
literature in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Comparison, express or implied, has always been a prominent feature of literary
criticism. The comparison of Vedic with post-­Vedic literature must have
suggested to the ancient Pundits the canons of literary judgment, much as the
study of English litera­ture along with the vernacular literatures has been
able to foster the critical spirit in modern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. There are also other reasons
for thinking that the art of criticism was not unknown in the four or five
centuries before the Christian era. The definition of “<span class=SpellE>Upama</span>”,
or simile, to be found in <span class=SpellE>Yaska’s</span> <span class=SpellE>Nirukta</span>
(5th century B. C.) and the reference to “<span class=SpellE>Akhyayikas</span>”,
species of composition, in <span class=SpellE>Vararuchi’s</span> <span
class=SpellE>Vartikas</span> (4th century B. C.), <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
the conclusion, as Prof. Kane has pointed out, that the writers in question
were aware of the existence of critical literature, though it was not able to
survive the ravages of time. At any rate, none of the writers, <span
class=SpellE>Bharata</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bhamaha</span> or <span
class=SpellE>Dandin</span>, can be said to be the pioneers of literary
criticism in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
as their writings are all covered with the traces of previous <span
class=SpellE>labour</span>. We may therefore presume that the beginnings of the
<span class=SpellE>Alamkara</span> literature should be traced back to the time
when the <span class=SpellE>Upangas</span> of the Vedas were composed, that is,
the 5th century before the birth of Christ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
the conditions under which the <span class=SpellE>Alamkara</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sastra</span> took its rise can only <span class=GramE>be</span>
thus conjecturally set forth, there is not the least shadow of a doubt
attaching to the question as to when and by whom it was carried to that high
degree of perfec­tion which it has attained. <span class=SpellE>Mammata’s</span>
<span class=SpellE>Kavyapracasa</span> if far and away the best and most
imposing and elaborate treatise on the subject, and all our authorities agree
in saying that it was composed in the beginning of the 12th century A. D. Some
of <span class=SpellE>Mammata’s</span> predecessors, such as <span
class=SpellE>Vamana</span>, <span class=SpellE>Anandavardhana</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>Abhinava­gupta</span>, were no doubt men of immense and varied
erudition; but, in width of view, subtlety of discrimination, precision of
state­ment, and above all, in critical tact and insight, <span class=SpellE>Mammata</span>
was, beyond denial, superior to one and all of them. He not only systematized
the speculations of the older <span class=SpellE>Alamkarikas</span>, but also <span
class=SpellE>endeavoured</span> to find out a rational basis for the rules that
they had more or less dogmatically laid down. In fact, he was the first to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> that such rules and counsels have no claim upon our
acceptance, unless they are founded in reason and in the nature of things. Thus
his investigation of the principles of the poetic art was more comprehensive
and penetrating than that of any of the writers named above. And if criticism
means, as it did in ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the application of philosophy to literature, <span class=SpellE>Mammata</span>
was certainly one of the greatest critics that the world has ever seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It would be futile to maintain that
he had said the last word upon the subject. The very fact that he had only a
single great literature to study and examine would suggest that his teaching
required <span class=GramE>to be extended and modified</span> in several direc­tions,
though this seems unfortunately not to be the prevalent view among our learned
and well-meaning Pundits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless,
it is to be hoped that students of Sanskrit litera­ture will turn more
generally to a study of <span class=SpellE>Vamana</span>, <span class=SpellE>Mammata</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Anandavardhana</span> and <span class=SpellE>Abhinavagupta</span>,
than to those writers of a later date, who have superseded them in popular <span
class=SpellE>favour</span>; for, Indian criticism was at the height of its <span
class=SpellE>vigour</span> between the 8th century and the 12th century A. D.,
the dates which scholars have assigned to the earliest and the latest of the
writers named above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Alamkarika</span> conception of the nature and scope of
poetry is both lofty and adequate, and the essential principles of the art have
been so carefully formulated by them that the business of modern criticism is
only to enlarge their teaching and extend its application to later literature.
By far the most important of their contributions to poetic criticism is their
uncompromising recognition of the fact that a poet’s merits can only be duly
appraised by his own “<span class=SpellE>Sahridayas</span>”, that is, men with
similar taste and temperament. When the poet’s art was in its infancy, this
limitation of his appeal would be hardly noticeable; but, as it became more
refined and specialized, he began to feel the need of a more sympathetic and
enlightened circle of readers than could be usually found. The poet Bhavabhuti,
obviously in face of such discouragement, assured himself of just approbation
on the ground that ‘time is endless and the world is wide’. In pro­portion as a
writer is distinctly individual and original, his chance of immediate appreciation
becomes increasingly small. Words­worth, than whom it is very difficult to find
a more original poet, <span class=GramE>implies,</span> all this when he says
that “a great writer has to create the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
more important question concerns the nature and signifi</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cance
of aesthetic enjoyment. The Indian critic <span class=SpellE>Abhinavagupta</span>,
whom <span class=SpellE>Mammata</span> quotes, has grappled with this problem
most </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>successfully. He says that the emotions which the poet seeks
to represent are not true emotions at all but rather moods, or sentiments–not
of “<span class=SpellE>bhavas</span>” (emotions) but “<span class=SpellE>Sthayi</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bhavas</span>” (permanent emotions). Wordsworth was
certainly aware of this distinction when he said that poetry “takes its rise
from emotion <i>recollected in tranquility.</i>”<i> </i>Other chief
characteristics of aesthetic enjoyment, according to the same gifted critic,
are its disinterestedness and its pleasurable excitement. It is interesting to
note that <span class=SpellE>Abhinavagupta’s</span> analysis of the aesthetic
state of mind is substan</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tially the same as that of Kant and other
modern aestheticians. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
also follows from his observations on this subject that our </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>enjoyment
of a great poet is always proportionate to the richness and variety of our own
experience, and also to the ease and readiness with which we can recall them.
He does not despise, for critical purposes, the knowledge we get from books,
but urges that the other kind of knowledge, which we acquire by actually living
in the world, is more distinctly our own, more intimate and profitable. Thus
the poet and his critic have to quarry for know</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ledge in
precisely the same place, viz., <span class=GramE>the</span> actual world. Real
appreciation of any great poet will become possible only when </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>we
can interpret his true meaning with the help of our personal experiences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What,
according to the <span class=SpellE>Alamkarikas</span>, are the constant
qualities of the poetic temperament? <span class=SpellE>Dharmadatta</span>,
whom <span class=SpellE>Viswanadha</span> quotes with approbation, says that
the root of all poetry is to be sought in the emotion of wonder. Another virtue
which the poet’s mind possesses is an exquisite sense of beauty or <span
class=SpellE>Ramaniyata</span> which, according to <span class=SpellE>Jagannatha</span>,
is “the quality of being the object of knowledge productive of hyper-physical
or <span class=SpellE>beautific</span> delight.” Thus, what <span class=SpellE>Pater</span>
and Theodore Watts <span class=SpellE>Duntun</span> say of romantic poetry, <span
class=SpellE>viz</span>, that it is the result of a happy commingling of the
two elements of strangeness and beauty goes only to corroborate the view of
Indian critics, if we remember the remarks of <span class=SpellE>Stendhal</span>
that all great art was romantic in its day, that is, at the time of its
production. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
the third and the most indispensable quality viz., imagination, Indian critics
content themselves with a few <span class=GramE>remarks,</span> and those not
very illuminating either. They say in effect that, whatever be his other
endowments, if a poet lacks imagination, he is no poet at all. On this point
therefore we do better to consult Western criticism, especially the
observations of <span class=SpellE>Coleridge</span>, Ruskin and <span
class=SpellE>Pater</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
question of poetic expression may now be taken up. The analysis of the
threefold power of words, made by the <span class=SpellE>Alamkarikas</span>, is
so profound and penetrating that it will be of the highest interest to modern
readers. The words of the poet should not say things merely but should suggest
them. This theory has been so well propounded and so minutely elaborated by <span
class=SpellE>Anandavardhana</span> in his treatise on “Suggestion” that the
reader, in case he wants further information, would do well to read it through
and through. Suffice it here to say that the ideas which the mere sound of
words raises in our minds are only a simple illustration of the principle of
suggestion which plays such an important part in poetic expression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

do the Indian critics stop here. The emotions to be embodied in a poem, they
say, have to be suggested by means of the <span class=SpellE>Vibhavas</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Anubhavas</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Vyabhicharibhavas</span>,
or the excitants, the <span class=SpellE>ensuants</span> and the accessories.
Then only they become “Rasas” that is, objects of aesthetic enjoyment. This
view, it is interesting to note, is shared by the great French philosopher <span
class=SpellE>Bergson</span>, who says in his book on “Time and Free Will”, “that
every feeling experienced by us will assume an aesthetic character, provided
that it has been suggested, and not caused.” It may also be said in passing
that the basis for the classification of poems according to the degree of
excellence that they possess is also furnished by this principle of suggestion,
though at first sight it may seem to be pushing matters undesirably far. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The merits enumerated by <span class=SpellE>Vamana</span> are many, but <span
class=SpellE>Mammata</span> reduces them to three, viz., energy, lucidity and
sweetness. One point needs to be emphasized in this connection. <span
class=SpellE>Vamana</span> refers to that quality which words possess in good
poetry of fitting into each other and presenting themselves to the ear as a
single word, and gives it the name of “<span class=SpellE>Slesha</span>”. This
indissoluble fusion of words is also that which <span class=SpellE>Macaulay</span>
glances at when he says that we can not replace one word by another in <span
class=SpellE>Milton’s</span> <i>Paradise Lost </i>without destroying the beauty
of the line in which it is embedded. Proceeding further on these lines, the <span
class=SpellE>Alamkarikas</span> found out that every poem should have an
atmosphere of its own, that is, the words in it should be all pitched in the
same key, thus <span class=SpellE>harmonising</span> with the predominant
“Rasa” sought to be embodied therein. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

next to style and its function in literature, we find in Indian critics several
valuable glimpses into the true nature of the poet’s speech. The bewildering
variety of styles to be met with in literature are reduced by the <span
class=SpellE>Alamkarikas</span> to three types viz., the <span class=SpellE>Gaudiya</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Panchali</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Vaidarbhi</span>
styles. In the <span class=SpellE>Gaudiya</span>, energy is the prominent
quality, whereas in the <span class=SpellE>Panchali</span>, it is sweetness or
mellifluousness. The <span class=SpellE>Vaidarbhi</span> steers midway between
these two extremes. There must be considerable truth in </span><span

English literature, we find the styles of writers, not yet imbued with the
Italian grace and softness of sentiment, to be somewhat uncouth and fiercely or
energetic. The style of Shakespeare while partaking of the sturdy strength of

is difficult to say anything with certainty about socialism. It has been
differently interpreted by different people and very rarely two definitions are
alike. In fact, socialism has lost its real shape because everybody tries to
interpret it according to his own special views and viewpoint. This is
obviously due to the fact that socialism has come to mean something more than a
mere political system. However, there is something common to all the
interpretations as regards the aims of socialism. To all, socialism aims at
providing first of all the conditions under which liberty can exist. This is as
much as to say that the creation of equality is its aim, because it holds that
liberty is not worth having without the security which equality provides. From<i>
</i>the economic of view every socialist argues that industry will be more
efficient when it is socialised, and from the moral point of view he claims
that socialism will ensure justice. Socialism thus proposes to complete rather
than oppose the liberal-democratic creed. It will use the victories already won
in a parliamentary democracy democracy to extend democratic principles to
industry. In the name of liberty the machinery of Government has been altered;
will it not be possible to alter the economic organisation of society in the
name of equality? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Gandhi, himself born in the <i>Baniya </i>community, a community which is
commonly deemed an economically dominant community in India, became conscious,
at an early stage of his life, of the acquisitive nature of this community. He
held the <i>Baniya </i>community mostly responsible for the poverty of the
Indian masses and, as such, he showed his hostile reaction to capitalism in
general. Also, he studied the different theories of European socialism and
communism and felt the sickness of an acquisitive society fully. As a result,
he accepted socialism as a part of his programme with a view to ending social
and economic inequality in India. But as it was his habit to interpret every theory
and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>every programme in the Indian context as well as to judge
its validity on moral grounds, he did not accept the western socialism
wholeheartedly, but gave a new interpretation to it and tried to fit it in the
Indian circumstances and conditions. Anyway, he accepted socialism as a central
belief of his life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
faith in socialism was so ardent that some interpreters are prepared to feel
that Gandhian socialism is Marxism minus violence. It means that Gandhiji
agreed with Marx so far as the ends are concerned; he differed only in the
approach and methods of Marx. But, Gandhian socialism is different in approach,
philosophy and outlook, from the entire thesis of Marxian philosophy. Marxism
is based on the edifice of the economic interpretation of life; beyond the
material needs there is little to be worried in life. But in Gandhism, life is
positively placed on a higher pedestal than the mere economic one. Humanism and
the importance of the inner life make Gandhism fundamentally different from
Marxism. The inclusion of the concept of soul, and its redemption, ought to
make Gandhism substantially a theory of the Utopia, which appears difficult, if
not impossible, to be practised. Gandhiji’s emphasis on the role of the inner
man, and the importance which he attached to the spiritual aspect, make
Gandhism a matter of blissful contemplation. This interpretation of socialism
in terms of spiritual beatitude makes it non-scientific and dogmatic. This also
leads to a possible assertion that Gandhism is opposed to socialism of any
sort, for socialism is basically scientific, rational and mostly objective.
There is nothing in western socialism and Marxism where any trace of the
Gandhian approach to life may be found. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Notwithstanding,
Gandhiji fervently believed that he was a socialist in a true sense. In
answering the question “What is socialism?” he said, “Socialism is a beautiful
word, and, so far as I am aware, in socialism the members of the society are
all equal–none high, none low. This is socialism. In it, the prince and the
peasant, the wealthy and the poor, the employer and the employee are all on the
same level.” He described this kind of socialism, as pure as crystal, and
suggested the need for adopting crystal-lake methods for its achievement. The
Gandhian end was to be achieved by Gandhian means. Unlike the western
socialists, he did not differentiate between the ends and the means. He was
convinced that only truthful, non-violent and pure-hearted socialists would be
able to establish a socialist society in India and the world. And he was
perfectly right in his thinking. Why socialism alone, no political system in
the world which aims at the establishment of a just social and economic order
in society, can be successfully evolved unless the people are truthful and
honest in their thinking and behaviour. A mere tinkering with the social and
political institutions will not bring about a new heaven and a new earth unless
people’s character, their daily habits, and attitudes, are equal to it. The
socialist state is a wonderful ideal provided the nation has the character and
leadership to work it in practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Gandhian theory of socialism, truly speaking, was not meant for any particular
country or state. Gandhiji was world-minded and he thought that with the
principles of truth and non-violence the whole world could be re-organised for
world socialism. Brilliantly enough, he planned a world order and that too with
no hatred towards any particular group. While for the western socialist
thinkers like Marx and Sismondi there is a class conflict, protest against some
group or other and some friction in the social order, for Gandhi all these
frictions and conflicts do not exist. He wanted to construct a new, non-violent
social system, in tune with India’s ancient cultural traditions, according to
which the spirit counted more than the material forces. In place of
class-conflict and social friction, he preached gospel of renunciation,
voluntary poverty, dignity of labour, equality of men and women, and universal
friendship. He did not think that the cause of socialism would be furthered by
class-conflict, creating group consciousness and hatred, and propagating the
cult of tension between individuals or groups of individuals. Thus Gandhian
socialism is of a different pattern and of a different colour from all other
forms of socialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhian
socialism is mainly based on his ethical concepts. He confronted all
traditional socialists with the most complex question of God. His supreme
reliance on the unrealisable, at least unseen, power made all socialistic
thinking a matter of faith. He posed a question whether the socialists can
believe in god or not and whether those who believed in God could be socialists
or not. He found out from his practical knowledge that most of the socialist
thinkers had founded their systems on the negation of God. In fact, the
greatest of all socialists, like Marx and Lenin denied the existence of any
concept of God and went much further saying that the idea of God had been the
main source of social exploitation and inequality. These socialists believed
that socialism would be lost in prejudices, dogmas and superstitions if it is
associated with anything which is not strictly material or practical. However,
Gandhiji did not believe that all the socialists were atheists or had anti-God
feeling. There might be many who did not connect God with social p</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>roblems;
possibly they felt no need to assemble these two different concepts. They
separated God and ethical life from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>political problems and
institutions, possibly because they thought that the association of the idea of
God and the ethical life </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with socialism would make the latter a
dogmatic creed. But this presumption is baseless. In Gandhian thinking the
concept of God never meant the too dogmatic and extremely doubtful existence of
the unknown and unrealisable. Gandhiji had correlated God with Truth and Truth
according to him meant something different from the usual meaning normally
attached to it in the common language. From this he expounded the concept of
Satyagraha. And he laid down the path of Satyagraha as the only means for
attaining any higher ideal of socialism or democracy. By laying so much
emphasis on Satyagraha as a method of attaining socialism, Gandhiji made it
clear that the violent methods which were usually advocated by the earlier
socialists would be impossible and undesirable in a search for true socialism.
It is of the utmost importance to note that Gandhian socialism is based on
concepts and forces which were completely new to the whole domain of western
socialism in particular, and western thinking in general. ‘Satyagraha is a
force which, if it became universal, would revolutionize social ideals and do
away with despotisms and the ever-growing militarism under which the nations of
the West are groaning, and almost being crushed to death, and which fairly
promises to overwhelm even the nations of the East.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the above exposition of Gandhian socialism it must not be thought that it was
only a matter of the mind. Gandhiji was intensely practical and his principle
was that the life of the individual must find all possible expression only in
the context of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the society. He added to this the possibility of
the application of non-violence and truth in all activities and thought.
Gandhian ideology in general, and Gandhian socialism in particular, is no mere
theory, no mere intellectual grasp or philosophic satisfaction which can be
attained by simple speculation and thinking. The most peculiar and significant
aspect of Gandhian socialism is the emphasis Gandhiji laid on the internal
aspect of life. Even in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the case of the theory of Sarvodaya, and
the Sarvodaya Samaj, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji did not give much importance to
external forces in organising the institutions. He did not believe that revolution
or evolution when imposed from outside will bring about any fundamental change
in the nature of the individual or the society. The whole responsibility for
reconstruction, in social, economic and political life, must start with the
individual himself, and without the individual’s consistent and constant
attempt at reorientation no amount of community or state effort will bring
about the socialist order. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Gandhian idea of Sarvodaya was the apex of Gandhian socialism. And the idea of
Sarvodaya or universal uplift is<i> </i>based upon an optimistic interpretation
of human nature. That man is essentially altruistic and, consequently, social
reform must concentrate on bringing to the surface this altruistic element, is
the basis of the Gandhian theory of trusteeship. An appeal to the hearts of the
people to respect their obligations towards the weaker and less fortunate, is
the most effective way of bringing about a change in society. And Sarvodaya
believes that voluntary sacrifice of one’s riches or pleasures will certainly
be forthcoming if only the moral approach is strictly followed. Acharya Vinoba
Bhave’s suggestive phraseology like Bhoodan, Shramdan and Sampattidan
reiterates the Gandhian stress on individual volition as the basis for all
social reform. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

one essential difference between the ethics of Gandhism and Socialism. No
doubt, among socialists too, there are some who believe in the innate altruism
of man. But these are prone consider the prevailing social circumstances as
hindering the free play of such morality and, consequently, agitate for
corporate social reform by which the mellifluous human nature may play its
part. There is, thus, a desire on their part to reform social </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>conditions
by the instrumentality of law. But Gandhiji is against any sort of authority
trying to coerce man directly or indirectly into realising his social
responsibilities. To him organised power is more an evil than a blessing. The
power of persuasion is far more fruitful than the power of the state, which
happens to be the normal channel for the expression of the social will in the
present-day politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yet
the Gandhian suspicion towards organised power should not be interpreted to
mean a rejection of all norms of social control. Gandhism does believe in
Government regulations and sanctions. But these should not be the concern of
specialised institutions, which make Government their profession and monoply.
Government and law must become part and parcel of the life of the common man,
things in which he must really have a share. In other words, the overwhelming
domination of political power–the feature of present-day society–must cease and
power must sublimate itself into a spirit of voluntary social obligation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a distrust of political power has a streak of extreme individualism in it. His
insistence on social revolution through voluntary conversion of the people, his
distrust towards the instrumentalities of the state and, finally, his immense faith
in human nature, cannot but remind one of the extreme individualist or
anarchist notion that the evils of society are, more or less, the consequences
of the existence of the State. As a matter of fact, Gandhiji’s whole emphasis
is on the creation of a new type of man with a new vision and outlook. One
cannot have socialism nor move towards it without a new type of human
character. Gandhian socialism, therefore, is mainly an individualistic
approach, and it moreover contains particular solutions for the peculair
problems of India and Asia. It may be true that Gandhian socialism with all its
ethical implications may be unsuitable in the western hemisphere. But in the
East, individualism has not lost its sway. Any socialistic theory must make
this distinction between the East and the West. Gandhian socialism may seem
confusing in that it implies that there can be anything like individualism in
socialism, for socialism by itself means the suppression, if not the negation,
of the individual. But in Gandhian socialism the whole approach was from the
bottom; Gandhiji was sceptical of the possibility of building up society from
the top. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The whole range of Gandhian thinking is superimposed
by the influence of the concept of the soul. As in the case of machines, the
idea of the State and Government have also been encircled by the higher ideals
of life and soul which will not come into the strict orbit of economic
socialism. He felt that decentralisation is the best method and on this ground
he said, “God forbid that India should ever take to industrialism after the
manner of the West.” Concentration of power will not enlighten the individual;
on the other hand it frustrates the inner genius of the individual. Gandhiji
believed that every individual has equal responsibility for the society and so
the possibility of making everybody as big as everybody else must be widened.
This will be possible in a socialism of decentralised power. In this approach
to socialism Gandhian socialism strikes new ground. Socialism always has meant
some kind of regimentation and State control over the individual. Though Marx
himself had supported, of course very vaguely, some kind of decentralisation of
power, other socialists had wanted that power should be centralised as much as
possible. In the 20th century, and particularly after the Second World War,
this trend for centralisation has been prominent. But in the case of Gandhian
socialism, as in the case of the Guild Socialists and the Fabians, there has
been an attempt for making power as much diffused as possible”...every village
will be a republic or Panchayat having full powers….every village has to be
self-sustained and capable of managing its affairs, even to the extent of
defending itself against the whole world. It will be trained and prepared to
perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without….such
a society is necessarily highly cultured, in which every man and woman knows
what he or she wants and what is more, knows that no one should want anything,
that others cannot have with equal labour.” </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
emphasising the role of the individual and underestimating the position of the
central power, Gandhian socialism is tending to be Utopian. Like the Utopian
socialists he was visualising a society wherein there will be no army, no
police force, no control and no oppression, where men and women will enjoy the
same rights and privileges, and where everybody will be left to his own
individual judgement. This type of Utopianism is, particularly, out of date in
the present political </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>world. Gandhiji himself admitted, “I may
be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore, not worth a
single thought.” Gandhian socialism is unnecessarily overburdened with the hope
and greed of the golden age of the past. His repentence for the past made it
difficult for him to think for the future to come. In being Utopian he was not
wrong, but his Utopia, rooted in the past, made him unaware of the new forces
of the changed world. He would have certainly become a progressive socialist,
had he suggested a real remedy for the economic problems. His understanding of
human nature and human problems was mostly ethical and spiritual. By his
saying, “I do not share the socialist belief that centralisation of the
necessaries of life will conduce to the common welfare when the centralised
industries are planned and owned by the State,” he was unprepared to accept the
basic economic phenomenon of the present economic atmosphere. But history seems
to prove that no socialist society will be possible without a strong State.
This is due to the fact that contrary to the Gandhian idea that the individual
is endowed with all virtues and the individual will never stand against the
society, the individual has been the greatest enemy of the group. The State has
to come in for the sake of the community or the society. Society cannot thrive
without the State. But in Gandhian theory the approach is quite different. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a fact that Gandhiji, due to his divergent and sometimes self-contradictory
ideas, himself made his own theories very difficult to understand. He said,
“Communism of the Russian type, that is communism which is imposed on a people,
would be repugnant to India. I believe in non-violent communism…my emphasis on
non-violence becomes one of principle. Even if I was assured that we could have
independence, by means of violence, I should refuse to have it. It won’t be
real independence. I base my faith in God and his justice.” Such were the ideas
which made Gandhian socialism a matter of inner faith and internal realisation
rather than one of practice, proof or experiment. Gandhiji himself was aware
that his socialism had been the subject of doubts and criticisms. He said, “I
am engaged in solving the same problem that faces scientific socialists. It is
true, however, that my approach is always and only, through unadulterated
non-violence. It may fail….I may be a bad exponent </span><span

the doubts of Gandhiji may be in the context of socio-economic attainment, his
conviction always found outlet through Indian beliefs and thoughts. Gandhian
socialism is more a serious attempt to revive the ancient Indian culture and
less to attain socialism. He had the feeling that “this (European) civilization
is irreligious and it has taken such a hold on the people in Europe that those
who are in it appear to be half mad. This awful fact is one of the causes of
the daily growing movements.” The<i> </i>efforts of Gandhiji were mainly concerned
with emancipating men and women on the spiritual level. He could not appreciate
the notion that women should seek their own opportunities or that men should
try to find out how to be economically comfortable and wealthy. For Gandhiji,
wealth in terms of money and property was a matter of responsibility, not a
matter of achievement. Such ideas on socialism made the theory of Gandhian
socialism less socialistic than probably it was meant to be. Socialism had been
a matter of struggle throughout the world and throughout history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Gandhian approach, there is no strife with the capitalists<i> </i>or
struggle with any person or institution to extract mere economic benefits. He
believed that everything is a gift of God and it is His duty to provide for
every one. This assertion, Gandhiji believed, will not degrade the role of man
and human society in attaining the socialist society. Gandhiji’s references to
Indian socialism are found in the <i>Upanishads. </i>It finds clear expression
in the first verse of the <i>Isaupanishad. </i>Gandhiji felt that socialism was
not the fruit of the industrial economy, but it existed long before–thousands
of years prior to the Western attempt to conceive anything called socialism.
This complex citation to the earliest references of Indian literature placed
Gandhian socialism on a different plane from the rest of world socialism. There
was much to be unproved and unchallenged and this privilege allowed Gandhiji to
live the life of a communist, thoughh he was opposed to the very thesis of the
Marxian followers. He was not in the least against the capitalists as well. “I
do not bear any ill-will to the capitalists; I can think of doing them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I want, by means of my suffering, to awaken
them to their sense of duty–God help you.” Gandhian sociology is full of such
saintly statements and appeals. True indeed, that such statements do not make
his theory of socialism scientific, but when understood in the context of the
purity of the heart of a crusader and one who had nothing to hope for, except
the emancipation of humanity as a whole, Gandhian socialism is undoubtedly one
of the greatest and most significant of all intellectual contributions of the
20th century. Few others had so much love for men and possibly no other
socialist was prepared to sacrifice one’s own stand to benefit the world and
the civilization of every man irrespective of caste, creed and colour. Gandhian
socialism with all its seeming inconsistencies and lack of scientific treatment
deserves the highest attention at least as an </span><span style='font-size:

very great widespread change of ideas or of heart takes usually at least three
generations. As examples, consider the ideas of Einstein and Freud. The
generation in which the new idea is propounded, is startled, often repelled,
and opposes out of habit, inertia, prejudice and reluctance to think new
thoughts. The second generation has become moderately familiar with the new
idea, has watched it longer in action, probably accepts it intellectually, but
is still hampered by the unconscious attitudes they accepted from their
parents. Only the third generation is free from unconscious prejudices and
bias, has realised the values of the new idea, and is heartily willing to
explore all the implications and possibilities of it. From thereon it really
begins to show its power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

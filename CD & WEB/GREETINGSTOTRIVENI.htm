</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nations are like human beings–they are souls as well as bodies. Freedom of the body from fetters is excellent, but all the same it is possible to be a slave in mind and soul. Independence or Dominion Status for India is merely the outer husk of the nation’s upbuilding ; it is only when the soul of India finds herself that she is truly a Nation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as a man finds his soul only by creation of new things from his heart’s depths, so too a Nation finds itself by creating beautiful things. Anyone who helps India to be proud of her artistic past, in order to produce more wonderful things still in the future, is indeed a patriot. That is why from the beginning I have been a warm admirer of ‘Triveni’. It is rare to find in India such a presentable magazine. I send my cordial wishes for its continued success to Mr. K. Ramakotiswara Rao, its devoted Editor.</P>

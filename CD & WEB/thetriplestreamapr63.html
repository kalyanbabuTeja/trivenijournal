was Free India’s singular good fortune to have secured the services of Dr
Rajendra Prasad as its first President and of Sri Jawaharlal Nehru as its first
Prime Minister. They were among the most distinguished of the Knights of the
Round Table whom the Father of the Nation chose from different parts of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> at the
commencement of the final struggle for freedom. Chittaranjan Das and Motilal
Nehru were in the forefront of the fight, but they were snatched away during
the early stages. Vallabhbhai Patel functioned as Deputy Prime Minister and
achieved the integration of the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Princely</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">States</st1:PlaceType> and the Provinces of ‘<st1:place
w:st="on">British India</st1:place>’. Rajaji was the last Governor-General of
India and the only Indian to occupy that position of eminence. Rajendra Prasad,
the modest and unassuming leader of <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>, was
in some ways closest to Gandhiji and sat at his feet to imbibe the essential
spirit of Gandhism. For him was reserved the greatest honour of all. During his
two terms as President, he won the affection and esteem of his fellow-citizens,
and the goodwill of foreign nations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as a scholar and patriot, Rajendra Prasad was superb as a great gentleman. In
him was a rare combination of simplicity and dignity, and a remarkable balance
of intellect and croatian. After a school and college career of exceptional
brilliance, he was wooed by Gokhale on behalf of the Servants of India Society,
but it was Gandhiji who eventually succeeded and won him over to
Non-co-operation. Sachchidananda Sinha, the patriarch of <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>,
foretold that young Rajendra Prasad would<i> </i>one day become President of
the Congress and soon after be elevated to the Bench of a High Court. Rajendra
Prasad was indeed President of the Congress for three terms, but instead of
adorning the Bench of a High Court, he became the first Rashtrapati of Free
India exercising the privilege of appointing Judges of the Supreme Court and of
the High Courts. All this happened to one who had no glamour for office or
position, and was content, like Cincinnatus, Consul of ancient <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Rome</st1:place></st1:City>, to go back to his plough. In this case
it was the Sadaquat Ashram. From <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>, the
home of King Janaka, came Rajendra Prasad, king among men and a shining example
of philosophic detachment amidst the battle of life. May the memory of this
modern Janaka live as long as <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>

Bill accepted by Parliament was an attempt to steer clear of the extremists on
either side, those lovers of Hindi who wish to see it installed as the sole
official language from January 1965, to the complete exclusion of English, and
the advocates of English who seek an amendment of the Constitution so as to
restore the position obtaining in 1947, without the interposition of Hindi in
the all-India sphere. Ever since the famous pronouncement of the Prime Minister
in Parliament in 1959 envisaging the continuance of English as an “associate
language” for as long as the non-Hindi speaking people wished it, public
opinion all over India had settled down to a state of equanimity and tolerance
of conflicting views. It was taken for granted that, without prejudice to the
status accorded by the Constitution to Hindi, a highly developed, efficient,
international language like English which served us well for over a century,
would still be available for the many purposes of Central administration and
legislation, for the use of the highest courts, and as a link language between
the Centre and the States, and between one State and another. Any sudden break
with the past, in a matter so vital as the all-India official language, would
inevitably lead to confusion. Hindi is still an undeveloped language and not
fit to play the role intended for it by the optimistic framers of the
Constitution. It has not been employed as the sole official language in all the
Hindi-speaking States. It will grow, as other Indian languages are growing, and
in a short period these languages may become the official languages of the
States, with English as an associate language in several of them. Some decades
of transition, of prolonged bilingualism, are needed before a final decision
can be taken by a future Parliament, in the light of circumstances then existing.
Meanwhile, no passion or bitterness need be imported into the controversy
regarding the status of Hindi versus English. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
this state of complacency was rudely disturbed by the Socialist Party which
sponsored a fanatical movement to abandon English altogether. They were
supported by the Hindu Mahasabha and by leading Hindi scholars like Dr Raghu
Vira and Seth Govinda Das. Conferences were held and emphatic resolutions
passed urging the total abandonment of English in administration and
legislation. This naturally roused the ire of the advocates of English, and
they were further exasperated by the lack of decorum on the part of the Hindi
enthusiasts who insisted on Sri Biswanath Das, the Governor, speaking in Hindi
in the U. P. Legislature, and created a scene in Parliament by urging that
President Radhakrishllan should deliver his opening address in Hindi. The
non-Hindi people were hurt and they looked to the Prime Minister for the
implementation of his assurances, which Rajaji hailed as the <i>Magna Carta </i>of
the non-Hindi people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

divergent reasons. The <o:p></o:p></span></p>

expressed general satisfaction, while some members of the party wished that
statutory recognition had been accorded to the Prime Minister’s assurances,
repeated by him during the debate, and further endorsed by the Home Minister
who was in charge of the Bill. A purely permissive measure, enabling the
Government of India to continue to employ English for an indefinite period, is
not an ideal solution of the problem. But it is the only feasible one,
embodying the greatest common measure of agreement. Further decisions will be
taken after consultation with the State Governments, while the Prime Minister’s
original assurance was to the effect that the non-Hindi States would have a
decisive voice, inasumch as their interests were to be safeguarded against any
disadvantages arising from the change-over to Hindi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

even after it ceases to be the medium of instruction except at the highest
level. It is also recognised that for post-graduate research in science and
technology, English will be an invaluable aid for all time. The prejudice
against English as a ‘foreign’ language must not be allowed to interfere with
the many-sided progress of a nation. Even the rapid development of the Indian
languages is dependent on their close association with English and other
languages like French and German. Light has to stream in from all sides, and
dispel the darkness resulting from isolation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bilingualism is now accepted as a feature of our public life, is it desirable
to insist that, at some time in the future, the nation should finally resolve
to adopt only one language-Hindi or English–as the sole official language for
all-India purposes? Since both languages will be taught in our schools, and
large numbers of Indian citizens will be familiar with both, may we not look
forward to a time when all controversies on this issue will be laid at rest and
Hindi and English accepted as the twin official languages of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> on a
permanent basis? This may offend nationalist sentiment, but the balance of
advantage lies in adopting such a scheme. Any citizen will employ that language
which he fancies but he will be sufficiently acquainted with the other language
to enable him to use it when the need arises. Language will then be no bar to
friendly understanding, nor will the employment of a particular language–Hindi
or English–rouse the passions in the way that it does at present. Harmony
instead of discord, goodwill instead of bitterness, will result from the
attitude of mind which accords equal importance to a national language and an
international one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

will gradually veer round to the view that, in between “Down with English” and

</i>English for ever”. All lovers of peace and progress must throw their weight
in favour of this new formula. If <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

with two official languages enjoying equal status, there is no reason why <st1:country-region

not enthrone Hindi and English. What is now described as the period of
transition must prepare the nation, not for the final adoption of Hindi alone
as the official language, but for the harmonisation of conflicting claims and
the avoidance of perpetual wrangles about the comparative merits of the two
languages. When Indian boys and girls who are now in their early teens finish
their college career, they will appreciate the new approach indicated here. The
Constitution may then be changed by including English among the listed

a part of our heritage. Let us treasure it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

teaching of his favourite subjects–history, economics and political science–to
three generations of students at widely scattered centres like Kakinada,
Vizianagaram, Nellore, Waltair and Bombay. Students belonging to successive
batches deemed it a privilege to sit in his classes and listen to his masterly
exposition of important themes. While he was familiar with many topics and
dealt with them in a style marked by elegance, precision and wealth of detail,
he was at his best in unravelling the intricate theories of the State and the
working of the written and un-written Constitution of many lands. His books,
essays, and addresses to distinguished gatherings all over <st1:country-region

served as a member of a selection committee for the appointment of a Professor
of Politics in the Bombay University, and how the other members of the
committee made a special request to the Professor to accept the post himself!
It was a great compliment to the Professor, and he served the university for
three years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pleasure to contribute essays and reviews. His quarterly survey of Foreign
Affairs <sup>1</sup> in this journal is read by a vide circle of scholars with
genuine appreciation. That elders like him have lent distinction to the journal

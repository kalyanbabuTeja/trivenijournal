forward to our annual visit to grandmother’s house in Hardwar. Grandmother was
an embodiment of kindness and she spoiled us children, with all the tasty
titbits her kitchen used to be filled with. She never ate much herself but had
a weakness for over-feeding others. We used to feel a smug delight also on
hearing our mother being scolded in just the same way as mother used to scold
us. It was some consolation to us, especially to my brother, to hear
grandmother chiding our mother, ‘You will never change, you will have the same
habits...as if you had not grown up at all.’ We discovered then that mother too
had been upto the same tricks as we, once upon a time. Of course we never said
anything to her about it because she was always trying to impress upon us how
good she had been as a child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

brother and I, for she always thought of the right thing at the right moment
and knew exactly the time we would be in need of toffee, sweets or pickles. To
us children she personified strength and character, love and devotion, and
above all someone who afforded us a very pleasant holiday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was not beautiful like most other grandmothers we knew. She was neither plump
and round nor laughing all the time like some grandmothers would. She could at
times make the servants tremble and even keep mother silent. We children always
felt at ease with her though and believed we knew all her secrets. Yes, when
she opened her boxes behind closed doors, only we were allowed to come in and
peep into them. Oh, what lovely things she had! Her hope chest was full of
beautiful clothes and articles of silver, some for me and some for my brother,
she said, when we grew up and got married. There were many pieces of rock sugar
and almonds in the trunks too. This she allowed us to fill our pockets with. On
one such occasion my brother insisted that she take a bite too. But she
refused. When he persisted, a rare thing for him, she again refused saying </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>she
could not eat hard things because she had false teeth. We looked at each other
in alarm. What did she mean? This was something new to us; we hung on either
side of her and demanded to see her teeth. She obliged us by smiling wide but
there didn’t appear anything odd to us. ‘What is the difference between real
and false teeth? How do you grow them?’ I asked. ‘They can’t be
grown’...laughed grandmother, ‘You have to get them from the Dentist. He is a
Doctor for the teeth, look...’ and said, giving them a push upwards, making a
clicking sound which intrigued us immensely as we watched her. ‘At night I remove
them and place them in a mug of water...now come along my pieces of liver (a
fond expression in Punjabi), let’s close the trunks...’ My brother’s eyes met
mine and were held together in perfect understanding at the thought of what
would happen if grandmother lost her teeth. The prospect of seeing her mouth
empty of teeth made us burst out laughing. We made our plans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

can be heartless little brutes when they want to, even when it concerns some
one they love. Of course one only takes liberty with those whom one loves.
After all she was our own grandmother. That night we decided not to sleep until
grand-mother took out her teeth. She slept in our room and the mug which she
referred to stood on the window sill just near to our bed, which we had never
taken notice of before. My brother and I slept together in the big bed. It was
nearing winter and very cold. We were wrapt up every night under a big quilt
and two blankets tucked in nicely. With such cosy warmth we found it difficult
to keep our eyes open. We whispered and giggled at our plan to dispose of
grandmother’s teeth. It seemed ages before we heard the sound of wooden clogs.
Grandmother came inside humming her evening prayer and moved around the room.
Then she peered down at us, murmured a prayer to remove the effect of any evil
eye cast on us. She fussed about with our blankets while we must have looked
like two cherubs in deep slumber. Then we heard the click and the splash as she
dropped her teeth into the mug. Quietly then she entered our mother’s bedroom
for a chat. The stage was set.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was decided beforehand by us that my brother would be the hero of the piece,
but now he remained very still. I nudged him hard to remind him. He peered at
my face in the semi-darkness and whispered that I should also accompany him. My
heart sank. ‘Don’t be a coward. Any other boy would have thought nothing about
it...’ I scolded. Of course it had a magic effect on him. He crept out of bed
and taking the mug (into which I stared for a while in disbelief and then
shrank back in horror for it was an ugly sight) he quietly disappeared from the
room. I prayed hard for his safe return–safe from detection. My head lifted
slightly; I kept my eyes glued on to the half opened door of my mother’s
bedroom, straining my ears to make sure of the steady flow of conversation. I
turned round suddenly to find my brother standing beside the bed still and
tense. I sighed with relief. He suddenly collected his wits and jumped back
into his place. We covered our faces and clung to each other, feeling the full
impact of what we had done. Then suddenly remorse overtook me. I pictured our
darling grand-mother without her teeth and, oh, how would she eat? As it was
she ate very little, always anxious to feed others though, and how happy she
was to see us children delight over special preparations–and this was how we
were repaying her. Tears or remorse stung my eyes as all these thoughts
tortured me. I removed the quilt and looked at my brother. He stared back. I
searched his face for any feeling of regret. His face was motionless as he
stared back–no sign of guilt or remorse in his eyes. I sniffed. ‘Oh, what have
we done. Poor dear grandmother!’ ‘Sissy,’ he hissed back. My heart stood still,
how heartless boys were...how unfeeling! ‘Oh, what will darling grandmother
do.’ I sobbed. ‘She will get more teeth from the teeth doctor...’ answered my
brother in a matter-of fact tone,...‘if you start crying, booby, they will come
and don’t forget you are to blame too; I didn’t want to go but you called me a
coward...’ In spite of myself I soon fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

morning we were awakened by the commotion in the house. For a while we sat
dazed trying to comprehend the extent of our mischief. The servants ran about
the house breathless, overturning things and looking underneath others, even
under our bed because the mug had a permanent place on the window near us.
Mother looked exhausted and upset, but grandmother, though agitated, directed
the search like a military commander, now scolding the servants, now cursing
herself–for her absentmindedness–perhaps she had left them in the bathroom or
kitchen or ? It was funny, exclaimed grandmother, she had never misplaced the
teeth before. We did not come under suspicion but we were certainly being
punished all the same, everybody forgot us–even grandmother. No hot milk and
biscuits were brought up to our room. We remained huddled up in bed–silent and
frightened. I had one question uppermost in my mind and, though we were alone
at times. I was too afraid to speak. I wanted to know where my<i> </i>brother
had thrown the teeth...We had discussed the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>drain pipe as the best
possible place but what actually happened to them in the end I didn’t know. My
brother was looking pale and sheepish. Neither of us could enjoy the joke any
longer. We were hungry. As time passed mother soothed grandmother and suggested
ordering a new set. The search was over, grandmother having reached the
conclusion that some abnormal cat or rodent had escaped with them...there was
nothing else to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>explain the mystery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
an indifferent breakfast, time dragged on to lunch time and when we sat down to
eat we caught sight of grandmother sitting in the sun outside, wrapped in a
shawl, looking pensive and sad. The tiny figure cut us and it was the first
time that grandmother was not sitting with us looking after our needs
personally while we ate. The meal was badly cooked, the servant having made it.
My brother looked at his ‘thali’<sup>1</sup> and then at grandmother. It was
too much for him...too much for his appetite</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>no
proper breakfast and now this insipid lunch. He ran towards her. Hugging her
tight he said, ‘Oh grandmother, please don’t look so sad...I will search for
your teeth.’ Before she could say anything he ran off disappearing for a while,
leaving me in a state of confusion and discomfort. Was he after all going to
give the whole show away…was he going to betray ourselves? Where had he hidden
them? He soon returned brandishing her teeth unceremoniously in both hands and
shouting for joy. Grandmother was so excited like a child with a new toy.
Everyone came </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>crowding round them as grandmother hugged and
kissed my </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brother spanking him lovingly...‘I know my
darling is going to be a great man. He is cleverer than all put together. Come,
‘my piece of liver’! I am going to make some coffee just now...Now let me see
what has he given you for lunch…’ She gushed in happiness entering the kitchen
too excited to put questions. But mother glanced at my brother very
suspiciously. After all, however, she decided not to put uncomfortable
questions when all had ended well...it was a relief to all. When we were alone
I pounced the question uppermost in my mind, ‘Where did you throw them? It’s
good they did not go down the drain pipe after all.’ For the first time my
suspicions were frantically aroused when I saw him remove himself to a safe
distance….they were too large for the drain pipe…I didn’t know where to hide
them, so...’ he smiled mischievously, ‘When you were not looking I placed them
under your pillow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

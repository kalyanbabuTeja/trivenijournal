volume under review comprises the papers, twenty in number, read at a Seminar
on Literary Criticism, organised by the Department of Post-Graduate Studies and
Research in English, University of Mysore, in June 1965. The editor has
contributed a preface explaining the significance and purpose of the
publication and an introduction explaining the scheme and objectives of the
seminar. He has also included in an appendix to the volume, a report of the
seminar by Mr. David McCutcheon, one of the participants, originally published
in <i>Quest, </i>which is calculated to give a rough idea of the proceedings of
the seminar, and the discussions that followed the reading of the papers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the editor himself points out in the preface, the title is rather pretentious,
for, barring one Sanskritist, one Tamil writer, and two European scholars, the
participants are all Professors or Readers in English at Indian universities
and the discussions, as well as the papers, are mostly confined to English and
American principles and practices of literary criticism. But almost all of them
reveal a commendable measure of acquaintance with, and appreciation of, the
classics in Indian literary criticism, and the traditional Indian approaches to
literature and aesthetics. The claim of the editor may readily be conceded that
the contributors to this volume may, taken together, be considered the highest Indian
critical intelligence, brought up largely on English and American literatures,
but responsive alike to the immemorial traditions of Indian and to European
critical modes in general. The objective of the seminar is defined correctly by
Mr. McCutcheon in his report as ‘to investigate the possible relevance of
Sanskrit theories to modern literary interests and to accommodate Sanskrit with
Western aesthetic theories in a joint approach.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
seminar and the publication amply demonstrate the need, and the desirability,
for systematic and sustained collaboration between the Indian teacher of
English and the Sanskrit scholar, in such attempts at mutual understanding and
influence, in the interests of the evolution of a modern tradition of literary
criticism, to shape and guide and foster the literatures in the Indian
languages, to forge links with our past with which today we have lost all vital
connection, to focus our attention on the sources of our own culture, to draw
the attention of the modern world to the treasures in our glorious traditions
of literature and literary criticism, which they richly deserve, so that we may
contribute to the integration of the wisdom of the past with modern knowledge,
and promote the evolution of a world culture and common standards of literary
criticism of universal validity, towards which the human race seems to be
rapidly advancing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
wonder the standard of the papers and the discussions which followed them
evoked high praise in discerning circles throughout the country. But it is only
a beginning, though a very good and encouraging beginning, and the endeavour
has to be steadily pursued with increasing zeal and one may hope the proportion
of Sanskritists among the participants in such seminars, like Dr. K. Krishnamurthy
of the Karnatak University, who can make the Sanskrit tradition available in
modern terms, progressively increasing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
recommendations of the seminar for a literary criticism syllabus combining
Western and Sanskrit poetics, and the desirability of working in both the
traditions in mutual collaboration, and the study of comparative aesthetics and
comparative literature, deserve the immediate attention of the authorities of
all the Indian universities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sanskrit
poetics have never received the attention and appreciation accorded in the West
to Indian religion, philosophy, art and literature. Consequently even in India
today the theories or Sanskrit literary criticism have been confined to courses
in Sanskrit and had little influence on modern Indian studies or practices.
Prof. Narasimhaiah therefore deserves to be complimented on his initiative in
the organisation of the seminar, and the publication of the volume under
review, which constitute a valuable contribution to the cultural renaissance in
modern India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
no other English poet and critic could it be said with equal validity that his
practice and theory had a seminal impact, in his own lifetime, on the poets and
the students of literature in this country as of T. S. Eliot, who died in 1965.
Conversely, of no other English or American writer could it be said that he was
influenced by the basic assumptions of Hindu philosophy to the extent of being
able to introduce them creatively into his own poetry, as T. S. Eliot again.
His reference to the concepts of Hindu metaphysics (and possibly even the
tenets of the Buddhist canon) </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was not a learned gimmick or a prank of
obscurity but something </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with a poetic inevitability and an
intellectual integrity about it. It was, therefore, in the fitness of things
that there should be a homage to Eliot from India as well as from the rest of
the world. And this appropriateness has an added poignancy to it when we learn
from the enterprising editor of the volume that he had originally planned it as
a garland for the poet over a dozen years ago to be presented on his 64th
birthday. It had instead became a wreath for the <i>Samadhi. </i>The <i>Puja </i>had
turned out to be a <i>Shraddha. </i>This is harmony in the incantation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
homage, in its variety and sense of purpose, is something that would have
gladdened the recipient’s heart, were he alive and will now give his soul some
peace. The editor deserves all praise for his imagination and perspective in
planning the volume and seeing it through. He has succeeded in tapping the
right sources for the wealth of informed contributions. He has cast his net
wide and the catch is impressive indeed. Ahmed Ali, in his perceptive analysis
of Eliot’s impact on the poetry of his younger contemporaries, rightly
describes him as a catalytic agent. Comparing him with other poets of the same
age, he finds him more considerable for his cryptic originality and all-round
achievement. English poetry was not the same again, after Eliot and poets were
not the same again either, after reading him. Among the poets of this century,
he was possibly the most widely read in the English- knowing world, with the
sole exception of Robert Frost, but he was not always read right, as P. Lal
takes care to put in. The personal response to the poetry of Eliot is outlined,
by a number of writers including Nissim Ezekeil, M. R. Bhagavan, Devkumar Das
and others with the Workshop imprint. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of the writers had opportunities of either meeting Eliot in the flesh or close
personal correspondence with him over the years. Dr. Mulk Raj Anand stayed long
enough in England and long ago too to have done some book-reviews for <i>The
Criterion. </i>It was Eliot’s good turn in the shape of unstinted praise which
was responsible for G. V. Desani’s <i>All About Mr. Hatterr </i>finding a
publisher in England. We learn from Dr. Ranjee Shahani’s interview that the
poet was truly humble, courteous to a fault, but anxious to avoid
over-simplification or imprecise statement in prose or verse. The image of the
clean and clerical Mr. Eliot “and his brow so grim, and his mouth so prim,” the
American poet, who died a snobbish English death, is, however, hard to efface
from the reader’s imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Substantial
contribution to the literature on Eliot is made by the discussions of the role
of Eliot as a critic. His critical theories are examined with care and a
juxtaposition with those of his forerunner in the last century, Mathew Arnold,
suggests itself quite naturally to many of the students of criticism. Lal
himself had done a thorough job in his scrutiny of the methods adopted by the
four critics who had dealt with Eliot in the pages of <i>The New Review </i>of
Calcutta. One of them is Mr. K. Viswanathalm who had perhaps with every
justification taken the cudgels for Arnold, who had come in for a lot of
needless derision in the wake of some hindsight debunking done by Eliot
himself. Arnold’s generalisations might be rather too facile for the critic who
would be particular, and his denunciation of religious or intellectual dogma
might itself sound to modem ears a little too dogmatic in turn. But it would be
less than fair to deny Arnold his share of good, solid, common sense. Nor can
we lightly dismiss his genius for the formulation of certain broad general
principles, which might, however, need some tidying up with the addition of
exceptions and qualifications. A jibe like the following, with an obvious ring
of Lytton Strachey about it in a different context, sounds rather misplaced and
superfluous after the laborious demolition done by Eliot. Referring to the
“criticism of life theory”, the comment has it: “While Eliot’s theory is a
result of years of patient research in poetic practice and achievement, Arnold
is speaking as an Inspector of Schools...” The point is not about one being an
Inspector of Schools, or the other having been a bank clerk or a publisher’s
reader. Without the body of general formulations by Arnold on poetry and
culture, Eliot would have found his job far less easy than he did. As it is, he
had a handy predecessor to contradict and wisely qualify and improve upon for
the benefit of the succeeding generations and the delectation of his own
admirers. In a way, it might be said that if Arnold the critic were not there,
Eliot the critic would not be there in the same form and shape. Messrs Sisir
Kumar Ghose, Sadhan Kumar Ghose, C. D. Narasimhaiah, Amaresh Dutta, and others
have thoughtful studies of Eliot’s criticism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

outspoken are some of the essays, especially those by Agehananda Bharati, David
McCutcheon and Lawrence Bantleman. Tributes in verse by K. Raghavendra Rao, P.
Lal, T. K. Doraiswamy, Pradip Sen and James McAuley lend a distinct personality
to the chorus of homage. Altogether a creditable achievement this as a
contribution to Indian critical writing in English, besides being a new
definition of the phenomenon that went by the name of T. S. Eliot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

depth of thought rather than the appearance of form that has rendered Indian
art what is usually called introspective. It is not so much the representation
of form as the inspiration of the spirit that is chiefly fascinating in Indian
art. Indian art is symbolical representation rather than factual imitation, Dr.
Vasudeva S. Agrawala’s “Studies in Indian Art” contains his articles contributed
to various journals occasionally and yet the coherence of thought and
expression has well been maintained throughout the book. But such collection of
a single author’s articles on the same subject is often compelled to contain
the risk of repetition despite careful editing. But to the lay reader such
repetitions are a boon rather than a curse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Agrawala’s interpretations have an inclination towards nationalism and
religiosity and thus he is hesitant to appreciate the presence of foreign
elements in Indian art. Yet, he could not help admitting the same. According to
Sir John Marshal the Mauryan art has its source in the Achaemenian art of Iran.
Even the lion capital of Asoka and the Mauryan palace at Patatiputra were
inspired by the palaces at Susa and Persipolis. It was also advocated that the
craftsmen of Asoka learnt from Persia to impart a lustrous polish to stone. Sir
John Marshal believes that the Persian influences had entered India through
Bactria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

capital, i. e., the ideas of expression, are concerned, we have already seen
from a two-fold approach how these ideas are wholly indigenous. On the other
hand, they are completely in accord with the tradition of Indian art both
preceding and following the reign of Asoka. Secondly the <i>Dharma Chakra, </i>the
four lions and the figures on the round abacus are eloquent expressions of the
personal ideas and ideals of Asoka, with respect to the love in the Law of

foreign scholars have a tendency to attribute many of he glorious achievements
of Indian culture to alien sources while Indian scholars are wont of
attributing even the achievements of alien culture to Indian sources. We have
to choose a middle path in between these two extreme viewpoints. In fact, no
culture of any country has been either purely indigenous or purely alien. In
the remote antiquity of humanity there existed no such difference of cultures.
No country’s culture is pure, untainted by the contact of the cultures of other
countries. It is the same with India where Aryan culture entered from beyond
the borders of India. And now we no longer consider the alien Aryan culture as
foreign. So, none should feel belittled when one learns that the culture of his
or her country has been contaminated by the cultures of other lands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Agrawala’s chapter on the art of the Gupta period is outstanding. In the life
and culture of India the Gupta period (300-600 A. D.) has been deemed as the
Golden Age. In this period the status of aesthetic activity was raised to that
of spiritual practice. External beauty was given an unusually high prominence.
Sensuous beauty in this period was not considered ignoble. Music, poetry,
painting, sculpture, drama, dancing etc., were held to be dearer to the Deity
than the spiritual practices. The poetry of Kalidasa, the painting of many
caves of Ajanta and some of the most enchanting pieces of sculpture and
architecture were produced in the Gupta period. The life of the people in this
period was throbbing with rhythm, rhyme, colour and movement. Of the sculpture
of this period Dr. Agrawala observes: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

period from about 300 to 1200 A. D. falls into three divisions of almost equal
length during which Indian sculpture passed through three phases of maturity.
Stylistically, these phases correspond to the Classical, Gothic, and Rococo
conventions of Western art. In Indian history they are known as the Gupta
(300-600 A. D.), the early medieval (600-900 A.D.) and the late medieval
(900-1200 A. D.) periods.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

art. Out of the many images of Nataraja, the one in the Brihadisvara temple at

book is a compilation of lectures delivered by Dr. Annie Besant on Hinduism,
Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism during the
Theosophical Conventions held in 1896 and 1901. The first series of lectures on
Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Christianity were published in 1897 as
Four Great Religions. The second series are included in the present book which
is hence entitled as the Seven Great Religions. In these “popular expositions”
of these great religions Dr. Besant has attempted and succeeded in unveiling
the “underlying unity” and “the common foundation which supports all
religions”. Therefore every thinking man should read and reread these lectures
patiently, imbibe the spirit of the unity of all religions, fully and carry on
the noble mission of human brotherhood propounded by Dr. Besant, earnestly. We
are deeply indebted to this great woman who had dedicated herself to our
country and our people and had awakened our national and spiritual
consciousness. The life and work of Dr. Besant will ever remain a romantic
chapter in the history of the British rule in India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

single lectures on these great religions are naturally succinct and limited in
their scope. But each lecture brings out the very essence of each religion and
kindles the reader’s curiosity and interest to go to its original sources.
Though meant to be popular expositions, they are sometimes heavy and learned
and more esoteric than exoteric and hence not always within the reach of the
beginner or the novice. This is quite understandable since these lectures were
delivered before the learned congregations of the Theosophical Society. If they
had dealt more with moral and ethical aspects of these different religions, the
common reader can more easily catch the common denominator, like while reading
the Perennial Philosophy of Aldous Huxley. Besides, even this edition is
incomplete without Dr. Besant’s last lecture on Theosophy or Divine Wisdom,
which should have summed up all the previous lectures and should have given a
sort of climatic experience both to the contemporary listeners and the later
readers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has failed to reform man so far, rather, man has refused to be reformed by
religion and has persisted in his folly; but religion has nevertheless
succeeded in dividing man from man. If these lectures cannot reform man
completely, at least they can unite man partially, by dispelling his colossal
ignorance of religions other than his own, as it is ignorance that is at the
root of all human failings and failures. Therefore Dr. Besant has rightly
exhorted: “Judge then a religion by its noblest, and not by its worst, and then
we shall learn to love each other as brothers, and not hate each other as
bigots and as fanatics.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the story is more than a mere presentation
of mass-psychology: it </span>is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>also a
reflect</span>ion on the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>living </span>relationship
between the audience and a theatrical performance. Mass-psychology is again
treated in “The Story <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>Baba
Chakradhari.” But in this story the knife <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>satire is much sharper: the mass shown here is possessed with
a mania. Unlike in “Tragedy”, the mass in “The Story of Baba Chakradhari” is
not a select audience: it is an assemblage of all the people of a small town.
These people were assured of an astonishing fire-jumping feat which, on account
of sudden deterioration of climatic conditions, the organisers were not able to
present. The man hired to perform the feat himself was afraid: the wind was
roaring furiously and to perform the feat would have been too hazardous. But
the assembled crowd was hysterically demanding the show: people wanted to have
the fun as they paid for it, no matter what the consequence. The chiefe
organizer, anyhow, was bold enough to play a trick to appease the crowd; but
the mass presented in the story, even at the end when it was frantically
disintegrating, is a mob–and a very realistic mob it is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
writer in two of his recent creations presented the curious ways by which a
fiction is accepted by a whole mass of people al true and believed decade after
decade. These stories are: “Farewell to a Ghost” and “The Crocodile’s Lady.” The
fact that make-believe plays an important role in the lives of men is only too
obvious to anybody who has some insight. Make-believe should not be taken as a
synonym for self-deception. Make-believe can be healthy; self-deception is not.
Self-deception is the vice against which Jane Austen had tirelessly waged her
pen in novel after novel. It blights the growth of personality; sometimes even
poisons the whole environment. On the other hand, make-believe can be hygienic:
it may enrich lift, give significance to existence. In “Farewell to a Ghost”
the writer has portrayed a village-folk who had unshaken belief in the
existence of a spirit. The ghost supposed to be the spirit of a young girl of
the same village, was accepted as one among them: in festive occasions she was
offered sweets, food and drink though none had ever seen her. But the depth of
their attachment to the “darling daughter” (as they affectionately referred the
ghost) became known when, on compulsion, they bade her farewell. The ghost was
only a fiction but they were moved by true pathos in bidding her farewell. In “The
Crocodile’s Lady” again the writer speaks of the fantasy building capacity of
the villagers. A girl, who suddenly disappeared from the village and was
missing for a decade or so made an equally reappearance. Nobody knew about her
life in the intervening period. But the villagers, with their creative fancy,
had woven a very romantic story round this happening, liberally using elements from
folk-stories and fables, to satisfy themselves. In neither story the writer is
explicit about the healthy role that make-believe plays in the lives of men as
Ibsen is in <i>The Wild-duck</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>. </span>But
in each story the writer had commented upon the fact that make-believe, which was
accepted by whole groups of people until a few decades ago, had fast
disappeared from our society. Growing advancement of scientific knowledge
definitely has to account for this; but even a greater reason perhaps is the
growing isolation of the individual. Make believe now is confined to the
individual and subtler in form. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
range of ideas that Manoj Das employs in his stories is wide–too wide. One of
the recurrent themes in his stories is modem man’s over-obsession with
sensuality and sense-pursuits. Being “caught in the sensual music” the modem
man forgets traditional values and ethical significance or life. What he
incessantly pursues is a perennial titillation. A possible consequence of such
an obsession is the subject matter of the story, “The Last I Heard of Them”. Here
he speaks of seven aged men who set out on a quest: they were in quest of a
supernatural agency which could aid them in gratifying some primitive, rather,
perverse, cravings. Luckily (or unluckily for them) they found one such,
miraculous ointment, and they were but too anxious to use it to see naked
female bodies in a club. But they over-reached themselves: what they saw was a spectacle
of skeletons pressing upon them from all sides, a sight dreadful enough to kill
the most courageous. Same is the theme of another story, “A Trip into the
Jungle”, though the technique employed here is different. In “The Last I Heard
of Them”–and in many other stories as well–the writer has used supematural elements
to bring home the central idea. But even while using supernatural elements
Manoj Das gives a perfect “objective correlative” for the experiences
communicated and the response is a “willing suspension of disbelief”. In “A
Trip into the Jungle”, however, the writer employs a naturalistic technique.
Here again he portrays a group of epicures who, in a strange picnic trip into the
forest could have devoured (it remains a mystery) half-roasted human flesh
under strong alcoholic influence. However improbable this climax of the story
may appear, the writer has developed the story organically–one of the very
striking features of Manoj Das’ writing is to develop each story organically–situations
growing out of characters and giving rise to events; and the dialogues towards
the end of the story are handled with immense care: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What
strikes us most in many of Manoj Das’ stories is the unexpected turn an event
or a chain of events takes. Often the sudden, unexpected turn of an event
flashes on our mind like lightning leaving behind a wealth for reflection. In “Mystery
of the Missing Cap” the writer speaks of a politician and his rural henchman,
who suddenly changed the course of their lives due to an event, apparently quite
trivial. The politician, who was a minister then lost his cap while he was
camping in a village. The cap was stolen from his bedroom by a domesticated
monkey. The minister’s henchman had cunningly invented a story to save the
situation, even to elevate the minister with his account, for whom, it appears,
he had been nursing immense contempt in his sub-conscious. But the moment of
the minister’s departure the monkey itself appears with the cap and offers it
back to the minister, thus shattering the fictitious account of the henchman.
This event, by itself, is quite trivial: the monkey acted just like a monkey;
but it contained the potentialities to change the lives of two professed
politicians. The real significance of the story, no doubt, is the psychclogical
element: the writer’s deep insight into the mysterious workings of the human psyche
chararterizes it. The writer, however, doesn’t offer any comments; he leaves us
to reflect upon and his motive is obviously satirical. But a very striking
quality of the story is the tender regard with which the writer held the
characters even if the satirical intent obvious. The story, therefore, is funny
as well as sad; satirical as well as melancholic. So is “A Song for Sunday”. In
this story, the protagonist’s “downward march” recalls O’Neil’s <i>The Emperor
Jones, </i>though the hero here is innocent and harmless. Mr. Lenka, a humble
stenographer in the District Collectorate, wanted to enjoy a joke on Sunday;
but the peculiar effect of the joke wrecked his sanity for a lifetime. We have
heard of the tragic hero’s “flaw” which enmeshes him with a chain of cause and effect
until he pays the price of life; but Mr. Lenka’s tragedy, though appears like a
parody, reminds us of the realities that operate in the lives of men which can
destroy one’s life even though he might be suffering from no flaw. It is needless
to say that we do witness such tragedies very often in real life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
an interview published a few months ago Manoj Das revealed that he did not want
to “preach” through his stories, that didacticism was not his concern. But he
has written a bunch of stories–he still continues to do so – supposed to have
occurred in a place known as “Luvurva hills” and these stories contradict this
declaration of the writer. In these stories (rather fables) the writer has
employed a technique which reminds us of Orwell’s <i>Animal Farm </i>and the
writer’s interest in these works is certainly didactic. In fact, there can’t be
anything seriously wrong with literature which is didactic, provided the “message”
conveyed grows out of the material rather than imposed upon it. But these
stories of Manoj Das reveal the writer’s over-preoccupation with ideas. These ideas,
however, are not as effectively transmuted into aesthetic experiences as in his
other stories. There is a marked artistic come-down in these stories and the
writer of this essay believes that Manoj Das can’t pursue this technique
without seriously impairing his progress as an artist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
Manoj Das is least at home with didactic stories, he is most at home with
stories dealing with child psychology. Stories like “A Letter from the Last
Spring” or “The Substitute for Sitar” are not possible unless a writer has the
gift of “negative capability” or complete “de-personalization”. In “A Letter
from the Last Spring” the writer portrays a motherless child Reena, and an aged
Professor. Both gaze at the passers-by on the road, standing on the balconies
of their respective apartments: Reena, eagerly expectant to receive a letter
from her dead mother whom she thinks to be still alive, and the aged Professor mostly
watches Reena, as he feels an inward kinship with her. The last part of the
story not only reveals the nobleness of Reena’s heart: but also the way Reena,
the young girl, viewed an aged man. Reena thought that the old man also
expected a letter from his mother and so he was standing on the hotel verandah
for hours and hours, watching the postman. To miss this psychological element
in the heart of the story is to miss the real beauty of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the very conception of most of the stories of Manoj Das there is an originality
and a freshness which delight and appeal to the reader’s mind. But his
narrative technique is conventional: he follows the traditional beginning-middle-end
structure in each of his stories. His style is certainly remarkable: it is
characterized by an olympian serenity, a rare aristocracy. The writer doesn’t
embroider much. In fact, many of his stories are so little embroidered that they
appear threadbare. He makes liberal use of irony and humour. A vein of quiet
laughter runs through stories like “Mystery of the Missing Cap”, “A Song for
Sunday” etc. But beneath the bubbling gaiety there is an undercurrent of pathos.
After reading many of his stories we remember Shelley’s lines: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sum up: considering the range of ideas and style of writing, Manoj Das appears
to be a writer of unusual gifts. His themes range from the most matter-of-fact
happenings of everyday life to the events suggestive of supernatural. While considering
his stories we recall the following words of Henry James: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is never limited ... it is an immense sensibility, a kind of huge spider web of
the finest silken threads, suspended in the chamber of consciousness and
catching every air-borne in its tissue. It is the very atmosphere of the mind.”

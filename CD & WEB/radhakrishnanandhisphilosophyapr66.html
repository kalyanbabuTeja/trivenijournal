may be considered as one of the great philosophers of the world who tried to
formulate a genuine synthesis of Eastern and Western thought, especially
philosophical and religious, and arrive at a world-view; incorporating elements
from the thought of both the worlds. Succeeding generations will be highly
indebted to him for his pioneering work in this field. He is superbly equipped
for this task as he is thoroughly conversant with the traditions of both the
East and the West and so could interpret the thought of the East to the West in
a Western idiom, and the thought of the West to the East in an Eastern idiom.
Rather, he hit upon a common idiom into which both Eastern and Western thought
could be translated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a Hindu first and foremost. He is a follower of the Sankara tradition of the
<i>Advaita Vedanta. </i>While he was studying in the Madras Christian College
he was astounded by the criticisms of his missionary teachers, namely, that
Vedanta considered the world to be an illusion, and that it had no Ethics, etc.
Shaken in his faith in Hinduism, he embarked upon a thorough study of the
Vedanta system and wrote a thesis for his M. A. Degree, <i>The Ethics of the
Advaita Vedanta. </i>From then on it became his quest and mission to correct
the misunderstandings of the Westerners of Eastern thought, and to reconcile
the differences between the East and the West. For this purpose he also
equipped himself with a comprehensive knowledge of all the religious and
philosophical traditions of the world, including Western philosophy and
Christianity to which he owes his belief in the value human personality and
individuality. He derived from Western philosophy not only much of his absolute
idealism but also his faith in democracy as the only justifiable form of the
State. He has a great belief in a universal religion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of his contributions, since this is claimed, but for his <i>Fragments of a

consists, at least in part, of criticisms of the tendencies of naturalism,
scientism, behaviourism, materialism and atheism. Radhakrishnan’s own
philosophy is based on the (Absolute) idealistic thought of the West and the
Vedanta of the East, mixed with a religious philosophy of his own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Radhakrishnan Philosophy is Philosophy of Religion. This<i> </i>seems to be
true at least in <i>An Idealist View of Life. </i>In his <i>Fragments of a
Confession </i>Philosophy seems to have been given a autonomous role, but it is
still rooted in religion. Religion is “experience of, or living contact with
ultimate reality.”<sup>1</sup> Philosophy must be systematic exposition of the
content and implications of religious experience. There is such an overwhelming
evidence for genuineness of mystic experience that it cannot be ignored or set
aside easily. The experience is accompanied in the individual by a sense of
certainty. Such experiences cannot be commanded at will, but occur
spontaneously. The mystic feels that the experience is effable. But yet he
cannot remain silent. As soon as he comes out of it he tries to express it in
symbols, “though the tools of sense and understanding cannot describe it
adequately.”<sup> 2</sup> The myths and metaphors, such as the crossing of the
ocean of <i>Samsara, </i>ascending, heaven, and meeting God face to face,
coming down to us as tradition, are examples of these expressions. These
symbols are derived from the tradition and culture in which the mystic has bred
up. But we should always discriminate between what </span><span

factual in mystic experience and what is only an interpretation </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Intuition
is the faculty by which the mystics come into contact with Reality or God or
the ground of the universe. Intuition gives us integral knowledge, which is
different and superior to the discursive knowledge given by the intellect and
sensuous knowledge. The intellect is not creative and productive. It is logical
in nature, and is necessary for communication, proof or demonstration. It
creates the duality of the subject and the object. Intuition is creative. It
gives us certain knowledge, which is free from the subject-object distinction.
In it knowing and being are one. This faculty, though present in almost every
one, is highly developed only in a few individuals. It is through intuition
that, we are aware of certain basic self-evident truths regarding the world and
ourselves which are not derived through experience nor through reason and so
can neither be verified nor be disproved by them. They are about the whole of
experience. Such truths form the basis of all scientific inquiry and
philosophic speculation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the conviction of Radhakrishnan that mystics everywhere and at all times are
in contact with the same living reality and that their experience of it is the
same. Though the experience is the same the expressions of it in language are
more or less adequate. It is also the strong conviction of Radhakrishnan that
all Philosophy must be a systematization of the expressions of mystic experience.
For Radhakrishnan philosophic speculation, at the basis of which also there are
intuitions, is independent of mystic statements, though it must ratify them.
But it may go beyond them, satisfying the intellectual needs in man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

says that intuitions are infallible. Then how is it that certain scientific
hypotheses, which, according to him, are products of intuition, fail? Would he
say that only right hypotheses are products of intuition and the others not?

would one know whether a hypothesis is true or false before he verifies it in
experience? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

affirmations. He gives two such affirmations: the existence of a spiritual
reality and the unity of the universe. As regards the personality or
impersonality of this spiritual reality he says that the difference in
interpretations is due to differences in point of view. In fact, the Real is
neither personal nor impersonal. He even says that personality is just a symbol.
Religious experience makes no difference between the two. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

regards the immanence and transcendence of the Supreme, Radhakrishnan says that
it is both. Speaking of the negative descriptions of Reality he says that they
are meant to signify the absolute transcendence of the Supreme. The Christians,
the Muslims and many others would strongly object to such a statement and say
that the contrary is true, that there can be only one final and full revelation
of God to man; and that the difference between God and man is never overcome.
But Radhakrishnan would never give way to those who claim uniqueness and
finality for their own type of revelation. Radhakrishnan thinks that the
conclusions of an absolutist idealistic metaphysics can be upheld by the expressions
of religious experience. But he does not heed the warnings of the mystics
expressed in their negative statements, viz., not to indulge in positive
metaphysical speculations regarding the nature of Reality given in mystic
experience. He is too eager to satisfy the intellect of the religiously
displaced persons.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a world federation of religions based on mutual respect and toleration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

speculation, according to Radhakrishnan, points to the same view of Reality as
presented above. Of course, he adds more to it. That is why his philosophy is
of more interest to us. He starts his philosophy with the statement that
necessity of thought as well as of scientific knowledge points to a
supernatural Reality as the ground and explanation of the universe. In this
matter Radhakrishnan’s position is almost the opposite of the spirit of
mysticism. For our ordinary purpose and for those of science and philosophy,
understanding and explanation of the given (fact) is always in terms of
something other than the given to which we try to relate the given, whereas in
mystic experience the given is understood and explained by means of itself, or
rather the problems of understanding and explanation cease to exist. Otherwise,
how are we to understand the statement that in mystic experience knowing and
being are one? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

believes in the principle of cosmic evolution and supposes that God is at work
in it realizing Himself through it. Believing in the principle of emergent evolution,
Radhakrishna asserts that mind emerges out of life, but that with mind the
process of evolution does not come to a stop, and that it will proceed further,
the last emergent being Spirit or <i>Ananda </i>which comprises of all the
rest. Human beings, being free, can create evil in the world, though evil still
forms part of the Divine purpose. History is not a cyclic process. Time has a
beginning and an end. Yet, Radhakrishna says, when the show is wound up the
process may begin again, for all we know. Answering the question why evolution
has taken his turn and not another, he says that it is so because the Absolute
is absolute freedom, and that it has freely willed to actualize the
possibility. The world is a mystery, a <i>maya. </i>The Supreme as
Transcendental Being we call Brahman or the Absolute; as free activity we call
Isvara. The created world is contingent because it depends on the free will of
God. In fact, Radhakrishnan makes a fourfold distinction of the Supreme Being:
1. Brahman, the Absolute Being, 2. Isvara, the unconditioned free activity, 3.
Hiranyagarbha, Prajapati or Brahma, the World-Spirit in its subtle form and 4.
Virat, the World-Spirit in its gross form. God is wisdom love and goodness.

it we can perceive elements drawn from Christianity, Hinduism, especially the

perhaps correctly), his fear of death, the inner conflicts and contradictions
in him, and the impermanence of things, it is these that prompt the individual
to undertake a journey on the path of salvation. When everyone reaches the goal
of salvation the cosmic process comes to an end. Till that goal is reached,
every liberated individual continues to be a centre of activity though without
selfishness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

accepts without questioning the twin doctrines of <i>karma</i> and rebirth in
virtually the same form as they are presented traditionally. Let us here
describe, in outline, Radhakrishnan’s conception of the human self, as it is
important to understand the theory of rebirth. “The self is an organism.” It is
not a collection of mental states. But this organization of the self is a
matter of degree. In all the transformations of man certain persistent and
distinguishable characters persist. The self consists of these. But such a self
is different from self as subject.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

finds support for the traditional conception of <i>sukshma sarira, </i>which is
a fine ethereal body acting as a link between the self and the gross body, in
modern psychical research. The body which the self takes up in the next birth
depends upon the <i>karmic </i>effects it has accumulated till the end of its
present life. Radhakrishnan does not deny, the possibility of reversion to
animal births; but he thinks that “rebirth in animal form is a figure of speech
for rebirth with animal qualities.” <sup>6</sup> With the Hindu tradition, he
thinks that the life of the soul is beginningless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

regards the mechanism of rebirth Radhakrishnan’s theory is not different from
the traditional Hindu theory. The self chooses a body proper for its character.
Parents provide the material for the new body. Answering the objection that
rebirth is inconsistent with the principle of heredity Radtakrishnan says that
this difficulty is natural for every theory except materialism, and that the
alternative viz., that a supernatural essence is thrust into the body all of a
sudden is much less acceptable. But we might point out that according to modern
psychology it might be true that the self grows with the body and may even die
with it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

not inconsistent with human freedom. Our future may be conditioned by the <i>samskaras

is not determined. Self-determination is freedom, which may be of different
degrees. Radhakrishnan does not clearly discuss the nature of the effects of <i>karma

just psychological effects, as Radhakrishnan seems to believe, what happens to

Radhakrishnan is applied religion. He advocates the freedom of the individual
and so denounces all forms of totalitarianism. Institutions and forms of government
are not ends in themselves. They are only means for regulating the relations
between individuals. Radhakrishnan accepts democracy as the best form of
government and advocates non-violence as the means of democracy. He is
evidently a follower of the liberal tradition in politics and of Mahatma
Gandhi. He distinguishes force from violence. Force is inevitable in a State.
Capitalism according to him, is incompatible with democracy. Social and
economic justice are necessary for overcoming communism. Radhakrishnan believes
in the co-operation of individuals and States, and in the brotherhood of all
nations and the unity of mankind. The world is slowly progressing towards a
world-community of States. In such a world, toleration should be the principle of
intercourse. Tolerance is adherence to one’s own convictions with due respect
to those of others. The basis of society must be renunciation and
self-limitation on the part of the individual. Rational persuasion should be
the means of settling disputes. Thus, freedom of the individual, tolerance, and
persuasion, are the cornerstones of Radhakrishnan’s political philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the fullest development of the individual, freedom is<i> </i>necessary. It is
only possible in a democratic society. But freedom lies discipline. Freedom of
individuals is possible only if there is mutual consideration for one another.
This results in the rule law which is again possible only in a democracy. In
order to ensure democracy, men must not only have political rights but also have
social and economic rights. Individual initiative must be, however, controlled
by common considerations. So also the right to private property must be
subordinated to social justice. The world must be organized at the basis of an
international State in which “the differences need not be fused but they need
not conflict.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

He is also against all unintegrated and specialized types of knowledge. The end

harmonize the various conflicting elements in man. Universities must put
forward a conception of life based on eternal values and responsive to
historical events. They must nourish spiritual values. For this purpose they
must possess at least a few creative personalities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>I loved you with all my body and all my mind,</P>
<P>And today, Maiden, I have brought you my garland of songs.</P>
<P>Many travellers march along the track across my heart.</P>
<P>Some come singing, weaving dreams in glowing music notes.</P>
<P>In some eyes shine the suggestion of tears like the glimmer of pearls.</P>&nbsp

<P>Some fill the earth with laughter loud<I> </I>and make all glad.</P>
<P>Some conceal their Sorrow and brood silently,</P>
<P>Smouldering with slow<I> </I>wasting fire beneath a speechless calm.</P>
<P>But I wandered on and on and my eyes were full<I> </I>of dreams</P>
<P>Till suddenly, startled, I found you walking by my side.</P>&nbsp

<P>When did I first feel your trusting hands rest in mine?</P>
<P>Through long<I> </I>summer days and weary sleepless nights,</P>
<P>Through the grey evenings when darkness thickens in<I> </I>the groves,</P>
<P>I went seeking in vain through all<I> </I>my world for you.</P>
<P>I sought you in palaces in<I> </I>far-off lands of dreams:</P>
<P>A golden lotus laughing on the waters of the nectar sea </P>
<P>That<I> </I>kiss the sunlit shores beyond the <I>Tepantar </I>wastes. </P>
<P>I<I> </I>dreamt of you robed <I>in Nilambari </I>blue as sky,</P>
<P>A<I> </I>garland of <I>Gajamati </I>round your slender throat,</P>
<P>Dusky tresses that glow<I> </I>like dark <I>Asharha </I>clouds</P>
<P>In whose depths flash laughters like lightnings bright. </P>
<P>Methought I would find you a princess in<I> </I>charmed sleep</P>
<P>Till I dawned upon your shores and kissed you back to life.</P>&nbsp

<P>I wove<I> </I>dreams in my heart and went along<I> </I>my way.</P>
<P>In songs I scattered my secrets upon the path.</P>
<P>Some listened and did<I> </I>not hear; others heard </P>
<P>And<I> </I>laughed at me with<I> </I>a vain disdainful laugh. </P>
<P>A few for a moment paused and with kindly eyes </P>
<P>Smiled at me in sympathy: but regardless of them all </P>
<P>I marched on with<I> </I>your <I>Agamani </I>upon my lips<I>.</P>
</I>&nbsp
<P>In<B> </B>the work-a-day world where crowds jostle day and night,</P>
<P>Men and women strive and struggle for their daily bread,</P>
<P>And tears and smiles of many hearts flash and fade, </P>
<P>There in the bend of the city-road I saw you come  </P>
<P>In<B> </B>the bright sunlight across the noisy market-place. </P>
<P>The dust of the road clung to your robes, and upon your brow</P>
<P>Burnt the <I>Tilak </I>of disgrace that all pioneer souls</P>
<P>Must suffer in the hands of weak and cowardly minds.</P>
<P>Suddenly you stopped and proudly smiled at me.</P>
<P>       </P>&nbsp
<P>I never dreamt I would meet you upon the common road.</P>
<P>But your laughter rang out clear above the din of strife.</P>

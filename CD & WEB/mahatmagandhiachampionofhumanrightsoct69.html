approach towards <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
freedom was, throughout his thirty years’ leadership, singularly free from
bitterness. He told the British people on one occasion, on the eve of the <span

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. On the

is a vast country. You and your people can stay comfortably, provided you
accommodate yourselves to our conditions here.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

war-time Prime Minister said, shortly after he had assumed office. “I have not
become the King’s first Minister to preside over the liquidation of the <st1:place

the efficacy of his philosophy and undeterred by setbacks, did not slacken his
efforts. And within less than a decade of Churchill’s assertion <st1:country-region

racial discrimination as <span class=SpellE>practised</span> by the then
Government of that country on settlers of Indian origin. On a limited scale he
fashioned the instrument of passive resistance against injustice, oppression and
wrong. A new concept of heroic self-sacrifice came into vogue under his
guidance, enabling thousands of common men and women in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
suffer in dignified protest all the consequences of defiance of racially

or for the uplift of the untouchables in this country was unique. To him <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s freedom
signified little without the rehabilitation of the less <span class=SpellE>favoured</span>
sections of the Indian people who had endured for centuries a number of social
disabilities and humiliations. They were not the less galling because they
stemmed more from custom than from legal sanction or State policy. Gandhiji
reviewed in the same perspective the degradation of the human personality,
whether <span class=SpellE>practised</span> in the name of a superior race or
for the preservation of the privileged position of an elite class. Thus his
mission was fundamentally one of protest against discrimination in all its
forms and manifestations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The dead hand of custom in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> had
relegated an appreciable section of the community–not all of another race or
faith–to a way of life which approximated to a denial of human rights and equal
opportunities. Political leaders before Gandhiji had fixed their gaze on <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
progress towards freedom exclusively in terms of constitutional reforms. The
disabilities of the untouchables–social, economic and cultural–numbering at
that time over 60 million, had, indeed, attracted the notice of reformers from
the second half of the nineteenth century. The <span class=SpellE>poineers</span>
of the movement had dared much in a great cause, enduring social obloquy, even
ostracism, humiliation and persecution from the orthodox sections of society.
But until Gandhiji’s appearance on the scene–periodically at first and
permanently in the middle of the First World War–the two streams of progress
had remained distinct and separate. </p>

from South Africa and keenly alive to the inhumanity of racial arrogance and
all its ugly implications through discriminatory policies and measures,
Gandhiji saw in India, as in a flash, the vital link between the removal of
untouchability and national freedom. In 1917, at the annual session of the
Indian National Congress at Calcutta presided over by another great servant of
India, Mrs. Annie <span class=SpellE>Besant</span>, the first concrete step was
taken to forge such a link. In a resolution<i> </i>adopted on Gandhiji’s
initiative, the Congress “urged upon the people of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> the necessity, justice and
righteousness of removing all disabilities being of a most vexatious and

assuming the leadership of the freedom movement two years later, Gandhiji
formulated a constructive programme for all workers in the movement giving the
complete eradication of untouchability and all the evils it had bred in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s social
and economic life the topmost priority. He declared on one occasion that he
would not sacrifice the vital interests of the untouchables even for the sake
of winning <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
freedom. He said, “I would far rather that Hinduism died than that
untouchability lived.” In his weekly paper <i>Young India </i>he repeatedly
justified this radical stand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1921 he wrote in the course of an article: Untouchability cannot be given a
secondary place on the programme. Without the removal of the taint, <span

should welcome social boycott and even public <span class=SpellE>execreation</span>

all the preoccupations of an active political career, involving periodical
defiance of British authority, first described as non-cooperation and later as
civil disobedience, Gandhiji never grudged time, energy or resources to the
nation-wide fight against untouchability. For the untouchables he coined a new
name, “<span class=SpellE>Harijans</span>” meaning the children of God. The
denial to them of entry into Hindu temples, he saw, lay at the root of all
their economic and social disabilities. Temple entry for <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span>
then became with him a primary article of faith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was nevertheless firm in his conviction that the effective protection of these
classes should not be carried to an extent that might in the long run defeat
its own purpose and harm them and the country. India’s permanent Constitution,
he asserted, should start with the fundamental assumption of making observance

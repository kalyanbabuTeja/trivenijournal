and is at sixes and sevens. It is trying to put up floating bridges of rubber
dinghies on a number of small rivers behind our lines. This of course is an
excuse for keeping the way open for <span class=GramE>their own</span> escape.
Some days back the Zero bombers flew across these hill ranges and smashed up
the bridges over those rivers. The whole Division might have been caught in a
mouse trap. But it was mighty lucky that British <span class=SpellE>Totnmies</span>

machine guns and have blown into smithereens this trench of ours, the only hope

time and in rains. But I had an experience of a new smell now. Suddenly I
seemed to have come down in the hierarchy of animal existence to the most
insignificant and most short-lived one. I was no greater than the puny insects
that helplessly crawled on the soil. Even they have been going about in this
trench every day in spite of continuous shelling. Our fright and helplessness
have not affected them in any way. Mosquitoes and flies have gone on their
rounds of flight over us with indifference and yet again in between a few
showers of shells and mortar fires one or two song birds have broken the

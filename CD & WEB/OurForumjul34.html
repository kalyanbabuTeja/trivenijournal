<P ALIGN="CENTER">AN INDIAN ACADEMY</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear Sir,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I read with great interest the article entitled ‘Why not an Indian Academy?’ by Dr. P. Guha-Thakurta in the July-August 1933 number of your esteemed paper which was subsequently reproduced in <I>The Hindustan Times </I>of Delhi. On perusing the article, I thought that it would attract the attention of the big literary men of the country who could come forward with their opinion and remarks in this matter. But, so far as I am aware, I do not remember anyone paying any heed to the proposal excepting Mr. I. A. Chapman who wrote from some Indian State and which was published in <I>The Hindustan Times. </I>Hence I was very much pleased when I saw in the Nov.-December (1933) issue of your journal a discussion on the subject by Mr. S. P. Sarma of Madras. I was gratified to think that at least one individual of the South had bestowed a thought over it and I am contributing these lines to your paper in the belief that the flame of discussion already started should be kept alive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is really very strange that one should be clamouring for an Indian Academy and nobody will take notice of it. Dr. Guha-Thakurta was perfectly right when he said that it was a misfortune that one had to plead for something one ought to have. The necessity for such an institution cannot, to my mind, be over-emphasised. Judging from the literary output of Bengal alone, such a ‘supreme intellectual tribunal’ is a necessity to give stimulus to the struggling young literary artists of that province who are really famished for want of recognition and funds. But co-ordination between provinces is a greater necessity, as we do not know whether there is any great intellectual achievement in the Tamil, Andhra or Maharashtra countries in their own language. Thus language is a great barrier between the provinces, almost insurmountable in its nature. Hence I think that branches of the Academy should be established in each province which should be co-ordinated by a central office at Delhi or Calcutta. Each province should maintain its own language and collect specimens of excellent productions for the year. These will be sent to the central office from all parts of India and the Great Ten of the central office will appraise their value and apportion their merits. The central office must necessarily be run in English in the absence of a common language for the whole of India. The central office should assign the hall-mark of recognition to certain really meritorious works and arrange for their translation, if they consider that it can claim universal approbation. I am told that, in England, the Royal Academy sits in judgment over all paintings received through the length and breadth of the country and the painters who receive recognition at the hands of the Royal Academy flourish, both in reputation and in money.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As long as we cannot have a separate Academy for science or philosophy, we should bring together all great scientists or philosophers of our country within the fold of the Academy and should not, therefore, include only <I>belles-lettres </I>men.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I conclude, I would like once more to stress the necessity for the establishment of such an institution in our country in the interests of the culture and civilisation we boast of, and of which we are natural inheritors, being the present-day citizens of the world at large. I invite the great literary men, scientists, philosophers and other numerous readers of your journal to come forward with their suggestions and help in the building-up of the Indian Academy which is still in the dreamland of Dr. Guha-Thakurta.</P>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A CALLOW schoolboy in the first decade of the
century was shocked beyond words when he read in a book by an American
hygienist that bathing was unnecessary for health and might conceivably be
harmful. And, though he has since outgrown many prejudices, he has not been
quite able to get over this one. For he was brought up on the banks of the
Kaveri. His day began with a bath; he envied the blossom grace of the young
swimmers though he was too timorous to emulate them. The water he drank came
from the river, not dripping lukewarm from a metal tap covered with verdigris
but in cool pitchers carried by gentle hands. In early summer the dry river-bed
was his playground. For many memorable months at a stretch he listened
spell-bound to the Ramayana expounded in the low-roofed spacious <i>mandapa </i>on
the bathing <i>ghat </i>by one of the greatest scholars of his time. To this
day the music of Valmiki brings up for him nostalgic recollections of those
“moving waters at their priest like task.” The festive pipes were often heard
there; and once in a while the long-dawn wail, of the trumpets as a funeral
passed by. But the most abiding memory is the hush that fell on the river in
the gloaming, when the old men standing knee-deep in water offered <i>arghya </i>as
the rooks settled to rest and the stars came out one by one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Indian culture is essentially a riparian growth. <i>Apo
va idagm sarvam</i>, says the Sruti, And the <i>Manasara </i>lays down that the
site of a projected village should be near a stream. Running water has
symbolised for us the central mystery of life, which ever renews itself, yet is
never the same. The oiliest prayer in the world invokes the seven holy streams;
and an immemorial tradition gives the Kaveri pride of place among them all, the
Ganga herself not excepted. She is the mind-born of Brahma, says the Sthala
Purana. The selfless rishi Kavera obtained her for daughter as the result of
his long austerities on the Brahmagiri. He gave her hand in marriage to the
sage Agastya. But, having come down from Heaven to purify the earth and enrich
it, she issued forth at the appointed hour from the water-bowl in which the
patron saint of the South had gathered her in essence along with other holy
streams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>At this point let the historian take up the tale.
The turbulent mounts in stream gathering many tributaries on the Mysore
table-land spills all over the plains till a constructive genius of the first
order comes to tame her. “The servitude of rivers,” says Gibbon, “is the
noblest and most important victory which man has obtained over the
licentiousness of Nature.” And Chola Karikala, by shoring up the turbid waters
between two high banks, turned what might have been a foetid swamp into a
Garden of Eden. Another Chola, probably Raja Raja, built the Grand Anicut, one
of the engineering marvels of the ancient world. And since then many dams have
been built up and down the river and innumerable canals dug, so that seen from
the sky the Tanjore Delta must appear seamed and scarred with the victory of
man over Nature. Even so the problem of drainage remains largely unsolved. But
the Kaveri for all her vagaries deserves supremely well the title <i>Chola Mata
</i>that a grateful Samskrit poet bestowed on her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Kaveri is by no means a mighty stream, reckoned
by any standard. Its length of four hundred and seventy-two miles is exceeded
by that of almost every other famous Indian river, not to mention such foreign
giants as the Mississipi and the Yangtse Kyang. In its most populous reaches it
is dry for six months in the year; and nowhere is it navigable. At its
broadest, above the Upper Anicut, it is hardly more than a mile in width. After
the Kollidam takes off it becomes progressively tenuous till barely a drop of
water is left by the time it reaches the sea. But, for all her physical
smallness, “Dakshinapatha Jahnavee”–(the Ganga of the South)–as she has been
called, has made a name for herself in literature which Roman fiber and
silver-streamed Thames might envy. The Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the
Bhagavata and the Skandha all speak of her with reverence. To Valmiki she is
“the divine stream, the blessed one, in whose lucent waters the <i>apsarases</i>
love to sport.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tributes to the sacred stream on which are situated forty of the
hundred-and-eight ‘tiruppatis’ of Vaishnavism and numberless Siva shrines of
hoary antiquity. Among later panegyrists the most notable are Parasara Bhatta
who in his <i>Rangaraja Sthava</i>, celebrates the beauty and magnificence of
the river at Srirangam the holy island; Tyagaraja who in his Asaveri Kriti <i>Sari
Vedalina</i>, playing a variation on the same theme, pictures her as hastening
with joyous abandon to join the Lord; and Nilakantha Dikshita who in his <i>Siva
Lilarnava </i>gives in a few verses the essence of that culture which is the
characteristic product of the Kaveri. The Dikshita, a grand-nephew of the great
Appayya, was born in Thondamandalam. He lived but a short while in Tanjore
where he studied under the polymath and statesman Govinda Dikshita. The best
part of his life he spent at Madura as Minister of the Nayak Kings. Such a man
can be hardly accused of parochialism, when he writes, “Whatever else one might
wish to praise one inevitably looks to the Chola Desa for a comparison.” “<i>Svarga
</i>and <i>apavarga </i>are equally at the command of these fortunate mortals.
Sweet is Kaveri water; sweeter the milk of the coconut on her banks; sweetest
the songs of her poets.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sprang directly from the life of the people and all classes and all strata
contributed to it each in its measure. It bespoke a social cohesion which even
forty years ago had not visibly broken down. In its palmy days that organic
society was perhaps family-centered, but its members were not self-centered.
They may have been clannish, but they were not exclusive. Caste was a reality,
but there was hardly such a talking as caste-consciousness. The river, the
numerous far-famed temples on its banks, the feasts, fasts, and ceremonies by
which they reckoned the passing year and which were never complete without a
bath at one or other sacred spot, the body of folk-lore and legend that had
accumulated down the centuries–all these acted as a powerful cement of social
relations. Learning was valued not for ones own sake nor for the money it
brought but as a means of liberation. Within the hallowed precincts of the
schools there were no such distinctions as high and low, native and alien. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Mahratta successors, poets, musicians and scholars flocked from all parts
of the country. They were receive with every mark of honour, assured a modest
competence and allowed complete freedom to devote themselves to their chosen
tasks. On the short stretch of eighty odd miles from Srirangam to the sea three
hundred villages have been listed and if you penetrate to three miles on either
bank the number could easily be trebled. Many of these were Royal grants. One
of the most famous was Sahajirajapuram, established by King Shaji and better
known today as Tiruvisanalloor. Sixty-four families noted for their learning,
contentment, and purity of life were settled here. There were Maharashtrans,
Kannadigas and Telugus among them as there, were Tamils; and they represented
all, the three schools of Vedanta. Ramabhadra the foremost poet of the Silver
Age of Samskrit, Sadasiva Brahmendra the Mahayogi, Sridhara Venkatesa the
prince of devotees and friend of Bodhendra of Nama Siddhanta fame,
Yagnanarayana Yajwa, the author of a great Mimamsa classic, and hundreds of
others who lived in this little village enriched literature and the arts. They
made history and in due course the halo of sainthood has settled upon them.
Within a mile or two of this Brahman centre of learning and piety and living in
perfect amity with the Sankara Acharya Peetha at Kumbakonam were the great
Tamil Adhinams, the home of Saiva Siddhanta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

miles of her course where lovely little villages are sown thick on either bank.
Earth has not anything to show more fair than this green valley with its dense
and yet orderly vegetation, through which the sun rarely penetrates. The soil
is rich and is constantly renewed by the prodigal river. Even when it goes dry
the water is never far from the surface and the busy picotahs make a pleasing sight.
Bountiful nature did not however make for sloth. All sections of a variously
gifted people placed their special talents and their ungrudged labour at the
service of the community. They built temples and choultries, organised
festivals, excavated tanks and opened many a new avenue to the questing spirit,

Aryan-Dravidian synthesis which was triumphantly worked out in these ideal
conditions. Long ago, on the banks of the Kaveri, the Tamil achieved an
intuitive balance between tradition and innovation. He offered an unwavering
hospitality to new ideas but took care not to endanger the stability of social
life. An extraordinary subtlety in speculation went hand in hand with an
unaffected attachment to the simple life. The decorative element which
proliferates luxuriantly in the sculpture of the great Chola temples is subdued
to the general design which is securely grounded in metaphysic. Not for nothing
did the temple serve for ages as the nerve-centre of the community. Today the
villages are half-empty, the temples too often in the undisturbed possession of
bats and owls; the Kaveri is rich in her bounty as ever, but the hands are too
few that are stretched out to receive the guerdon. But no man who has lived on
her banks in the impressionable years can forget her quite. Echoing the
memorable confession of a great scholar in another context, he might say:
“Familiar with all skepticism’s, expert in tracing all beliefs to primitive
superstitions, explorers of the infinitely great and infinitely small, we are
children of the Kaveri still.”*<o:p></o:p></span></p>

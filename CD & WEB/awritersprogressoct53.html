style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Binu
often went to the palace. He was familiar with the way a Raja lives. He also
visited the <i>Pan </i>quarter and the quarter of the <i>Sabars; </i>he knew
how they lived. He saw the stratification of society but it did not pain him
then as it was to later. The hiatus between classes and their conflict had not
obscured his perception of how they came to exist. The elevations d depressions
of society were bearable as long as the custom of establishing arbitrary bonds
of kinship was a living custom, even though such relationships were only
lip-deep and perhaps not even that. People do not trouble to set up even superficial
ties of kin nowadays. Lip-kinship is incapable of concealing the width of the
gap between classes; the pretence has been abandoned. This is why the class
question is so acute today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever
the outcome of the conflict may be Binu will always cherish in his heart the
memory of mutual affection between people as people. At the time those to whom
he was not bound by his own or his parents’ self-interest allowed him to
believe that lip kinship is real kinship. He found pure affection and love
despite social inequality. This sort of thing, unimaginable today, was then a
reality. Why should not what was a reality in the life of one become a reality
in the lives of all, if there is truth in it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

poet is not born to settle social questions; that is others’ work. What he
perceives to be true is true at least for him. If he be the representative of
many others, it is true for them also. If he be the spokesman of all time, what
is true for him will be true for all time. Binu did not lose the faith of his
childhood just because he had grown up. To break faith is to betray; he could
not betray all the aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters he had loved as a
child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Binu had never learned to read or write, if he had spent his days sitting in a
quince tree or his noons and afternoons in a swimming hole, he would still have
been linked with the inmost soul of India through the Ramayana, the Mahabharata
and Vaishnava poetry. Also through the <i>Chandi </i>of Kavikankan. His
grandmother told him stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, orally, not
in a general way but in exact and elaborate detail. He did not learn more from
books later. He also heard the two tales of the <i>Chandi </i>first from her
lips. At home the <i>Chandi </i>was read out in a musical recitative. Binu was
at first a listener and then a reciter. And the <i>kirtan </i>songs made their
way into his heart through his ears at singing parties. He joined the chorus
which chants the refrains. The theatre, the <i>jatra, </i>and the <i>kathakata </i>made
him aware of ancient traditions without any </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
life was pervaded by these influences. He did not go into ecstasies over the
past, nor did the fascination of it blind him to his own times. On the contrary
he proclaimed loudly that mistakes made in the past are responsible for the
present plight of India. He criticised it mercilessly. But to sever one’s
connection with the mother river of tradition, the Ganges, would have dried up
the waters of his spirit. His country would have become a waterless wilderness
to him, though it would have been his country still. A country without a past
is a country without a future. To deny the past is to sever oneself from it. To
deny the future is to be without a culture capable of further growth. This is
what happened in Egypt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

connection must be kept intact. It is because those of our countrymen who have
accepted Islam are suffering from the pain of this amputation that no notable
creative work is being produced by them. Those who have become Christian have
not cut themselves off in the same way. That is why the writing of <i>Meghnad
Badh </i>was possible. In Binu’s life various creeds mingled and he was
familiar also with foreign thought. But he did not deprive himself of the
continuous experience of four or five thousand years, the tradition of his own
country and its ancient roots. To the long chain of Indian poets Binu was an
added pearl, strung on the same string.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
since when had he become a poet? The journalist in him had pushed to the front
and was dominating. His desire to be a journalist was the result of the
attraction his own times held for him. He had scarcely learned his letters
before newspapers fell into his hands, newspapers bringing him the message of
his times. At last he began to want to be a messenger himself, transmitting
news. To transmit news is to be a journalist. The news transmitted is the news
of the age. For the journalist there is no distinction between his own and
other lands. Such a distinction, if it happens to occur, is unlooked for and
dispensable. But a journalist must have a sense of his times; he cannot get
along without that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
Binu this sense had not entirely obscured his awareness of his nationality, but
it was slowly spreading across it like clouds overcast the sky. Day and night
he dreamt of America and perhaps became somewhat annoyed with the land of his
birth. So it was that Amritsar found no response in his heart and to him the
proposed Non-co-operation Movement appeared only evidence of a certain narrowness
of outlook. But he felt the heat as the temper of the country rose, bursting at
last into flame. He decided to non-co-operate and made only a pretence of
sitting for his exams. He knew the results would be poor and he did not care,
for he felt no desire to go to college. Going to jail did not attract him
either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
set out for Calcutta to become a journalist. From there he intended to proceed
to America as the opportunity offered. But one look at the ocean-going steamers
made his mouth go dry. These ships were not fit to cross the Ganges in! How
could one sail the seven seas in them? One look at him made the mouths of the
editors go dry. When they were told that this stripling wrote both English and
Bengali and was competent to do their editorials for them, they took their
heads into their hands. At last one of them suggested that he do translations
for the time being. Another made him a proof-reader. Binu was surprised that no
one gave him any writing to do, not<i> </i>even a column. Binu’s health gave
way not long after. One of the men with whom he worked advised him to become a
college graduate if he wanted to be a journalist. Binu was hurt by the advice
but he went home, recovered his health and entered college.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

such as how to increase the yield of land, reduce the ravages of harmful
insects, conduct business in co-operation, how to dispense with brokers and how
to take trade out of the hands of the rich and put it into the hands of the

intended to love but not to marry and tie himself down. If a child resulted
from his love, society would have to take the responsibility for it. Society
must be prepared for that sort of thing. One of Binu’s chief tasks was to
reform society and there was always the country to be saved. If he went to

were modern civilisation, large-scale industry, parliamentary government, armed

God in capital letters was Swaraj. They accepted Gandhiji for the sake of
Swaraj. But why should they give up mill-made cloth and wear homespun khaddar?

the wise men had forfeited their peace of mind. So had Binu. He had not doubted
that Gandhi was a man of destiny but his birth was the death of an age. That
was evident. Binu fell into a dilemma. Gandhi’s <i>Hind Swaraj </i>thrilled
him. He too was an anarchist in his bones; he could not bear any sort of
government. If a law is to be obeyed, it is the inner law. Yet he was
absolutely unwilling to go back two hundred years at the word of Gandhiji, even
though there be no Swaraj.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

renouncing his knighthood Rabindranath proved that he was not the man to look
on at the dishonour of his country helplessly. So when the poet took exception
to the ethics of Gandhiji’s Non-co-operation Movement, many like Binu found an
excuse for not joining it. Otherwise Binu would have felt that the disgrace of
going to college had branded him. Binu was already an admirer of Rabindranath;
now he became an ardent partisan, worshipping him blindly. On the other hand he
had a weakness for Gandhiji too, perhaps through the influence of <i>Hind
Swaraj.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

That was the trouble with patriotic dyes in those days!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Binu had read and beep moved by almost all the works of Rabindranath, his
relationship with the poet had more of a religious than a literary character.
Rabindranath was an Upanishadic Rishi and Binu was a seeker, a questioner of
life. The answers to his questions he found on the lips of Rabindranath, not of
Gandhiji. To seekers like Binu the poet made a direct appeal, saying as it
were, “No other Path at all is there to go.” <i>(Naanyah panthaah vidyate
‘yanaaya)</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

had brooded over the thought of death ever since he lost his mother. In his
grief he found comfort in Rabindranath’s <i>Gitanjali, Naibedya </i>and <i>Kheya.
</i>He did not read these books as literature nor did he stop to consider
whether the poetry was good poetry or not. He read them for their message and
discovered in them intimations of immortality. They were books written from
living experience, not from pedantry. “The farther I explore my heart and
mind,” wrote the poet; “the more of Your Infinity I find. No sorrow, no death,
no separation exists there.” This was the voice of the true seer, the Rishi.
Binu concluded that he was infallible. So it was that when Rabindranath wrote,
‘Satyer Ahwan’ (The Call of Truth), in refutation of Gandhiji. Binu felt he had
found a satisfactory justification for his conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it shone on. The soul is immortal. Though the<i> </i>body may die the soul
shall not. If the body were enough, Maitreyi would not have asked, <i>“Yenaham

sense that the human soul is immortal. He is also immortal in the sense that
his message is immortal, his creative achievement is immortal. Would Binu, like
Rabindranath, not create something that would make him immortal too? Binu felt
a keen desire for<i> </i>the immortality that can be earned. He wished to live,
he wished to live in his works. “In this beautiful world,” he quoted, “I
desire, not death, but to live among men.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was to create. What should he create? Does the desire alone suffice? Is no

feelings he had experienced. How meagre it seemed to him! He must add to it.
The reading of books and periodicals does not add to it; to leave home and take
to the road does. How rich and varied is the experience strewn along the
roadsides of the world! All one has to do is to gather it up; there is no lack
of material then. Anybody can write a book after reading half a dozen other
books. But few<i> </i>read such books. The writing perishes before the writer.
All that remains is a museum skeleton. Who wants such a fate! Binu wanted his
work to live among the living, in individual lives, not in the museum of the
commonplace. He addressed himself to the eternal, to the individual reader. And

Continent. European literature filled him with admiration. Indian life is so
monotonous and the life of Europe so rich and varied! This was one reason.
Another was that there are many masterpieces in European literature which
transcend their time and place. Binu felt that what he created, if he created
anything at all, should be the equal of these masterpieces. His ideal of
achievement must not fall below theirs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

beginning his favourites among foreign writers were Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw,
Bertrand Russell and H. G. Wells. Similarly Sarat Chandra Chatterjee and
Satyendranath Dutta were his favourites among Indian writers. He had discovered
Bankim Chandra and Dwijendralal in childhood and, unknown to himself, outgrown
them. Sarat Chandra and Satyendranath became greater favourites but not greater
than Rabindranath and Pramatha Chaudhuri. Nor were they dearer to him than
Tolstoy and Romain Rolland. Nor than Dostoevski and Balzak, nor than Shelley,

as in the lower classes, they are the tame creatures of men, not birds of the

came from women themselves! They are women! Binu was made to realise that women
are not ready for real freedom. Neither are men for that matter. Genuine freedom
will come only with fundamental changes in the social structure. When such a
waste of youth and life becomes intolerable to men, when this tame existence

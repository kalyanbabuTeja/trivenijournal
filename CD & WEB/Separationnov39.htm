<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between us was a blinding curtain, forbidding and foreboding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between us were doubts, prejudices, and our dead hearts’ ashes– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we looked into each other’s eyes and seemed to hear</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The music of our former life–alas! crushed dead so soon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were in two different worlds, so real and so untrue:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One, a glittering dome of show, money and shame, and the forgotten Self</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other of dreams, hopes and the rhythm of the Soul.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And you said: ‘Come out, you dreaming idiot, kick those castles in the air.’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And I replied: ‘Come, my friend, leave that dead material world</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of hate, passion and distrust, where men toil on to find their graves.’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we shook our heads and murmured, ‘Let me die where I was born.’</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words clashed, our hearts were crushed, and we looked mortally pained;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And like drifting boats we strayed apart to shores we knew not which.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, Fate decreed that we should meet and balm the bruised hearts:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So here we stand to understand the unknown and the un-knowable.</P></DIR>

the 21st August, a week after this writer had mailed the manuscript of the
‘Survey’ for the last issue of the <i>Triveni, </i>the Soviet and Eastern
European troops marched into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Obviously, for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>,
the Czech <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span> went beyond the point of
permissible deviation within the Communist camp. The Czech Communist Party
Secretary and the main architect of <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span>,
Mr. Alexander <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span>, disappeared and later it came
to be known that the Russians had arrested him and, in manacles, took him to a
far off place, presumably, with a view to liquidate him. Meanwhile, the Czech
people rose in revolt against the occupying forces and the extent and
spontaneity of the upsurge was such that a virtual state of war existed. The
outside world expressed concern at this ‘rape’ of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:country-region>
for a second time in thirty years and on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of
the creation of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Czechoslovak</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. What is more
significant, the Czech resistance seemed to have unnerved <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>,
which immediately announced that it would hold talks with the Czech leaders in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City></st1:place>. The Czech
President, General <span class=SpellE>Swaboda</span>, appealed to his
countrymen to show restraint, while asserting that Czech <span class=SpellE>honour</span>,
independence and integrity will not bartered away at the negotiations and asked
the people to have faith in him. It was also disclosed then, for the first time
since the invasion, that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span> was safe and
would be participating in the talks. Apparently, the Czech revolt, the world
reaction and their own guilty conscience, made the Russian leaden not to carry
out their intention of eliminating him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
talks commenced on the 23rd August, and lasted for three days. Agreement was
reached that foreign troops would vacate Czech soil as soon as conditions
returned to normal. The question of a time-table for troop withdrawal was left
to </span><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
While the Soviet agreement, in principle, to withdraw, and the participation of
the liberal leaders, <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
<span class=SpellE>Cernik</span> (the Prime Minister), can be regarded as gains

end to <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span>, a declaration of their loyalty

w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> demanded that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City>
should avoid projecting an image of a victim of aggression. Since the <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> talks, <st1:City w:st="on">Prague</st1:City> has
shown an over-Concern in opposing any public debate over the invasion to save
the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> from <span class=SpellE>ernbarrassment</span>.
Whereas only a couple of days after the invasion, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
erstwhile Czech Foreign Minister rushed to U. N. to let the world know of the
‘rape’, yet since the Moscow negotiations, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Czechs returned to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City>
receiving a triumphant welcome from their people. But the leaders soon began
the un</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

Early September was a period of agony for them. They had to do the almost </span><span

task of making the top personnel of the regime survive the Russian wrath and at
the same time put de-<span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span> into operation.
Strong <span class=SpellE>rumours</span> were current that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> was still determined to oust <span
class=SpellE>Dubcek</span>. But, apparently, its designs were foiled, thanks to
the spontaneous support to <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span> by the people, in
general and the Czech and Slovak Communist parties in particular. At subsequent
meetings, the executives of the Czech and Slovak Communist parties declared
that there was no question of any change in their leadership, and indeed, at
one of these, they alleged that the Russians attempted to secure the ouster,
one by one, of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span> and his supporters, and
their replacement by more pliable party men like Mr. Joseph <span class=SpellE>Smrkovsky</span>,
the President of the Czech National Assembly. While this illustrates the
massive support available to <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span>, the events also
highlight how insecure and uncertain seem to be his tenure against <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>’s pressures.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile,
preparations were afoot for the <span class=SpellE>despatch</span> of the Czech
delegation to the crucial second round of talks on the proposed treaty with <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>. This meeting had
to be put off twice because the Czechs and the Russians could not agree about
the composition </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the Czech delegation. It appears that <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> wanted to see the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City> team include supporters of the
Moscow-line while the Czechs stuck to their right to pick their men. The latter
had their way, and announced that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span> and Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Cernik</span> would lead their team. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Czech delegation left for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
in the first week of October. On the 5th, it was announced that a treaty had
been <span class=SpellE>finalised</span>, providing for the immediate
withdrawal of the bulk of the occupying forces but permitting the “temporary
stationing” of some Russian troops (70,000) even after the <span class=SpellE>normalisation</span>
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It is evident that the talks marked a substantial climb-down for Czech
aspirations. While the immediate withdrawal of the bulk of foreign troops is in
the nature of a concession to Czech demands, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> prevailed on the prestige issue of the
right of Warsaw Pact divisions to stay on Czech soil. The treaty, as <span
class=SpellE>finalised</span> at <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>, was
formally signed at a ceremony in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City>
by Kosygin and <span class=SpellE>Cernik</span> on the 16th of October, and the
withdrawal of Polish and Hungarian troops already commenced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Czech gains are, thus, mainly confined to the survival of the leadership that
was responsible for the <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span>. And this in
itself is significant. To an extent it indicates a slight softening in the
Soviet attitude towards ‘dissenters’ and ‘renegades’ in the camp. But if the
liberal leadership managed to survive, <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span>
itself is scotched and, what is worse, the leadership is made to recant and
retrace. Since the end of August curbs on free expression reappeared and
experimentation by way of economic industrial <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span>
is shelved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
on the whole, the invasion can be said to have succeeded in curbing reformism
and to have browbeaten the Czech leaders to confine the wielding of their
independence to lines approved by <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>.
No doubt, <span class=SpellE>Dubcek</span> made repeated assertions that the
Czech way to communism will not be traded to buy peace with their ideological
mentor. But such assertions, in the light of the subsequent turn-about in the
implementation of <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span>, can only be
regarded as attempts to compensate for absence of action by political
rhetoric–a sort of face-saving device for the Czech leaders before an expectant
public opinion at home. Here one important point should be appreciated. Moscow <span
class=SpellE>recognises</span> that the Czech leadership in reluctantly bowing
to Russian demands, has the urgent need to keep up appearances of having stood
up to Moscow. This is needed both in order to placate Czech public opinion and
also to avoid another popular upsurge against <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>. This recognition in itself
constitutes a notable shift in the Russian attitude. Apart from their anxiety
not to ignore the norms of legitimacy in dealing with the countries in their
sphere of influence, an equal concern to avoid open confrontations with the
native populations is hereby disclosed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
now remains to enquire why the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>
decided to intervene. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Reasons ranging from Russian fears of
counter-revolution in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and its cancerous spread to other areas to alleged pressures by neo-Stalinist
sections among the Russian and other Eastern European leaderships have been
suggested. It is difficult to isolate any single cause and identify it as the
real one behind the Russian action. In politics, as indeed in human motivation,
there never are single causes. The Russian obsession with the idea that behind every
dissent there is the devil of heresy cannot lightly be passed over. Howsoever
imprecise and unconvincing the charge of counter-revolution might appear to the
non-Communist mind, it should be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> that it
is a meaningful reality to the communists. In addition, there is also the point
that liberalization in Czechoslovakia, in particular, (with its record of
democracy and its committal to individual liberty of the Western ‘genre’, till
its <span class=SpellE>communisation</span> in 1948), might always tend to
overstep the limits of permissible deviation within the fold of communism and
‘degenerate’ into bourgeois individualism. Further, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s demand <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>for the vacation of Warsaw Pact forces from
its soil might have caused extra anxiety to the Eastern Block countries. A fall
in ideological </span>zeal in a borderline State would to an extent <span
class=SpellE>jeopardise</span> military security of the Bloc itself. There is
the possible motive of giving a salutary warning to other Communist states like
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Romania</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
where ideological deviation seemed to assume the proportions of asserting
complete independence in the conduct of foreign policy. It is known that for
the past few years <st1:City w:st="on">Bucharest</st1:City> sought close
relations with Western powers and, what is even more surprising at times
refused to vote along with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the United Nations. All these considerations could have weighed with <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> and its allies.<i>
</i>And here perhaps the pressures of the ‘hawks’ in Moscow and in other
Eastern European States account for the precipitate nature of the<i> </i>action
which baffled so many outside observers. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To

aggression. And it is all the more deplorable, because in resorting to it,
Moscow has apparently reversed its policy of allowing dissent among its
ideological allies or, at least, its policy of dealing with dissent in a humane
and less brutal manner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has the immediate effect of retarding the growth of ‘detente’ between the West

at peace in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are heading towards a major breakthrough. The Americans have now announced
total halting of the bombing of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North
  Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Since the North Vietnamese have
been insisting, from the start, on such an American initiative as a
pre-condition to any efforts at de-escalation in the war on their part, the
American offer is indeed a great step forward. With this, the Paris Talks will
move from the stage of discussing how to reduce hostilities to that of the most
crucial stage of negotiations for a general political settlement in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>’s response is

preventing guerilla infiltration into the South and also by adopting a
reasonable attitude towards the future settlement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
American offer has been sudden and in it origins, not without a touch of
melodrama. For, till the middle of October, the Paris Talks did not make an
inch of progress since they began in May. The North Vietnamese kept on to their
demand for an unconditional stopping of bombing raids on the North; the
Americans on their part stood pat on their position that, since they had
already reduced the intensity of bombing from last spring, it was now <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>’s turn to
reciprocate with stopping infiltration. And these respective positions remained
unchanged till the middle of October. Meanwhile, responsible world leaders like
the U. N. Secretary-General, U <span class=SpellE>Thant</span>, reiterated that
<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
should stop all bombing raids. President De Gaulle has been even more
forthright in condemning <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
for not doing so. A couple of months ago, Mr. Arthur Goldberg, the former
American ambassador in the U. N., also expressed the opinion that it was for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> to take
further initiative. Yet, President Johnson was unmoved and the Paris Talks went
on their five-month-old pattern of mutual accusations of war-mongering and of
insincerity towards the cause of peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
suddenly a spurt in diplomatic activity was witnessed in Saigon since the 17th
of October, with the American ambassador in <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place>,
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Elseworth</span> Bunker, meeting the South Vietnamese
President, Nguyen Van <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span>, for a series of talks.
This led to speculation that the Americans were prepared to offer to <st1:City
w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> a complete bombing halt and that the talks to Saigon
were intended to sound <st1:place w:st="on">Saigon</st1:place>’s reactions, as
also to assure it that South Vietnamese security will under no conditions be
sacrificed. Yet, while the world capitals hummed with reports of this new
American initiative, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
itself denied that any policy changes were contemplated. It was only after
repeated denials that <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>,
at last, came out with the offer. It is obvious that the American reluctance to
admit that an offer was being considered was due to their concern for <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>’s relation to the
offer. It is certain that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>
was sounded by the Americans to ascertain whether in return for the offer the
former would assure that they would not take military advantage of the lull in
bombing. Presumably, the Americans also informed <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City> of their wish that the present Saigon
Government should be allowed to participate in the future talks and that the
National Liberation Front, the political wing of the Vietcong, will also be
invited to the talks. It is difficult to know what precise assurances the
Americans had obtained from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>
before they made their offer public. But <span class=GramE>It</span> is now
known that the Americans </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>, through their
delegate to the Paris Talks, as far back as mid-September, though nothing of
this was suggested in the progress of the talks themselves till the end of
October. It is not known whether <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City> will
concede to the participation of the <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> regime and
it is equally doubtful whether the South Vietnamese will take well to <st1:country-region

to seat the N. L. F. at the conference table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is being observed as the International Year for Human Rights. Twenty years ago,
the U. N. adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with the ringing
words “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are
endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in the
spirit of brotherhood.” Thus was the spirit behind the French Revolution and
Thomas Paine’s <i>Rights of Man, </i>reasserted by humanity. No doubt, the
unparalleled obliteration of every facet of human dignity under the Nazi terror
shocked the world conscience, and thus provided the immediate cause for the
Declaration. There were other causes too. The spirit of liberty, emanating from
<st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>, was shut off by the Europeans
themselves, thanks to colonial greed, and it needed the necromancy of the Nazis
to make the Europeans <span class=SpellE>realise</span> that rights have no
relation to race and region. The era of colonial liberation, starting with the
birth of new <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is also symptomatic of the process of the <span class=SpellE>universalisation</span>
of freedom and human dignity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Declaration was a mere general statement intended to serve as a rough model for
member states to draw upon in incorporating human rights into their
constitutional set-ups. The need for more comprehensive and precise draft of
the various categories of rights of man was felt from the start. By making
members subscribe to such draft conventions, their obligations to </span><span

rights can be made direct and identifiable and the extent of the discharge of

that the U. N. Commission on Human </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rights toiled for
eighteen years and prepared two universal multi-purpose conventions which
translate the philosophical and political </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ideas of the Universal
Declaration into legal parlance. These two, the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights, were adopted on 16th December 1966, by the General Assembly.
These two multi-purpose conventions, along with the Declaration itself,
constitute the triptych of the noble edifice of human rights. These conventions
legally bind the subscribing states to incorporate the Contents into their

only the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has the provision for enforceability

secure these, is, of course, the reason. The same predicament forced the
framers of the Indian constitution to make Fundamental Rights representing more
the civil and political rights, enforceable, while leaving out from this
category, economic and social rights, which find expression in the Directive Principles.

Universal Declaration and for which services has been awarded the Noble Peace
Prize this Year. He says: “The most important conclusion that emerges from a
comparison of the Declaration with the 18th century declarations and 19th
century constitutions is that individual freedoms are not considered by the
Universal Declaration to be the fundamental human rights to the exclusion of
all others. In the Universal Declaration, these individual </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
must also be pointed out that in addition to this creditable work of adopting
the multi-purpose conventions, the U. N. had also passed single-purpose
conventions dealing with a freedom or a particular right. The conventions on
genocide (1948), statelessness (1951), forced <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
(1957), discrimination in the matter of employment (1958), and all forms of
racial discrimination (1965) are notable among these. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
acceptance and implementation of human rights contained in these conventions
has so far been less than sincere in many parts of the world. There is no doubt
that the under-developed parts of the world are <span class=GramE>more guilty</span>
on this score and the trend towards the erosion of human values is indeed
deplorable. Yet, it is also necessary to <span class=SpellE>recognise</span>
that there is a correlation between the fact of their economic backwardness and
the neglect of human rights. Rebellions, revolutions and the consequential
repression by the powers that be–all indices of the absence of civil and
political liberties–are partly a function of the prevailing poverty, ignorance
and despair. Those that off-hand <span class=GramE>condemn</span> the failure
of democracy and the denial of human dignity in these regions, should bear in
mind this factor. It is here that the imperative need for the acceptance of
responsibility on the part of the richer nations to share their affluence with
the impoverished world arises. Thus, while the U. N. should step-up its
campaign in urging for the speedy adoption of the Covenants on human rights, in
letter and deed, unless a fresh drive for massive financial assistance through
international aegis is launched, there is no use bemoaning that human
dignity–the <i>raison <span class=SpellE>detre</span> </i>of the Universal
Declaration–has been humbled. No body need be surprised if the International
Year for Human Rights passes off with no appreciable advance in the
implementation of these rights over wide areas. For, did not the International

of the richer nations to come to the <span class=SpellE>succour</span> of the

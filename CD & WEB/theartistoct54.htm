six years of enforced banishment in a <span class=SpellE>mofussil</span> town,
I was once again able to be<i> </i>in the city to welcome <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Ravi</span></st1:place> on his arrival from abroad and
participate in the fete held by his brother-artists in <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
of his arrival. Tied down to a dull and monotonous life in what was an apology
for a town, and compelled to maintain a family on a mere pittance, I would
often look back with nostalgic regret on the pleasant days which now seemed so
far away in retrospect, as if they had existed in some previous birth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

those days I was a care-free youth, a typical college student <span
class=GramE>more keen</span> on wandering about the streets than on attending
the classes. It was then that I contracted the acquaintance or artists. There
was something enchanting about their Bohemian and devil-may-care attitude to
life. Later when the responsibility of supporting a big family fell on me, I
had many times felt an irresistible desire to escape into their free and
unconventional world <span class=GramE>where</span> freaks were the rule. My
admiration for their wild freedom, an admiration not quite unmixed with envy,
was that blend of wonder and awe which a child feels at the sight of an acrobat
doing wonderful feats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
remember <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>. In
that nondescript mass of artists of all varieties I was able to remember him,
for he was a bit out of the common. Like his confreres he was also jovial and
unconventional, and sported a happy-go-lucky attitude to life. But what
distinguished him from the crowd was the seriousness of purpose which <span
class=SpellE>characterised</span> his devotion to art. Accustomed to sudden
changes of income and compelled to wade through months of poverty, with rare
intervals of short-lived prosperity, artists are generally a spendthrift race.
This kind of life makes them too generous with words which are not followed by
deeds. It is common even for really gifted people to plan for years some grand
work of art without actually attempting it. When pressed by some financial
crisis, which is a normal occurrence in their life, they are apt to satisfy the
needs of the moment with something second-rate, postponing the real ‘It’ for a more
proper time, and very often their masterpieces remain mere dreams to the end of
their lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>
also would often talk about his masterpiece. But on such occasions I had
noticed a wild gleam in his and had told myself that, in the midst of all those
bragging artists, there was at least one genuine man who would one day <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> his dream. I was sure that <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span>
<span class=SpellE>Babu’s</span> work would one day cause a stir in the
art-world and earn for him a high place among the Heroes of the Brush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
that day then seemed far off. <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span> <span
class=SpellE>Babu</span> had set before himself a high ideal of perfection and
was constantly striving towards it. Unlike his brethren in the profession he
had a clear view of his own limitations. He was not satisfied with an almost
perfect work which might have satisfied a lesser artist. He wanted absolute
perfection. This cannot be achieved so quickly, and when he found that a
particular work was not up to his standard, he destroyed it unrelentingly and
launched on a new venture. Repeated failures did not damp his <span
class=SpellE>ardour</span>, which grew steadily with years. <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span>
<span class=SpellE>Babu’s</span> intended masterpiece which was so long in
coming had become a byword among his friends for something too high for this
earth and hence unattainable.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
wonder therefore that my curiosity was roused at the information that <span
class=SpellE>Kailas</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span> had become a
school-teacher. “What a fall!” I was tempted to exclaim. I wanted to go to the
bottom of the matter and learn what caused the change. I accompanied <st1:place

thatched building which housed the school in the <span class=SpellE>Harijan</span>
colony was small but clean. One part of it was set apart as the residence of
the teacher. It took me some time to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> that the
man who received us at the entrance was none other than <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span>
<span class=SpellE>Babu</span>. Had it not been for that bright sparkle in the
eyes, I could never have associated this prematurely aged man, with wrinkles on
his forehead, dark rings round his eyes and an air of exhaustion about him,
with the <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span> I have
known, the jovial artist who would talk for hours on the greatness of art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were ushered into a small room. It was not exactly a room but a small space
partitioned off by mud walls, with a small </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>window letting in only
a little light, so that there was in it the dimness of the darkening twilight

before we had adjusted ourselves to the semi-darkness of the room, our
attention was arrested by a full-size painting hung on the wall in a
conspicuous place. We moved near to examine it. Though not an artist myself,
years of acquaintance with artists had made me a connoisseur of art. It was too
dark to see the details of the painting. But even at first view<i> </i>it<i> </i>struck
me that here was work of which any artist could be justly proud. The picture
depicted a sick-bed scene. It showed a woman. She was not even a woman, but a
mere slip of a girl of about twenty, with a delicate, flower-like beauty which
showed in her wasted features, lying on a bed about which were scattered
medicine bottles and other paraphernalia of a sick-bed. I could not but admire
the skill of <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>
who had produced the suggestion of hopelessness and frustration with a few
strokes of the brush. This was the masterpiece of <span class=SpellE>Kailas</span>
<span class=SpellE>Babu</span> and nobody could excel it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

girl you see in the picture is Kamala, my wife. You could not have known her,
for she came to the city while both of you were away. She came into my life
quite unexpectedly and caused as much excitement as a new planet swimming into
the view of an astronomer. She was an orphan and came to the city to earn her
living as an artist’s model. You can yourself see she was eminently fit to be a
model. Her delicately sensitive eyes could command the subtle nuances of a
whole gamut of emotions. I was quick to perceive her possibilities and engaged
her. My hopes were more than justified, for she did not remain a mere model but
provided inspiration for me. Love of art was a link between us and identity of <span
class=GramE>interests</span> engendered love which culminated in marriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my married happiness was fated to be short-lived. <span class=SpellE>Kamala’s</span>
early struggles in poverty had their inevitable sequel, and, a few months after
the marriage, she was attacked with T. B. I was stupefied by this unexpected
stroke of fate, and made arrangements for her treatment according to my ability
and resources. But the disease was in an advanced stage, and she was gradually
wasting away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was at this time that I had a brain wave. I feel that the devil had prompted
me, for no human being would have entertained such an inhuman thought. You know
I have been intending for </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>years to create a masterpiece. I worked
strenuously, but the results were not completely satisfying. Undeterred, I

perfection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there’s something in the very nature of an artist’s work which stultifies its
perfection. The system of <span class=SpellE>modelling</span> is responsible, I
feel, for this failure. However perfect a model you have, you cannot get a
perfect picture with it. The person acting as model cannot but be
self-conscious and this self-consciousness defeats the sincerity and
spontaneity that should <span class=SpellE>characterise</span> a living work.
This difficulty can be overcome if you have nature for your model. But I was
not interested in mere nature, except as a background for humanity. I wanted to
exploit the vast possibilities of the human face and figure and the pathos of
human life. I was therefore in search of a human model <span class=GramE>who</span>
could remain natural without the least tinge of self-consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wretch that I am, I began to look upon <span class=SpellE>Kamala’s</span>

for my masterpiece in which I could bring out the terrible futility of the
struggling human soul. I set up my easel in the next room and began working.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

work on my picture progressed steadily in proportion as <span class=SpellE>Kamala’s</span>
condition deteriorated. But my absorption with it grew so great that I came to
look upon her, not as a human being who had come to share her life with me, but
as a mere model for my masterpiece. I engaged a nurse to look after her and
spent most of my time with the picture. I visited her only once or twice a day,
and that too to catch the atmosphere of the room or some detail about Kamala.
The fact that she was sinking fast did not escape me, but that realisation, far
from exciting my sympathy, only made me do my work in frantic haste lest she
should die before my picture was completed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

enough to believe that she would not know what I was doing, and what she did
not know would not hurt her. But her eyes were too keen not to observe my long
absences from her bed-side, and rare and short visits to her. I learnt after
her death from the nurse that Kamala guessed the nature of the work I was
engaged in, but she pretended not to know, out of consideration for my
feelings, as if I had any feelings left in me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me but she had signed to her not to do so. Her extremely sensitive nature was
wounded on finding herself neglected even in her last moments by the only
person whom she loved above everything else in the world. She had curled her
lips in contempt at the thought of my heartlessness, and the last words she
uttered were, “Oh, that picture!”…… <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that his fellow-beings are human and tends to treat them as so much material

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Aurobindo is unique because he represents in himself the long-awaited fruit of
the evolution of spirituality on earth. In the cosmic scheme of things, it has
been given to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to cherish and nourish spiritual things in its bosom and give expression to
them. If we trace the history of spirituality in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> from early times, we find the
Vedic Seer soaring to spiritual heights with his feet firmly fixed on the
ground. As time went on, the pristine streams of inspiration, intuition and
mystic communion of the Vedic times got lost in the arid sands of sacrificial
rituals and external ceremonies. Buddha had to appear and reveal the hollowness
of the outward forms. In the process he had to preach about the hollowness of
life and extol a state of negation, void, <span class=SpellE>nihil</span> as
the ultimate aim to be achieved. The whole country was caught in the spell of
this message and it was an uphill task for Acharya <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span>
later on to uplift the whole nation from the lethargy of inaction and <span
class=GramE>bring</span> it back to the robust optimism of the Vedic times. He
was not able to succeed in this to the full extent. The message of the Buddha
had cast such a spell on<i> </i>the Indian mind that he could only modify it.
While affirming that God is Truth, he had to concede that the world is false, <i>Brahma
<span class=SpellE>Satyam</span> <span class=SpellE>Jagan</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mithyaa</span>. </i>And the Veda was understood only as a handbook
of rituals and was subjected <span class=GramE>to</span> much criticism.
Therefore, to propagate his message Acharya <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span>
had to leave the Veda out and take to Upanishads as the end-product of the
Veda, <i>Vedaanta. </i><span class=GramE>Thus, his commentaries on the
Upanishads, Brahma Sutra and the <span class=SpellE>Bhagavat</span> Gita <span
class=SpellE><i>Prasthaana</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Traya</span>, </i>set
the pattern for the later <span class=SpellE>Acharyas</span>.</span> From his
time onwards, the belief became rooted in the mind of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
nation that to gain God the world had to be rejected and it was impossible to
gain supremacy over matter and spirit at the same time. His concept of <span
class=SpellE><i>Adwaita</i></span><i>, </i>monism, was later qualified by Sri <span
class=SpellE>Ramanuja</span> and much later Sri <span class=SpellE>Madhwa</span>
with a pragmatic approach preached <span class=SpellE>Dwaita</span>, duality.
Thus Indian spirituality was evolving slowly till in recent times it took a new
turn and found new expression in the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The essential
spirituality underlying all the religions of the world is one and the same and
this was demonstrated in the Spiritual <span class=SpellE>Sadhana</span> of Sri
Ramakrishna illustrating in himself the harmony of all religions. And it was
left to Swami Vivekananda to pave the way for the West to receive the immortal
message of the Spirit from the East. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the stage was set for Sri Aurobindo to make his unique contribution, the
consummation of the evolution of spirituality on earth. The <span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span>
ideal stressed on the supremacy of the <span class=SpellE>Purusha</span>
subordinating the action of Nature, <span class=SpellE><i>Prakriti</i></span>,
to his will. The <span class=SpellE>Tantric</span> discipline saw the world as
Power, as Reality, as the symbol of the <span class=SpellE>paramountcy</span>
of <span class=SpellE>Prakriti</span> and made the <span class=SpellE>Purusha</span>
inert, inactive. Both the <span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span> ideal and the <span
class=SpellE>Tantric</span> discipline are necessary for an integral
realisation. One need not give up Matter in order to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the Spirit, neither one has to wean himself away from the Spirit in order to
have a grip over Matter. Spirituality has been long associated with the East,
while materialism has been the ruling principle in the West. The East has to
get a grip on Matter while the West should learn to win the Spirit. This has
been the long <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> of the earth. The world is
not to be <span class=GramE>rejected,</span> it has to be transformed by the
Power of Spirit. The lifes solution is in death but in a higher evolved life
where principles higher than those of the mind will govern. Sri Aurobindo
declared the object of his Yoga in these terms: Perfection has to be worked
out, has to be accomplished. Imperfection, limitation, death, grief, ignorance,
matter are only the first terms of the formulary; they are the initial discords
of the musicians tuning. Out of imperfection, we have to construct perfection,
out of limitation, to discover infinity, out of death, to find immortality, out
of grief, to recover divine bliss, out of ignorance, to rescue divine
self-knowledge, out of matter, to reveal spirit. To work out this for ourselves
and for humanity is the object of our Yogic practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Veda declares that man is the offspring of Heaven and Earth. Heaven is his
father, Earth is his mother. He cannot </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>disown his parentage
from either of them. He is the product of both matter and spirit. Sri Aurobindo
therefore looks to the Veda, the fount of Indian spirituality for the
propagation of his thought. In this respect he makes a departure from the other
<span class=SpellE>Acharyas</span>. He has not commented on the Brahma Sutra as
it is only the amplification of the <span class=SpellE>Upanishadic</span>
thought reconciling the various view-points. His <span class=SpellE><i>Prasthana</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Traya</span> </i>is the Veda, the Upanishads and the Gita.
His writings on the Secret of the Veda, his commentaries on <span class=SpellE>Isha</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Kena</span> and his luminous notes on other Upanishads
and his essays on the Gita are standing monuments to his intuitive scholarship
in the authentic exposition of the ancient <span class=SpellE>Sanatana</span>
Dharma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
Sri Aurobindo is unique in that like other <span class=SpellE>Acharyas</span>,
did not write his commentaries in Sanskrit. If he wanted, he would have easily
written in the language of the Gods. To propagate his message for humanity, he
chose the language of Man, the English language which the majority of the
people in the world understand. The language of materialism was thus made a
sure vehicle for the expression of the subtleties of the Spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

along in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there had been no dearth of great <span class=SpellE>realised</span> souls. But
they did not deign to express themselves or communicate experiences in rational
terms to others. If they wrote at knowing that language was a poor vehicle for
their profound thoughts, they wrote in pithy aphorisms <i>sutras </i>which
could lend themselves <span class=GramE>to</span> many interpretations. Or they
narrated their experiences in easy stories and parables which tended in
over-simplification or <span class=SpellE>generalisation</span> of their
profound findings. Again, Sri Aurobindo is unique in that he has written in
great detail, in unambiguous terms quite logically and rationally about all the
ramifications and intricacies of the realms of the Spirit which normally baffle
descripti</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Hitherto,
the Yoga had been for the liberation of the individual with the society was
left behind to its own ignorance. Sri <span class=SpellE>Aurobindos</span>
Yoga is for the whole humanity, for the whole of the earth. Integral is his
vision. All the known sciences and thoughts of the world are embraced in the
science of his integral Yoga; nothing is left out. In fact it is no
exaggeration to say that one understands the thought of Acharya <span
class=SpellE>Sankara</span> or Sri <span class=SpellE>Ramanuja</span>, the
concept of the <span class=SpellE>Tantra</span>, etc., after one has read the
writings of Sri Aurobindo. In his scheme, each has its due place, nothing is
discarded. In no other spiritual path such an ideal is put forth to be
achieved. What is this unique ideal? In the words of Sri Aurobindo himself: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a Truth-consciousness as it is called in the Vedaa <span class=SpellE>Supermind</span>
as I have termed itpossessing knowledge, not having to seek after it and
constantly miss it. In one of the Upanishads, a being of knowledge is stated to
be the next step above the mental being. Into that the soul has to rise and
through it to attain the perfect bliss of spiritual existence. If that could be
achieved as the next evolutionary step of Nature here, then she would be
fulfilled and we could conceive of the perfection of life even here, its attainment
of a full spiritual living even in this bodyor it may be in a perfected body.
We could even speak of a Divine Life on earth; our human dream of
perfectibility would be accomplished and at the same time the aspiration to a
heaven on earth common to several religions and spiritual seers and thinkers.
The ascent of the human soul to the supreme Spirit is that souls highest aim
and necessity, for that is the supreme reality; but there can be too the
descent of the Spirit and its powers into the world and that would justify the
existence of the material world also, give a meaning, a divine purpose to the
creation and solve its riddle. East and West could be reconciled in the pursuit
of the highest and largest ideal, Spirit <span class=GramE>embrace</span>
Matter and Matter find its own true reality and the hidden Reality in all
things in the Spirit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

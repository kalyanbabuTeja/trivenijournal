Bertrand Russell - Vol. I </span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
his latter-day excursions into the explosive region of world conflicts, in
which his maturity of political wisdom is not always seen at its best, Bertrand
Russell remains a sort of intellectual Methuselah of the modern world. His
pronouncements, on any and every subject under the sun, are sure to compel
attention, even where they do not convince people and win their agreement.
Those who might occasionally feel like writing him off for one of<i> </i>the
vestigial remains of a more spacious age, cannot ignore his versatile genius
and wide-ranging scholarship. He is regarded not only as one of the most
significant seminal thinkers of this century, but as one of the best
prose-writers of the English language for several generations. In life, as in
thought, he has never ceased to be a figure of controversy. He might not always
have been on the side of the angels, but his good intentions, at any rate his
intellectual <i>bona fides, </i>have never been seriously questioned. It is
possible that he was many times in the wrong but rarely, if ever, on the side
of wrong. That his autobiography, of which the first part has recently seen the
light of the day, should be eagerly awaited as an epoch-making document by his
admirers and other readers alike the world over, is but natural. Nor would it
be a surprise if it were to prove a best seller, for the year, in the branch of
serious non-fiction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I

we had read these lines in the columns of a daily newspaper, instead of in the
pages of a hard-cover book, we might well have mistaken them for an extract
from the political rhetoric of Dr. Soekarno or the lugubrious histrionics of
the late Dr. Mossadeq. The testament of beauty and faith is delightfully vague
and impressively lofty, as it is. One could only hope that there was no
overstatement of any kind in this. That the main body of the book, running to
over a couple of hundred pages, is not written in this emotional strain, is no
small mercy that the reader has to be thankful for. Actually, it represents the
other extreme–factual in approach, meticulous in detail, and even trivial in
its minutiae. Now past 95, the author cannot, in fairness, be expected to
recall his early childhood, with any degree of vividness or accuracy, unless he
had maintained a diary, with retrospective </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

impressions of these formative years. He mentions quite a few incidents, of no

a large slice of icecream, and suchlike. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The ‘longing for love’ leads the youthful Russell to
many odd, and not so odd, situations beginning with the overtures to the
maid-servant whom he wanted to kiss, and culminating in the more passionate
love-affair with a sister of Logan Pearsall Smith, Alys, five years his senior,
whom he succeeds in winning as his first wife. But after a few years, the
realisation dawns on him, all on a sudden, while seated on a bicycle in a
country ride, that he no longer loved her, though she had remained faithful to
him all through. The unforgettable encounter with the still young and beautiful
Lady Otteline Morrell, with whom he spends two or three ecstatic nights, seems
to have brought him close to the highest fulfilment. But when he found that she
was in no mood for a family break-up and that her interest in him was much less
than his in her, he began to reconcile himself to the inevitable. He was mainly
instrumental too in shattering the heart of a bright young American girl of
literary ambitions and driving her to madness and then to a premature death. He
makes the confession that he would have married her, but for his campaign for
pacifism on the eve of the First World War, which he did not want disturbed by
a private scandal! A remarkable feature of all these experiences is that none
of them were allowed to affect his concentration on the intellectual wo<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>rk with which his name is ever to be
associated. The saving grace is, of course, the refreshing candour with which
he recounts them, </span>even when they do not show his character in the best
of lights. </p>

life at Cambridge, as a student or as a Fellow, as depicted by the author,
stands out as the best part of the whole account in this volume. It was at
Cambridge that his resourceful intellect received the sort of stimulus that it
most needed for its development. And it really never stopped growing hence.
Prof. Whitehead, his teacher, and McTaggart his college contemporary, and other
great minds of his generation left an abiding impress on him. The groundwork
for his <i>Principles of Mathematics, </i>as also the later <i>Principia
Mathematica, </i>was done during this period and the foundations were laid for
the basic structure of his philosophic thought. Not that the scholar’s life was
all work and no play. He obviously enjoyed the company of some of his brilliant
friends, as he recalls many anecdotes in his typical tongue-in-the-cheek
manner. Some of these profiles (not quite adding up to ‘portraits’) from memory
are delightful in themselves–the three brothers Trevelyan, of whom the second
seemed to love books more than anything else in life, prefacing every poetry
reading with the remark that the present selection was not from the author’s
best. The youngest, George (who was to attain fame as a historian), was
addicted to the habit of walking miles, about forty a day, which he would not
give up even on his wedding day, to the discomfiture of his bride! Logan
Pearsall Smith (who was at Ballioi) was the founder of the Society of Prigs <i>(sic.</i>),

junior, he has only the highest praise: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

intellect was the sharpest and the clearest that I have ever known. When I
argued with him, I felt I took my life in my hands, and seldom emerged without
feeling something of a fool. I was sometimes inclined to feel that so much
cleverness must be incompatible with depth, but I do not think this feeling was
justified.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The surprise at the end of the book (which is
eminently readable, by and large) is not that he fails to write as brilliantly
as he might be expected to by the admiring reader, but that he writes at all
and clearly enough at his age! The overall impression of the subject, however,
is anything but pleasant. He is peevish, more often than not, and thinks low of
American professors who try to be extra-polite to him (by telling him the way
home in a town, to which he was new). His famous ‘dry wit’ is a little too dry
and brittle and the ‘cad’ under the skin plays hide and seek with the genius.
All the same, anything written by Russell can hardly fail to be of absorbing
interest. One could only hope that the next volume of his autobiography will be
more satisfying than the first and that the well-known publishers will be a
little more careful about their proof-reading. </p>

constituents.” What the Telugu grammarians regarded as <i>aluk </i>Compounds
are not really such and there is no possibility for such Compounds in Telugu. <i>Avyayibhava

grammarians have erred in adopting that nomenclature from Samskrit. <i>Bahuvrihi

imaginary and based on<i> </i>the Samskrit grammar. <i>Samasanta Pratyaya </i>in
Telugu is deliberately brought into Telugu to make <i>Bahuvrihi </i>construction
possible therein. Some of the Compounds named by Telugu grammarians as <i>avyayibhava

in Telugu many Compounds that remain unclassified. These are a few of the

Anjaneyulu is an uncommitted traveller. He could, therefore, see the countries
visited in their true perspective and give a travel diary as free from bias and
propaganda as it is full of delight and wisdom. As the great ‘Cham of
literature’ rightly observed, a man must carry knowledge with him if he is to
bring home knowledge. Mr. Anjaneyulu’s travel diary of Europe is verily a true
index of his wide reading and vibrant humanism. He saw things as a scholar and
without either lordly sneer or servile adulation and expressed himself in a
prose-style as simple as it is elegant. </p>

the three books under notice are by noted journalists of the south of India,
who had grown grey in the profession. Time was when the south was known as the
pen-arm of India–a well-merited tribute to the writing talent form this part of
the country, which was very much in demand in all the regions, including
Bengal, though to a slightly lesser extent. It was then possible largely
because of the position occupied by the English language in the political and
intellectual life of the nation, even at those times when the English rulers
were not in favour among a freedom-loving people who could hardly ever feel the
language itself to be a hurdle in the struggle to attain the long-cherished
goal. All the three authors have one common feature–that of a commendable
felicity of expression in the English language, in which they had been
functioning for over half-a-century. Their temperaments and outlook on life, as
reflected in their writing, in the manner as well as the matter, are vastly
different from one another. But, there is a lot of common ground covered by two
of these books and the third is not unrelated to them in its basic element. All
these three authors roughly belong to one generation of journalists who
believed in the quality of what they wrote and kept their interests as wide as
they possibly could, without losing sight of their own acknowledged <i>forte. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

and other organisations of working journalists. In these articles are
discussed, at length, many of the problems of practical interest to the
profession, including freedom of the press and training for journalism, the
Press Commission and the Press Council. In the first chapter entitled “History
of Indian journalism”, the author makes a merciless analysis of the second part
of the report of the Press Commission, which was compiled by Mr. J. Natarajan.
While exposing the gaps in the chronicle and pointing out the general deficiencies
of the compilation, he, however, concedes the utility of the volume as raw
material (“notes,” to quote the exact word) for a history, of Indian
journalism, which is yet to be written, in a real sense, in spite of some
work-a-day attempts extant in the field. On the ‘Freedom of the journalist’,
the author is typically down-right in warning against its being confused with
that of the proprietor (who insists on calling the tune as he pays the piper)
or the well-paid editor, who is only too willing to serve as the mouth-piece of
his employer and identify public interest with the former’s </span><span

some ways, the second book is rather a contrast to the first. While Mr. Nair
restricts himself to the newspapers and editors of Madras, he prefaces it with
a general introduction into which had obviously gone a good amount of research
work. He pieces up an impressive array of historical facts into a useful
chronicle for students of journalism. Among the Madras newspapers, he devotes
considerable Space to <i>‘The Mail’, </i>which he had loyally served for over
three decades, recalling his association with its English editors, whom he
succeeded towards the close of his career. In discussing men and events, he is
always cautious, and almost non-committal, unlike Mr. Thiaga Rajan, who has
done a hearty job of it with “Some vanished voices.” Printer’s devils abound in
both the books, which deserve better of the printer as well as the reader. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a certain level, of the overt and the political, Jawaharlal Nehru’s life was
almost an open book to the Indian reader. Or so it seemed, for decades more
than any national leader’s, with the possible exception of Mahatma Gandhi’s.
But even here, there is a point that is apt to be forgotten by the more superficial
observer. While it is true that the Mahatma was thinking aloud all the time
(and he meant it when he said it, which was quite often), the process itself
threatened at times to defy the ordinary methods of logical analysis, as it was
intuitive rather than strictly rational. The ‘inner voice’ was necessarily
shrouded in mystery, and the spiritual basis of any formulation lent it a kind
of sanction that could not be easily challenged, except at the risk of
blasphemy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stood to gain by their self-imposed labours, are the busiest now in wielding

Festival. She might have met them earlier in England, but it was only from now

as a guest in “The Big House” and almost became one of the household. The one
impression that stands upper-most in her sumptuous volume, profusely
illustrated by rare snapshots from the family album, is that of Nehru as a human
being–warmhearted, uninhibited, genuine, friendly and lovable. His friendship
for K. Krishna Menon (perhaps one of the very few who could understand him
fully) is described in good detail and the progress of their relationship
traced in all its ups and downs. The last days of Nehru are vividly captured in
a series of close-ups as on a television Screen. The postscript contains a
brief study of Mrs. Gandhi’s character and the confidence it inspires in
measuring up to her new responsibilities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru’s relation with the <i>National Herald w</i>as among the most fruitful in
the annals of political journalism. He gave much of himself to it, but also
derived not a little by way of moral and intellectual reinforcement from its
editorial columns. On the spelling out of the basic postulates of his foreign
policy, this was particularly true. No wonder, therefore, that the souvenir
(which is really a symposium on Nehru’s contribution to Indian life and
thought) brought out by the <i>Herald </i>is something more than a bunch of
conventional tributes to the memory of a departed leader. In editing this
volume, Mr. Chalapathi Rau has shown his characteristic judgment and
discrimination as also his well-known restraint. The studies are well-thought
out and well-written. Mr. Narla’s assessment of Nehru as a maker as well as a
writer of history is bold and perceptive. He places him higher than Churchill
and Caesar, but with good reasons. Prof. Hiren Mukerji’s political analysis is
sympathetic but sharp and Dr. Mulk Raj Anand’s essay on Nehru, the
Intellectual, is very comprehensive. Messrs Sri Prakasa, P. N. Sapru, Joachim
Alva, Dr. Syed Muhmed, Dr. Gopal Singh and others, who had known the subject at
close quarters, have contributed to this substantial volume, which is indispensable
for any student of Nehru. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

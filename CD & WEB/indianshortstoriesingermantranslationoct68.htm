A. Oerley, the editor of this volume, who has also translated a good number of
these short stories into German, has done a good job of work, on the whole, The
book comprises 34 stories of Indian authors born between 1861 and 1928. Besides
the biographical data of all the 34 authors, we have here a glossary explaining
in German some specific Indian words. All important Indian languages are
represented, but unfortunately many translions are secondhand, from English. Is
it so difficult to obtain direct translations into German? The four Dravidian languages
are not sufficiently represented, the emphasis being laid on Bengali, Hindi,
English and Gujarati authors. It seems, however, that the publisher, Horst
Erdmann, is aware of this defect, for he announced during his visit to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> in 1967 the publication
of a new collection, which will take into account a larger number of authors

selecting process. Only stories which deal with modern <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> were
chosen. We have to commend this intention, for due to the traditional attitude

Buddhadeva Bose’s <i>Wir Drei </i>(We Three), Yashpal’s <i>Der Vorhang </i>(The

experimental story-writing in this anthology. Does it exist in <st1:country-region

the documentary purpose of the selection is better served by a literary

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is, first of all, the great importance which is still given to religion.
Mysticism is still alive. In Saradindu Bannerji’s <i>Das Gottliche Bildnis </i>(The
Divine Image), two men with modern education experience the mysterious power of
a Buddha image in the <st1:place w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place>. This story is
full of romanticism and has rather naive and adventurous elements: the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> of “Tom,
Dick and Harry”, we are tempted to say, where miracles and other supernatural
events are facts of daily life to be reckoned with. But the author of another
story, Prabodh Kumar Sanyal, in <i>Eine Tugendhafte Frau </i>(A Virtuous
Woman)–where a woman, during a pilgrimage in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>, has a mysterious encounter
with the divinity, leaves the interpretation of the mystery to us, the readers.
This seems to me a more sincere approach to religion, by which the subjectivity
of belief is admitted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
most of the cases, religion is seen in its confrontation with modernity. As it
is closely linked with the traditional social order, this confrontation can
easily become a contradiction. Industrialisation, rural exodus and class
struggle enter into the seemingly peaceful life in the small towns and
villages. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">And.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on the horizon a powerful danger to rural peace can be seen: the big city. The
young Adivasi who broke away from the old beliefs and Customs of his village
might be looked upon as a criminal by the villagers and by the<i> </i>author,
Tarasankar Bannerji in<i> Der Steinerne Thron </i>(The Throne of Stone) but
that does not alter the fact that he is the only character in this<i> </i>story
who has to suffer Psychologically from the changes </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>caused
by a modernizing civilisation. If Bannerji seems still to be guided by a
certain admiration of the traditional order, Mulk Raj Anand in <i>Der Traktor
und die Getreidegottin </i>(The Tractor and the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Goddess of
Corn) shows in<i> </i>a knowing and humorous manner how an idealistic zamindar
succeeds in modernising his land and the minds of the peasants working on it.
He chooses the Gandhian way in implementing the revolution: the threatened
outbreak of violent clashes is overcome by means of persuasion. Superstition
disappears. Humour and wisdom, too put an end to superstition in Tagore’s <i>Das
Horoskop </i>(The Horoscope), a story full of the atmosphere of tenderness and
restrained passion. Here all the conflicts, not only that of traditional order
and modern enlightenment, are embraced by<i> </i>the atmosphere of safety,
which is given by the “home” and the family. On the other hand, however, this
organic order, far from suppressing the individual, seems to live, with the
conflicts quivering beneath its surface. In this work of Tagore, the Mahatma’s
way of facing and solving conflicts seems to me exemplified most clearly: there
is a profound belief in the ultimate victory of goodwill, reason, humour and
wisdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But we get acquainted with the
reverse also: the uncompromising delineation of misery, poverty, sickness and
death in the stories of Bhabani Bhattacharya, Bisham Sahni, Yashpal, Arvind
Gokhale, Achintya Kumar Sen Gupta and S. K. Pottekatt. In <i>Frigen </i>(Figs),
by B. Bhattacharya, young boys, who, in normal conditions, should be playmates,
become almost like wild animals due to hunger. Childhood and youth are their
years of hopelessness and distress, yet still, even in that situation without
escape, there is a manifestation of humanity, friendship and self-denial. In
the other stories, however, this last assertion of human values does not
express itself in the form of resistance to misery. Poverty, hunger and
humiliation there are no longer<i> </i>mere proofs, by which the human dignity
is rendered evident or even glorified but quite the opposite: conditions by
which the human dignity is destroyed and gets lost<i>. </i>The downfall of a
high class family in a society without bottom in Yashpal’s <i>Der Vorhang </i>(The
Curtain) reveals existing conditions for the slow pauperization, degradation
and defiguration of man. Chowduri Pirbux, a rather insignificant average man,
who is so proud of his “noble” descent, his white shirt and, above all, a
precious curtain, the symbol of his noble origin, at the end lies in the mud,
in the slums before the feet of a little usurer, his wire and daughters
covering shamefully their nakedness. The permanent and irresistible decline of
this man is full of symbolic power, also because of the laconic and almost
documentary style. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are other delineations of poverty like, for instance, Achintya Kumar Sen
Gupta’s <i>Der Bambustrick </i>(The Bamboo-Trick) or Bisham Sahni’s <i>Der
Preis Eines Huhns </i>(The Price of a Chicken) which are as uncompromising as
Yashpal’s story, but their effect is somehow blunted, because they appeal to
our sense of pity and are not so objective as the dispassionate “report” of
Yashpa1. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a long procession of Indian characters, which passes in front of us. The
strange but deeply human ambitions of an old woman mourner of Gujarat, for
instance, and her tragic breakdown after having been displaced by a younger
rival. Here again, a realistically narrated destiny of an individual becomes
transparent and something like a parable of general human significance. Satire
is represented in the enjoyable story of a rickshaw-man who lets down a fatuous
and conceited civil servant (by Upendra Nath Ashk) or in Humayun Kabir’s <i>Prestige,
</i>where an orthodox and extremely narrow-minded Muslim is given the
“run-around” by his clever young wife. We see a Brahmin widow, full of her
inherited centuries-old <i>hauteur, </i>who nevertheless is overcome by
humanity, when she is confronted with the distress of a dark-skinned child from
the lowest of social classes. We get a glimpse of the words of Tamil and
Malayali farmers, and that of cabmen in <st1:place w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place>,
of westernised Bengali intellectuals. The women characters deserve a special
essay all to themselves. In general and especially in the traditional sectors
of the society they are underprivileged. Is it for that reason that they
attract the sympatby of the authors? Again and again, their courage, their
readiness for self-sacrifice, their absolute devotion, but also sometimes,
their astute shrewdness, is depicted. We see Indians in their families, in
their marriages, in their work, in their passions and despair: we see the
eternal human comedy in all its variety and with all its possibilities in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and when
we close the book, after the last story, we know more about this country than
any learned thesis or analysis could have told us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

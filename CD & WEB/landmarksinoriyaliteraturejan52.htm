style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the second or medieval period which extends down to modern times, the contrast
between what had been produced before and what follows is as between the
daylight and the light from coloured electric bulbs. Gone are the days of
naivete and unpolished vitality, of interest in the charm of Nature and the
problems of man, and the unrestricted enterprises in diction. The nation being
subjugated and ruled by foreigners and subjected to continuous famines and
internecine wars, Saraswati now leaves the cottages of free citizens and courts
the patronage of small feudal chiefs, who, having lost all opportunities of
independent action now took up literature as a pastime like hunting and harem.
Versification tended to be more and more artificial; and the more twisted, the
more incomprehensible and lexicographical the verse greater was the credit for
the poet. There are, of course, exceptions, as always there are in any period,
and it is these exceptions in which the natural human emotions have been given
vent to in simple, direct and alliterative musical lines. Throughout this
period with all major and minor, the natural tendency was however to tack the
toy of poetical art to the wings of music. That has been the saving grace of
this period and has indeed helped the survival of pieces in the memory of the
race which should have long been buried deep in oblivion for the very weight of
their pedantries and artificialities. As matters stand at present, we may meet
anywhere in Orissa people singing songs or reciting poems, in the singsong way,
of which they know not the meaning or care to know. The reciters and singers
willingly themselves in the tide of rhythmical sounds under which sense gets

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
poet who dominates this period and in whom all the vices and virtues of the age
are typified is Upendra Bhanja, who, having been depriv</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ed
of the throne of his little principality in Ganjam District through family
feuds, spent the life of an exile in a neighbouring State, and like Tagore, not
having any serious preoccupations, produced like the latter an enormous amount
of poetry. Schooled by court pedants, Upendra seems to have been impressed in
youth with the verbal jugglery in decadent Sanskrit poetry which it became his
life-long passion to recreate in Oriya. He has left behind a small amount of
lyrics and poems in the natural language of poetry expressing the instinctive
reactions in the human heart to the charms of Nature and the fair sex, which
suggests what the poet was actually capable of. But that sort of achievement
must have been thought puerile by the dry-as-dusts of the royal courts, and
unbecoming of his erudition and aristocratic birth, and so his major efforts
were devoted to the successive creation of Kavyas, each more difficult to
understand than the previous one, because of the artificialities of
versification and diction. He composed the entire Ramayana, using a new metre
for each canto, and all through this wonderful epic not only do the first lines
begin with the letter ‘Ba’ but the number of stanzas in each canto is a figure
that begins with that letter, and the name of the book ‘Baidehisha Bilas’ is an
alliteration of ‘Ba’s, and the epic had also to be completed in twelve months
or ‘Bara-mas’ in keeping with the verbal symmetry. He wrote descriptions of
seasons in verses of which if you take away the first letter it may describe
the summer, and if you take away the second it will mean the rains, and so on.
All things considered, Upendra reached the very acme of craftsmanship in word
jugglery. He may have no parallel in this respect in any other literature. He
used all the metres, simple and complex, that were then prevalent in the
language with consummate skill and invented some. None also can excel him in
creating that dreamland of youthful romance describing the voluptuous sex-love.
The extraordinary power of painting erotic sex-love being combined with an
extraordinary power of verbal jugglery in him, Upendra has exercised a spell
over the masses and classes in Orissa which is not warranted by his
achievements in genuine poetry. His followers and imitators in the language are
not only numerous, but their line continues even today.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when we keep Upendra and his bizzare standards of artificialities out of the
picture, we come across the fountains of true poetry in a large number of
places in this period also. Great among the numerous poets of the period are
Abhimanyu Samanta Sinhar, Dinakrushna Das, and Kavisurya Baladeva, who, in
spite of attempts at tentacled diction, lexicographic cleverness and
conventional techniques, have left behind a store of poetry thrilling with
tasteful alliteration and beautiful music which still keep the masses in Orissa
enthralled. The craze Sanskritisation of Oriya had gone so far in this period
that Kavisurya Baladeva wrote his famous ‘Kishore Chandrananda Champu’ half in
Sanskrit, half in Oriya. All the same, this ‘Champu’ is a super-excellent
musical drama in our literature. Its theme is the tryst of Radha and Krishna,
and the drama is gradually developed through successive songs beginning with
the letter ‘Ka’ and ending in the letter ‘Kshya’. The first letter in all the
lines of each song is the same with which the song begins. In spite of these
restrictions, Baladeva created unique songs in our literature, whose tunes are
held now as standards of Orissan music by Ostads. Coupled with musical
excellence is the clever and bold characterisation of Radha, the heroine, and
Lalita, the go-between, far more masterly and realistic than what we meet in
Jayadeva’s ‘Gita<i> </i>Govinda’ dealing with the same subject.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Unique
not only in this period, but in all our literature, and fit to be counted among
the very few that exist in all Indian literatures in the same category, and
standing all by himself, is Brajanath Badajena, the poet of ‘Samara Taranga’ or
‘Waves of War’. The poet belonged to Dhenkanal State and perhaps participated
in action against Mahratta invasions of his native State. The Mahrattas were
repulsed and the poet took up this contemporary topical subject for writing a
stirring war-poem. He has given minute descriptions of militaristic details;
there is an address to the cowardly and the hesitant in the vigorous and uncouth
phraseology of a soldier. The cantos are written in various heroic metres, and
where Oriya has proved inadequate, the poet has freely used Hindustani and
Marathi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Towards
the end of the 18th century we find, however, a healthy reaction against the
artificialities of this age. Sick of the unnecessary trappings the Muse was
trying to appear again in simpler and more natural habiliments. The harbingers
and symbols of this reaction were two poets of very great stature–one epic and
the other lyrical. Both were poet-saints, their memories and memorials being as
much worshipped as loved. With both of them their poetic theme was the story
the gospel of Krishna. While in Bhaktacharan’s ‘Mathura Mangal’, the beautiful
epic episode, we taste the quintessence of the Jnana and Bhakti-Yoga in
delicate and direct poetry, in Gopal Krishna’s innumerable little lyrical gems
we get the depths of pure, etherealised and yet sensuous love as between man
and God, and man and woman. As a writer of Vaishnavite songs and lyrics, Gopal
Krishna belongs to the same class as Vidyapati andChandidas. He is the single
great blessing of the Chaitanya cult in Orissa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the time Gopal Krishna passed away, English education had already spread in the
country, although he himself lived and died quite unaffected by anything
western. Quite unknown to this last great medieval poet, however, the dawn of
the modern period had set in and new notes were already heard from newly
arrived birds. It is a pity that the old and the new never met.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
progress of the various Indian languages in the British period is almost alike.
There is no gainsaying that the contact with the extraordinarily free arid
variedly rich English literature gave a veritable new birth to the Indian
languages. Poetry found new genres for expression, prose was practically born,
dramas and novels depicting life as it is were written, magazines and
periodicals appeared as vehicles of current thought. This new literature has,
however, to depend on a book-buying public or aristocratic patrons. Formerly
book production cost almost nothing except the poet’s or a scribe’s labour. But
now it meant capital investment for the producer and for the consumer, who in
olden days got it almost free through recitals at the temples and village
assemblies and ‘jatras’ and musical performances at rich men’s courtyards. All
this disappeared, with the advent of the printing press, into the holy
precincts of the Goddess Saraswati. Literature has become costly, has been
commercialised with the background of a rich, leisured middle-class as its
mainstay. Such a background existed in Bengal in its perfection. And that
explains to a very large degree the phenomenal growth of Bengali literature in
the British period and, to a lesser extent, of that of those regional languages
which centred round other big modern cities like Madras and Bombay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
this splendid renaissance, which inundated India’s linguistic fields with the
flood-waters of western thought, and the new prosperity of the British rule
with its mechanical civilisation, came to Orissa only in small channels dug
with the despairing labours of a few devoted worshippers of Saraswati. All
through the British rule the land remained dismembered between different
Provinces. There were attempts by our more powerful neighbours to wipe off the
map the moribund Oriya and to establish the conquest of their own languages in
its place. Orissa’s middle-class had almost been wiped out by this time through
the new tenancy laws introduced by the British, and through the exploitation of
intermediary officers from other Provinces who came in as camp followers of the
British army. The spark of freedom and battle against tyranny that was still
alive in the peasant militia of the land had its last glorious flicker in the
Paik Rebellion of 1818, after which the wings of the martial Oriya race were
ruthlessly clipped, and the entire race was disarmed, demilitarised and
dehumanised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when the darkness appeared to be the thickest, the morning stars appeared on
the horizon. Radhanath, Fakirmohan, and Madhusudan have not only saved the
Oriya language from extermination, but have left it healthier and more
beautiful in new garments. It was the new literature produced by these three
men of genius, with a small army of imitators, that kept alive among the Oriya
intelligentia in all the scattered slices of Oriya-speaking tracts, the impulse
to be united under one Government, while in the cottages of the toiling masses
from Calcutta to Vizagapatam and from Puri to Bastar the old lamps still
burned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
the three mentioned above, Fakirmohan Senapati, the great novelist, was the
born leader of the team, true to his name ‘Senapati’. He may be taken as one of
the most outstanding literary figures of modern India. Born poor, and sickly
throughout life, he could not have more than primary education, but against
this humble background his achievements are nothing short of amazing. In his
worldly life<i> </i>he rose from a schoolmaster to be the Dewan of big States
and was on friendly terms with learned British civilians like Mr. John Beams,
the great grammarian, and Mr. Ravenshaw, the then Commissioner of the Orissa
Division, owing to his upright conduct and erudition in Oriya, Bengali, Hindi
and Sanskrit. In the literary world his success is still more astonishing.
Single handed he translated the epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, wrote books on
history and mathematics, wrote satires and innumerable poems and lyrics, wrote
the first and some of the best short stories in Oriya, wrote major novels which
are still unsurpassed in the language and, are sure to rank among the topmost
of the kind in any language in India, and wrote also an epic on Lord Buddha. It
was a great blessing in disguise that this genius was not coloured by western
education. He came out of the masses and, in spite of profound scholarship in
many languages, continued to think and write in terms of the masses. In fact he
may be taken as India’s first great proletariat author. In his novels he used
only the language spoken by the toiling millions in the urban and rural areas
of Orissa. Had he not used that idiom, and with such marvellous consummation it
would still have remained contemptible and unfit to be used as a literary
vehicle. But now it is the noble ambition of all fiction-artists in Orissa to
emulate Fakirmohan, at least to make the style as approximate to that of
Fakirmohan as possible. But in the mastery of colloquial idiom, the expression
that always breathes the perfume of the soil, the village, the paddy fields and
the peasant’s hut, Fakirmohan is still our marvel and despair. We do not find
his like even in Bengali. The affinity can be perceived only in that other
marvel of language – ‘Ramakrishna Kathamrita’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
his style and phraseology, Fakirmohan’s characters also came direct from life,
from the soil of urban and rural Orissa. Till now these uncouth, unlettered
folk in filthy habiliments were beyond the pale of literature. But Fakirmohan
just took these ragamuffins and created undying characters out of them. Taking
1921 as the starting line of Indian revolution, we may say that Orissa of the
fifty years preceding that date lives for ever in Fakirmohan’s pages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Radhanath,
the second of the Trio, brought poetry from the mythological world of Ramayana,
Mahabharata and Bhagavata to the tangible but as yet untouched world of Orissan
history. He wrote metrical romances in the style of Scott and Byron. His
characters are semi-historical, with an atmosphere of magic chance and divine
agency. The only sure element in his poetry is the background against which he
placed his heroes and heroines,–the beauteous natural scenery of Orissa. As
Ancient India’s topography has been immortalised in the lines of Kalidasa, so
has Orissa’s been in those of Radhanath. For the first time in our literature,
Radhanath revealed to us the beauties of our lakes, rivers, forests and
mountains. The finest achievement of high-priest of Nature is his invocative
poem on the Chilka lake, which, just for Radhanath’s enchanting poetry, has
become a favourite object of visit from all parts of Orissa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Radhanath,
besides introducing this local colour in our literature, introduced also a
revolutionary change in diction. He freed the Muse of all artificialities of
the medieval times and wrote again in simple yet sonorous, alliterative yet
precise words. Radhanath wielded and still wields a profound spell over his
readers, mainly through the charms of diction. One may read his poetry over and
over again without the least satiation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third member of this famous Trio was Madhusudan Rao, a profoundly religious
man, a zealous Brahmo, a thorough puritan and a great educationist. He was
Radhanath’s student, and later his greatest friend. In him we perceive the
reappearance of that mystic stream in Orissa which has been perpetually flowing
as an undercurrent in society, and has always been manifested in the language
alongside of, or incorporated with, the secular literature. This profound
undercurrent can easily be traced from the Buddhist lyrics of Bauddha Gan O
Dohan’ of the 8th century to its outburst in the writings of Jagannath Das and
his associates in the 16th. It is manifest again in the Buddhistic Bhajans of
the blind Kandh poet Bhima Bhoi in the 18th century. It appeared again in the
modern Brahmo garb in the hymns and lyrics of Madhusudan. Whatever has
Madhusudan written breathes purity and noble ideals. He has written immensely
but there is not a speck of vulgarity anywhere. He perceived God everywhere in
man and in Nature, even in outcastes and prostitutes, and poured out his divine
hunger in exquisite hymns and lyrics which would be precious treasures in any
language. His hymns are sung and recited in every school in Orissa. His poems
like ‘Morning Glory in the Himalayas’ or ‘The Divine Descent in the Soul of a
Saint’, are matchless in the dignity of diction, the ethereal atmosphere, and
in the rapture of the human soul in the realisation of God through the marvels
of Nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

three heroes had each a host of followers and imitators, at least two of whom
were endowed with true poetic genius. Of these two Gangadhar Meher, the
weaver-poet of Sambalpur, has become deservedly popular in the country, perhaps
more popular than his masters. He combines in his style the elegance and
precision of Sanskrit with the musical metres of the medieval Oriya poetry, and
beats his masters and contemporaries in clarity of vision and subtlety of
expression. He was in the true line of Orissa’s poets and artists, plying the
paternal loom with one hand for his livelihood and the pen with the other to
give expression to his divine urge. But poor weaver that he was, he produced
poetry which is as exquisite as the famous textiles of Sambalpur, and the
nation is to be congratulated for hanging Portraits of this weaver in company
of the greatest dead in the land.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

other poet, Sri Nanda Kishore Bal, struck altogether a new and original note in
the language. Discarding heroes and princes and the world of mythology and
history, he took the humble village for his theme. For the first time in our
literature the village institutions, like the village school, the village
barber, the village cemetery, the village temple, the village market and also
the village minstrel acquired deathlessness through poetic art. For the first
time also, Nanda Kishore utilised the folk songs of Orissa as the basis of
modernised lyrics and wrote the first children’s verses in our language. His
‘Pallichitra’ or ‘the picture of the village’ will remain for ever exquisite
for its unique artistry as well as for the nostalgic attractions for the old
village that is fast dying out in the country. A future Goldsmith of Orissa may
have plenty of materials to write ‘The Deserted Village’ as a contrast to Nanda
Kishore’s ‘Pallichitra’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the man who, after this Trio, has wielded the greatest literary influence in
the country, and that too unwittingly, is Pandit Gopabandhu Das of hallowed
memory, the greatest humanitarian, the greatest orator, the greatest
politico-social leader and educationist that Orissa has produced in modern
times. Pandit Gopabandhu had a heart of butter which melted at the very sight
of human misery. In verse, prose and oratory, he swayed the masses and classes
of Orissa as never before or since. I have myself seen vast crowds weep like
children at the magic touch of his oratory. He started his career as a poet,
but, due to his preoccupations in humanitarian and political activities, it was
not possible for him to stick to literature. But on occasions when he had some
leisure, as when he was in jail, or when he was over-powered by emotion, he
sought relief by pouring out his heart in poetry which, bereft of all poetic
embellishments, throbs with the tears of a golden soul and touches the readers’
hearts like the words from a lover to a lover. For the political and social
uplift of the masses in Orissa. Gopabandhu edited a monthly magazine and a
weekly through whose columns flowed his sonorous, rhythmic, easy-flowing prose
which, with an inimitable blend of the classical elegance and colloquial
expressiveness, was a new revelation of the possibilities of prose in Oriya and
a thing to enjoy, while being educated. Gopabandhu’s weekly ‘Samaj’ is now the
widest read daily paper in Orissa and wields an enormous influence in the
country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this time we come upon the border line of our national revolution led by
Mahatma Gandhi. Gopabandhu was not a mere political leader; he was the greatest
national institution in Orissa. In him the entire race in all its national
aspects found adequate expression. At Satyabadi, near Puri, Gopabandhu
established his own Vihar in beautiful sylvan surroundings. There he gathered
round him some of the finest intellectuals in the country, who, with the
highest university degrees against their names, were prepared to serve as
schoolmasters on a mere living wage. This was possible because of Gopabandhu’s
genius and personality. Inspired by Gopabandhu, almost all the intellectuals
like Pandit Nilakantha Das, Pandit Godavaris Misra, Pandit Lingaraja Misra, and
Pandit Krupasindhu Misra who gathered at Satyabadi, devoted themselves to
literature as a means of raising the masses. They produced histories, dramas,
ballads, lyrics and epics ringing with patriotic fervour and high idealism. But
alas, this cultural University of Orissa was only short-lived. This was swamped
by the tidal waves of the Mahatma’s Non-co-operation movement. Gopabandhu and
his band of poets and scholars now had to prepare themselves for the spinning
wheel and the British jail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Gopabandhu group out of the picture, there is a sudden break in the
continuity of tradition. Now a group of college students, imbued with the ideas
and styles of Rabindranath who then dominated the Indian literary firmament,
ushered in a new kind of poetry in Oriya literature. The leader of this group
was Annadasankar Ray, who, as a civilian, lives now in Bengal and has earned
great fame there as a litterateur. Of this group, the poems of Annadasankar and
Baikunthanath Patnaik, and some stories and one novel of Sri Kalindi Charan
Panigrahi, have been accepted by critics as valuable additions to the
store-house of the language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

following this group came the Socialists led by Sachi Routray. Now that the
whole world has become one family, literature is tending more and more to be
international. Easy access to world literatures, through the medium of English,
makes the newest literary experiments in other parts of the world quickly
reflected in the least known languages of the globe. So, the so-called
socialistic poetry is written in imitation of ultra-modern English poets in
free verse in Oriya also, although the conditions in the land do not fully
warrant these outbursts. Like most of the modern English verse, some of this is
difficult of comprehension by even intellectuals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is rash also to pass judgments on living poets and current literature. Time
is the best judge of the arts. In English literature, likes and dislikes of
readers and critics change like the English weather. It is better, therefore,
that I draw the curtain. In a short sketch like this of a literature that is
seven hundred years old, it is not possible to do justice to all. I have,
therefore, only confined myself to the undercurrents in my literature from the
beginning to the present day; the mutual reactions of people and literature,
each to the other; the broad circumstances in, and the background against

in Europe, from the very beginning, translation from one language to another
has become the universal practice, here in India, living in closest proximity,
linguistic units remain in complete darkness about one another. Oriyas and
Telugus have lived from time immemorial side by side, but how many Oriyas have
heard even the names of the major poets in Telugu, let alone their achievements?
It is now high time for every Indian University to make arrangements for the
study of at least two important Indian languages other than that of the State
where it exists, and encourage and conduct continuous translations of the best
in all other Indian literatures as well as from the literatures of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

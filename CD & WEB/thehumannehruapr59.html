ago the Allahabad Law Journal Company published an enchanting book, &amp;titled
“The Human Nehru”. The author, Shri Tandon, is a well known journalist of Uttar
Pradesh. It is an illustrated book, with many intimate and revealing pictures
of our Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru. It contains several unfamiliar
photographs of Shri Nehru which give point and meaning to some of the less
known incidents in Shri Nehru’s life. The bulk of the incidents relate only to
Shri Nehru’s personal life, and bring into prominence fine facets of his
graceful character in a manner to make any Indian rejoice that the destinies of
his nation are linked with one so clean and so simple, so generous and so
straightforward; so full of the wisdom and the goodness of life.</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
emerges from a reading of this book with a feeling that one has not seen enough
of Shri Nehru or read enough about him. That is a compliment which one
unconsciously pays not only to the subject but also to the author of the book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
author does appear to have had fairly intimate contact with Shri Nehru The
intimacy seems to have been of a kind that leads to a close observance of the
significant traits of conduct and habits of thought of his subject. The greater
part of the narration is gathered from other sources. That is as it should be.
Even so, it seems to me, not all the best available sources were touched or
thought of. Perhaps I am wrong, but the book gives the impression that the
author was content with a few sources near at hand. Lots of important people in
India, and unimportant too, with a sense of the piquant and the beautiful, must
have many distinctly interesting memories of Shri Nehru stored in their minds
and in their hearts; flashes of varying incident; thought and feeling, which
throw the eager and colourful personality of Shri Nehru into vivid relief. A
reader of this book should be pardoned if he wished that all such people and
all such memories had been sought and used to compile a more carefully chosen,
even if not a more complete, book of vignettes of Shri Nehru’s life. But this,
in a reader, is, perhaps, being greedy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
the arrangement or the sequence of the episodes in the book looks a little
haphazard. It bears no evidence of a scheme </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in the author’s mind
to present the incidents in any artistic or logical order. The episodes are
jumbled up not<i> </i>only in the matter of chronology, but in the matter of
the moods and the sentiments evoked. This is understandable in the author
because the author, in his preface, “ventures to think” that “the merit of the
book” is that it can be taken up by the reader and perused with pleasure at any
page.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

should not, however, be understood, even for a moment, to be saying that the
anecdotes, so beautifully described by Shri Tandon, </span><span

not interesting. They are indeed most interesting and most illuminating. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reader, impelled by his or her peculiar taste and temperament, is bound
especially to like some of the anecdotes in this book in preference to the
other anecdotes in it. I have my own preferences. I am coming to one of them
which held me bound. It is an incident narrated in this book without the aid of
photographs to illustrate it. But the text itself conjures up a pictorial
news-reel of every movement of Shri Nehru in the incident. It was 1942. Another
of our leaders in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>
struggle, Rajaji, had his acute differences with the Congress Working
Committee. He was at the moment rather unpopular. Rajaji was always of a kind
to rouse popular emotion by his own seeming lack of it. There was resentment,
specially among a large section of the Hindus, that Rajaji, not less than
Jinnah, was just then trying to sell the idea of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
all across the Asian continent. Rajaji was also not willing to bless the
rebellion that was taking shape for August, 1942. And he was coming to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>
to attend a meeting of the Congress Working Committee. Followers of the Hindu
Maha Sabha, to whom Shri Nehru was a revered friend outside their politics,
were gathering at the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>
railway station, with black flags, ready for Rajaji. Rajaji was to be the guest
of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>,
the guest of Shri Nehru and of all his fellow-citizens. Shri Nehru heard of the
demonstrators waiting in large numbers on the railway platform. He had other
important work to do, but he did not care. He grew wild with anger that any one
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>
should </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dare to offend the guest, Rajaji. He himself did
not agree with Rajaji’s views about the partition of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Nevertheless, Rajaji </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>’s
guest, and Rajaji had a right to hold his own views! There should be no
demonstration against Rajaji in Shri Nehru’s home-town! Shri Nehru jumped into
the car, and rushed up to the leader of the demonstration against Rajaji, and
shouted, “You dare insult my guest in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Allahabad</st1:place></st1:City>.
I will have nothing to do with you in future. <i>You shut up.</i>”<i> </i>There
was a lashing of sticks and fists. There were hot words, and then hot blows.
And Shri Nehru had his share of the blows. But a crowd that loved him gathered
round him, and the demonstrators fled, and Rajaji arrived by the next train,
and there were no black flags and no slogans of abuse to greet him!</span><span

ought to be a matter for profound satisfaction, all the world over, that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s

photographs in the book call for special mention. As camera technique they may
not reach up to a great deal, but, as living records of moments that cannot be
called back, they are superb. There is a picture of Shri Nehru talking to a
group of worried pensioners. Shri Nehru’s look in it ought to have killed the
petty-minded officer who was troubling the pensioners. There is another picture
of Shri Nehru with a poor lady visitor who came to him for a recommendation.
The look of trust on that lady’s face is a compliment to any leader of men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

could go on multiplying my themes of delight in the book, but I must stop with
just one other picture. It shows Shri Nehru in the saddest of moods. There are
tears in his eyes, but he is trying to withhold them: in vain. It was perhaps
the day his mother died. Or, his father, the great Motilal. Or, was it
Gandhiji? There is a haunting loveliness about that picture. There must have
been moments in the country’s history when Shri Nehru felt no less sad,
thinking of the sorrows of his people–and of all mankind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has not made Pandit Nehru a cynic. His child-like habits and youthful
exuberance remain. He loves to roam in the realm of thought, but he is capable
of enjoying fun and frivolity also. In 1940, when the inmates of <i>Anand
Bhavan </i>played <i>holi </i>with great gusto, Nehru vigorously participated
in the frolic…..There was a lot of fun that day. When a photograph was being
taken on the occasion, Nehru climbed on to Acharya J. B. Kripalani’s shoulders,
and sat there, adjusting himself with the help of others. Acharya Kripalani
kept on laughing, saying: ‘Jawahar, you are not a light little child. For
goodness’ sake, get down.’ Nehru insisted on being photographed like that.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

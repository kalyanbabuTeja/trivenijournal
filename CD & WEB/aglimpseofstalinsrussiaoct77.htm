font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>During
the last fifty years the trend of Russian literature has undergone a complete
change. A study of Russian fiction, during these years reveals that the
thematic concentration seems to be more on the outside world rather than on
spiritual values. This does not, however, mean that the writers in the 19th
century and the early part of the 20th century concentrated only on the
spiritual sphere. They were as conscious and aware of the world around them as
the contemporary writers, but their occupation was more with the motive of
setting off their convictions and beliefs than is elaborating the happenings of
an era. Dostoevsky, for instance, went deep down into his own spiritual and
psychological self, and transferred the agonies of his spirit and mind into his
creations. It is the inner struggle of man studied in certain universal human
conditions that form the theme of Dostoevsky’s works. Tolstoy in his monumental
work is quite aware of the outside world, and though he has described <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>War and Peace </i>as the “Picture of manners
based on a historical event,” it can be better described as a “peace of life.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
would perhaps be more appropriate to refer to literature published in Russia
from the year 1917 as Soviet literature; With the exception of Sholokov and
Pasternak, it has been noticed that the preoccupation of the novelists and
writers of the Soviet Union is with special aspects connected with political
changes in the era. Instead of the study of human character in certain
situations, we find the concentration on special situations and the effect they
have upon life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an essay in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Times Literary Supplement
</i>one of the Soviet literary critics has stated that Soviet literature has
become more “closely involved with its readers,” and that it has come closer to
concrete and authentic realities.” There are a number of Soviet novelists who concentrate
on the Revolution and on the World War which left behind such bitter memories.
These novels form a class by themselves and are united by a similarity of
theme. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Stalin regime was generally referred to as the “death of liberty” and the
terrible happenings in that era form the subject of some recent books. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Times Literary Supplement</i> refers to
these books as “Russian purge literature,” and these are mostly based on the
writer’s personal experiences during this terrible regime. Quite a number of
these books were translated into English and published during the year 1967. In
spite of Svetlana Stalin’s letters in which she tries to justify the actions of
her father, all these books leave a very gruesome and horrible picture of
Russia with its prisons and concentration camps and all the relentless
machinery of crushing an individual. Lydia Chukovskaya’s novel <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Deserted House</i> which is autobiographical
tells of the hideous machinery that sent thousands of innocent people to
concentration camps. Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>One Day in the Life</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of Ivan
Denisovich </i>describes life in a concentration camp and Evegenia Ginzburg’s <i

of the author’s life in various prisons and labour camps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that destroys masses of people in a ruthless manner. Only those who are lucky
enough to survive the ravages of the whirlwind can describe what their
experiences were like. Such was the political whirlwind that swept over Russia
in 1937-’39. Many innocent men and women were affected, very few survived to narrate
their experiences of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>that reign of
terror. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Semyonova Ginzburg was one of those unfortunate individuals who was wrongfully
persecuted in the Stalin era. She was a teacher and journalist and was happily
married to a member of the central committee. As she was working under a
historian who was accused of being a follower of Trotsky, she was arrested,
tortured and thrown into prison where she spent eighteen years of the best part
of her life. Later on her husband was also arrested and her family was
completely broken up. Her children were given other names and deported to
different towns. After her release in 1955 she made many efforts to find out
the whereabouts of her husband and her children. She could get no news of
either her husband or her eldest son Alyosha. Her youngest son Vasily Aksyonov
is now a talented novelist, and has written many novels which have been very
well-appreciated in the USSR. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Into the
Whirlwind </i>is an autobiography, an account of three years of the eighteen
that Evegenia Ginzburg spent in captivity. This book has not so far been
published in the Soviet Union. The English translation was published in London
in the year 1967. It is difficult to understand how after such a terrible
experience Evegenia Ginzburg still manages to live in Russia. She is still a
communist, and her ideologies have not changed in spite of her bitter
experiences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
book is a very powerful narrative of her personal experiences in the prison and
labour camps of Russia. She has gone through unimaginable difficulties and
tortures but what is remarkable is not just the horror of what she describes
but how her will and determination to survive helped her to withstand the agony
of these difficult years. It is the “story of a noble and intelligent person,
persecuted though innocent, humiliated as a citizen and as a woman, deprived of
the benefit of husband, children, home, profession, feminity, all this in her
own country by her own party. She was kept alive in mind and body, by her
determination not to let this just happen, but to observe and remember and one
day to establish the historical records”. “One rarely comes across a woman of
such tremendous courage who in spite of the tortures that were inflicted on her
could still preserve her serenity and presence of mind. Her book gives us an
insight into the infinite capacity of the human soul: nothing can debase or
demoralize it; suffering on the other hand increases its greatness. The book
can also be considered as the most important autobiography by a Soviet citizen
and is perhaps the only book that can challenge Svetlana Stalin’s memoirs. The
book need not be assessed as a propaganda against communism. Nowhere does
Ginzburg criticize the ideologies of communism; in spite of everything she is
and still remains a Russian Communist. From the literary point of view the book
is important as the revelations of an intelligent and sensitive woman caught in
a regime that was based purely on a mechanical formula with utter disregard for
human values. In this type of a political set up the basic human and spiritual
values are forgotten and sacrificed to preserve the ideals of a party that has
its own selfish motives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
book is divided into two parts. The first deals with the author’s life in the
Russian prisons; the second part describes her life in a Siberian labour camp.
The narration is restricted only to three years of her life in captivity. The
publisher in his note has said that the author is at present engaged in writing
another book which will cover the remaining years of her prison life. Each
chapter has a significant caption which gives us an idea of the contents. The
narrative starts with a telephone call at dawn. On the 1st of December, 1934,
Evegenia Ginzberg was summoned to appear before the regional committee at 6 O’
clock in the morning. She had not the slightest idea as to why she was called,
but this was the beginning of the end of her peaceful little world. The author
was persecuted and cross-examined by the party for the simple reason that she
refused to denounce Elvov. She was too proud and upright to go against her
convictions. One of her husband’s very close friends was her very first
interrogator. There were others too who ceaselessly interrogated her for two
months until she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. At the end of the two
months the licence to teach was withdrawn and this was the unkindest cut of
all, for all her life Evegenia Ginzburg had either been a student or a teacher.
When the schools and colleges reopened after the vacations and the town was
full of activity, she had a very frustrated feeling when she realised that she
would never again walk through the entrance of her own university. All her
reserves broke down when she received a bunch of flowers and an affectionate
note from her last year’s students. Her old mother-in-law advised her to save
herself by going into hiding in a remote village, but again her sense of pride
overcame her and she refused to do what her conscience did not approve of. It
is only much later that she regretted having adopted this stiff attitude,
having come to realize through her bitter experience that it is pointless to
use the intelligence when struggling with a heartless monster–far better to use
subterfuge. She was then summoned to Moscow for a fresh trial of her case that
Evegenia Ginzburg realised that she was doomed and that every minute was
precious. When she was expelled from the party she could see that her end was
near, and eight days after this she was arrested. The day that she was called
to meet the Head of the Department for Special Political Affairs, she knew that
she was being arrested. It is the most touching account that the author gives
of her last moments with her family. When her four-year old son sensing
something unusual in her departure came running to her, she turned away from
him and asked her mother-in-law to take him away; she says “ I could not so
much as look at the children or kiss them. If I had, I would have died then and
there”.<sup>2</sup> After the routine of interrogation she was assigned to the
cellars of Black Lake. The cold despair in her heart was relieved to a great
extent when she realised that she had a young girl as a companion in her cell.
From then onwards, the author’s life was a game of shuttlecock between the
interrogation room and the prison cell. Very often the torture and the
interrogation lasted continuously for several days–this was known as a conveyor
belt and prisoners were invariably left as mental wrecks after such an
experience. After one such ordeal which lasted for seven days the author became
unconscious. As soon as she was brought back to her prison cell her
co-prisoners gathered round her with food, drink, medicines and sympathy.
Common suffering increases the bond between human beings. In a similar way when
another prisoner was brought in, broken and unconscious from the torture room,
Evegenia and the other prisoners pooled their meagre resources together to make
him as comfortable as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a few months the author was told that she was being transferred to another
prison. During the months a sense of comradeship had grown up between Evegenia
and her cell-mates and she was sorry to be parted from them. Her watch was
returned to her and when she looked at it she saw that it had stopped as it had
not been wound since the day of her arrest, she then remembered that it was “2
O’clock on that memorable day–the day on which my life ended; Everything since
then had consisted only of my wanderings through hell. Or could it be
purgatory?” The words of her friend Garey come to her “Could Garey be right
about fetters falling and prisons crumbling some day? What would have become of
us all if it were not for the illusory light of that incessant hope”.<sup>2</sup>
The only welcome piece of news she received while going from the jail to the
other was information about the welfare of her family. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
new prison was as dirty and filthy as the other one. Here also she made friends
with all her prison-mates and a bond of friendship soon developed between them.
As speaking to each other was strictly forbidden and impossible they would
communicate with each other by a series of taps on the walls...like the morse
code. It is by this method that information was passed on from one prisoner to
the other. One day she received the stunning news that her husband had been
arrested. She had somehow resigned herself to the misery of life in prison with
the belief that her children and husband were safe at home. This news shattered
her peace of mind. From the time she had been arrested she had learned to
withdraw her mind from thoughts of her home and children. She had been
contended with the idea that the children were being looked after by their
father. Only a mother can understand the thoughts and feelings that run through
her mind at this stage. She is positively in agony when she thinks of her
dependent children. Memories of trivial incidents come to her and torture her–Vasya,
her little son, had always liked falling asleep in her arms with a red shawl
wrapped round him–Sometimes he used to ring her up at work in the university–but,
most vivid was the memory of when she had slapped her little son for having
broken an expensive bottle of perfume, and she says, “Now this memory tortured
me like fire. Nothing seemed to weigh more heavily on my conscience. My poor
little one, alone in this dreadful work, and what did he have to remember his
mother by? That she had slapped him for an idiotic bottle of scent. And worst
of all, there was nothing in the world I could do now to put it right”.<sup> 4</sup>

darkest moments there was always relief and respite. She found great solace and

memory failed she composed her own verses. When she was put into the punishment

Ginzburg has a very sensitive and expressive style of writing-typically
feminine. She has an artistic sense of beauty and precision for details.
Sometimes she elaborates a very trivial incident just because it had made an
impression on her mind at that moment. In many aspects we can refer to her
style as poetic. She is also very emotional and sentimental. “The Summer
Breeze,” “The Rustle of the Trees,” “The Starry Skies” have a tremendous effect
on her. It is this love of beauty and poetry that helped the author to live
through her dreadful experiences and come out intact as a human being. She has
also a quality of making unusual comparisons. Standing in front of her judges
she suddenly looks at the clock and she describes it as “Large and round, with
shiny handles like a moustache”.<sup>9</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the individual by the force of his own will power can retain the greatness of
his own characters. Suffering increases the sensibilities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ginzburg is not only a very courageous woman but also an extremely
compassionate and noble individual. Throughout her life in prison she tried to
lighten her miseries by diverting her attention to the suffering of others.
When by a turn of events the people who had been responsible for her arrest
were thrown into the same prison, she tries her best to help and comfort them.
Such was the case of Bari Abdullin, the second Secretary of the Party Regional
Committee. He had openly condemned Evegenia Ginzburg and had been instrumental
to her expulsion from the party. When he was arrested and tortured for
forty-eight hours, she could think of him not as her enemy but only as a
friend. Revenge would be a despicable action. She gladly shares her meagre allowance
of cigarettes and food with him. She feels amply rewarded for her action when
the man asks for her forgiveness. Then again, in the labour camp she sees a
half-starved and emaciated man on the verge of death. She comes to know that it
was the same man who had convicted her and had tantalized her with food when
she was starving. She willingly offers her half portion of bread to him. She is
inspired not by her ego but by her pity for a fellow-sufferer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book is a good example of the fact that the human will has infinite capacities.
The author could rise above her terrible experiences only by her sheer
determination to survive. In her postscript the author explains how her life in
prison helped her to understand human nature more thoroughly. “An intense
interest in the sides of life and of human nature which were then revealed to
me for the first time often distracted me from my own suffering.<sup> 10</sup>
The book is an admirable account of the survival of the human soul and spirit
in the most inhuman conditions of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

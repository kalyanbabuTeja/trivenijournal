in an orthodox Brahmin family in humble circumstances. After finishing his
primary education at <span class=SpellE>Chickballapur</span>, he was taken for
high school and college education to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City>.
Too poor to pay for his school fees and books, he earned while he learned,
giving tuitions to other boys. He graduated from the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Central</st1:PlaceName>

dint of intelligence, industry and earnestness, he secured rapid promotions and
was earning Rs. 500, less than two years after entering service. He worked on
various assignments as Irrigation Engineer, designing water works and drainage
schemes for various towns in the then Bombay Presidency. He devised what is
known as the Block System of irrigation, to give water by rotation to minimize
wastage of water and yield better results to cultivators–a system commended by
the Irrigation Commission set up by the Government of India in 1901-3. ‘The
object is to distribute the benefits of irrigation works over a larger number
of villages and to concentrate the irrigation in each village within blocks of
specified units and in selected soils and situations.’ This system was successfully
worked in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Nira</span></st1:PlaceName>

class=SpellE>Khadakvarla</span>, near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Poona</st1:place></st1:City>,
to raise the storage water level of the lake permanently by about 8 ft–without
raising the dam–<span class=GramE>increasing ,</span> the storage of water by
about 25 per cent. He took out a patent but refused to ask for any royalty as
the work was carried out under his own supervision as Government Engineer. He
was deputed to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Aden</st1:place></st1:City>
to devise the water works and drainage of that town in 1906. Kolhapur needed a
water supply scheme and the Political Agent wrote to the Government of Bombay
asking specifically for the services of a European Engineer; but as Visvesvaraya
was as good as any European engineer he was deputed; and it must be said to the
credit of the Political Agent that he paid a handsome compliment to
Visvesvaraya for the fine job done by him at Kolhapur. He soon rose to be
Superintending Engineer, having superseded many in service on account of the
special offices to which he was appointed. His work drew unstinted praise from
a Governor like Lord <span class=SpellE>Sydenham</span>, not particularly noted
for his pro-Indian sympathies, who spoke appreciatively of his “great abilities
and unvarying industry.” He was only 47 and had put in 24 years in the service
of the Bombay Government by 1908, but wished to retire as he felt that “in the <span
class=SpellE>staet</span> of political felling in the country” at the time, his
chance of being appointed as Chief Engineer was rather remote. His European and
Indian friends feared that he might not be considered eligible for a pension.
Lord <span class=SpellE>Sydenham’s</span> Government, however, took a generous
view and wrote to the Government of India that “the service rendered by Visvesvaraya
has been exceptionally meritorious and fully entitles him to the additional
pension.” </p>

years, not to enjoy a holiday, but to study the conditions in Western countries
and make notes, as was his invariable practice. This was not his first foreign
tour, as he had already visited <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1898 for three months, making notes of what he saw, and had even compiled a
small book without any idea of publishing it. What he had seen of <st1:country-region

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had, no doubt, by now formally retired from Government service, but it can be
truly said that his most active and fruitful career was just beginning, as
proved by subsequent events. His life in the service of the Bombay Government,
of which he spent nearly 14 years in <st1:City w:st="on">Poona</st1:City>, the
educational and political <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of <st1:place w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place>,
specially fitted him for undertaking nation-building activities in later years.
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Poona</st1:place></st1:City> was one
of the most vigorous <span class=SpellE>centres</span> of national feeling and <span
class=SpellE>endeavour</span> in the country. It was fortunate for Visvesvaraya
that he came into intimate contact during this momentous period with the great <span
class=SpellE>Mahadev</span> <span class=SpellE>Govind</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ranade</span> and his illustrious disciple Gopal Krishna Gokhale.
It is interesting to note that as early as 1893 he contributed an article to
the journal of the <span class=SpellE>Sarvajanik</span> Sabha on “National
Uplift”. He had also been instrumental in starting the <span class=SpellE>Deccan</span>
Club in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Poona</st1:place></st1:City>
in 1891, where the elite of the city could meet for recreation, get to know one
another better, and discuss topical public questions informally. These precious
years that he spent in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Poona</st1:place></st1:City>
must have deepened his patriotic <span class=SpellE>fervour</span>, and given
direction to his later activities as a front-rank publicist and
patriot-statesman. While this <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> environment <span
class=SpellE>moulded</span> his ideas and gave him a vision, his purity and
strength of character, were of his own making. Scorning the common pleasures of
life, he had disciplined himself rigorously to live a well-ordered life, and
one of high moral <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>. Todd’s <i>Students’
Manual </i>and the works of Samuel Smiles on <i>Duty, Self-Help </i>and <i>Thrift
</i>were books which were in great vogue in those days, and were earnestly
recommended to the young for their reverent study by well-meaning elders. These
books seem to have been <span class=SpellE>favourites</span> with Visvesvaraya,
who evidently strove to reduce to practice the many ennobling and excellent
precepts in these books. THE GERMINAL IDEAS IN THESE BOOKS seem to have fallen
on fertile soil and they bore abundant fruit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

second foreign tour, referred to above, was interrupted by an urgent call from <st1:City

<span class=GramE>river</span>, flowing through <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>, which had caused considerable
damage. His services were, therefore, requisitioned to suggest remedial
measures. Visvesvaraya replied, fixing his terms and agreeing to go to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City> five months
later. His terms were those that would have normally been offered to a European
engineer of similar status. The <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>
Government <span class=GramE>were</span> anxious to have his expert advice and

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
interesting instance of how he jealously safeguarded the self-respect and
status of Indians may be given here. It was when he was <span class=SpellE>Dewan</span>
of Mysore. During the <span class=SpellE>Dasara</span> celebrations, one day
was set apart for a European Durbar in the Palace. The European guests were
provided with chairs, while the Indian officers and other guests had to squat
on the floor on the other side of the hall. Visvesvaraya resented this
arrangement, and a custom, which had prevailed for many years, was changed at
his instance, and chairs were thereafter provided to all invitees, European or
Indian. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

course of which he said that Visvesvaraya would find ‘ample scope both for his
energy and talents’ and that His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore was aware
‘that he attached greater importance to opportunities for rendering public
service than to mere official emoluments.’ Visvesvaraya was still not keen on
accepting the offer and wanted time to consider the matter. He inquired asking
if there was any prospect of the Government encouraging industries and
technical education in the State and utilizing his services in that connection.
As he got a <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> reply, Visvesvaraya joined as
Chief Engineer of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>

the first step he took was to insist on encouraging merit in making new
appointments: without being influenced by extraneous considerations. Committees
were appointed, at his instance, to make a plan for technical education, and,
again, at his instance, the Economic Conference was established in June 1911.
It functioned actively for many years, and worked in three sections:
Agriculture, Industries and Commerce, and Education. Public-spirited
non-officials were associated in the work of numerous committees. Visvesvaraya
had a passion for statistics and insisted on targets being clearly set in
respect of various development activities and speedy efforts being made to
reach them. He thus made the officers and people plan-minded. This was, indeed,
the beginning of planned efforts, ever made in India on any considerable scale,
and well may Visvesvaraya be hailed as the Father of Planned Economy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it. Officers had to be at their places when the offices opened, and, by making
surprise visits himself, he ensured that the age-old habits of irregularity
yielded to new ways of efficiency. Heads of Departments had also to make
themselves available at fixed hours to visitors. He saw to it, in addition,
that officers were smartly dressed, in Western style preferably, except for the
Mysore turban; and there are stories still current, of the ludicrous instances

watchwords and he attempted to infuse these virtues into the officials and

for instance, was often retyped over and over again, so that there was not the
slightest flaw in it. He spared neither himself nor others and, in spite of a
frail and even puny body, gave evidence of extraordinary alertness and physical
energy. His regular diet habits and his daily walks kept him thoroughly fit and
active. He was punctual to the minute in keeping his engagements. He set a high
standard of moral rectitude which had a chastening effect on the
administration, so that one rarely heard of corruption. He abhorred nepotism
and jobbery of any kind in making appointments or bestowing other Government <span

would not touch Government stationery or use Government conveyance, making a
distinction between public duties and private work with a meticulousness that
was almost fanatical. All this might sound fantastic to the pampered officials
of the modern day, provided by a generous Government with vans and jeeps, and
unaccustomed to the drawing of su.ch nice distinctions. </p>

important lead in the matter of assigning a proper status to the citizens and
the rulers of the Indian States in the contemplated Federal Constitution of
India. Though he could not agree to the methods of direct action and mass
political agitation launched by Gandhiji, he was by no means a reactionary and
was well in advance of the then ‘moderate’ opinion in the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Besides
numerous pamphlets and brochures or reports of which he was the author,
Visvesvaraya wrote and published three substantial books: <i>Reconstructing
India </i>(already mentioned), <i>Planned Economy for India </i>(1934) and <span
class=SpellE><i>Memoris</i></span><i> of My Working Life </i>(1951). The first
two books are packed with facts and figures and set down his views on the
reconstruction of India as an economically prosperous and industrially
developed nation. The third book is a plain and unvarnished account of his
public career as a Government official in Bombay and, later in Mysore, and of
his varied activities subsequently. The book is characteristic of him. It opens
with his 24th year, with not a word in it about his private life and its joys
and sorrows by way of introduction or even incidentally. Nor does it contain
any sidelights on the men and events that influenced him in the course of his
public life. It is, true, there is mention of great personalities like, <span
class=SpellE>Ranade</span>, Gokhale, Tilak, Sri <span class=SpellE>Krishnaraja</span>
<span class=SpellE>Wadiyar</span> and others; but we are not, permitted even a
glimpse into his relationships with these great men. The narrative is severely
objective and factual. He has obviously said much less than he felt about any
person or any event. This reticence, and the style of strictly objective
expression, seemed to have become his second nature, the result of prolonged
self-discipline. In the course of his long public life he did come into contact
with all kinds of people–people who must have greatly hurt him or sorely tried
his patience. But his <i>Memoirs </i>contain not a word of comment or
condemnation of any person. No doubt, occasionally, it contains quotations from
appreciative and flattering references to himself from numerous high officials,
but these seem to<i> </i>be set down not out of vanity but to serve as an
example to his fellow countrymen so that they might profit by his experience.
In 1960–in his 100th year–he published <i>A Brief Memoir of My Complete Working
Life. </i>It is not priced and seems to have been intended for private
circulation. It sets down categorically the events of his long career, the
dates on which he delivered University Convocation Addresses in four Indian
Universities, the dates of his six foreign travels and their purpose, the dates
on which titles and <span class=SpellE>honours</span>, degrees (<span
class=SpellE><i>honoris</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>causa</span></i>) from
eight Indian Universities, were conferred on him; and the list of his
publications. It is a kind of logbook rendering an account of his life and
prepared in his characteristically methodical way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the scrapbooks contained compilations relating to public questions and some to

Herculean efforts to modernize Mysore during the nine years he was associated
with its administration as Chief Engineer and <span class=SpellE>Dewan</span>
have been already referred to. It is true that he succeeded in a large measure
in creating a new life, or its outward signs, during his regime. But it must
not be forgotten that he had his severe critics who condemned his ‘wasteful
expenditure’ and ambitious plans. He was even charged with doing things for
show though in sober truth he husbanded the resources of the State most
carefully and was ever watchful to effect the utmost economy in the expenditure
on Public Works. Showiness was utterly foreign to his nature. No <span
class=SpellE>Dewan</span> was so unassuming and mild as he was. Again, there
were the irreverent scoffers even among the officials of the State who looked
upon his schemes as a huge joke, and his plans as so many fads. There were,
again, others among them who knew the things that would please him and tried to
make an impression on him by external habiliments or the reeling off of
statistics cooked up for the occasion in reply to his invariable queries.
Visvesvaraya, in spite of his supreme intelligence, was not always a shrewd
judge of men and was easily taken in; and when he discovered that he had been
imposed upon, very likely he must have felt sorrow rather than anger. People
who moved closely with him have testified that they have never seen him lose
his temper–an extraordinary thing to say about any human being! What would
cause indignation in others simply found expression, in his case, in some <span
class=SpellE>drily</span> humorous remark, which often quenched his hearers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

impersonal, passionless and intensely intellectual attitude was both his strength
and his weakness. One felt awed in his presence, but not drawn to get into
closer communion with him, unless, of course, one belonged to his intimate
circle. Yet he was extremely considerate, and gave frequent evidence of a
tender heart that felt for others. Of his many deeds of charity, of monthly
pensions to dependents, poor relations and needy students, the world could know
little; he gave and helped so quietly. His reticence and intellectual <span
class=SpellE>vigour</span> and moral elevation left him on a lonely eminence.
He could not evoke widespread and deep emotional response from the masses: he
was not made to be a mass leader. But the people admired and adored him; and
his portraits could be seen on the walls of village homes in the Mysore State
long before the portraits of other national leaders which became popular in
later years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Visvesvaraya had many things in common: purposefulness in life; unfailing
courtesy; personal austerity; a passionate regard for tidiness and punctuality;
a capacity for untiring work. But the differences in their outlook on life, and
approach to national problems, presented a striking contrast. Gandhi
personified in an unmistakable way the people of India and particularly the
poor; Visvesvaraya appeared to be outlandish. Gandhi was not <span
class=SpellE>enamoured</span> of machinery and the complex industrial
organization of the West and bent all his energies to the revival of the <span
class=SpellE>Charkha</span> and cottage industries; Visvesvaraya, though he was
aware of the importance of village industries, was an ardent admirer of the
technological advances made in Western countries and was never tired of holding
up their example for our<i> </i>emulation. Gandhiji’ spoke of <span
class=SpellE>Ramarajya</span>, of the <i>Gita </i>and of God; Visvesvaraya did
not refer to the past but was fully engrossed with the present and the future,
and his approach was thoroughly secular. Gandhi always harped on Satya and
Ahimsa; Visvesvaraya was always speaking of precision and efficiency. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was unique in his own way: both of them achieved mighty things in their
lifetime. Both of them were impatient to lift the masses of India out of the
poverty and degradation into which they had sunk, and make them strong and
self-reliant. The seeming antithesis between them (and, indeed, Gandhiji seemed
to be the antithesis of almost every other Indian leader, in a way, being in a
class by himself) was due to the difference of emphasis on factors that each
sincerely believed would help build up the manhood of India and a fuller life
for the Indian people. Both of them dedicated all their life to the great task
of national regeneration, each in his own sphere, and according to his own
aptitude and light. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Vighneswara,’
as most readers in South India might know by now, is the pen-name of Mr. N.
Raghunatha Aiyar, one of the ablest and most learned of leader-writers in this
country (who had retired from <i>The Hindu, </i>after a distinguished record of
service for nearly three decades), under which he was writing, the <i>Sotto
Voce </i>column for Khasa Subba Rau’s <i>Swatantra, </i>without a break, from
its very inception, till the day the founder-editor had to leave it. It was a
happy thought of the publishers to collect these brilliant contributions in
book form and rescue them from the limbo of decaying files of the defunct
periodical. The first volume, covering the papers for the first three years
1946-1949, came out two years ago under the original title of the column. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second volume in the <i>Sotto Voce </i>series, covering the next three years,
has now been made available under the title <i>Our New Rulers, </i>which might
obviously suggest the predominantly political character of its contents, more
than its predecessor. Week after week, he brings the new democracy and its
economic and educational policies and its social and cultural legislation under
his powerful microscope and points out where in his view they are found
wanting, in the light of the ideals set before themselves, and judged by his
own standards of public conduct and private behaviour, which are quite high.
Brought up in the orthodox Hindu tradition and steeped in the classics of the
East and the West, his emphasis is invariably on the values of individual
liberty (which has now to be understood in the new context of planned economy
and a progressive society) and a social organisation in which the memory of the
race persists, as he puts it in his own way (but this memory seems to fade with
the break-up of the caste system and the disintegration of the joint family–the
signs of the times are unmistakable). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it would not be correct to assume that politics of the hour were the only or
even the main theme of his brilliant column. In fact, like his mythical
namesake, who was the worthy amanuensis of the author of the <i>Mahabharata, </i>‘Vighneswara’
takes all knowledge for his province and he takes everything in his majestic,
elephantine stride. He has an apt word for everything that comes his way and
his shrewd comment on all foibles of human behaviour–whether it be the wedding
of a septuagenarian political leader or the food fads of a high-up in
ministerial office. He is also an astute dialectician, who can cross swords
with Dr. Ambedkar and other doughty constitution-makers. But, even in the most
serious of disputations he does not cease to be a wit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a political commentator, he has a cynical flair for pricking all the
pretentious balloons. There are all kinds of weapons in his intellectual
armoury, but he enjoys wielding the rapier of wit and the lance of irony and
sarcasm rather than the sledge-hammer of heavy argument. But, I personally feel
he is at his best when he is unbending, as it were, on his favourite themes,
which are, luckily, non-political. The artist and poet in him comes out of the
columnist’s sun-burnt shell here. This, of the deodar of Almora: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be a pigmy<i> </i>by the side of the famed American redwood. And the pine,
with its green tapers pointed heavenward, has a more slender grace. But the
deodar is instinct with adoration. It yearns towards the infinite, its
gesturing arms undulant under the pressure of caressing winds.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

handling the <i>ghana </i>ragas, Mr. Naidu is prone to pay less attention to
their architectonics than do those instrumentalists, whose musical imagination
has been largely fed on the work of the great classical composers, particularly
Tyagaraja. He loves to explore, instead, the tempting by-ways which are hinted
at, rather than worked out, by more orthodox expositors. Those <i>sancharas, </i>which
tease the imagination with their suggestion of strange frontiers, call out all
his originality. The smaller <i>rakti </i>ragas and their analogues of the
Hindustani school are his metier.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

looking for the <i>mot juste, </i>he often achieved it with surprising
facility, like the inebriate bee blundering into the chalice of the ready
flower…..Venkataramani has always backed his fancy, to use a racing metaphor.
He was never one of your timorous half-and-halfers. He was too full of his
vision to spare any thought for the mockers. And snobbery wilted in his
presence. His enthusiasms are those of a poet; they have the quality of the
rainbow, intangible and ever fresh. For the Ashrama on the Kaveri and the rural
university of his dreams there may be as little to show after a life-time of
high endeavour as the few sticks and stones that, for the imaginative child, <i>are
</i>the king’s palace. The poet shares with the child the simplicity of
self-surrender; it is of such the Vedic seer said: <i>Tyaagenaike amtrtatvam

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Of Dr. C. R. Reddi, the ‘Statesman of Education,’ he

lingered about him, almost to the last, a suggestion of the Naughty ‘Nineties,
whose breath was probably still hot on the cheek of the Cambridge of his
days….Though he was profoundly interested in politics and took a gladiator’s
delight in exercising his thews and sinews in the arena, he could, somehow,
never bring himself to take party politics of his day seriously. On the puppet
stage of the Montford regime he spoke the language of Fox and Pitt. And when he
discovered that you cannot run a ghost through the heart, he threw away his
sword with a sigh of relief.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the poets of the classical age as in the singers of the <i>Saamam </i>it was
the mysterious power of <i>Vaak </i>that gripped him. Music, he held, came
before meaning and subsumed it. And as he read, or rather sang, the great hymn
to Vishnu or Aja’s lament in the <i>Raghuvamsa, </i>the magnificent
Gangaavatarana scene, or the dythyramb on the season of snows in the <i>Bhoja
Champu, </i>you were transported to the world of pure imagination where
materialities ceased to exist. You saw the magnanimity of Dileepa, the humanity
of Ramachandra, the serenity of Dharmavyaadha, as painted frescoes on the
crystal of the poet’s luminous sperch. To Sastriar a half-verse was a nodal
point of beauty, a jasmine bud that blossomed at the touch of the sahridaya.
And to one chrysalis mind he brought the first intimations of a world of
immortal essences.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is rarely that a journalist’s work-a-day column survives the passage of the day

scholar. He is an essayist to the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>manner born, and, at
his best, is in the hallowed tradition of the English essayists of old. He can
be pithy and epigrammatic as Bacon, quaint and whimsical and allusive as Lamb,
as also learned and mock-serious like the fourth leaders from the London <i>Times.
</i>He is a consummate stylist, as well as a scathing satirist. The progressive
intellectual may not enthuse over the golden age if it is always in the past.
Vighneswara’s Latin tags may now and then take us beyond our depths. His
Sanskrit proverbs may irritate some who are strangers to the language.
Sometimes, he might send the average reader scurrying for the dictionary. But,
a careful reading of the book is sure to be rewarding like the company of the
classics. Political opinions notwithstanding, it is one of the few modern books
which repay study by lovers of the English language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

by the famous authors Prof. R. M. Maciver and Prof. C. H. Page is a well-known
book in Sociology, widely used as a text-book by college students and teachers
in many countries. Since the publication of its first English edition in 1950 a
number of reprints have been issued from time to time, and now that the same

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
book is divided into three main parts. The first part is concerned with the
analysis of the nature of social relations and the influence of environment
over social life. The second part discusses the nature of social structure, the
forces that sustain social structure and also its major forms. The third part
analyses in detail the nature of social change. One of the special features of
this book lies in the precision with which the primary sociological concepts
have been defined. In fact, Sociology has always been criticised for the lack
of standardised precise concepts. Therefore the credit of making clearer the
analytical tools of Sociology definitely goes to the authors of this book; and
it is heartening to note that in recent years a number of text-books have been
adopting these concepts and definitions. The authors of this book have made a
clear-cut distinction between the important terms civilisation and culture. To
them all those things, techniques or organisational aspects which are used by
us ‘because of some outer necessity’ and are meant either for controlling
natural phenomena (basic technology) or for regulating the behaviour of human
beings (higher of social technology) are within the category of civilisation,
and those, like art and religion, which ‘we seek them as such’ and give us
‘direct satisfaction’ are within the category of culture. The other special
feature of this book is the extensive treatment given to the topic ‘Social
Change’. No other text-book in Sociology has attempted an analysis of this
topic so </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thoroughly. Indeed the authors have made a
notable contribution to this field by introducing the two concepts of
‘technological lag’ and ‘technological restraint’ as against Prof. Ogburn’s
concept of ‘cultural lag.’ Prof. Ogburn divided culture (in line with the
classification of culture made by Anthropologists) into two large
categories–material and nonmaterial. He argues that usually changes occur first
in the material culture and even though the nonmaterial culture tries to adjust
itself to the former, it lags behind. Criticising Prof. Ogburn’s analysis the
authors write: “If, for example, we cling to old fashioned ways when under new
conditions our needs could be better served by changing them, we cannot
properly say that the lag is between the material and nonmaterial. Nor again
should we assume that it is always the ‘material’ that is in advance of the
‘nonmaterial’.” Thus, keeping in line with their distinction between
civilisation and culture, they point out that the term ‘lag’ cannot be made
applicable to “relations between technological factors and the cultural pattern
or between the various components of the cultural pattern itself.” Therefore
the authors use the term ‘technological lag’ to denote “certain failures of
adjustment within the basic technolog and the ‘higher’ technological
organisation, that of politico-economic order” and use the term ‘technological
restraint’ to denote the situation “where the introduction of more efficient
instruments, methods, or agencies, or the utilisation of more efficient
products is impeded or balked by controls designed to protect some established interest.”
Above all, the authors have successfully tried to simplify and combine, where

of all these three closely related social sciences so as to understand human
society in full, without, of course, losing sight of the fact that each science
has its own special field of study and that the analysis of social relations is
the prime concern of a student of Sociology. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a perusal of this book one cannot but agree with the opinion of the authors
that if this book goes in more thoroughly for social analysis than do most
introductions to Sociology it is because any such analysis is the first
requisite for the intelligent study of society. But, as in this book there is a
vast citation of references and a great number of examples are drawn mainly
from Europe and the U. S. A., the Indian student would rather feel it difficult
to understand thoroughly their significance. The Indian teacher, therefore, has
to carefully select appropriate examples from Indian society and fit them into
the theoretical framework of the book and thus make the student derive the full
benefits of the scientific analysis of ‘Society’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

from many angles familiar to his ardent students. With characteristic restraint

diverse angles, without attempting to impress his own integral apprehension of
the Master Spirit on the reader’s mind. Such studies are well calculated to
stimulate thought, provoke further study, and thus contribute to a better

well as his thought which derives from roots of traditional Hindu religion and
Upanishadic philosophy. This thesis is maintained even with reference to the

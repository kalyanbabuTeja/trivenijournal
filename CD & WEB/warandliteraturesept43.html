style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Paper is short and war is long. And that, gentle
readers, is the moral of the article I intended to write. Intended, please
note! for what I might be writing now seems more of an exasperation than an
inspiration. Whatever that be, facts would be facts even when there is not
enough of paper to publish them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One such fact is about New Ideas. I believe
idealists and historians have great praise and enthusiasm for new ideas. That,
however, does not surprise me since neither the idealists nor the historians
are sufferers from ideas. It is the poor writers, my tribe (may it not
increase), who chance to entertain new ideas and it is they, therefore, that
realise all the conveniences and discomforts that go with these ideas. For one
thing, a new idea is like a spot with a ‘wet paint’ notice. You cannot sit on
it, nor would you feel comfortable to do so near about it. That is why I speak
of my tribesmen as poor writers. These are the days when the only thing you can
do about new ideas is to sit on them and that is the only thing which a writer
can never do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Fact number two. A writer writes as a woman puts on
her finery. No woman would wear all that luxurious plumage just to please
herself, less her husband. She has been enough tortured physically and her
husband enough tortured financially, for either of them to enjoy the sigh of
that dress. That show is meant essentially for others, for the neighbours, for
the general public. So is a writer’s writing. If it were a question of just
pleasing himself, a writer could have smoked a few more cigarettes and finished
with it. But no! he writes so that others, his neighbours, his public are
pleased and he be also pleased with himself. That fact is another reason for a
writer’s not being able to sit on any of his ideas, much less on new ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I would be doing an injustice to my clan if I were
not to clarify the writer’s position a little more. Otherwise a writer would be
misunderstood–as himself an irrelevant fact. With a war on, threatening his
very existence, could not a writer do a better thing than produce new ideas out
of his inkpot? Is it so inevitable? Perhaps not, if one were to speak on
principles. But in a world like ours where statesmen find wars inevitable why
should not a writer too feel his profession inevitable? It is true that the
present war is a total war (does it mean total destruction for an entirely new
creation?). But does that total include the small fractions in the form of writers?
If it does, then the writer, like the other soldiers, demands his equipment of
war, <i>viz., </i>pen and paper. And so I come back to where I started from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Having thus gone round the position, I now proceed
straight to my point. That point is that I feel it necessary to complain in the
name of my profession. And who would not? Almost every other profession, due to
those very war-conditions, has increased its earning potentialities while it is
only in ours that the prospects, instead of the markets, are black. Has any
writer ever got a black-market price for his writing? If not, why not? That is
the question. No, the question is worse than that. The very basis of the
profession stands threatened since actually blank paper costs more than when
there is something in black written on it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Black and white! That used to be the figure
of,–nay, the flowery–speech to describe writing. But now the paper is white and
the market black; with the result that writing, no longer capable of being both
black and white, has simply ceased to exist! A writer, if he still must write,
will have to think first and then, on second thoughts, will have to keep on
thinking. Now he has no choice but to ‘write in’. Thinking is thus mad not only
compulsory but continuous for the poor writer. Is not that unfair? It is not
even justice when followers of other professions have simply and merely to act.
These acts bring them such immediate profits that their authors have not time
enough to think. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A writer’s troubles do not end there. Thinking, in
itself, would not have been so unwelcome to him since he is used to it all the
twenty-four hours of a day for the sake of making both ends <i>viz., </i>pen
and paper, meet. But now it is not that kind or that way of thinking at all.
Now he has to keep on thinking till such time as materials to write them on
would be made available. This is where thinking not only becomes different but
difficult. Either he has to keep on to the same thoughts, in which case is
compelled to grow stale or consistent; or, he has to adjust his thoughts from
time to time, in which case at the actual time of writing them down must be
prepared to find nothing definite to write down. And that again would be
unfair. In this ever-changing world of ours should we expect only the writer to
stagnate in consistency? In these days of equality and democracy should the
writer alone be denied equal chances?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>What could the poor writer do–one might ask, almost
condemning the writer with pity. It is true that writers are really up against
Himalayan odds. They have to compete with the nations of the world that might
appropriate all available paper to write mutual promissory notes of
good-will-to-be and of peace-to-come and all the rest. They have to fight and
win a public that prefers to use its ears instead of its eyes and so listens to
radio news; a public that finds it more convenient to feel excited than to
think and so reads propaganda communiques; a public that thrills and satiates
itself on cinema-posters. This fight against the public is most unfair since
writers have no better weapon than brain, a heritage of neolithic antiquity,
while the public has the benefit of all the modernity that science is capable
of, <i>viz., </i>cheapness, smallness, installment-payments, second-hand
dealers, mass ugliness etc. And the heaviest odds of all are still to come.
These are the politicians and public leaders. Writers have an arduous job in
watching these who talk so loud and so continuously that for ages to come
nothing grand or eloquent is left for the writers to write. Universal Love,
Universal Brotherhood, Universal bickering, universal this, universal that, and
everything universal has been thoroughly, finally, and eternally and eloquently
dealt with and disposed of. Perhaps if writers could get a seat on this Universal
Committee they might reserve a few convenient topics for writing in the
post-war planning. That is a future possibility. For the present, the prospects
are such as to justify the writer’s pessimism or his campaign of complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Incidentally (and finally), let me say one thing. I
do not know what Theories literary critics would like to advance, but I do feel
that in view of the fact of the propaganda and the politician exploiting all
emotions from love to war, a kind of ‘deterioration’ is bound to set-in in
post-war literature. There is no choice. Either we write now or we live just to
repeat and to repent. With this note of warning (which I have to sound to
awaken my readers!) I end this analysis before it deteriorates into an apology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

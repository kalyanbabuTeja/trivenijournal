Kafka is one of the problem figures among modern novelists. There are many
critics who are ready to swear that he was a “religious genius” and a great
artist; there are others who believe that he was neurotic and that his works
are psychopathological case histories, and there are some who are of opinion
that he is a typical product of a ‘lost generation’ and hence not very normal.
The justification for these violently opposed opinions can be found in the life
and works of Kafka himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is quite appropriate to say in the case of Kafka that his life story is the key
to his works. He was born in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City>
on the 3rd of July 1883. His father was a wealthy Jewish merchant who had worked
his way up from humble circumstances. After having studied at the Gymnasium or
Secondary School, Kafka joined Prague University, first as a student of
Chemistry and German language and literature and then of Law. It was here that
he made friends with his classmate Max <span class=SpellE>Brod</span> who
published Kafka’s works ­posthumously. In the year 1906 he took his doctorate
degree in Law and for one year after that he worked as a Barrister without pay
at the Law Courts. His father, the shrewd man of the world, had however other
plans for his son’s career. It is here that, the essential father-son conflict,
which looms so large in the novels of <span class=GramE>Kafka</span> begins. At
the insistence of his father he worked for a year in the family business, and
then switched over as an official in a workman’s insurance company. He
deliberately chose a dull profession so that he could have enough leisure to
pursue his literary work, yet, in spite of it, he suffered terrifically from
the conflict between his need to devote himself fully to his literary
activities and the demands of his daily work. Max <span class=SpellE>Brod</span>
in his biography of Kafka gives great significance to the father-son conflict
and to the reaction of the idealistic view to the materialistic demands or life
and society. In 1914 Kafka became engaged to <span class=SpellE>Felice</span>
Bauer who was a determined and practical woman a prototype of Kafka’s father.
It did not take Kafka long to break off the engagement, as he developed a
morbid fear of marriage being convinced that as a married man he would have to
sacrifice his literary pursuits. As a matter of fact he wanted to give up his
regular job as it hampered his literary work, but was prevented by the outbreak
of the Great War, so he continued with the insurance company. He was granted
exemption from military service on grounds of ill-health. In 1917 he became engaged
again, and when arrangements for his wedding were being made he suddenly
discovered that he was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and he had to
abandon his plans. He was retired from service with a pension, and he went to <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Berlin</st1:State></st1:place> to devote himself
to literature. But life was so difficult in Post-War Germany that his disease
was aggravated and he was taken to <span class=SpellE>Kierling</span>
Sanatorium near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vienna</st1:place></st1:City>
where he died in 1924 at the age of forty-one. The last few years of his life
was brightened by his friendship with a young Polish girl called Dora <span
class=SpellE>Dymant</span> whom he had intended to marry, but her father
forbade it because Kafka was not orthodox. Also significant are his love
letters to <span class=SpellE>Milena</span>, a married lady who translated his
early works into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czech.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
On both sides there was love, but instead of a realization there was a helpless
frustration, a feeling that is very well illustrated in his works. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

undoubtedly his greatest works. All his writings were in German and we are
indebted to Edwin and Willa Muir for the translations into English. In his
introduction to some of Kafka’s short stories, Edwin Muir also remarks how the
atmosphere of tension of his early works becomes less oppressive in his last
works “There still remains a sense of vast and incom­prehensible powers
presiding over human destiny, but they no longer press upon the hero so

<span class=SpellE>Brod</span> referring to the three novels calls them a “<span

perhaps because Kafka considered the theme of each to be a quest for the
infinite, and there virtually cannot be an end. Besides these, there are
numerous short stories and aphorisms that Kafka has written. The most
well-known are “The Great Wall of China”, “The Metamorphosis”, “The Mole” “The
Burrow and The Investigations of a Dog.” In all these stories, though the
problems are the same as in the novels there is a considerable change in

humility and wish to co-operate with the authorities, drops his work and puts
on the air of a guilty man and works to push his case to a decision. His uncle
tries to help him and secures the services of an important advocate to argue
his case, but this man astounds K with the news that no case is even settled in
court by arguments but is settled out of court by influence and bribery. <span
class=GramE>But, in this case none of these methods work.</span> Desperate with
this mood of inactivity, K starts invading the Judicial Offices where he makes
a nuisance of himself as nobody has ever heard of his case. Haunted and pursued
by the sense of this unknown crime and trial, K feels that there is some
sinister authority that is ever watchful of his feelings and actions and is
becoming annoyed by his anxiety for justice. K therefore becomes <span
class=SpellE>paralysed</span> by a sense of fear. Finally the day before <span
class=SpellE>K’s</span> thirty-first birthday two other policemen show up and
take him to the edge of the town and give him a knife and ask him to slit his
throat with it and when he refuses, they themselves push it in and end his
life. Thus, the quest remains unfinished, the crime remains untold and the
final act closes with death. Yet, how futile is <span class=GramE>death,</span>
and it is not the means of realization but is just the inevitable end. It is
not the story that is important in <i>The Trial, </i>but the symbolic
significance. It is the story of the individual and his re-action against
spiritual powers which he does not understand. K had been leading a normal
existence without a sense of guilt. His crime is not that he has been immoral,
but that he has lived without taking thought of what is beyond life. His arrest
is the symbol of his awakening to life. Apart from the <span class=SpellE>symbolistic</span>
aspect, the novel is also supposed to be an exposure of the evils of
bureaucracy. It is something like a satire upon the delays of justice and red
tape, which is the death of the average man. K committed the fault of acting on
principles which are real in the spiritual world but are a fantasy in the
material: he therefore provokes the powers of evil </span><span

is Kafka’s next novel is something like a nightmare in which movement is
retarded at every step by an obstacle. The view of life and its problems
presented in <i>The Trial </i>can hardly be accepted as the final word and <i>The
Castle </i>seems to be a further exploration of the possibilities of life. Here
too, the hero is incognito and is called ‘K’. The novel begins with the arrival
of K to the village at the foot of a castle where he is supposed to have been
appointed as land Surveyor. It is late, in the evening when he arrives and he
seeks lodgings at an inn. When he is asked to leave the village as no one can
remain there without special permission from the court of the castle. He
explains that he is the land Surveyor. K starts making endless efforts to get
in touch with the authorities in the castle. He learns that the person of
importance is the Chief caned <span class=SpellE>Klamm</span>; he tries to get
in touch with this official and gets involved in a love affair with <span
class=SpellE>Klamm’s</span> mistress Frieda, but this also comes to nothing. To
keep himself going he has to accept a job as janitor in the village school and
that also ends in a fiasco as his two assistants Arthur and Jeremiah create a
good deal of confusion. In the meanwhile the two assistants make themselves
such a nuisance that K gets rid of them and it results finally in his losing
Frieda to Jeremiah. It is his constant striving for an audience with the
officials of the castle and his apparent neglect of Frieda <span class=GramE>that
results</span> in this end. By constantly directing his gaze on the
unachievable he is deprived of all that is within his reach. The striving for
the infinite leaves all material possibilities unfulfilled. This view of Kafka
is very similar to the idea of the existentialist Philosopher <span
class=SpellE>Soren</span> <span class=SpellE>Kierk­gard</span> whom he admired
so much. Objectively, eternal truth can never be grasped; it always lies in
uncertainty when approached in this manner. So, a man who seeks for truth has
to do so subject­ively and thereby he estranges himself from the normal human
relationship, for example <span class=SpellE>K’s</span> alienation from Frieda.
As in <i>The Trial </i>Joseph K is summoned because he did not seek the Truth;
in <i>The Castle </i>K starts out in quest of the truth and finally turns out
to be incapable of his venture. The heroes of both the novels are
intellectuals, and life ends on a note of <span class=SpellE>unfulfilment</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his nephew. The Senator takes Karl to his home and the Stoker’s <span

home of his uncle Karl is kept more or less under house arrest. The uncle casts
him off however, when one day he disobeys orders and visits a friend of his
uncle. He starts work as a lift boy in a hotel but he is dismissed. After
various adventures in the glamour world of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place

happiness in “The Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, where all workless people find
peace. In spite of all these experiences and confusion in the labyrinths of a
wicked city life, Karl remains innocent and good. Karl wants to progress beyond
his start, and his plans for the future always play an important part in his
life. He has all the opportunities before him but he never develops; his
character is such that it does not permit growth. The whole problem is an
attempt to adapt the individual with the world, and no matter how he tries Karl
is rejected again and again when be finally finds peace in “The Nature Theatre
of Oklahoma”, where the ego is preserved against forlornness and isolation in a
vast world. Thus neither in <i>The Trial, <span class=GramE>The</span> Castle </i>or

individual in the world </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
relationship to truth and the ultimate reality–the problem of bringing the
spiritual and material together without injuring their essentially
contradictory natures. In all these novels the influence of <span class=SpellE>Kierkegard</span>

The sense of isolation, persecution, fear and the son-father conflict are very

impossible for him to continue to work and live in society in the normal
manner. When his parents go into his bedroom and see his transformed state they
are thrown into a panic and are horrified. His mother and sister start weeping,
but his father in great disgust drives him back into the room with a stick. He
is kept locked in his room and his sister brings him food regularly. One day he
manages to escape into the living room while his sister is cleaning his room

intention of killing him. The mother intervenes and implores the father not to kill

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>life
and society finally find a complete expression in his “Investigations of a Dog,”
and “The Burrow.” One can see in the “Investigations of a dog” a similarity
with <span class=SpellE>Kierkegard’s</span> ideas of subjectivity. The dog has
no inner paradoxical connection, but he is interested in the immediate. Though
in this story there is a note of redemption it does not reach <span
class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>. Kafka’s own strivings for the fundamental
experience are translated into the experiences of the dog. In the story called “The
Burrow”, the narrator is a lonely nervous animal, and it lives in a burrow
which consists of complex passages and <span class=SpellE>defence</span> spots.
The Burrow begins where <i>The Castle </i>ends. One day the animal hears a
noise that seems to come from an enemy invading his home, and all its <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> measures seem to be useless against this unknown
enemy. The story ends with a description of this situation. The burrow
symbolizes an achieved security in the world, and this security is checkmated
by the final threat namely death. The carefully built-up structures seem of no
value when faced with the final act. This story is something like a terminus in
Kafka’s creative development, as it is the last work he wrote before his death.

confirm the fact that Kafka was a psychological case and that his works were
the products of his diseased personality; nor can we say that his mentality was
so distorted and contradictory that he was incapable of the <span class=SpellE>commensense</span>
of everyday life. There is no doubt that there were certain defects in the
personality of Kafka and that the sense of <span class=SpellE>unfulfilment</span>
in his life was largely responsible for some of his dominant ideas. In a
certain sense, we have to admit that Kafka’s works had for him primarily a
therapeutic function, a medium through which he relieved the tension in his
life. The <span class=GramE>dilemma</span> with which his characters are faced
are in actuality the problem that confronted him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

simplest answer to the problem of Kafka would be to say that his works are the
ravings of a psychologically unstable character. He himself has classified his
works as an “attempt at flight from father”. In his letter to his father he
writes, “You were the subject of my books. In them I poured out the sorrows
that I could not pour out on your breast. My writing has been a purposely drawn
out parting from you. There is no doubt that Kafka did undergo an emotional
suppression and the result was an introspective attitude, isolation from
society and a ceaseless analysis of his own actions and motives. The view that
Edwin Muir has about the works of Kafka seems to be the most illu­minating idea
that we can consider.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

will of heavenly powers”.<sup> 6</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

are always two courses in life: one is to adapt oneself to the community and
its values and to integrate oneself into its conventional pattern; the other is
to reject life because of its blind conventions and live according to standards
that conform to spiritual life. Kafka had neither the courage to completely
reject the first course or the strength to plunge into the second–his dilemma
is the dilemma of modern existence. Kafka’s novels are studies of individuals
who long for a proper place in the community, but can never find their allotted
positions. Kafka is in reality concerned with an external problem–life and
society in a changing world in which traditions and customs have lost their
significance. People today are going through a period of unusual instability
and anxiety to solve the problem but that he has been able to realize it; and
give artistic expression to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

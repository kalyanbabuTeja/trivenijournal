October, in accordance with the Prime Minister’s announcement of the 25th of
March. Sri C. M. Trivedi, the Governor-designate, is now functioning as a
Special Officer for Andhra Affairs, assisted by a committee of party leaders.
The attempt to revise the decision of the Andhra members of the Madras
Legislative Assembly to locate the temporary capital at Kurnool has not
succeeded, except to the limited extent of eliciting pronouncements from the
Prime Minister and the Home Minister that, after the 1st of October, it would
be open to the new Legislative Assembly to resolve to shift the capital. To any
one who is not obsessed by local patriotism, and is at the same time aware of
the comparative unimportance of the issue of a temporary capital, the amount of
bitterness generated by this controversy must appear startling. The democratic
parties came to an understanding about <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kurnool</st1:place></st1:City>,
because they were anxious to respect the provisions of the Sree Baug Pact and
thereby to placate the sentiment of the people of Rayalaseema. That it was a
political decision cannot be denied. But it is cruel to attribute improper
motives to the leaders, or to predict ruin for the new State merely because of
the choice of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kurnool</st1:place></st1:City>.
As in the case of every new State, some inconvenience has to be faced in the
initial stages. If the Andhras can sink their differences on this particular
question and allow the Cabinet to function from Kurnool for two or three years,
some degree of peace and stability attained, permitting the administration to
devote its attention to the task of building up Andhra as a prosperous and
well-oriented State, till such time as Visala-Andhra becomes a reality with
Hyderabad as its capital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the end of a forty-years’ struggle, the Andhras are having a State of their own
with freedom to develop a homogeneous unit, based primarily on language but
satisfying other important tests like that of contiguity, historic growth, and
cultural heritage. Andhra was never envisaged as an independent sovereign State
cut off from the parent stock. The sponsors of the Andhra movement, who held
their first Conference at Bapatla in 1913 under the presidentship of the late
Sir B.N. Sarma, were far-seeing statesmen and patriots. The free <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> of their dreams was a Federation in which
sister Provinces like Karnataka, Maharashtra or Utkal were to take their due
places and vie with one another in contributing to the sum-total of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
achievement in all spheres of activity. They were aware that, between any two
Provinces, there were bound to be bilingual border areas where the two
languages must be given equal status in administration and education. Dr.
Pattabhi Sitaramayya hoped that such border areas would serve as the hyphens
that connect and not as the dashes that divide.” If that hope has not so far
been realised, the reason lies in the continued denial of the demand for
reorganisation of the States. When the main demand is conceded and the new
States come into being, the rights of linguistic minorities can be safeguarded
on the lines indicated in the Constitution, and under the supervision of
officers deputed by the Central Government to each border area. These are
matters of administrative detail which do not vitiate the thesis of departed
patriarchs like Sri Venkatappayya and Sri Nageswara Rao, that the linguistic
redistribution of Indian Provinces was an inevitable step towards the
rediscovery of India’s soul, and for the harmonious development of Indian
political life and cultural activity in accordance with the Indian genius for
achieving unity in diversity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For some months the crisis developing in the
internal politics of Kashmir has been causing anxiety to those who hoped that a
similarity of aims and comradeship in a common endeavour would knit <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>
in closer bonds. The failure to implement the Delhi Agreement, the unfortunate
death in a prison-hospital of the heroic Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, and the
alarming statements of Sheikh Abdullah on the prospects of an independent <st1:place
w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>, created a tense situation. Even Pandit Nehru,
who treated the Kashmiri leader with affection and reposed implicit confidence
in him, was perturbed and obviously at a loss to divine the motives that
impelled a valued colleague to stray from the path of rectitude. The position
became intolerable, but <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> saved itself
through the prompt action of the young Yuvaraja Karan Singh, Head of the State,
and of Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, the new Prime Minister. The National Conference
as well as the Constituent Assembly were divided between rival factions, and
each of the factions sought to strengthen itself among the general public of
the State. Within the Cabinet itself there was a sharp division. Sheikh
Abdullah’s loyalty to the Indian Union, which rushed to his support in the dark
days of 1947, gradually changed into hostility. While he blamed the ‘communal’
elements in the Indian Union, he fostered the fanaticism of the Muslim
population in his own State, so as to create the requisite atmosphere for the
achievement of his private ambition. Deprived of office and kept in detention,
the Sheikh must now survey at leisure the history of the last six years, and
his own decline from the position of a national hero to that of a person
charged with corruption and the betrayal of the State’s interests.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While the frequent changes in the internal
administration of ‘Azad Kashmir’ passed unnoticed by the Government of India,
and by foreign powers, the recent change-over in Kashmir has created a furore
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Foreign influences, believed to have misguided Sheikh Abdullah, are now
actively engaged in spreading garbled versions of the happenings in Kashmir and
in blaming the Government of India for its alleged desire to grab <st1:place
w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. The Prime Minister of Pakistan came post-haste
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> to
discuss this and allied matters with Pandit Nehru. The previous meeting at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Karachi</st1:place></st1:City> created a
friendly atmosphere, and everyone hoped that, at long last, the two States
would settle their disputes and inaugurate an era of peace and progress. The
overthrow of Sheikh Abdullah ought not to make any difference, so far as the
settlement of outstanding issues between <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is concerned. Sheikh Abdullah was never a <i>persona grata </i>with the
architects of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or its present rulers. Accession to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> was not a part of his
programme. He was only toying with the idea of a division of the State and the
carving of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> into a small
independent unit. This brought him into conflict with a majority in the Cabinet
and in the Party. His failure to carry his colleagues with him affords
convincing proof of his waning influence. The new Prime Minister will seek and
obtain a vote of confidence, and proceed with the task of restoring internal
harmony and of putting down corruption and inefficiency in the administration.
To his banner must flock all those who do not swear by the discredited
two-nation theory and are pledged to the ideal of a secular State. And when a
plebiscite is held on the question of accession to <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the healthy, non-communal elements will find their voice, unstifled by the
tendentious propaganda of the Pakistan Press and of interested foreigners. The
assumption of power by Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed is likely to be the prelude to
friendlier relations with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span

repeated heart-attacks. He retired from the Presidentship of The Theosophical
Society last year, for he was nearly seventy-seven and felt too weak and tired
for the burdens of office. He was expecting to return to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> after a
tour in the West and settle down at Adyar. Adyar was always his spiritual home,
but he was not destined to revisit it. For fifty years he carried the message
of Theosophy to many lands, and delivered it in many languages. In speech as in
writing, he combined the precision of the scientist with the beauty of the artist.
Teacher and guide of students of religion everywhere, he was specially famed
for his exposition of the philosophy of the Beautiful and for his approach to
Reality through the adoration of Beauty, in nature and in life, in poetry and
in music. His sensitive soul reacted to all that was noble in human endeavour.
In his gracious presence one shed for the moment all the petty cares of the
individual life and sensed something of the life of the Spirit that pervades
the universe.</p>

me, the passing of this esteemed Elder Brother is fraught with intense pain. He

valued member of the Advisory Board, and during the many crises that marked the

These were bestowed in generous measure, for he seemed to perceive, more
clearly than I ever could, the value of the role which <i>Triveni </i>was
seeking to fulfill as a symbol of the Indian Renaissance. During his travels
abroad, he used to write to me and admonish me never to ‘deny the work’, and
whenever I paid my respects to him at Adyar, he made detailed enquiries about
the progress of the Journal, and poured forth strength to sustain me in my
long-drawn fight against adversity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

met him for the last time in March 1952. He invited me to a series of talks by
him, at the School of the Wisdom, to a group of earnest seekers in Adyar. That
was a great privilege extended to me, but he went a step further and insisted
on sending his car to fetch me from my hotel to Adyar on three successive
Wednesday mornings. Those were unforgettable days when I reaped the reward of
my continued devotion to the cause of culture. Indeed, what greater reward
could a struggling journalist desire than the approbation and the companionship
of a savant like Sri C. Jinarajadasa?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a distinguished member of that fraternity. When the Liberal Party came into
being on the eve of the inauguration of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, it was,
led by V. S. Srinivasa Sastri and P. S. Sivaswamy Aiyar, and these stalwarts
found in T. R. Venkatarama Sastri an able and well-in- formed co-adjutor. The
philosophy of Liberalism which the Indian Liberals owed to the Gladstone-Bright
tradition in British political life, came into acute conflict with the Gandhian
view of the Indo-British relationship. Non-co-operation, civil disobedience,
the ‘Quit India’ programme, and the long<i> </i>series of campaigns for the
winning of freedom through ‘unconstitutional’ though peaceful means, widened
the gulf between the Congress led by Gandhiji and the Liberals who were pledged
to normal, constitutional methods of agitation. But between them and Gandhiji
there was not the slightest trace of personal ill-feeling. In fact, the
brotherly affection subsisting between Gandhiji and Srinivasa Sastri was an
object lesson to smaller men on either side. It is important to recall in this
connection that Srinivasa Sastri and Venkatarama Sastri were life-long friends
and inseparable companions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 w:st="on">Letters</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, regional boundaries cannot
always prove quite effective against the dissemination of ideas from one
country to another. Lucky it is for us that it should be so. For, otherwise, no
modern literature in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in whatever language, would be what it is today. What is true of other
literatures, is equally, or even more, true of Telugu literature. The Telugus,
as a class, had hardly ever believed in the cult of cultural self-sufficiency.
Tendencies towards purism, often politically motivated, seem, therefore, to
have had no great attraction for them. A sort of spiritual cosmopolitanism has,
for long, been a marked characteristic of their social attitude. Sanskrit
poetry, Marathi drama, Bengali novel, not to speak of English criticism and
Russian thinking, in more recent times, have been there in the making of the
Andhra intellectual. He has taken them all, and more, in his stride, and has
never fought shy of acknowledging his debt to them. This has resulted in the
fact that Telugu literature can claim a high degree of variety and flexibility.
But the sudden enthusiasm of the Andhra for something or the other, off and on,
has also had the effect of leading him sometimes to an equally sudden
disillusionment, which may be inevitable, and <span class=GramE>even</span> a
general attitude of <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span> and cynicism in the
end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
discussing the history of prose fiction, it is well to remember that the novel,
as an art form, is of a comparatively recent origin in Telugu, as in almost all
the Indian languages, for that matter. Despite the patriotic propensity, of the
tradition-bound scholars to hark back to the hoary past of <span class=SpellE><i>Panchatantra</i></span>
and <span class=SpellE><i>Kathaa</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>sarit</span> <span
class=SpellE>Saagara</span></i>, the Telugu novel, as a distinct and <span
class=SpellE>recognisable</span> literary form, is less than a century old. The
great pioneers in this field were not ashamed to acknowledge their debt to the
English masters, to whom they were introduced in the latter half of the
nineteenth century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and large, the influence of English fiction in particular and of English
literature in general (and of Western literature, as a whole, through the
English medium) could be studied in three stages, for the sake of convenience,
rather than of anything else. The first was that of <i>form</i> and <i>structure</i>
(which we could see in the works of <span class=SpellE>Kandukuri</span> <span
class=SpellE>Veeresalingam</span>, <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarti</span>
Lakshmi <span class=SpellE>Narasimham</span> and the other pioneers). The
second was that of <i>approach and ideas</i>, as also of technique to some
extent, (as could be seen in the works of <span class=SpellE>Unnava</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Chalam</span> and others including <span class=SpellE>Kutumba</span>
Rao, for instance). The third is an <i>all-pervasive influence covering all
aspects, including incidents and <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span>,
language, idiom usage and the rest</i>. This, in turn, could easily be <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> in the works of a whole generation of
contemporary writers, from a man of such undoubted talent as <span
class=SpellE>Butchi</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>, to many, who are
lucky enough in having managed to become the current coin in Telugu fiction.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the first category falls <span class=SpellE>Veeresalingam’s</span> <span
class=SpellE>Rajasekhara</span> <span class=SpellE>Charitram</span> (published
in 1872) which is popularly accepted as the first Telugu novel-certainly in the
sense in which we understand the term, now-a-days. This position might well be
challenged by some of the redoubtable research scholars. But, then, there is
pretty little on this earth, which is left unchallenged by them. Questions of
chronological precedence apart, there could be little doubt about the fact that
<span class=SpellE><i>Rajasekhara</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Charitram</span>
</i>is a work of great literary distinction and had stood the test of time. It
continues to be readable enough to this day (for those who can follow a fairly
simple <span class=SpellE><i>graanthika</i></span> style). Anyway, it is still
remembered (not merely for purposes of literary history), as it deserves to be,
while many others are forgotten. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the author’s own admission, it was inspired by the model of Goldsmith’s
celebrated novel, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. But, it was far from being a
mere translation or even a narrow adaptation of the English classic. Except for
a general similarity in the basic traits of a few characters and in the
occurrence of one or two incidents, there was not much in common between the
two novels. Both of them could, of course, be described as “sentimental <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the realistic school, though. In both of them runs an undercurrent of
idealism and the authors are anxious to reassure themselves and their readers
of the ultimate triumph of good over evil and of the straight path of honesty
and good conduct over the crooked ways of intrigue and treachery. Dr Primrose
and <span class=SpellE>Rajasekhara</span>, simple, open-hearted and well-meaning
souls both, are rewarded by success and fortune in the end, after a series of
reverses caused by their own gullibility and the cheating by the evil-doers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
<span class=SpellE>Rajasekhara</span> <span class=SpellE>Charitram</span> was,
otherwise, an original work, in its own right, was amply demonstrated (if
demonstration was at all needed) when it was brought out in an English
translation by the Rev. Mr. T. R. Hutchinson, under the title <i>Fortune’s
Wheel</i>. <i>The Times </i>(<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>)
observed that “….the pictures of Hindu domestic life, religious ideas, mode of
worship and superstitions and the condition of women, with denial of all rights
of choice in marriage, are so well-drawn and illustrated that the book will
have a charm for all readers.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
novel, if it be anything,” observes George <span class=GramE>Moore,</span> “is
contemporary history, an exact and complete reproduction of the social
surroundings of the age we live in.” By this standard, <span class=SpellE><i>Rajasekhara</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Charitram</span> </i>is given a high place for the vivid
light it throws on contemporary Andhra–with particular reference to the <span
class=SpellE>upperclass</span> Brahmin families in the <st1:place w:st="on">Godavari</st1:place>
delta area. From the traditional preoccupation with mythology, legend and high
romance, among the earlier writers, we come down here to social life in all its
realism. The prince of noble birth, so familiar to the <i>Prabandha</i>
readers, has given place here to the average house-holder. Man’s relations with
other men are depicted here as such, needing no incredible miracles to
intercede for salvaging him from desperate situations. The good man suffers, no
doubt, not from the wrath of some capricious god or holy, ill-tempered sage,
but for his own inherent weaknesses–mainly in the shape of vulnerability to
flattery and propensity to live beyond his means for love of ostentation. All
this change in <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span> is mainly a result of
the influence of the realism of English fiction. The good man comes through the
ordeal in fairly good shape, because it was the author’s unshakable belief,
based on a mixture of Western humanism and Indian theism, that virtue was bound
to win in the end, if Providence was just, as it was known to be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lakshmi <span class=SpellE>Narasimham</span>, who was a close disciple of <span
class=SpellE>Veeresalingam</span> in more ways than one, went on record that he
had learnt the art of novel-writing from a reading of the latter’s <span
class=SpellE><i>Rajasekhara</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Charitram</span></i>.”
Maybe, there was some grain of truth in this, when we take into account the
basic social theme and the general contemporary <span class=GramE>background,
that</span> his <span class=SpellE><i>Ramachandra</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Vijayam</span> </i>shares with <span class=SpellE><i>Rajasekhara</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Charitram</span>.</i> The story of <span class=SpellE>Ramachandra</span>,
a poor boy who makes good and marries a rich man’s daughter, follows the
pattern rather of the Dickens novels, like David Copperfield, Oliver Twist and
Nicholas <span class=SpellE>Nickleby</span>, in which the hero ends up by
marrying the master’s daughter. But many of the other <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarti</span>
novels could be seen to have had quite a different inspiration, altogether.
They were historical romances, based on the novels of <span class=SpellE>Medows</span>
Taylor <span class=SpellE>centring</span> on the life and adventures of <span
class=SpellE>Tippu</span> Sultan, Tara, <span class=SpellE>Chand</span> <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
element of historicity involved in the works of <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarti</span>
or even those of <span class=SpellE>Medows</span> Taylor, for that matter,
might only be marginal in character, mainly in the names of characters, locale
and outline of important events. Both the authors might well have drawn on
their fertile imagination and exploited their innate flair for picturesque
description. Sometimes described as “the Andhra Scott,” mainly for the purple
passages of elaborate description, <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarti</span> can
hardly be credited with the historical scholarship and direct knowledge of the
locale, which were the strong points of Sir Walter Scott. He was mainly a poet
and playwright of the traditional <span class=GramE>type,</span> and it may not
be fair, on our part, to compare him to a writer of a different intellectual
equipment and expect a different quality of novel from him. Dr K. <span
class=SpellE>Virabhadra</span> Rao, who had done some research work on the
subject, locates whole paragraphs and chapters in which <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarti</span>
closely, and even mechanically, follows in the footsteps of (<span
class=SpellE>Medows</span>) Taylor, in his novels, <span class=SpellE><i>Hemalata</i></span>
and <span class=SpellE><i>Ahalya</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Bai</span></i>.
Shades of the villains in Scott and Shakespeare are also found in <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similar
could be the experience of scholars who might have the time and the patience to
go through the other Telugu novels of the period (especially the late Nineties
of the last century). The titles themselves go to show this. The endings, ‘<span
class=SpellE><i>Charitra</i></span><i>’</i>, ‘<span class=SpellE><i>Vijayam</i></span><i>’</i>,
‘<span class=SpellE><i>Vilaasam</i></span>,’, etc., are possibly borrowed from
“The Story of so and so”, “The History of Tom Jones”, “Joseph Andrews”, “The
History of Henry <span class=SpellE>Esmond</span> Esquire”, etc., by Fielding,
Thackeray and other English novelists of the 18th and 19th centuries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Paradoxical
it may sound when we are told that one of the most significant (and, to my
mind, original), of Telugu novels produced in the first quarter of this century
is woven on the pattern of a well-known English novel of the 19th century. I am
thinking of <span class=SpellE>Maalapalli</span> by <span class=SpellE>Unnava</span>
<span class=SpellE>Lakshminarayana</span>, parts of which are said to be
closely adapted from Mrs. Henry Wood’s <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Eastlynne</i></span>. No Telugu reader would <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
this, if he were not already told about it. Nor does he enjoy it a whit less,
in the reading of it, even after this knowledge. But partly because of this,
this Telugu novel, which is a classic of country life in Andhra, might have
missed the chance of being taken up for translation in the UNESCO series being
made available to all the major languages of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

one particular chapter, might have owed much to the English novel, the better
part of <span class=SpellE>Maalapalli</span> could not be considered as
anything but an entirely original work. Even if we are to forget the story of
the good man (Rama <span class=SpellE>Naidu</span>) and his credulous and
wayward wife, who comes to a sorry pass, there is a lot in the book that is
worth remembering for a long time. The accurate and sensitive cameos of rustic
life in the <span class=SpellE>Guntur</span> District, that fill this book,
have not been paralleled since. Nor are the heights of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
idealism, traced back to the native Hindu tradition of Ramanuja and the philosophy
of the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bhagavadgita</i></span>,
easily touched by many others, with no credibility gap left yawning in the
process. And the Telugu idiom, with its genuine local ring, reminiscent of the
native woodnotes wild, is hard to come by in the common run of prose-writers
during the last four to five decades. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Gudipati</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkatachalam</span>, to give
the full name) is too much of an individualist to be classed together with any
other Telugu novelist. But as an unrivalled master of social realism, one is
persuaded to put him close to <span class=SpellE>Unnava</span>, despite their
obvious differences of approach and outlook. <span class=SpellE>Chalam’s</span>
realism is <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrentian</i></span>
in its poignancy and power, while <span class=SpellE>Unnava’s</span> realism is
almost <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tolstoyian</i></span>
in its <span class=SpellE>tranquillity</span> and grandeur. He might have been
deeply influenced by the powerful stories of Guy De Maupassant. He might also
have the incurable habit of interspersing his Telugu sentences with English
expressions, understood in the typically Andhra way rather than in the English
way. Queen’s English is not by any means the Yardstick to be used for measuring
<span class=SpellE>Chalam</span>. But one thing is certain. By a process of
trial and error, as it were, he has evolved a vigorous prose style of his own,
intensely evocative and invariably suggestive. It has a strange power and
beauty, even if it cannot be conceded that rare merit of linguistic virtuosity.

individualism in the tireless quest for liberty has a family likeness to the
social philosophy of the English anarchists, rather than to the impulse of the
social reformers the world over, who believe in collective action and

major significance, three or four names compel attention as much for the way in
which they have been able to absorb Western and world influences as for their
intrinsic merit as writers. They are Messrs. <span class=SpellE>Kodavatiganti</span>
<span class=SpellE>Kutumba</span> Rao, T. <span class=SpellE>Gopichand</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Butchi</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Rachakonda</span> Viswanatha Sastri. Apart from being the most
prolific of them, <span class=SpellE>Kutumba</span> Rao is also the hardest to
put in a pigeonhole. He is a Marxist without being a Communist and a
Progressive without being too much of an Idealist. He has made a happy amalgam
of what he found acceptable in social realism, as well as socialist realism.
There is in him something of the same sureness of observations and accuracy of
detail, as also a conscious striving for simplicity, as in Maxim Gorky. His
prose style was once described by the present writer, with no offence meant, as
being “<span class=SpellE>sterilised</span>.” But, it has also the quality of
distilled water – hygienic and satisfying, though apparently <span
class=SpellE>colourless</span>, tasteless and <span class=SpellE>odourless</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Gopichand</span> had exposed himself to the winds of Western
philosophy, as could be seen in the studies in the human mind, provided in his
novels. <span class=GramE>(<span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

narrative technique, he might have benefited from a study of the stories and
novels of H. E. Bates. His language is, however, his own. Successful
experiments in <span class=SpellE>Wodehousean</span> <span class=SpellE>humour</span>
are made by Mr. <span class=SpellE>Palagummi</span> <span class=SpellE>Padmaraju</span>

disillusionment. A little of the amusingly cynical attitude to life in general
and the almost clinical observation of the foibles of human character are in
evidence here, strongly reminiscent of Somerset Maugham, of whom <span

admirer. The stream-of-consciousness technique, perfected in the hands of James
Joyce and Virginia <span class=SpellE>Woolf</span>, and shades of the
Existentialist philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre, are adapted with unerring skill
by <span class=SpellE>Rachakonda</span> Viswanatha Sastri who achieves the
maximum of effect in the minimum of words. While his angle of vision is
surprisingly new for the traditional reader of Telugu action, his idiom
combines a refreshing simplicity with a delightful novelty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

quite rich in fiction, the novel as well as the short-story. If women-writers
seem to dominate it, irrespective of the statistics, it is not without reason.
In discussing “aspects of the novel,” in his Clark Lectures at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cambridge</st1:place></st1:City>, E. M. Forster tries to give all
possible answers to the question: “What does a novel do?” His own preference
(as well as personal identification) is expressed in the cryptic words: “Yes–oh
dear, yes–the novel tells a story.” And women-novelists in Telugu, by and
large, know how to tell a story. They also take care to weave the story around
a theme that they know quite well. As for the influences, Indian or English,
the important thing is what they are able to do with them. Some of them, whom
the present writer finds more acceptable, are fairly integrated in themselves
and unpretentious about their work. They had probably digested what they had
consumed and the benefits of the influences, external or internal, had got into
their bloodstream. And their work is marked by poise and judgment, and
therefore, remains memorable for the reader. One of the names that <span
class=GramE>comes</span> readily to my mind is that of <span class=SpellE>Dwivedula</span>
<span class=SpellE>Visalakshi</span>. She never tries to bite off more than she
could possibly chew, in choosing her subject matter. And she does a competent
job, always trying to see that the story is more important than the
story-teller. She has a sense of style and pays attention to workmanship. I
dare say there are quite a few others, equally good perhaps, maybe even better,
whom I have not been able to read at the same length, and with equal care. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not however, one of women or men writers. Nor is it a question of foreign influence
or Indian influence or no influence at all, except their own. We all tend
unconsciously to imitate what we insensately admire. There is no dearth of
talent among the younger generation of contemporary novelists-women as well as
men. But one could do with a little more of intellectual discipline and
personal integration. A few are always busy dazzling their readers with their
flashes of verbal wit, as long lost shadows of Oscar Wilde. A few others are
never tired of being slick and smart, but cannot help showing themselves up as
superficial and unsteady. The characters are bodily transported from the latest
English, American or continental novel in translation. They talk in Telugu, no
doubt, but they talk a language, which cannot be understood by the Telugu
reader unfamiliar with the latest in English fiction. A character in a recent
nove1 (published in the popular pocketbook series) is described as follows:
“For want of the speaking habit, he has got used to speaking Telugu like Hindi,
and Hindi like Punjabi. “ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of some of the novelists themselves–the apparently smarter among them, at any
rate. But luckily for us, they are the exceptions rather than the rule. The
best of them cannot overlook the need for digesting the material at their
disposal, and <span class=SpellE>harmonising</span> the influences from afar
with the experiences nearer home. The problem of matching form and content is a
perpetual one and each generation strives to solve it in its own way. And out
of this ceaseless striving we could look forward to a great novel, as well as
some good novels, not to speak of a great many popular ones from time to time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

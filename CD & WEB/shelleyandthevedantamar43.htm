<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Shelley and the Vedanta</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">BY DIWAN BAHADUR T. BHUJANGA RAO</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stopford Brooke describes the philosophy of Shelley as "idealistic, pantheism". It resembles the <I>Vedanta </I>so much that a discussion of how Shelley arrived at his philosophy may be interesting. But it may at once be said that Shelley was not like Emerson, for example, a student of Indian philosophy. Shelley’s philosophy was merely a reaction from the Calvinistic theology that prevailed in his time. Stopford Brooke refers to that theology in one place in his writings as a "dreadful theology" Whether the description is fully justified or not, there can be no doubt that Shelley believed the theology to be dreadful. Shelley chose for attack three principal dogmas of the Calvinistic creed (as he understood it); and it is in reaction from those doctrines that he developed his own philosophy, (in so far as the intuitions of a poet may be described as his philosophy).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first dogma attacked by Shelley was the doctrine of a "jealous", anthropomorphic deity, hurling thunderbolts from the skies and ordaining the "reprobation" of the greater part of mankind. Shelley revolted from the conception and described the Calvinistic God as a Moloch of vindictiveness: -</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Queen Mab</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next dogma was the doctrine of an eternal hell. Shelley rejected it and pronounced the horrors of hell to be but figments of theological invention: -</P><DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Queen Mab</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third dogma was the doctrine of Original Sin, the doctrine which, in the words of Stopford Brooke, "stains the child with evil from its birth and brings it into the world as the child of the devil". Shelley treated this doctrine with scorn and proclaimed that the soul was untainted with sin: -</P><DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">III</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reaction from the conception of a "jealous", anthropomorphic Deity, sitting high in the heavens, Shelley conceived of God as the Eternal Love pervading and animating creation. In this he was not alone. The barren deism of the 18th century, and the revival of Calvinism in the early years of the 19th century, made other poets in England, such as Wordsworth, seek for God in Nature and in Man, Wordsworth spoke of his feeling</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Tintern Abbey Revisited</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shelley felt this sense in an acuter way. He could acknowledge fraternity with the elemental Beings of Earth and Air and Ocean and proclaim that they participate equally with man in the Divine life. </P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To Shelley, the whole world, with its trees and rivers and lakes and mountains, was a manifestation of the Divine Life and an attestation to the Divine Love:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Adonais</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deity was, to Shelley, often the Spirit of Love with whom he could commune:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thou art the wine whose drunkenness is all</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Prince Athanase</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deity was also the Spirit of Beauty whom he addressed thus:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But though often the Deity to Shelley was impersonal, the personal aspect of God was not absolutely excluded. For Shelley could also write:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">IV</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reaction from the Calvinistic doctrine of an eternal hell and of everlasting damnation for the greater portion of mankind, Shelley propounded the doctrine of what may be called Life-in-Death or Salvation-in-Death. Shelley was an ardent student of Plato. Plato not merely held that the world is a scene of misery and illusion but that, to use the words of Walter Peter, "for the soul to have come into a human body at all was the seed of disease in it, the beginning of its own proper death". Shelley imbibed these ideas and declared that human life was a dim, vast vale of tears and illusion:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This life</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of error and ignorance and strife</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where nothing is but all things seem </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And we the shadows of a dream.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Sensitive Plant</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shelley at times soared into the highest flights idealism and found the world to be an unsubstantial pageant and ‘such stuff as dreams are made on’: </P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of suns, and worlds and men and beasts and flowers,</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is but a vision: all that it inherits</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are motes of a sick eye, bubbles and dreams.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Hellas</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But to Shelley the escape from this vale of misery was through Death:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Death is a gate of deariness and gloom</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That leads to azure isles and beaming skies,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And happy regions of eternal hope </P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Queen Mab</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shelley held that the period of man’s stay in this world was a period when his heavenly radiance was dimmed by the vapours of mortal life but that the mystagogue of Death would transport man to his true realm:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stains the white radiance of eternity,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Till Death tramples it to fragments.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Adonais</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that Shelley did not live long enough to study Indian philosophy, with its teaching of the evolution of the ordinary human soul though a series of incarnates in this world and of the advanced soul through a series of stages in the other worlds. The Greeks, no doubt, often referred to the theory of re-incarnation, but they more or less played with that doctrine. Shelley, too, played with that theory as a fancy, as for, example, in his poem. "<I>With a Guitar, to Jane</I>." But there is nothing to show that Shelley held the theory of re-incarnation seriously. The result has been that, while his theory of Salvation-in-Death may be true of the most perfect saints (called <I>Jeevanmuktas </I>in India), it is not easy to accept it as true of all mankind. Between the perfectibility of man and his actual perfection Shelley’s idealism could see no distinction.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">V</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last dogma of Calvinism attacked by Shelley was the dogma of Original Sin. This dogma took no account of the innate divinity in man. But, modifying so as to suit the requirements of pantheism the doctrine of Love expounded by Plato in the dialogues of the <I>Symposium </I>and <I>Pheedrus</I>, Shelley advanced the counter doctrine of what may be called the divinity of man. He maintained that far from being tainted with sin from the hour of its birth, the soul of man is a portion of the being of God, a spark from the Dive Fire:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">O’er the grey rocks, blue waves, and forests green.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Epipsychidion</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Combining this belief with his doctrine of Life-in-Death, Shelley declared that after death the soul awakes to a consciousness of its native dignity and dwells in an everlasting union of love and bliss with the eternal God:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pure spirit shall flow</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Back to the burning fountain whence it came,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A portion of the Eternal, which must glow</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through time and change, unquenchably the same.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Adonais</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shelley therefore asserted with jubilant enthusiasm that, disburdened of its corporeal frame, the soul of Keats was merged in the glory of the Divine:</P><DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is made one with Nature. There is heard</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is a presence to be felt and known</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spreading itself to where’er that Power may move</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which has withdrawn his being to its own.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(<I>Adonais</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, so strong was Shelley’s faith in the high destiny of man to partake in the Being of God that he claimed that he himself would realise the consummation designed for all the world:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which, through the web of being blindly wove</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fire for which all thirst, now beams on me,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consuming the last clouds of mortality.</P></DIR>

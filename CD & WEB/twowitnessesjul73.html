the evidence for the petitioner was over, the respondent went into the witness
box. She deposed that neither in the presence of any of the petitioner’s
witnesses, nor in the presence of any God or devil did her marriage take place
with the petitioner or any other person. She was not married at all. She didn’t
know the petitioner. Except in this case she didn’t ever see him before. She
never lived with him. She was kept by Mr. So-and-so, a merchant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

other defence witnesses deposed that the respondent had been known to them
since her childhood. She never married anybody. She had no need to marry at
all. Since she came of age, that is, for the last three years, she had been
kept by Mr. So-and-so, a merchant. The respondent who had been happy under the
care and support of the merchant would never need to marry a fit-for nothing
fellow like the petitioner. She conceived during her liaison with the merchant.
She recently gave birth to a son. Such was the trend of the evidence on behalf
of respondent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seems that the merchant went to the United Kingdom. He would proceed to the
States. It was not known when he would be back. The respondent, it seems, was
not possessed of sufficient funds to have him examined on commission. So
without waiting for the merchant to return, the court heard the case, recorded
evidence and heard arguments. Sometime later the judgment was delivered. The
following were the salient features of the lengthy judgment pronounced by the
court: “The facts of the case are, the petitioner has laid the action alleging
that the respondent is his wife, that she deserted him without any reason one
month before the filing of the petition, and that she should come and live with
him and for a declaration that the respondent is his wife and to direct her to
come to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

also have deposed to the same effect. It has been put forward by the defence
that even prior to the alleged marriage took place, the respondent had been
kept by somebody. The person who had kept her didn’t come forward as a witness.
There is unimpeachable evidence on behalf of the petitioner to prove the
positive fact that marriage took place. About the negative fact that the
marriage didn’t take place, there is no clinching evidence. The respondent’s
witnesses wouldn’t be with her all the twenty-four hours to see if she has
married or not married in a temple any night. Moreover, while there are so many
women in the world why would the petitioner say that he had married this
particular respondent unless he had, in fact, married her? On a careful

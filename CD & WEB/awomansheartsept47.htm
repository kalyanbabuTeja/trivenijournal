<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sivapura is like any one of a hundred villages in
the south-west of Mysore. It is situated in a flat expanse of cotton soil, very
black and dry in summer, very green and miry during the monsoon, with a narrow
cart-track leading from the Taluk road to a clump of trees which shelter the
village, and relieves the blackness of the summer landscape. The track, after
running on the boundary of the village pond, skirts the temple grove and
becomes the main street. The approach to Sivapura is not without a simple
charm, which went to the heart of Rudrappa, student of the Bombay College of
Medicine, returning home for the holidays after a year’s absence. As Rudrappa
walked on the bund of the pond, young women who had come for water smiled
welcome at him, shy or frank according to age and temperament and gave him a
thrill of home feeling. It was the hour of worship in the Basavesvara temple,
and the bells pealed out as he passed the grove, seeming to greet him with augury
of good. He saw the old <i>jangam </i>Sidda Devaru tending his little flower
garden where, with great care, he could hardly save a handful of blossoms for
worship from the flower-loving little girls of Sivapura. Rudra touched the
hermit’s feet, for his twelve months’ life in Bombay had not quite obliterated
his long habit of reverence for the <i>sanyasi</i>.</p>

You know he is conceited like most Brahmins. When I asked him about the sea, he
repeated some <i>mantra</i>,<sup>l</sup> which he said was the <i>Ramayana</i>,
and meant ‘the sea is like the sea; the sky is like the sky’, which, though no
doubt quite correct, did not seem to improve one’s knowledge very much. If he had
said ‘the sea is like the sky’, I might not have believed him, but still, it
would have been something to go upon.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rudra laughed, but the tears rose to his eyes. He said in gentle raillery, “Now
that you have cracked your finger joints and I am once more safe, let me get

considerable man in Sivapura, and its twelve hundred inhabitants looked up to
him as the leader and representative. He was always referred to as the Sahukar
(the rich man); calling him by name would have been unseemly familiarity. His
house was a big square building, solidly timbered, and finished with glistening
lime, till the walls shone like marble. There was a great open yard, in front,
lined with outhouses for cattle and carts, and a garage where a Ford car
carefully covered up with a tarpaulin was the wonder of the village, and its
pride. On the rare occasions when it was used, the starting of the engine by
pushing was an event of the first magnitude, which afforded the village as much
perspiring exhilaration as a car-festival. In the outhouses, reposing after a
life of decrepitude and decay, were palanquins, bullock coaches, victorias, and
dog-carts, which indicated that the family had been wealthy for generations and
Sivabasava Devaru was reckoned very wealthy, though there were people who shook
their heads and talked of speculations and mortgages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there. Parvatamma, Rudra’s mother, was a woman of forty-five inclining to
stoutness in her middle age, still handsome, but with large eyes, full lips,
and a look of lazy, condescending good nature. She wore a fine silk <i>sari </i>of
the best, and her face softened into real beauty as her son prostrated himself

sister, now dead some years, who after a brief married life with a poor
relation in a neighbouring village had been widowed, and had come with her only
child to live with her brother. Parvatamma, who had never approved of the
marriage, was not surprised at this termination of it. She received her
bereaved sister-in-law kindly enough, but with a degree of condescension that
must have been very oppressive to the poor lady. When a woman enters her
paternal or fraternal roof under circumstances of this kind, unless she is
possessed of superior wealth or influential connections, she soon becomes a
household drudge. Such was the position of Shanta’s mother when she died a few
years later, leaving Shanta a child of eight behind her in a world in which
herself had found so little happiness. Parvatamma, for all her superiority, had
a kind heart and she was far kinder to little Shanta than she had ever been to
her mother. It is said–whether truly or not, only women can say–that
mother-love, to attain perfection, requires a daughter, and Siva had denied her
that blessing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about,–that there should be no nonsense about Shanta ever becoming Rudra’s
wife. No doubt Shanta was a good girl, quite a pretty girl,–anybody could see
that,–and deserved a good husband; the Sahukar would see to it that one was
found for her whatever it cost. But Rudra–no. The boy belonged to a bigger
brighter world. He should take a wife from the greatest of his caste in the
world for which he was destined,–a princess would not be too good for him.
There were merchant princes among the Lingayats in Bombay and Madras. Rudra
would be carefully brought up and educated for a sphere very different from the
little village round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the circumstances of her life working on a sensitive nature, but they could at

side by side with Rudra who was come five years her senior in age, and it was
no wonder if the prince of the household, so brave, so strong, so clever, and
born to such a high destiny, became her hero. She never dared to think that
such as she could be a wife to him; she longed to be his humble foot-maid. She
entirely agreed with her aunt in her suppression of match-making gossip–but
latterly, she was, she knew not they, rather prone to burst into tears when she
was alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

turned away and some times burst into tears when questioned, as modest maidens
often do; but the Sahukar, and his wife, and Rudra himself approved of him.
Basappa himself approved of the girl, and fell in love with her, and spoke to

was one Lingappa Halabhavi, the eldest son of Dewan Bahadur Halabhavi, a
well-known figure in Bombay commercial circles and in the share market. Young
Halabhavi was a brilliant student, and with his prospects and social position,
a leader in college society. The young men were much together and Rudra, was a
frequent and welcome guest at the Halabhavis’ mansion on Malabar Hill, where he
made the acquaintance of his friend’s sister Sarojini, an undergraduate who was
studying for her degree. She was an accomplished young lady, and could not only
sing sweetly and play divinely on the violin, but had considerable taste and
knowledge in English and Sanskrit literature. She had that rare and fascinating
blend of Indian and European culture which seems to retain the best in each and
manifests itself in a combination of the delicacy of the East with the joyous
freedom of the West. She received Rudra with the frank kindness of a sister,
and he for his part fell deeply in love with her. He was so full of thoughts of
her that he could not keep from mentioning her in his letters to his father, a

poor Parvatamma was none too cheerful herself to have any cheerfulness to spare
for others. Then came bad news from Mysore. Shanta’s husband Basappa took his
bed with a carbuncle, and the doctors declared that he had been ill for a long
time without knowing it. Sivabasava Devaru hastened to Mysore but was only in
time to see Basappa die, and to administer his affairs. His houses went to his
brothers, and poor Shanta was left with her jewels and about ten thousand
rupees. She felt crushed by the blow, but resolute refused to return to
Sivapura, preferring to live in a small rented house in Mysore, in the front
part of which she set up a modest grocery store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

platform and took him to his room in the Empire Hotel. The day of arrival at
Bombay was spent in purchasing equipment to mask the rusticity of Sivabasava
Devaru; such as dhotis, silk shirts, and a Kashmir shawl. They refrained, by
mutual consent, from discussing the match, but that evening young Halabhavi was
introduced to the old gentleman, and they went round seeing the sights of the
city. The next day Sivabasava Devaru called on the elder Halabhavi, and was
received with great cordiality and distinction. It was obvious that stories,
probably overcharged, had reached Halabhavi about the Mysore man’s affluence;
he must have made enquiries of his own correspondents and Sivabasava Devaru had
the reputation of being rich.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

visit, Halabhav was not surprised, but careful. He received the proposal
courteously; he knew Rudra well and liked him very much, nay, loved him as a
son; but a marriage was a matter which required consideration. Sivabasava
Devaru, he knew, was a rich man and was of a highly respected family; but he
wanted to be sure that Rudra would be able to maintain his wife in the way to
which she was accustomed. For one thing, life in a village was out of the question.
As for city life, a doctor without European qualifications was no likely to
have much of a chance. He had made up his mind to send his own son to England
for training. Would Sivabasava Devaru do the same with Rudra? If that was
possible, and if Sivabasava Devaru could satisfy Halabhavi that the young
people could start life with adequate capital, he for his part would be only
too happy to form the connection. Of course, it was essential that the young
people should love one another, but this need be considered only after the
other conditions were satisfied. He did not press for an answer; he knew that
an answer required thought and a scrutiny of worldly affairs to assure oneself
of financial ability. Halabhavi was a man of the world,–polished, kind, but extremely
careful and prudent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

own wife would be very comfortable with her: he felt rather abashed and gross
in her presence himself. He unconsciously contrasted her with poor Shanta, so
shy, so timid and loving, and so solicitous of pleasing everyone at home; and
he sighed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sivabasava Devaru found that his son had set his
heart on going to England for completing his medical studies almost as
passionately as on making Sarojini his wife; in fact, it was to him the only
way of winning her. At Rudra’s age, and to one in his condition, making up one’s
mind seems the one thing necessary for achievement,–such small matters as
money, and the incidence of the proposed action on others, being mere
negligible details. Sivabasava Devaru was so wrapped up in his son that it is
to be feared that his own perspective was not dissimilar. Mr. Halabhavi was
very clear that though, of course, he recognised a moral engagement, he could
not agree to a marriage taking place before Rudra returned fully qualified and
was in a position to set up practice in suitable style. That would also give
Sarojini time to complete her studies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mood. The arrangement meant a good deal of money. Halabhavi had suggested the
desirability of at once setting apart a reserve of twenty thousand rupees,
invested in Government Bonds, as Rudra’s starting capital in life. The English
post-graduate course was three years at the least and would cost, all told,
about five thousand rupees a year. And then one had to provide also for
passage, equipment, and such contingencies (God forfend!) as ill-health. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is very different from that employed in towns and cities. And what seems very
large in the estimation of simple folk accustomed to penury may be nothing
considerable in a world of wants and ambitions. Sivabasava Devaru had land and
some money, which he was willing to lend cautiously on good security, and his
income, though large on the Sivapura scale, was inadequate to the requirements
of grandeur and foreign travel. He had had to borrow to find money for the
shares he had taken in the new mill, and again and again he felt the strain of
the premia he had to pay on a heavy life policy that the eloquence of an
enterprising agent had over persuaded him to take. The regular remittances to
Rudra at Bombay during the past five years were a drain which his finances felt
in more than one direction. The recent agricultural depression and the drop in
the prices of silk (Sivapura was in the heart of the mulberry country) had made
his collections scanty, and some of his investments doubtful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rudra to England only with great effort, and at considerable sacrifice. He
would have to realise his shares in the mill and sell some land to find money
for the Bonds. The suggestion about the Bonds had come from Halabhavi, and
Sivabasava Devaru felt that it was a considered test of his financial ability,
which had to be satisfied. He had many an anxious consultation with his wife. She
saw all the difficulties but had no helpful suggestion to make, and invariably
ended with tears and saying that they had but one son, and his happiness had to
be assured. As a matter of fact, there was nothing to consider, as was a
foregone conclusion that Rudra must go abroad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

result of the M.B.B.S. Degree examination. He was conscious of having done
creditably; he had put forth his best, feeling that not merely professional
success but happiness in life depended on his efforts. His father for the first
time discussed family finances with him. Hitherto Rudra had been permitted to
take the wherewithal of his education for granted. For the first time also,
Sivabasava Devaru felt a vague antagonism arising from a difference in points
of view, and relative values. The mother invariably took Rudra’s part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

announcing Rudra’s brilliant success in the examination. This, by some unknown
law of thought, seemed to dissolve all doubts based on arithmetic and prudent
considerations, and it was decided that Rudra should proceed to England. Then
followed a few weeks of busy correspondence, with British Academy and Medical
authorities, the High Commissioner for India, and other high functionaries
whose existence had never before been heard of in Sivapura. Rudra went to
Mysore, saw foreign-educated doctors of the medical service received
suggestions, hints, advice galore, and felt himself daily growing in interest
and importance. At Mysore, he called on Shanta and discussed prospects with
her. She was very glad–she repeated it several times–but tearful and rather
alarmed at Rudra’s having to reside in a far land for years. When he called on

relating to his father what happened at this second visit. “You know Gopalu,
the Shanbhog’s son who has started lawyering in Mysore. He has a nice office,
lined with swanky looking books, which might be carpenter- book-inder’s for all
the use he makes of them. Nice, retired, restful kind of place, that office,
for never a client comes there; Gopalu uses it mostly for smoking cigarettes
which he dare not do at home. I was put up in the office, when I called on
Shanta. I was told she was not at home but I was made welcome by that solemn
old sister-in-law of hers, who gave me cakes and sweetmeats and coffee, all
made in orthodox style,–that is, uneatable cakes, sticky sweets, and smoke
flavoured coffee. She did not know when Shanta would be returning; so after
waiting for half an hour, enlivened by authentic histories of Saivite saints, I
took my leave. Would you believe it, Shanta was in the backyard all the time,
for I am sure I caught a glimpse of her head over the wall as I was turning the
corner. Now, why should she do a thing like that? If she is too good to talk to
me, well, I don’t think I care.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

overcame all obstacles. Sivabasava Devaru raised money by selling his shares in
the mill, a house in Mysore and several acres of land, and invested a part of
the proceeds in Government Bonds, and deposited the rest in the Mysore Bank,
with instructions to make regular remittances to Rudra at London. The Bonds
were also deposited in the Bank to be held till Rudra’s return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

preparations and embarkation left Rudra very little time to attend to his
father, and when, after a hurried adieu, he went up the gangway with Lingappa
Halabhavi, and the good ship glided off and diminished and disappeared, poor
Sivabasava Devaru stood on the pier staring into space with unseeing eyes and
feeling all at once very old and lonely. He was awakened to the world by a
touch on his arm, and found Halabhavi and Sarojini who had come to see Lingappa
off. For moment a hot rage surged in Sivabasava Devaru as the thought came to
him that <i>there </i>were the authors of his sorrow, but when he saw that
Halabhavi’s face was wet with tears, and that Sarojini was weeping unashamed
with the corner of her <i>sari </i>to her eyes, a great sob burst from him.</p>

To Sivabasava Devaru it looked as though some inner light, which had brightened
the slow routine of village life and made it vital, had gone out, leaving the
daily round a joyless grind. The silence of the big old house, in which poor
Parvatamma flitted disconsolately thinking of her absent son; oppressed him.
They made more than one attempt to induce Shanta to live with them, but the
most they could get from her was a brief occasional visit, which seemed but to
render visible the gloom of their daily life. The old <i>jangam </i>became a
frequent and welcome visitor and his simple philosophy of life, and child like

and re-read, in private and before interested friends who gathered for a
glimpse of the great world beyond the waters, till not only the parents but
most of their friends knew the contents by heart. In some respects a village is
one big family and Rudra was in a sense the young hopeful of the whole village.
Sometimes there was a wistful homesickness in the letters which brought tears to

the trade depression. His creditors became pressing, and in the midst of it all
he has to face the steady and relentless need for remittance to England. He
raised money on mortgages, and he also sold some more land. The gold ornaments
of Parvatamma had first disappeared: she had insisted on offering them with the

disorganized, the streets were deserted, and the grass grew on some of them.
Business was at a stand-still, save for the crowds that struggled round
hospitals and drug stores, shouting, bullying, begging for thymol and other drugs

glare of the white high-road, that she could see nothing for a while, and the
silence struck a chill at her heart with the thought she might be too late.
Then, as her eyes got accustomed to the gloom, she saw her uncle and her aunt
lying on their beds. So silent and still were they that not till she approached
and noted the rise and fall of their breathing was she sure they were alive.
While she stood there taking in the scene, and divesting herself of her bundle
and little carpetbag, the <i>jangam </i>came in, and uttered a glad exclamation
on seeing her. Unable to contain her feelings,–for memories came to her of her
childhood and early youth, and of all that these two, who lay so still and
helpless, had been to her,–she threw herself on the old priest’s feet and
sobbed aloud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

more than ever anxious to complete his training with credit, and return to
build up for his father a home where loving care would tend his declining
years. His father’s letters, which had discontinued for several months, began
to come again. They were in Shanta’s hand, and were signed by Sivabasava Devaru
in a vague shaky scrawl that smote Rudra’s heart. The letters were cheerful,
and indicated that his father was comfortable and well looked after. Rudra
blessed Shanta in his heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from young Halabhavi the news of Sarojini’s defection. It<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

moved on some little way in mind and outlook during the years of strenuous work
in London. Perhaps the thought of his mother’s death and of his father left
desolate in his old age, with doubts as to whether Sarojini would provide a
happy home for him, had reacted on his scale of values. He was disappointed and
hurt, but not as utterly unhappy as he expected. He however acted the
broken-hearted part expected of him by Halabhavi, and sent off a magnanimous
letter to Sarojini wishing her and her future husband all happiness. This episode
closed, he applied himself with redoubled vigour to his studies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

successful in his final examination, and was admitted to the Fellowship of the
Royal College of Surgeons. Halabhavi was also successful and, in due course,
the two friends returned to India. Rudra spent a day at Bombay, and called on
to Halabhavis where he was introduced to Mr. Mallanna, I.C.S., whom he rather
liked. Then he took train for Mysore and arrived there late in the evening. His
heart leaped into his mouth as he saw the beautiful city bejeweled with its
myriad lights, and watched over by its Guardian Deity from Her light-crowned
hill, and felt his cheeks fanned by the breeze laden with the scent of a
hundred gardens. When the train drew up at the platform, he gripped Gopalayya’s
hand in silence,–he could not trust his voice,–and they drove to Gopalayya’s
house in the perfumed half-light of Mysore streets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his battered life was capable of. As for widow remarriages–I have taken the
opinion of your Mutt authorities and social leaders. Such marriages are quite lawful,
only your people sought distinction in imitating the bad conventions of
Brahmins, and discouraged such marriages. Even now, in the villages, such
unions are by no means uncommon. But why need you bother about that? A marriage
under the Civil Act is a perfect equivalent in all its legal incidents to an
orthodox marriage with chanting priests, etc. etc. And then about Shanta’s
willingness, I know she has loved you from her childhood. I had suspected it
all along, and when I went to see her during her attack of influenza, she said
things in her delirium which made all clear to me. Her sister-in-law must have
known it too, for she raises her tearful face to me as though to implore me to

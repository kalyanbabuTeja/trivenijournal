<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The 1st of November is an important landmark in
recent Indian history, nearly as important as the 15th of August 1947 when <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> achieved <st1:City w:st="on">Independence</st1:City>
or the 26th of January 1950 when the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">India</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> came into being.
For over four decades certain linguistic groups, notably in the South and West,
urged the need to redraw the map of India so as to <span class=SpellE>organise</span>
the country into well-knit, homogeneous administrative units based on
contiguity of territory and community of language. Stalwarts like Lokamanya
Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> that as a result
of such <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span> <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> could preserve her rich <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>diversity of language and culture alongside of
her fundamental unity of aim and outlook. Patriots of outstanding eminence–</span>Mahesh
<span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> of Bihar, <span class=SpellE>Gopabandhu</span>
Das of <span class=SpellE>Utkal</span>, <span class=SpellE>Konda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Venkatappayya</span> of Andhra and <span class=SpellE>Gangadhar</span>
Rao <span class=SpellE>Deshpande</span> of <span class=SpellE>Karnatak</span>,
to name only a few<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>–</span>dreamed the
twin-dreams of <span class=SpellE>Swaraj</span> for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and a Province of their own.
While <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place> and <span class=SpellE>Utkal</span>
were carved out into separate administrative regions even when the British held
sway, the others had to wait for some more years. The new States of Mysore,
Andhra Pradesh and Kerala <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>are the
outward manifestations of an inner impulse to <span class=SpellE>vitalise</span>
the sub-national units within the framework of the Indian Union. </span>Maharashtra
and Gujarat have been combined into the larger bi-lingual State of Bombay,
mainly because of the difficulty of adjusting rival claims to the City of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>. The States are
settling down, and the Zonal Councils will seek to promote the spirit of
friendliness and co-operative effort between the States in each Zone. It has
been wisely decided to make the Home Minister of the Union Government Chairman
of every Zonal Council. That way <span class=GramE>lies</span> the path of
harmony between the parts and the whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
some ways the most important of the recommendations of the Fazl Ali Commission
was the one relating to the disintegration of the State of Hyderabad and the
assignment of its three divisions–<span class=SpellE>Telangana</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Marathwada</span> and Karnataka–with the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span>
States of Andhra, <st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>. The <span class=SpellE>Nizam</span>
of Hyderabad is no longer the Ruler of the State, not even Governor. He wishes
to retire from active life and devote himself to the pursuit of Art and
Letters. Thus does the descendant of the famous <span class=SpellE>Asaf</span> <span
class=SpellE>Jah</span>, a front-rank nobleman and general of <span
class=SpellE>Moghul</span> times, pass into political <span class=GramE>oblivion.</span>
But the Maharaja of Mysore has agreed to function as Governor, and with him as
Head of the State the scattered areas of Karnataka are integrated into a new
pattern. <st1:City w:st="on">Mysore</st1:City> has always been a rallying
centre for the people of <st1:place w:st="on">South India</st1:place>, speaking
different languages but united in their loyalty to the memory of the great
Empire of <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span>. The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Palace</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mysore</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
and the royal personages who adorned it maintained the <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span>
tradition of patronage to the arts. Musicians and painters, scholars and poets
were welcomed in <st1:City w:st="on">Mysore</st1:City> and made to feel that,
even in a period of transition when old values are yielding place to new, the
cultural inheritance of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could be safeguarded and enriched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City> is a
symbol of <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span>, Andhra Pradesh is the
inheritor of <span class=GramE>an</span> yet earlier tradition–that of the <span
class=SpellE>Kakatiyas</span> of Warangal. Under <span class=SpellE>Ganapati</span>
<span class=SpellE>Deva</span> and his gifted daughter <span class=SpellE>Rudrama</span>
<span class=SpellE>Devi</span>, the Telugus achieved political and cultural
unity and acted as a bulwark against invasions from the North. Under <span
class=SpellE>Pratapa</span> <span class=SpellE>Rudra</span>, the <span
class=SpellE>Kakatiya</span> power succumbed to the Muslims, but the chieftains
of the region made common cause with those of Karnataka and helped to build the
Empire of <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span>. The new Andhra Pradesh begins
its career under happy auspices. With its immense natural resources and its
intelligent and industrious population, it is likely to win a high position
among the States of the Indian Union. One hopes that the differences between
rival groups of Andhra Congressmen will soon disappear, and that the <span
class=SpellE>Andhras</span> will make a sustained effort to bring back harmony
into their cultural and political life. There is, in all fields, plenty of
individual talent but the leadership is poor, even pitiful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is now fairly certain that the General Elections in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> will come off during February
next. The leading political parties are engaged in the preliminary task of
choosing candidates for the Central and State Assemblies. At one time there was
some talk of an election alliance between the Leftist parties ranged in
opposition to the ruling Congress party. But this has not <span class=SpellE>materialised</span>.
In spite of minor differences born of temperament the <span class=SpellE>Praja</span>
Socialist Party is nearer to the Congress than to the Communists or to the
Lohia group of Socialists. With the acceptance of the “Socialistic pattern of
society” as the ideal of the Congress, the differences between the Congress and
the P.S.P. have been narrowed. An Indian type of Socialism is being evolved,
and since the Congress and the P. S. P. are equally interested in such an
evolution, they ought to pool their resources in man-power and <span
class=SpellE>organisational</span> skill and pave the way for the emergence of
a strong Centre Party, opposed to the conservative elements like the Hindu <span
class=SpellE>Maha</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> and the Jan <span
class=SpellE>Sangh</span> on the one hand and to the disruptive forces
represented by the Communists on the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
recent years the Congress has suffered in the estimation of the general public
owing to the presence in its ranks, and even in its leadership at the State
level, of self-seeking politicians whose </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>professions of
patriotism are utterly unrelated to the activities in which they indulge,
particularly in their interference with the normal course of administration in
their districts. At the time of elections, some of these are not up as Congress
candidates, and old time Congressmen who are not <span class=SpellE>enamoured</span>
of ‘group’ politics find it difficult to vote for these local bosses. But since
the usual alternative is to vote for a Communist–and the prospect of a
Communist administration continues to be a nightmare to democratic,
peace-loving Indians</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a majority of votes
are cast for professional politicians sailing under Congress <span
class=SpellE>colours</span>. A feeling </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is rampant in the
countryside that, irrespective of party labels, honest and talented individuals
must be returned to the legislatures. Herein <span class=GramE>lies</span> a
danger. In democratic countries a Parliamentary system of government
pre-supposes the existence of well- <span class=SpellE>organised</span>
political parties based on differences in objectives and programmes, but all of
them wedded to constitutional methods. People who owe no allegiance to any <span
class=SpellE>organised</span> party and claim to be ‘Independents’ cannot be
trusted to pursue particular programmes. The slogan of “the best men
irrespective of party” must lead to chaos in our political life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
the immediate problem for the Congress organisation is to find candidates who,
in addition to being good party men, are also acceptable to the electorate on
grounds of personal merit and integrity. The choice of such candidates will win
for the Congress the enthusiastic support of the large mass of voters who may
hesitate to vote for undesirable individuals selected by the Congress. And
eventually, and in any case before the succeeding General Election of 1962, the
Congress and the P. S. P. must coalesce. Such a united party will draw unto
itself the best elements in the public life of the country. It will also
prevent the formation of miscellaneous groups swearing by individual
politicians and bargaining for place and power whenever a new Ministry is
formed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

suddenly called upon to exercise the franchise, behaved with admirable
restraint during the previous election and won the encomiums of the democracies

few scholars in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sufficiently acquainted with French or German, Spanish or Russian, Chinese or
Japanese to render the classics in those languages without the aid of existing
English translations claiming to be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>fairly accurate and
elegant. Even the translations from one Indian language to another are
sometimes made from an English or Hindi version. Thus, the late <span
class=SpellE>Romesh</span> <span class=SpellE>Dutt’s</span> <i>The Lake of
Palms </i>was translated into Telugu by <span class=SpellE>Chilakamarti</span>
Lakshmi <span class=SpellE>Narasimham</span>, not from Bengali but from
English. Hindi and English are studied by several people in every part of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and it
is always possible to secure the services of competent translators who can
render a Marathi or Gujarati work into Tamil or Telugu with the help of the
Hindi or English version.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sooner or later every region in India must train bands of translators who have
made an intensive study of languages other than their own and may be depended

available for this service of cultural interpretation, the Universities in <st1:country-region

endow Chairs for the teaching of three or four Indian languages and at least

dwelt in the presence of the Supreme, and sought no reward except His grace.

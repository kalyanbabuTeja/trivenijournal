traditional Western standards his had been a long and laborious life. He had
very nearly completed his century, and that century, it must be said to his
eternal credit, was packed with multifarious activity. He was a doctor by
profession, a <span class=SpellE>traveller</span> by inclination, and an author
by sheer compulsion; he was not, that is to say, an author “to the manner
born”, not having come to authorship <i>con amore. </i>It was almost as if
second thoughts supervened and forced him to turn novelist and playwright. That
he ended up as a very successful novelist and playwright is not the point. The
point is that the writing of novels and plays was not his first love. I am
rather inclined to think that if it had been his first love, matters might well
have planned out differentially and that he might have emerged as a much more
considerable literary figure than he actually did. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

much: I cannot go into <span class=SpellE>dithyrambics</span> over him, come
hell or high water. I adore him–but only this side idolatry. I cannot even
honestly claim to have read all his works (I wonder whether anyone can). Nor
can I honestly claim that those few of them that I have read have <span

is, “bowled me over”. We all have (or should have) our assorted literary

his own testament, he had tried very, very hard, indeed), had not that inestimable
advantage. His prose style is pedestrian to a degree. The finest prose style
is, undoubtedly, the simple style, but a simple style need not be pedestrian.
There is an ornament that pertains to simplicity, and there is a simplicity
that is, at the same time, scholarly. But flatness was the besetting sin of <span

is the diametrical opposite) it enables you to enter unerringly into what Mr. <span

class=SpellE>Jeeves</span>, calls “the psychology of the individual”. “Men in
the <span class=SpellE>loomp</span> are bad”–or so the poet tells us–and an
early inkling of this fundamental truth (combined, I suspect, with his initial
training as a medical practitioner) appears to have made of <span class=SpellE>Maugham</span>
an expert psychologist- especially of the fairer and the gentler sex. Mrs. Virginia
<span class=SpellE>Woolf</span> has declared somewhere that every woman is a

I have read of his prodigious output has left an indelible impression on my
mind. He, obviously, inclines to the view that we, humans, are not only fallen
angels but fallen apes as well. All his novels and short stories, right from
his earliest effort <span class=SpellE><i>Liza</i></span><i> of <span

ineradicable conviction of man’s “original sin.” Even <i>Cakes and Ale, </i>his
undoubted masterpiece (he himself, it will be recalled, preferred it to the
more popular choice, <i>Of Human Bondage</i>), has that <span class=SpellE>unsavoury</span>
theme at its core. Take away the heroine Rose’s multiple infidelities and what
have you left of it? Of his three famous books, <i>Cakes and Ale </i>and <i>The
Razor’s Edge </i>and <i>Of Human Bondage, </i>the first is decidedly in a class
apart: if only because it is, of the group, the most impeccably written. It is
the one where one may legitimately assert that he has a distinct (and not
unmemorable) prose style. It is also extremely entertaining: the quality that
runs like a golden </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

significant of his writings. As a story-teller he is “the <st1:place w:st="on">Pillars

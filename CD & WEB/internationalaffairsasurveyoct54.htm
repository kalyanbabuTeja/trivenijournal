tensions arise out of the difficulties experienced by individuals or groups in
adjusting themselves to changing situations. Man is a creature of habit, and
when he is called on to change his habits – physical, emotional or intellectual
– in response to changing situations, he has to overcome a great deal of
resistance. It is not in his nature to do this easily and quickly. A period of
tension therefore becomes inevitable in the lives of individuals as well as of
nations. It is utopian to expect perpetual peace in the history of mankind.
Tensions are like the waves of the sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two world wars have brought about a revolutionary change in the global
situation. Two aspects of it are of great significance. One is the awakening of
Asia and the other is the disappearance of all other powers in the West except
the U.S.S.R. and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the intense rivalry between them.
States like <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>, Holland etc., which wielded a large
amount of influence in the past are finding it difficult to adjust <span
class=GramE>themselves</span> to a world where there is acute rivalry between
Soviet Russia and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Are they to merely yield place to
these giants? And if they are to take sides, which side should they prefer –
the Soviet or the American side? The West is also finding it difficult to
adjust itself to an awakened <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>. For nearly
four centuries it exercised ascendancy over this vast continent. It regarded
this continent as weak, powerless and <span class=SpellE>uncivilised</span>.
Today the situation is different. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> has become a great power. It
has been able to check the American armies in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Korea</st1:country-region>
and to check the American allies in Indo-China to whom large aids have been
coming from the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is in a position to create
trouble in <st1:City w:st="on">Malaya</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Siam</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Given time it can become a still greater power. The same is the case with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. She is
even more mature than <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
in the realm of politics; she is more highly <span class=SpellE>industrialised</span>;
she occupies a more important strategic position in the Indian Ocean; she has
been able to gain the goodwill of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Burma</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and her leadership has been recognized–though informally–by several of the
Asian and African peoples. She is sure to become a greater power in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>course
of time. Besides <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> there is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is true that she was
defeated in the <span class=GramE>second world war</span> and that she was
deprived of all her imperial possessions. But the country is being
reconstructed. In any case no power on earth can suppress her for all time. Her
revival has been found necessary by the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. She is bound to
become an important Asian power within a short period. Though in point of
numbers of her population she does not occupy the same place as <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, she has a superior role in
the sphere of industry and in point of military efficiency. In another forty or
fifty years’ time the Asian continent is bound to become the political center
of the world just like <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> in the
nineteenth century. There is then every possibility of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
losing all that political importance which she possesses today. The tensions
with which the contemporary world is faced are thus the outcome of the
difficulty experienced by the nations of Western Europe and by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> in reconciling themselves to an
awakened <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>. The difficulty is all the
greater as they have to face the prospect–which is not very remote–of an
awakened <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be incidentally noted that in contrast with these States of the West,

outcome of the <span class=GramE>second world war</span> was a great
disappointment to the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Great Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
They were, of course, interested in destroying Hitlerism and preventing <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> from
again becoming a great military and industrial power. But they were not
prepared to welcome the establishment of Soviet suzerainty over <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. This was in their view </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
much more dangerous phenomenon than the suzerainties attempted by <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
over that continent in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

possibility of bringing all Europe under the government of <st1:country-region

this would have enabled the Soviet to establish ascendancy over <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> also.
In addition to this there was the Communism with its dictatorial and
totalitarian </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>form of government, and with its denial of the
fundamental, freedoms and rights as understood by the democracies of the West </span><span

<h1>GERMAN REARMAMENT</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no need to tell here the story of these efforts. The topic is referred to
here as it is this that has made the discussions on the rearmament of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
become crucially important. The United States and Britain, along with most of
their allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, were agreed that unless
German armies became a part of the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> strength
of Western Europe, as against any aggression from Soviet Russia, there was no
chance whatever of such aggression being defeated. It was for this purpose that
the European <span class=SpellE>Defence</span> Community was thought of. But
here came the opposition from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There was nothing surprising or unnatural in that opposition. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> had been enemies for a
thousand years. Till about 1860 <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
took advantage of a politically disunited <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, inflicted many defeats on
her and occupied several German regions. Things were reversed after 1860 when
by successive wars under the leadership of Prussia–the last such war being the
one waged against France herself in 1870-71–Germany became united under a
single government, highly <span class=SpellE>centralised</span>, efficiently
administered, with all attention concentrated on building the strongest
continental army and a powerful navy. It was this united <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region> armed to the hilt that inflicted
disastrous defeats on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the first and the second world wars. A nation which suffered such severe
losses at the hands of Germans on three occasions within a period of eighty
years cannot be expected to forget the serious consequences of a unified and
rearmed <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
French were naturally in a dilemma. They were, it is true to some extent,
afraid of conquest by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the establishment of a Communist regime over them. They knew that they
could not save themselves from<i> </i>such a catastrophe out of their own
efforts and that they required the help of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But the price which the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in particular
demanded for this help was French willingness to rearm <st1:place w:st="on">Western
 Germany</st1:place> to a limited extent at least. A compromise formula was
evolved for this purpose and it was on such a formula that the EDC was based.
But the French nation could not reconcile <span class=GramE>themselves</span>
even to a limited rearmament of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There were many among them who felt that a rearmed <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
would sooner or later embark on aggression–as was done by Hitler–and that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> would
once more become a victim to it. They thought that the danger from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> was
remote and that it may even be escaped by a policy of neutralism or nonalignment.
Even today the French are not completely free from this dilemma: which is to
them a greater danger, a Russian aggression or a German aggression? This was at
the root of their opposition to EDC and they naturally rejected it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the plan which she has worked out for four years for the <span class=SpellE>defence</span>

 w:st="on">Netherlands</st1:place></st1:country-region>, knew full well that it
was only the American leadership of the NATO and the <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
strength that was built up with American help that checked Russian aggression.
Though they believed in diplomacy and negotiation to a far greater extent than
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
did, they knew from experience that diplomacy would succeed only when backed up
by effective strength. They were therefore resolved somehow to reconcile the
French to the idea of re-arming <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and at the Nine-Power London Conference, concluded in the first week of
October, decisions were taken on this issue and all these decisions were agreed
to by the French Premier Mendes-France.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

equipment, and to her becoming a full and equal member of the NATO. What
induced the French to agree to these decisions was primarily the willingness of
the British to keep on the continent an arm of 100,000 as a part of the <span

The West, however,–and especially the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

inadequate recognition by the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United

The help which she has rendered to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the war in Indo-China is
an instance in point. Her policies–especially in the matter of giving aid to Pakistan,
bringing about a <span class=SpellE>Turko</span>-Pakistan pact (to which Iraq
now proposes to adhere) and her persistence in <span class=SpellE>organising</span>
a South East Asian <span class=SpellE>Defence</span> Treaty Organisation–have
naturally created the impression that America is trying to step into the shoes
of Western Imperial Powers (Britain, France etc.) in Asia. The situation is
just like that in Central and South America when, in the early part of the
nineteenth century, the colonies threw away the yoke of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Portugal</st1:country-region>
but were being threatened with the establishment of the yoke of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
other European powers which were still strong. It was then that <st1:country-region
w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> proclaimed her famous <st1:City w:st="on">Monroe</st1:City>
doctrine, which for more than a century has safeguarded the independence of the

The danger which <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sees in American policies is similar to this. It may result in American
Colonialism (Dollar imperialism) being substituted for European imperialism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

arises out of their attitudes towards international Communism and the means of
combating it. The Americans hate Communism as the greatest danger confronting
the ‘free’ world. They identify the Soviet and Chinese Governments with
international Communism and they are not prepared to come to any understanding
with them. They want to carryon a holy world-crusade against it–which means
against Soviet Russia and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and their foreign policy is aimed wholly at the accomplishment of this

different. She does not regard Communism as such a great danger. She is also
not afraid of any country becoming Communist if it is the result of an internal

why does <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
persist in this holy crusade against Communism? Why do so many of the free
countries help her in this enterprise? There is no space to go in full detail
into this question. Reference to it has been made above in connection with the
danger of Soviet suzerainty over <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. There
is, however, a smaller issue to which reference has to be made here. There is a
genuine fear in the United States, and this fear is shared by very many
sections of people in Asia, that if America and the West do not interest
themselves in the politics of South-Asia, the States here–the smaller ones
especially–which are not in a position to defend themselves will be easily
absorbed into China in the case of South-East Asia and the Far East, into
Soviet Russia in the case of<i> </i>the Middle East. They will become
satellites of these two big Communist powers. The withdrawal therefore of
Western or American imperialism will not mean their freedom, independence and
sovereignty but their dependence on <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
and Soviet <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>–the
substitution of one imperialism by another. Such a fear is entertained in <st1:country-region

there can be no escape from Americans trying to fill in the power vacuum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>PANDIT NEHRU’S VISIT TO <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">CHINA</st1:place></st1:country-region></h1>

is in this context that the visit of Pandit Nehru to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> assumes world significance.
If he can get an understanding from China–an understanding of an effective
character–that she would never cast her eyes on Indo-China, Indonesia,
Thailand, Burma, Nepal and the Philippines, that she would not encourage any
subversive movements in them, that she would not use the ten million Chinese
residents in them to further her own purposes, there is then the prospect of an
Asian settlement. It is on these points that there is suspicion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It may be argued that China had already given a
guarantee in respect of these matters by subscribing to the five principles
included in the <span class=SpellE>communiques</span> issued after her Prime
Minister’s talks with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma. In a world where
there is so much of disparity between word and deed, how are the nations to be
convinced of the practical utility of these principles? After all they are not
new. They are at the basis of the Charter of the United Nations to which sixty
nations have subscribed. But are there not many States who have violated them
and whose violations could not be remedied by the Security Council or the
General Assembly? It now rests with Pandit Nehru to bring back with him some
measures of a practical character under which the independence of Asian nations
is guaranteed, not only against Western imperialism but also against Chinese
and Soviet imperialism. This will place him among the greatest of statesmen of
all times.</p>

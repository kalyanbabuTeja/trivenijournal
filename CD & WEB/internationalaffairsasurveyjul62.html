style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
seventeen-nation disarmament conference, which met at Geneva in March to bring
about an agreement between the United States and Soviet Russia on the banning
of nuclear tests and on a detailed plan for universal and complete disarmament
by stages, was adjourned <i>sine die, </i>after more than two months of
fruitless debate. As usual, the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
would not agree to a ban unless it was accompanied by a fool-proof system of
international inspection and control, and the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place>
was equally insistent on not having any such system. The non-aligned states at
the conference tried their best to bring about a compromise, but to no effect.
The two big powers could not even agree on the wording of a declaration urging
a moratorium on war propaganda. As all the time of the conference was taken up
with debates on nuclear ban, the problem of general disarmament was not at all
considered. The result is that the nuclear arms race is going on. The <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> has resumed its series of tests;
and the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet Union</st1:place> is planning for another
round of them. Each is bent upon achieving its own superiority in the
possession of the most destructive nuclear arms. The only consolation is that
the Conference was adjourned instead of being dissolved. This gives the <span
class=GramE>hope</span> that the discussions would be resumed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile,
an Anti-Nuclear Test Convention was held in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> under the auspices of the Gandhi
Peace Foundation. Not only non-officials like Dr. <span class=SpellE>Rajendra</span>
<span class=SpellE>Prasad</span> and C. Rajagopalachari, but also officials
like the President and the Prime Minister of India participated in it. Eloquent
speeches were delivered in support of an immediate ban on tests and of general
disarmament. Every one agreed that, as pointed out by Dr. <span class=SpellE>Prasad</span>,
the race for nuclear weapons would lead to a thermo-nuclear war between East
and West which would result in the annihilation of whole populations on either
side, destroy civilization and turn the world into a radio-active waste land.
There was also an agreement on the need, as pointed out by Dr. Radhakrishnan,
for all nations to surrender their national sovereignty and submit to a Rule of
Law. But there was no effective answer to the only important question as to how
to induce the two nuclear powers to stop the tests. The only <span class=GramE>device,
that the Convention could think of,</span> was to have a resolution passed by
the General Assembly of the United Nations banning all tests. Now that the
non-aligned Afro-Asian nations have a large numerical strength in that body,
there might be no difficulty in getting such a resolution passed. But what
guarantee is there that it would be respected by the two great powers? The
suggestion of C. Rajagopalachari that they should be expelled from the United
Nations if they do not respect <span class=GramE>it,</span> was thrown out, and
rightly also, by the Convention. The majority of the delegates realized that
the world body would cease to exist if the two powers left it. The Convention
could not think of any other sanctions. The suggestion of Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Rajendra</span> <span class=SpellE>Prasad</span> that <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> should
set an example to other nations by unilaterally disarming <span class=GramE>herself,</span>
was considered to be impracticable and inadvisable. The net result is that the
situation continues to remain what it was before the disarmament conference met
at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only hope lies in the two powers growing wiser and in their realizing that the
nuclear race is destructive of both. Both of them know this, but they do not
have the wisdom to benefit by their knowledge. It is also quite possible that
both of them may come nearer each other if they come to think of Communist
China as their common enemy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
outcome of the rivalry between the two powers is the growing unity among the
States of Western Europe. Western Europe is more or less of the same size as
India, and like India it has been for ages divided politically into a number of
independent sovereign states in spite of the fact that there is a large amount
of cultural unity among them. Modern nationalism with its emphasis on the
absolute and unlimited sovereignty of the state had its birth herethe English
and the French having been the earliest nations. There are also differences of
language among the peoples of <st1:place w:st="on">Western Europe</st1:place>.
Attempts made in the pastby the Holy Roman Emperors in the middle ages, by the
Bourbons and the Hapsburgs in the early modern period, and by Napoleon, Kaiser
William and Hitler later onto unify <st1:place w:st="on">Western Europe</st1:place>
politicallyended in failure. To-day, however, the atmosphere is quite
different. In communism and Soviet Russia, all the States of Western Europe
find a common enemy. Each of them has come to realize that it cant defend
itself in isolation. Moreover, they have found that they should all come closer
together if their economies are to be properly developed in the new technological
age. The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has been encouraging them to come closer together for both political and
economic purposes. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was the first step in
this direction. The European Common Market, which is being organized at
present, is the second step. And many regard that sooner or later it will be
followed by the third stepthe formation of a sort of West European Federation
consisting of almost all the States on this side of the Iron Curtain. The era
of national States in the history of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
has practically come to an end. The era of regional federations has begun. The
decision of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> to enter
the European Common Market clearly points out that this is the direction in
which events are moving in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. A West European
Federation will be one of the strongest and economically one of the most
advanced of the States of the world. In a shrinking world there is no place for
States of small size like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Belgium</st1:country-region> or <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Holland</st1:place></st1:City>.
They have to become either satellites of a great power or be federally united. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
only in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> but also in other parts of the
world, this tendency will grow strong. It is this that gives significance to
the Malaysian movement in <st1:place w:st="on">South-East Asia</st1:place>. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region> is to be merged in Malaya, and this is
to form part of a bigger federation of which British Borneo and the other
remaining colonies of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in this part of the world are to be members. There is already a sort of
cultural union between Malaya, the <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
All these are States threatened by the aggressive Communist China. It is,
therefore, quite possible that in due course all the States of South-<st1:place
w:st="on">East Asia</st1:place> might come closer together both politically and
economically. It is in a similar direction that the Arab States of Western Asia
and <st1:place w:st="on">Northern Africa</st1:place> are likely to move. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

organization of the European Common Market and the entry of <st1:country-region

 of Nations</st1:place>. The transformation of the British Empire into a <st1:place
w:st="on">Commonwealth of Nations</st1:place> has been rightly regarded as a
unique event in history to which there is no parallel. All other empires broke
up, and though the <st1:place w:st="on">British Empire</st1:place> also broke
up like them into a number of independent states, these have preferred to come
together on a free and voluntary basis as members of the Commonwealth. Even
republics like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have found a place in it. The members have been linked together by cultural and
economic ties and the Commonwealth has been serving as a moderating factor in
the settlement of international issues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has been pointed out by several authoritative writers that the English language
and parliamentary democracy are the outstanding cultural links that hold the
Commonwealth together. Even after the one time dependencies of the British <span
class=GramE>empire</span> became independentas in the case of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Ceylon</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ghana</st1:place></st1:country-region>they have
not given up the English<i> </i>language which in the days of British rule
served as a common medium of communication among the educated classes in them.
Whatever antipathy might have existed towards the English<i> </i>language, as
the language of an alien country, in the days of foreign rule, it has gradually
disappeared and efforts are being made in the Asian and African member-states
of the Commonwealth to retain English and to raise its standard. As a recent
writer on the Commonwealth pointed out, By 1960 the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>maintenance
of English as a cultural language had become the official policy of <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
addition to these cultural links, there have been two other links which bound
the members together. One is the recognition of the principle of racial
equality. The Commonwealth is an inter-racial entity. There is no place for the
<span class=SpellE>colour</span> bar in it. It was because of the policy of <span
class=SpellE>colour</span> bar to which South Africa rigidly adhered that it
found that it had no place in the Commonwealth and prudently gave up its
membership. Otherwise, it might have suffered the indignity of being expelled.
So strong was the resentment felt by all other members towards her policy of
Apartheid. The other is the economic link. The member states enjoy a sort of
preference for the entry of their goods duty free into Britain, and this is of
great advantage to them in earning foreign exchange. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
entry of Britain into the European Common Market is sure to break the economic
link. Commonwealth countries like India will, in future, not be in a position
to send exports to Britain duty free. The trade policy of Britain will be
influenced more and more by the rules and regulations of the Common Market, and
Britain will be drawn closer to the countries of Western Europe and away from
those of the Commonwealth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
other tendencies which may weaken the Commonwealth also deserve notice. One is
the growth of authoritarian forms of government in States like Pakistan and
Ghana and their moving away from the institutions of parliamentary democracy
and the Rule of Law. The other is the introduction, though indirectly, of a
sort of <span class=SpellE>colour</span> bar in Britain as a result of the new
Immigration Act. In the past, all citizens of the Commonwealth were allowed to
migrate and settle in Britain without any restriction. Under the new Act
several restrictions have been imposed and several of them have been imposed
specially to prevent, the people of India and Pakistan from entering the
country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The movement for freedom from colonial domination has
shown appreciable progress in recent months. Algeria has become free in spite
of the opposition and the killings resorted to by the French Secret Army
Organization. The killings and the work of destruction carried on by the
organization were on an unprecedented scale. Even women and children were not
spared. Hospitals were destroyed. Oil wells and refineries were burnt, and a
regular scorched-earth policy was pursued for more than two months. The free
Government of Algeria bore all this with patience. It did not resort to
reprisals and immerse the country in civil war on the eve of freedom. Its
statesmanship yielded valuable dividends. The Secret organisation realized that
its efforts to create anarchy and delay the emergence of a free Algeria were
futile and reconciled itself to the new state of affairs. With the referendum
on July 1, a new independent State of Algeria has come into existence and a
century-old French rule has come to an end.</p>

primitive. They are still in the tribal stage. There are internal feuds among them.
Economically they are backward. There are no trained men to serve as civil
servants and administrators. The question, therefore, is how they will use
their freedom, and what meaning freedom conveys to them. Even in Congo which is
in their neighbourhood and which has been administered for a longer time by
Belgium, freedom did not bring either peace or prosperity. Conditions have
continued unsettled. Katanga, the richest of the provinces, has not agreed as
yet to remain as an integral part of United Congo. Its ruler <span
class=SpellE>Tshombe</span> continues to be under the influence of the foreign
syndicates engaged in exploiting its mineral wealth. All negotiations between
him and the Congo Premier, <span class=SpellE>Adoula</span>, have failed. It is
only with the help of the United Nations Forcesof which the Indian contingent
forms an appreciable partthat peace is being maintained. The situation in <span
class=SpellE>Ruanda</span> and <span class=SpellE>Urundi</span> is much worse
and gives cause for concern. One is naturally justified in asking the question:
Is self-government good under all circumstances? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the troubles in the contemporary world are ultimately traceable to the cold
war between Soviet Russia and the United States. Very many of the troubles
would have disappeared in due course if the two powers had not intervened in
the troubled spots. Berlin in Europe, Formosa, South Vietnam, Laos and even
Kashmir continue to be trouble spots because of the great power rivalries. If
the United States withdraws its seventh fleet from the Straits, there will be
no trouble in Formosa. All the trouble which Pakistan is able to cause in
Kashmir, is due to the military help which the United States is giving her. It
is the rivalry between the United States and Soviet Russia that is the source
of trouble in South Vietnam and Laos. Each is anxious to bring as much area of
the world as possible under its sphere of influence. The tensions in the world
cannot be reduced unless this cold war comes to an end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has been amply illustrated by recent events in Indo-China. The small kingdom of
Laos with a population of about three millions has been for years a scene of
civil war because of the help which the Communist <span class=SpellE>Pathet</span>
Lao party has been getting from Communist China and North Vietnam and the
rightist ruling party has been getting from the United States. It is the policy
of the United States to contain communism and prevent it from engulfing the
whole of South East Asia. The Chinese, in their turn, are keen on extending
their influence and converting all the States in Indo-China into their
satellite States. Because of the growing divergence between Soviet Union and
Communist China, the former has seen the wisdom of coming to some understanding
with the United States and preventing the growth of Chinese influence in Laos.
Both of them, therefore, agreed on making Laos a really independent and
neutralist State under a neutralist premier. This agreement has come into
effect and if both the States are sincere and if all the foreign armies are
withdrawn from Laos, the kingdom will have the opportunity of enjoying peace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is good for Laos is equally good for South Vietnam. At present there is a civil
war going on in this State between the communists and the governmental forces.
The former are helped by the communist government of North Vietnam and China,
and the latter, by the United States. These facts have been clearly brought out
by the International Supervisory Commission functioning in Indo-China under the
Geneva Agreement of 1954. If civil war is to be put an end to, it is necessary
that Soviet Russia and the United States should abstain from all interference
in this area, and this will be possible only on condition that all the States
in the area follow, like India, a policy of non-alignment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

seventeen years the two great powers have been carrying on a cold war with a
view to establish their domination over the whole world. Historians have
pointed out that this is similar to the wars that Islam and Christianity fought
in the middle ages and Protestantism and Catholicism in Europe in the middle ages.
These wars proved futile and ultimately the parties learnt the lesson of Live
and Let Live. The same is the case today. There is no possibility of either of
the two great powers achieving their aim of becoming the sole world-ruler. They
should learn the lesson of real co-existence and co-operate in the promotion of
peace and prosperity of the whole world. Otherwise, the continuation of the
cold war will sooner or later lead to a hot war and result in the destruction
of both. History warns them against such continuance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

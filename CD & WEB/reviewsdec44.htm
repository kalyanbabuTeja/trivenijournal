<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
C. L. R. Sastri is Sir C. Y. Chintamani’s son and that, perhaps, partly
explains his charming cocksureness. It also explains the readability of<i> </i>a
book which deals mostly with figures who, to the working Journalist in India,
are forgotten ghosts of<i> </i>Fleet Street remembered only by <i>John O’
London’s </i>or<i>, </i>at best, by<i> </i>James Agarte. Mr. Sastri is alive to
the limitations of his<i> </i>book and it is no use finding fault with him for
not doing what he does not attempt to do. His main purpose is to indicate the
higher aims of journalism, emphasize its kinship to literature, explain the
work of<i> </i>great models and recall to the minds of Indian Journalists some
of their own good standards. This he does in the manner of an essayist, in a
style intensely personal, and since it helps to make his enthusiasm infectious,
the method may be considered highly successful. Like Hazlitt, one of<i> </i>his
heroes, Mr<i>. </i>Sastri has gusto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
those of<i> </i>the younger generation of journalists in India, who either do
not know or do not care to know their Massinghams, Montagues and Gardiners, a
book which glorifies not only the English language but English models may seem
unconvincing. Mr. Sastri does not mention even American journalism or American
journalists by way of compensation. But if our tailors still look to Bond
Street, our financiers to Lombard Street and our politicians to Downing Street,
there is no reason why our journalists should not look to Fleet Street for inspiration.
As long as there is English journalism in the country, it would be better not
to claim linguistic <i>swadeshi </i>in the matter of<i> </i>English but to
remember that what is well worth writing is worth writing well. Unfortunately,
many of the younger journalists in India drift into the profession with no
higher purpose than to make a living and turn their blood into lead and with no
higher success than be slipshod leader-writers, indifferent newsmen and
incompetent editors, mere journeymen in an alien world of<i> </i>letters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Sastri, it seems, emphasizes too much the kinship between journalism and
literature. His list of British journalists who have achieved distinction in
literature is not imposing. Nor was Saintsbury’s. Neither Masingham nor
Montague, good writers and great journalists, could be classed as major figures
in literature, and when Mr. Sastri calls EarleWelby as genius, the reviewer,
who has equal enthusiasm for Welby, must look to other standards than Mr.
Sastri’s. Where journalism ends literature begins and the true journalist is
modest enough for, as Mr. Sastri admits, journalism is at best literature in a
hurry, in fact, it is history, sociology, politics, and economics in a hurry.
The truth is that it belongs to the sphere of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
Mr. Sastri prefers to emphasize the literary aspect of journalism, he is
entitled to it. He is also well qualified for it. His standards are high, his
models great, his epitaphs eloquent. His digressions–including the digression
on digressions–are always interesting and his quotations, for which he puts in
again a digression in defence, are, even when they seem too long, apt. His
enthusiasm for Sir Francis Low or Sachchidananda Sinha it is difficult to share
but on one matter it is easy to agree whole-heartedly–his tribute to <i>‘Triveni’
</i>and its Editor. For one who had the same heroes as Mr. Sastri at one time
or other but has since chosen other standards, it is possible to disagree with
Mr. Sastri at every step; but it is impossible not to be interested in his
enthusiasms. It is a vividly written and highly entertaining book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Elwin’s study of Maria Murder and Suicide is a refreshing contrast to much
pseudo-anthropological research that is carried on in the country. The author
combines in himself a broad knowledge of primitive life, an accurate
acquaintance with the aborigines of India, a humanitarian insight and
scientific acumen of a high order. The book embodies investigations into the
murders and suicides of the Bison-horn Marias of Bastar.</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
book naturally divides itself into four broad sections. In the beginning we are
furnished with a general idea of crimes among the aboriginal tribes in India
and we are then introduced to the tribe under investigation. Its general
manners and customs are described and the ethico-religious background of the
lives of its members is indicated. This part of the book is valuable in view of
the author’s claim that it is a contribution to social anthropology rather than
to the study of crime. The most interesting group of chapters in the book is
the one devoted to the analysis of the various categories of crimes, in terms
of their causes, like witch-craft and magic, marital infidelity, the desire to
eliminate disputes about property, the tangle of family life, alcohol, revenge,
and fatigue. The crimes of women and criminal lunacy are also discussed. This
part of the book has great value particularly because of the many concrete
cases in illustration and incidentally much light is thrown on the actual life
of the community. Its problems and tragedies are vividly presented. The last
group of chapters deals with the behaviour of the criminal after the crime, the
attitude of the society to crime and the ways of the aboriginal prisoner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
book has the merit of dealing with live anthropological material which it
presents in a classified, tabulated form and, at the same time, is full of
sympathy and insight into the lives of the criminals. Interesting points are
brought out at every decisive stage of the exposition. Most of the crimes are
shown to be the expressions of the social rather than the anti-social spirit.
It is also established that the civilised man is not morally different from the
primitive man, however different their respective types of criminality may be.
It is also interesting to note that a large percentage of crimes proceeds from
ignorance rather than wickedness. A powerful and sustained plea for a deeper
and a more inward understanding of aboriginal mentality is the outstanding
contribution and emphasis of the whole study. Such an understanding serves the
two-fold purpose of rendering investigations more scientifically objective and
of enabling reformist zeal to work with intelligence in the task of aiding the
progress of the aborigines. A work like this educates our spirit of humanity
and guides the effective expression of that spirit in working plans for the
promotion of social welfare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hold no brief for Indians. Many of them behaved atrociously to me,” writes the
author towards the end of the book. “I who vowed never to write<i> </i>on India
have reluctantly put my awkward pen to this book,” says he elsewhere (P. 65)
and hopes modestly that “it may stir one or two of my countrymen to a
realisation of the hatred which we are unnecessarily engendering and the
friendship that we are steadily losing<i> </i>among<i> </i>the<i> </i>people<i>
</i>of<i> </i>India.” Lionel Fielden was Controller of Broadcasting in India
from 1935-40 and had occasion, in that capacity to meet not only the high
dignitaries of Government and Congress Ministers but also a good section of the
public. He presents the Indian Problem covering well-trodden ground–the
Minorities, the Princes, the linguistic and racial divisions, urban and rural
differences–with a sureness of tread that is remarkable for one who claims to
be no expert, and with a directness and even brusqueness of expression
characteristic of a broadcast announcer. We have in this book the Indian
nationalist point of view presented with an incisiveness and vigour such as few
non-Indians have ever succeeded in doing. Though the author disclaims the
intention of writing a learned thesis, a ‘heavy-weight’ affair loaded with
facts, he yet manages to present all relevant information in a striking manner.
The general tone of informality, the non-chalance of a free lance, occasional
flashes of humour and irony, the personal ‘asides’, all make the book eminently
readable in spite of its dwelling most of the time on matters of acute
controversy at the present time. One indeed hopes that the book will stir many
more than just one or two of Lionel Fielden’s countrymen. The description of
the Cripps episode and the sketch of Gandhiji are high lights m the book. The
‘Frontispiece’ at the beginning and the ‘Tail-piece’ at the end are delightful
sketches dealing respectively with the departure and arrival of Indian
Viceroys, and suggesting with devastating irony the lurid contrast between the
pomp of viceregal movement and normal Indian life. <i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

Mudrarakshasa is one of the very few plays in Sanskrit dealing with a
historical theme. In fact, scholars have not been unwilling to use it even as a
source of historical information. The play is concerned with plot woven by
Chanakya to force Amatya Rakshasa, formerly the Chief Minister of the Nandas
and now the deadly enemy of their vanquisher, Chandragupta Maurya, to become
the minister and chief supporter of Chandragupta himself. Hence the theme of
the play is entirely political; it is unrelieved by popular attractions. The
time-honoured Court jester is absent; what is more, love-interest itself is
quite absent. Yet the play of his completely grips one’s attention. Here we
witness a ‘battle of wits’; here is the absorbing interest of watching the
clash of political plots and counter </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>plots–the vengeful
plans of the selfless, devoted and efficient but too human Amatya Rakshasa

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>schemes emanating from
the brain of the ruthless and ever-watchful Chanakya. As the Drama progresses,
the net cast by Chanakya draws closer and Rakshasa is firmly caught in its
coils. Ultimately he sees no other way but to accept service under Chandragupta
if the life of his dearest friend, the great-hearted Chandanadasa, is to be
saved. The whole play sweeps on with such irresistible power that we are
breathlessly carried along with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Pandit’s rendering of the play “is literal and omits nothing”; it is entirely
in prose while the original, as is usual in a Sanskrit play, is in verse and
prose. The<i> </i>translator knew the difficulties of his task quite well. He
has confessed: “Unfortunately it has not been feasible to bring out the charm
or vigour of the lyrical passages in form and matter.” He has moreover
attempted “to retain, as far as possible, the original construction so that the
Sanskrit style might be indicated.” This has resulted, as he himself has
admitted, in making the play, if read aloud, “sound a trifle out of the
ordinary.” It is also possible to quarrel with the translator occasionally, for
instance when he renders the word ‘hataka’ (as in Chanakyahataka) by ‘good as
dead.’ And one notes with regret that he has gone wrong in making the sentence
‘Katham na jnayate nama’ mean ‘How should the name be unknown!’ (page 23). The<i>
</i>context makes it clear that the sentence should be rendered in some such
way as ‘How can you possibly not know it?” Slips there are. But one notes with
joy that they are not many. The translation, especially of the crisp prose
dialogues, (which, it may be noted in passing, are the most significant part of
the play) runs well and can be read with pleasure. Many an English equivalent
has been aptly chosen and many a Sanskrit phrase has been happily rendered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

One occasionally wonders if all this matter, though valuable in itself, is

all happened suddenly. He woke up half refreshed from the afternoon nap and,
yawning lazily, he looked up at his reflection in the looking glass on the
wall. The hair receded at the temples, grey hairs showed through the black
ones, the brow was lined and there were crow’s feet round his eyes. He wondered
whether he was as old as he looked. They say a schoolmaster looks old but he
was happy he was no more a schoolmaster. The School management were busy
building up a case for his discharge from service on the ground that he
preached atheism and free love to the students; but actually it was a
vindictive step provoked by his zeal for reform. For, Ramadass had threatened
to make public the affairs of the management, his chief charge being the
misappropriation of school funds. But, with the exception of a few youngsters,
nobody believed him. They had always looked askance on his views and now they
had come to regard him as a crank. He had no alternative but to tender his
resignation which he did that forenoon. As he looked at the mirror, Ramadass
made a wry face at the reflection. He might be fifty but he was no more a
schoolmaster.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the mirror, he saw reflected, the old deal-wood box in the corner. He walked
across the room, opened the lid of the box and began to rummage idly at the
contents. On the top were the few letters which he had written to his wife,
Kalyani, during<i> </i>the early days of their marriage. He took out one and
began reading. He was surprised at his capabilities as a lover. Yet, during the
six years of their married life, he was consumed by jealousy. He was jealous
because she remained cold and aloof. It was a coldness, amounting to frigidity,
which chilled his ardours. He thought, she never surrendered herself completely
to him, because there was someone else. Another grouse was, she bore him no
children. He wondered whether something was wrong with him. He wanted to put it
to test by taking another wife. He was not rich enough to provide for two
wives. Also they might quarrel among themselves and make his home like hell.
Ramadass was then thirty two years old and fell in love with a young girl
living in a nearby house. But of course he did not keep this a secret from his
wife. The result was, she charged him with unfaithfulness and made angry
scenes. In a way these scenes made him happy because they gave him a sense of
power over his wife. Some months had elapsed and Kalyani contracted pneumonia.
Ramadass recalled, with aversion, the many friends who used to come enquiring
after her. Some one among them, he thought, must be intimate with her, and his
inability to place the adventurer maddened him. However, these trials were
short-lived, for Kalyani died and he was a free man. His freedom to remarry
came too late, for the girl he had desired to marry was married to some one
else and had settled down elsewhere. All this had happened fifteen years ago
and Ramadass, ever since, remained a widower. He hoped love would come again
into his life, but it did not; he was miserable. Soon he learnt to glory in his
unhappiness. His married life was a failure and he came to believe that
marriage is a bore. His preaching was consistent with his experience. He said
children are a nuisance, besides over-populating the country. He thought men
humbugs and women wicked. However he forgot himself in his work as a teacher
and his cynicism gave his teaching a peculiar force.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ramadass
put aside the letters and took out the album of photographs. The album had been
his wedding present and he often looked at the wedding photograph, for it
brought him sad memories. He was then so slim and graceful. People, who looked
at it years after, expressed surprise when told that it was himself. He was so
changed that he took out the photograph from the wall and put it inside the
album lest it might call forth comment which should pique him. Then there was
his photograph as a boy of fifteen with wide, innocent looking, eyes. It was
ironical that he never enjoyed the quietude of innocence. A strange sense of
sin haunted him, and in vain he sought escape from it, for it returned again
and again. It was in a way a small matter–the failure to call the doctor in
time when his wife was in bed with pneumonia. At the time he never thought it
would take such a serious turn; even his wife had spoken lightly of it. The
doctor himself never hinted that he was called in too late. His wife had died,
and it looked as though he was somehow responsible for it. Some people–probably
those who envied his freedom–had made vague remarks that her death had suited
him. His life had been a sort of running away from this sense of guilt and he
hastily put away the album of photographs. He rummaged below for some clothing
with which to cover the album. He picked it up and found that it was a
theatrical costume, worn out and faded–a relic of his histrionic activities in
his younger days. There were others too, made of muslin, the king’s tunic, the
minister’s turban in gold lace, and a sherwani in striking crimson. At the
bottom was the loose long yellow-coloured robe of the mendicant, and whiskers.
There was also the T-shaped palmyra stick, short and crooked, on which the monk
supported himself when he sat in meditation. As a teacher, Ramadass was in
charge of the annual school stage event, and often he himself had taken the
role of the sage Narada–the mischief-making sage of classical mythology–who
composed quarrels. Ramadass had always wanted to be an actor; something told
him that he had in him the makings of a great actor. His life itself had been a
long piece of superb acting. There he seemed to have succeeded but on the
actual stage he was a failure. After the death of his wife, he wanted to be a
philosopher and a sage in real life. Once he met a band of mendicants in a
railway carriage. They spoke to him of the glory of renunciation, and of the
ecstacy of meditation in the heart of the <st1:place w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place>;
he thought of Buddha and of Ramakrishna and was lost in imagined spiritual
bliss. As the train stopped, however, the band of mendicants were marched off
by the ticket examiner for ticketless travel, and his vision was shattered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Almost
without his knowing, Ramadass had donned the loose garb of the monk, attached
the whiskers to his chin, wound a piece of yellow cloth as turban, and looked
into the mirror on the wall. The costume fitted him admirably. He looked every
inch a sage. The look of benevolence, the pursed lips, and the purposeful
knitting of eyebrows–these had imparted the calm of repose. The grey hairs now
symbolised maturity and wisdom. Yes, this was his real forte. He was meant for
the role of the Recluse. Suddenly an idea occurred to him–how will it be to
look at the world in the make up of the mendicant! It should be a thrilling
experience. The clock struck three as though it approved of his idea. He called
to the maid and told her that she need not come for the day. He took the T
-shaped stick in his hand, bolted the door of the wall inside, locked up the
door opening into the yard, looked up and down the street, and making sure that
none had seen him, stepped out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

walked a few steps, so as to get a complete view of his house, and gazed at it
fondly, as though he was looking at it for the last time. A minute after, he
started walking briskly and soon came on to the main thoroughfare, wondering
whether anybody had recognised him. As he looked on the passers by he felt
distant and somehow superior. There they were, miserable, crawling humanity,
each wrapped up in a cloud of care, weeping for what they knew not. That was
the bank clerk hurrying back home from office–his home was another bank where
he handed over money to his–life across the bedstead. In that car went the
Government official hatching schemes that would secure him rapid promotion. As
their ambitions were fulfilled they became bolder and aimed at bigger things,
till at last the clouds burst and destroyed what they had achieved. Yet, they
were happy because they wanted some thing. Only those who did not know what
they wanted were unhappy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

came to the park where urchins played and pedlars were trying to sell things.
He saw a couple of ‘Sadhus’ inhaling ‘bhang’. Anxious to avoid running into
them, he moved on stealthily and came to the bank of the canal. Alongside of it
were several huts and a group of women seated under a tree, weaving palmleaf
baskets. He began walking briskly till he reached a solitary spot. He heard
footsteps and when he turned round, he saw a man who accosted him with the traditional
obeisance. He was careworn and his eyes were wet with tears which he brushed
aside with a towel thrown across his shoulder. Ramadass wondered whether he
should speak to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Swamiji, I knew you would be here. There, you see, my wife and my girl ‘Radha’
are in the jukta. We came to the park and I knew you would be here. My wife
wants to pay her respects to you. This is my ‘Hari’–he was only slightly bruised.
The doctor put a bandage and, Swamiji, what you said was right. What she was
reading was not an old letter; she was only looking over an old photograph–our
wedding photograph. It was exactly as you had described. The photograph
transported her into a world of romance, and I was an intruder. I was foolish,
I told her all and sought her pardon. You are a miracle, Swamiji. But wait a
minute, I will bring her here. The man went hurriedly followed by Hari.
Ramadass saw the woman alighting, get down, and walk slowly towards him. He
looked at her and quickly walked away. When the man returned he was gone far
and the man whet running after him. ‘Oh Swamiji, why do you go away? Won’t you
bless my wife and children?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

began walking quickly till he came to the main thoroughfare. He saw the man
turn back towards the park. Ramadass knew the moment he saw Hari that he
himself was the culprit. Only a few hours ago he had seen the photograph of
himself as a boy of fifteen. Hari closely resembled the boy in the photograph.
The words of the girl at play ‘I caught the culprit’ rang in his ears. The
laughter knocked at his heart and he was unmasked. He thought philosophy sham
and man a humbug. He was the humbug. Did he love his wife and ask her
forgiveness? Was his threat to expose the school management inspired by hate
for them or by love of<i> </i>the good?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reached the street which led to his house. His pace slackened and his eyes had
become wet with tears. A six-day old moon stood on the sky covered by a thin
white cloud. He looked at the faint stars, the wan moon and saw a light flash
in the darkness of his mind. The street was empty. Here and there a light
showed up in the windows of the houses. There was his house, where he hid all
these years. He was always hiding, in the house, in the school, behind whiskers
and gowns. And now he was sought out. He could hide no more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Ramadass suddenly turned back, walked on and reached
the end of the street. He crossed the main thoroughfare and walked past the
park and soon came to the tents on the bank of the canal. He pulled out his
whiskers and threw them in the water. He walked on and on, towards the blue
hill covered in mists, towards too mystery beyond.</p>

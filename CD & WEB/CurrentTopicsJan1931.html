<P>THE RETURN OF PEACE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We rejoice that, as a result of the prolonged conversations between Gandhiji and Lord Irwin, a general cessation of hostilities has been ordered. This is but the prelude to the convening of another Round Table Conference in which the Congress will participate and help to evolve a constitution for Swaraj India. The terms of truce indicate that each side has shown commendable anxiety to restore normal conditions, and settle down to constructive work. Despite the fears of a breakdown at one stage, the prayerful earnestness of two devout individuals and the untiring efforts of the trio of peace-makers have achieved a moral triumph</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">rare in the world's history and absolutely unique as between a dominant and a dependent nation. Here it was not a victor that dictated terms to the vanquished, but the representatives of two great nations–good men and true–that discussed all problems in a friendly spirit and explored the avenues to peace. The spirit behind the agreement is thus of greater import than the terms. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first time in recent years, the Congress and the Government of India have been brought face to face, not as opposing powers claiming the nation's allegiance, but as the Governments of today and of tomorrow. The Congress is no longer a mere deliberative organisation ‘ventilating grievances’ and pressing for reforms, but the incarnation of the National Will–the one body which the Government of the day must satisfy and treat with. The discussions of Gandhiji with the Working Committee on the one hand, and of Lord Irwin with his Executive Council on the other, have taken on the character of deliberations of cabinets of equal rank, preparatory to the conclusion of an alliance of amity and friendship. This is an immense gain from the national point of view, even apart from what is yet to follow. The new Round Table Conference will be a live body capable of not only deciding momentous issues but of carrying them into effect. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mahatma Gandhi has once again demonstrated that he is essentially a man of peace. Where smaller men would gloat over their triumphs, he is filled with humility and calls upon his followers to be likewise. His success at the present moment is of happy augury not for India alone but for the world, for, has he not shown that in the strife between nations there is a power mightier than the sword? Verily is he the Prince of Peace, the harbinger of a new era in human history.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">INDIA AND WORLD OPINION</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Valuable evidence is pouring in from everywhere that the Indian struggle for freedom under the leadership of Gandhiji has created a splendid impression in other lands. Shri Rabindranath Tagore, who returned from abroad last month, speaks of this &quot;new technique in the history of revolution, which is in keeping with the spiritual traditions of our country&quot; and how, &quot;the noble spirit of courage and sacrifice manifested&quot; has won the admiration of Europe and America. Prof. N. G. Ranga, who represented, though unofficially, the Congress viewpoint to British audiences at the time of the Round Table Conference, was struck by the magic influence exerted by Gandhi's name. On his return journey he visited Italy, and on one occasion a number of Fascist soldiers accorded him a military salute, noticing that he was wearing a Gandhi cap; and they proceeded to explain, &quot;This is our salute to Gandhi.&quot; Yet another friend, Mr. N. Krishnamurti–the Travancore Secretary to Mr. T. Raghaviah at the Conference–tells how he walked proudly &quot;the proud cities of Europe&quot; just because he was a compatriot of Gandhi. The number of foreign journalists besieging &quot;Anand Bhavan&quot; at Allahabad and Dr. Ansari's residence at Delhi affords another striking testimony to the interest aroused by India. The exchange of cables between Gandhiji and the Rev. J. H. Holmes of New York is significant. All this is to the good. The Indian issue has now become a world-problem, and peace in India is the best guarantee of world-peace.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PANDIT MOTILAL</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The noblest of modern Indian statesmen has been snatched away just when the need for statesmanship is greatest. A halo of glory and romance surrounds the memory of this prince among men. At a critical moment in his country's fortunes, he, along with the late Desabandhu Das, came to the forefront in Indian politics, and for over a decade he went from victory to victory till, on the eve of the greatest victory of all, he laid down his precious life urging with his last breath that the fate of India must be settled in the historic ‘Swaraj Bhavan.’ It was the fond wish of everyone that with the establishment of Swaraj in India, Pandit Motilal should be our first Premier. But he was not fated to watch over the final fruition of the nation's hopes. One incident in his great career must have filled him with legitimate pride. The Presidentship of the Indian National Congress is one of the greatest elective offices on earth. He filled this office twice, and on the last occasion passed it on to his gifted son. We doubt if such a thing ever happened in any nation's history. If the younger Pitt had succeeded to be Premiership of Great Britain immediately after Chatham, or if young Maurice had been elected Stadtholder of the Netherlands in succession to William of Orange, there might have been a parallel. As it is, the Nehrus, father and son, have broken all record. The name of Motilal Nehru will be enshrined for ever in the nation's memory, and future ages will speak of him as another King Janaka of Mithila.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE UNKNOWN VOLUNTEER</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Immediately after his release from prison, President Jawaharlal paid an eloquent tribute to the services of the volunteers. During the Great War just praise was lavished on the young men of Britain and of other warring nations for the magnificent part played by them. From Raymond Asquith, son of the Premier, down to the humblest private, they went forth to fight and risked their lives, that succeeding generations might enjoy the privileges of independent nationhood. But infinitely greater is the heroism of the Indian volunteer who walked in processions <I>knowing </I>that the procession would be broken up by force, picketed foreign cloth shops <I>knowing </I>that he would be beaten mercilessly and dragged in the streets like a dog, knowing too that he would be condemned to the &quot;C&quot; Class and suffer untold humiliation. The soldier in armed warfare takes the chances of war. He may live or he may die. But with the non-violent Indian volunteer, it is the certainty of being beaten, coupled with the equally certain factor of absolute non-resistance on his side, that lifts the fight to an altogether higher plane and invests him with the glory that was Christ's. These are the flower of modern Indian chivalry, men and women who have made history. In song and in rhyme let their triumphs be sung. In the cities and in the villages, let a grateful nation erect memorials to the &quot;Unknown Volunteer.&quot;</P>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Andhra University deserves to be congratulated on the election of Dr. Radhakrishnan as Vice-Chancellor. At a time when large schemes are awaiting inauguration, the services of the new Vice-Chancellor will, be simply invaluable. Our only regret is that the name of the revered scholar and saint of Andhra, Sir R. Venkataratnam, should have been dragged into this affair. We devoutly hope that the bitterness engendered by the election will be forgotten and that, at long last, the University may be given an opportunity to contribute to our cultural renaissance.</P>

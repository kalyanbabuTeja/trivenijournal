<p class=MsoTitle>THE ART OF MAHALINGAM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:26.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>By P. M. NI TYANANDAN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
living in an age of tensions and laxities and the frightening insecurity of the
atom, I consider myself and a few million others astoundingly lucky to have
belonged to an age in which T. R. Mahalingam lived and played his glorious
music on the flute. He is one of the few living passports to a rather plane to
which we <span class=GramE>Can</span> retreat, be it for an hour or two, and
forget the world and its cares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is the secret of his appeal? As a dabbler in the art, but also as one who has
heard Mahalingam for many years with equal parts of veneration and analysis, I
venture to make a few comments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Is
it his originality? There is no doubt that he is extremely inventive. There is
hardly a performance of his which does not contain something new and striking,
whether it <span class=GramE>be</span> one of his distinctive mellifluous
flights, or an unusual changing of <span class=SpellE><i>gathi</i></span><i>. </i>And
he has the gift of showmanship, producing it when it is least expected. His
originality is at once the despair of <span class=GramE>conservative</span>
circles and the delight of the less-exclusive. That he is a tireless
experimenter, never static, is indicated by his recent preoccupation with <span
class=SpellE><i>talam</i></span><i>. </i>It can truly be said there is little
he plays like everyone else. Yet, in a broader aspect, he is not alone in this.
Hence creativeness only cannot be his charm. Though he is transcendentally
fertile in imagination, this can only be an ingredient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps
it is due to his perfection of finger-control. His fingers move incredibly fast
at times, and his mastery over cross-fingering and doubled notes (with which he
produces some beautiful effects) is complete. Time and again one is astonished
by the variety and the number of the notes he plays in the smallest compass of
time or <span class=SpellE><i>tala</i></span><i> </i>measure. His consummate
handling of the delicate nuances of semitone passages, as in the gamut of <span
class=SpellE><i>Todi</i></span><i>, </i>is sufficient evidence of his
accomplishment, for this is not easily come by on the instrument. He has
successfully investigated more quarter-tones on the flute than, probably, anyone
else. But yet, is that all? Facility of playing has been achieved by others,
who approach him in his own techniques, albeit they were mostly developed by
him. We have, therefore, to look elsewhere to discover the uniqueness of his
music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Physical control is of the body, and originality is
of the mind. In addition to these, it is my firm opinion that emotion, which is
of the heart, is what makes Mahalingam a colossus in the field of artistic
interpretation. <span class=SpellE>Carnatic</span> music is very emotional in
appeal: with emotion, it is all; without! <span class=GramE>it</span> is as
dead as the dodo. And Mahalingam has a phenomenal ability to translate emotion
through his fingers and lips. Two factors conduce to this. The first is his
remarkable control over volume, by which he is able to stress a note hard and
then reduce it to a tiny squeak without ever breaking the thread. The second,
and more important, is what I would call–for want of a better term–his
wholeheartedness. (Incidentally both these qualities are axiomatic among
singers and instrumentalists who transcend normal capabilities. A good example
is <span class=SpellE>Dwaram</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkataswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Naidu</span>.) A keen observer of Mahalingam would notice that
there is not a single passage, nay a note, into which he does not put all of
himself. Never is he casual. It is only then that every single note is given
its correct status of pitch, and, what is equally important, volume. This is
apparent in the slow and studied elaboration of his <span class=SpellE>alaapana</span>.
That is why his style of playing most closely approximates to the highly individualistic
cadences, of <span class=SpellE>Carnatic</span> music in a Singer’s voice, and
it is these familiar cadences heard with overwhelming Sweetness on the flute,
that form the core of his appeal. That is, I believe, his entire secret. He has
very wisely chosen to imitate the human voice and its melody at its best,
rather than to set up the instrument as a law unto itself; a law that does not
exclude harsh and discordant sounds as long as they are made on the flute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

emotionless musician is an artistic robot. Virtuosity is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>attainable,
but emotion is inherent: the mark of only an artist of stature. That is why so
much music is like animated clay. In our preoccupation with Mahalingam's
virtuosity, we are apt to overlook this fundamental capacity of his–a capacity
which would undoubtedly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>have singled him out in whatever art-form
he chose to follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
There are those who enjoy his music, but complain of his inconsistent playing
on some days, to <span class=GramE>whom</span> I have no answer to make except
to say that there are other days on the calendar. There are others who <span
class=SpellE>criticise</span> his <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> and
manners on and off the platform. This is so absurdly irrelevant to his music
that I forthwith deny them further space in this article.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all his critics are agreed that he is a genius, whatever that oft-tortured term
may mean.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
all ephemeral things he will soon be a milestone that is left behind, and
posterity will be the poorer for it. For, as long as this system of music is in
vogue, we may not see a flutist the like of him again. Here, truly, is an
artist: when comes such another?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

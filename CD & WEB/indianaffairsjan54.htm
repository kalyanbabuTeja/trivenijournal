<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>1953 ended on a note of optimism in the speeches of
the Finance Minister and other Ministers in Parliament. On the ‘food front’ we
seem to have not only turned the corner and actually crossed the wood, but also
to be having troubles in the opposite direction–of falling agricultural prices!
In the industrial sector also production figures are encouraging; within the
last 30 years production here has increased by 150 per cent. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has just
concluded an agreement for the erection of a steel plant with a German firm,
placed orders for a huge stock of railway engines and wagons, planned to tide
off the wave of unemployment by a business-like resolve to spend another <span
class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 170 <span class=SpellE>crores</span> in the public
sector, and so on and so forth. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>

seems to be undaunted, like many in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

from the happy trend noticed above, we observe the beginnings of a few others
which augur well for our future in what we may call the ‘public life of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’. One
such important development may be found in the relations between the Government
on the one hand and the public on the other, and even the academic economists,
in the counsels of the country. Take, for instance, the patient hearing the
Prime Minister gave, along with the <span class=SpellE>Deshmukhs</span>, to the
deliberations of the Federation of Indian Chambers at Calcutta; or look at the
cordial relations that prevailed during the meetings of the Export Advisory and
Import Advisory Councils; or watch the attempt made by the Commerce Minister to
meet the economists half-way at <span class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>. Hitherto, the
opinion was held strongly in some quarters that Government was trying to woo
only Labour and the voters, but, lo, there is a change, and the Government has
now the patience to hear the complaints of the merchants and manufacturers, the
view-point of the exporters and importers and consumers, and even that of the
Economists!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Or,
am I mistaken about the latter class of intellectuals of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I mean
the economists? At the recent conference of the economists at <span
class=SpellE>Jaipur</span>, for the first time, the spokesmen of the Government
and the academic economists of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
met on a common platform to understand each other–or, is it to find fault with
each other? Hitherto for the last twenty years (for which I can vouchsafe)
neither the Government nor the Press in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> took any serious interest in
the deliberations of the economists in their annual conferences, or of the
teachers of Political Science who have been meeting for the last 16 years. This
apathy was striking, and unfortunate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
complaint of the Government is that teachers are too academic and their
proceedings are doctrinaire and therefore unrealistic, though Sri <span
class=SpellE>Krishnamachari</span> admitted, quoting Prof. <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Rostov</span></span><span class=GramE>, that</span> the economists
should move on the economic plane. But a more pertinent question is; who is
more <span class=GramE>doctrinaire</span>, the Government or the teachers? Are
not the Reserve Bank and the Finance Ministry (and the Planning Commission)
applying the economics which they learnt from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> with its emphasis on </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bank-rate,

<span class=GramE>plan</span> the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>base, and the
super-structure will take care of itself. Look at the statement of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Deshmukh</span>, in answer to a question put by the Editor of the
‘Eastern Economist’. Asked to state the benefits of the Revised Plan in terms
of employment and per capita income, Sri <span class=SpellE>Deshmukh</span>
said that they “had no ready formula which would enable us to reckon what the
effect of this spending in the public sector on the total economy would be.
What you have to consider is the aggregate level of investment and of economic
activity in general in the system as a whole. The object, of course, is to step
up total expenditure. By increasing the investment in the public sector, <span
class=GramE>We</span> would be enlarging the money incomes in the community and
then these incomes will create additional demands for consumer goods.” This is
certainly planning to build on Adam Smith’s tomb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am glad, however, that we now see the necessity to
base our plans on theories and our policies on principles. Three distinct
schools of thought could be distinguished in the Government agencies as well as
among the academicians. A school of thought <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt'>in the Government believes in the doctrinaire economic policies, and is
trained in the traditional British Universities. This is similar </span>to the
one that exists among the academic economists from whom the advisers of the
former are largely drawn. A second school in the Government believes in
pragmatism, while another tries to steer a middle course–is it
middle?–believing that the social structure and the politics of a nation are
partly determined by its economic life and that, at the same time, the
operation of the economy is partially determined by the social and political
framework. These three may be said to be represented roughly by the Finance
Minister (and the Planning Commission), the Food Minister, and the Commerce
Minister respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Outside
the Government there is the school roughly represented by the large majority of
the academicians, trained in English and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">American</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Universities</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
trying to apply their half-digested theories from foreign text-books, based on
foreign experience and foreign conditions. The second school <span class=GramE>is,</span>
what may be called, the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> school, trying to
apply the canons of ‘bullock-cart economy’ to the Atomic age. The third school
is in an insignificant minority and unable to make its existence felt. It
believes in taking the ‘facts’ of a country into consideration and applying to
them our previous knowledge in order to achieve a pre-determined end. This may
be called the ‘<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Realistic</st1:PlaceName>

are thus coming out of the nebula and beginning to base our policies on
principles so that the people are now in a position to understand them better.
This is in contrast with the old method of putting into practice whatever one’s
convictions or even fanaticism tells them; and in this list I put, as examples,
the <span class=SpellE>Vanamahotsava</span> of Sri <span class=SpellE>Munshi</span>
and the Elementary Education Scheme of Sri Rajaji. Whatever might be their
intrinsic merits, such changes and schemes should be the result of collective
thinking and clear ideas. Rajaji is reported to have said that he insisted on
the scheme because it was his idea since a long time. A social reformer in <st1:City
w:st="on">Madras</st1:City> seems to have suggested recently–and a similar
suggestion was given in <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place> a few years
before–that nobody should be employed in Government service unless he or she
marries into another caste! Any idea, however good, ought not to determine the
policy of the Government before it is thoroughly discussed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Asking the question: Can we develop agriculture so as to keep pace with the
number specified in Table 10? (<span class=GramE>indicating</span> a terrible
increase in population by 1981), the Report answers that only birth control by
our women, ‘a near miracle’, can save us. Obviously, as one Journal has pointed
out, the Report has not taken into account the possible increase in
agricultural production as well as in our capacity to import food. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> is

the Plan seems to be all right, though one or two special features require our
attention. Firstly, it has been shown that we have so far been unable to use
our foreign exchange resources. The second feature is that private industry is
not happy with the concept of mixed economy in our Welfare State, the latest to
join in the chorus of protests being (Sir) <span class=SpellE>Homi</span> <span

which requires careful attention, is that the Government have done a great deal
to impair private enterprise, and governmental policy is lacking in consistency

chosen from the period of survey. Recently it was reported that the Commerce
Minister was thinking of a new policy for <span class=SpellE>industrialising</span>
the country–the State would first start industries, in some cases where private
capital was not coming into the field, and then, after they are successful,
hand over these industries to private enterprise. This new policy is just the
opposite to the current policy whereby it was reported that the State might <span
class=SpellE>nationalise</span> industries started by private enterprise after
they are proved successful, though of late the members of the Government have
been at pains to convince the industrialists that they were not going to <span
class=SpellE>nationalise</span> much. Now which of these policies stands? What
is our objective–to <span class=SpellE>industrialise</span> the country, or to <span
class=SpellE>nationalise</span>, or both? Pandit Nehru is reported to have
exhorted the nation to become ‘share-holders in India Ltd’. An excellent idea,
indeed, and it must certainly <span class=GramE>enthuse</span> the people,
coming as it does from their idol. But why not devise a practical way of making
the people <i>actual </i>share-holders instead of making them merely <i>feel </i>so?
This can be done by suitably altering Sri <span class=SpellE>Krishnamachari’s</span>
reported plan, whereby the State, after starting and successfully running new
industries, will hand them over to a private Finance Corporation in which the
people and the State have equal shares. This can also solve one of the
headaches of the Planning Commission, as to how to make the people save and
invest more. People are willing to save provided they get a reasonable return,
and shares in a <i>good </i>industrial concern run by the Government will
attract them better than a mere 4 per cent on the Small Savings Scheme. I may
also suggest that the State might throw open half the shares of the Railways to
public subscription after making the Railways a joint-stock company, or invite
public subscription for the proposed steel plant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
levy of death duties, recently proposed, is another example of that
‘inconsistent’ thinking. No doubt, it is true that the idea of death duties was
there for the last twenty and odd <span class=GramE>years,</span> and also that
the purpose of taxation is accepted as socio-political. Yet, there are two
points deserving our attention. The Government <span class=GramE>want</span>
private capital to play its part, and yet they tax it right and left–that is
Sir <span class=SpellE>Homi’s</span> charge–and also collect all the available
capital through small savings and big savings! Again, the Government <span
class=GramE>have</span> recently appointed a Taxation Enquiry Commission to go
into the matter very comprehensively; could not the Government wait, it may be
asked, till its Report is available? Critics have also pointed out that the new
tax might not fulfill our expectations. In the first place, if its object is to
reduce inequality, then, not only is the rate suggested too small, but also the
experience of countries like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shows that inequality cannot be reduced by either death duties or even by
steeply progressive income-tax. Secondly, the yield also may not be much in a
country like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
where wealth is hidden in gold and cash, and where family ties are strong. We
can easily transfer or gift away our property to our sons or grandsons or to
wives without any compunction, which no average Westerner could do, for fear of
divorce etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This raises-apart from the merits of the legislation
itself–a point of fundamental constitutional importance. Should the Legislature
conduct itself according to the written Constitution, or should the
Constitution be changed to suit the purpose of a State Legislature? All
theories of the Constitution support the former view–that the Legislature
should not go against the Constitution and that the Constitution is written and
made rigid exactly to prevent this contingency. <span class=GramE>Originally
Art.</span> 31 was the result of a long discussion inside and outside the
Constituent Assembly, and the compromise formula was moved by Pandit Nehru
himself. It is interesting to note that during the discussion Pandit Nehru made
it clear that the object was <span class=SpellE>zamindari</span> abolition and
it should be fulfilled, Constitution or no Constitution, courts or no courts.
“The Constitution is the creature of Parliament,” he declared to the
bewilderment of constitutional <span class=SpellE>Pandits</span>, and it would
be changed if necessary, and change they did to abolish <span class=SpellE>zamindari</span>.
But should it be changed as often as it comes in the way of an enthusiastic
Legislature?</p>

old complaint thus stands vindicated, that either we have not understood the
Constitution or we are forgetting it. I may cite two more examples. The
question was recently asked in the M.P. Assembly as to when an unseated
Minister–unseated by the action of the Tribunal–ceases to be a Minister in the
light of A. 164 (4), and I may add, in the light of A. 193, because if he
ceases to be a Member and a Minister, he is liable to be punished for attending
the Assembly. The decision of the Speaker of the M.P. Assembly seems to be that
the Minister could remain for six months after the Gazette notification
unseating him. Without meaning any disrespect to the Speaker, it may very
respectfully be argued, (1) that an election that is declared null and void
unseats the Member from the date of his election as he was <i>never </i>elected
at all, and because he was a Minister he could continue so for six months from
the date of his first appointment; and (2) that if the Minister should attend
the Assembly again (i.e. after the expiry of the six-month period) he
automatically comes under Art. 193. It may also be added, (1) that he simply
‘ceases’ to be a Minister–the courts can refuse to enforce his orders under A.
164 (4), and there is no need for resignation or dismissal; and (2) that the
Governor could again appoint him a Minister by a notification. There was a
similar case in <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place> but there the Minister
resigned in time, and another case is pending now in Orissa; and as such cases
-may increase, it is time some definite conclusion is reached on this. The Best
course seems to be for the President to get the opinion of the Supreme Court
under Art. 143.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the way the two Houses are likely to work in future. The Houses calmed down–it

would be better, some argue, if we accept the simple basis that <st1:country-region

wants </i>linguistic States. Two more points may be noted: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>)
even if the people speak the same language, there can be two States, as <st1:City

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>IN ancient India the poet was indeed a “maker” in
an absolute sense. The words of the true poet were so potent as to shape
reality. The story is told of King Bhoja that he was eager to know the epitaph
that Kalidasa would write on his death, and he begged the great poet to
rehearse the composition of the verse. The poet refused to comply with the
request, for if he supposed the king’s death in his verse, the king must be
dead in truth. The King’s curiosity was irrepressible. He went in disguise and
surprised the poet one day with the news of the king’s death. Kalidasa burst
forth with a verse immediately, and the disguised man fell dead to the ground.
The King’s identity was immediately known and Kalidasa was shocked. He had
however only to resay his verse, changing the original words cleverly so as to
indicate that the King was alive on earth, to bring back the King to life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The highest poetry is the poetry of devotion to
God, and the great poet who turns only to God for inspiration scorns earthly
and material wealth. He does not resort to kings’ courts, but lives in secluded
independence He lives and prospers by his faith in, and entire dependence on,
God, and he necessarily undergoes many hardships in life, because of his
uncompromising idealism. Potana, the Telugu poet who lived in the fifteenth
century was a poet of such an exalted ideal. He translated the Bhagavatam, the
stories of God Vishnu, from Sanskrit into Telugu. This translation is of such
literary worth that it bears the impress of original work. The Hindu conception
of Vishnu and his incarnations is full of splendour and poetic inspiration.
“For the protection of the virtuous and the destruction of the wicked, for
establishing righteousness, I am born, in age after age,” said the Lord God.
God is a knight- errant labouring to establish righteousness in age after age.
This splendid conception became naturally a great inspiration to devotees and
to poets. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Potana was a farmer holding the plough on his own
field. He refused to go to courts. He wrote melodious poetry in which narrative
and description were utilised in the service of establishing devotion to
Vishnu. The Bhagavatam is the collection of stories describing the life and
achievements of each great incarnation of God Vishnu. Each of these stories is
told attractively, though Potana’s task was only that of a translator. While
preserving his loyalty to the Sanskrit original, improved on it, making it
accessible to thousands of readers to whom Sanskrit is a closed door. Potana
made his translation explanatory and what was stated too concisely in the
original was elaborated clearly in the language of the common people. Telugu,
like Malayalam, has cherished the tradition of enriching its language with the
incorporation of the beautiful and delicate expressions of Sanskrit. The
emotional qualities of Potana’s style draw our fervent admiration. Love,
devotion, and heroism are all blended to produce a surpassing effect, to
enthrall the mind of the reader or the hearer. The heroic deeds of Sri Krishna,
Prahalada’s invincible faith in Vishnu as against the traditional attitude of
his family, and the story of “The Elephant-King’s Emancipation are among the
extraordinary parts of Potana’s work. Krishna the lover and Krishna the suitor
for Rukmini’s hand are delightfully depicted. The beauty of Potana’s poetry
goes deeper than melody, racy narrative, and apt description. He has a profound
understanding of good and evil. Evil is purely negative and must get absorbed
in good sooner or later. The wicked beings who appear as God’s adversaries are
so only temporarily, and receive the grace of God soon after. As a creative
artist, Potana must claim his place with the greatest of the world. Like
Shakespeare he humanizes the villains from whom it is impossible to withhold
sympathy on several occasions. Hiranyakasipu, the father of Prahlada is an
instance. By family tradition he was opposed to the worship of Vishnu, and yet
his son was bursting into ardent devotion for Vishnu in spite of all the
efforts to direct his mind another way. The father remonstrates gently with his
son about this, but the son is unalterable. The language used by Hiranyakasipu
is reflective at once of deep affection and concern for his son, and of sharp
disappointment that the son expresses his allegiance to the Enemy of his own
race of Asuras. In the story of Bali again, another adversary of God, we are
touched by Bali’s high sense of honour. The Lord God Vishnu has chosen to be
born on earth as Vamana, the dwarf-Brahmin who approaches Bali to ask for a
gift, of just three feet of earth. This is a trick, for in measuring three
feet, Vamana means to grow to an infinite stature, so that his three feet cover
the upper, the lower and the middle worlds. Sukrachari, Bali’s family priest,
utters a note of warning and tries his best to prevent the fulfilment of the
gift to Vamana. Though apprised of the peril lying ahead, Bali is unshaken in
his generous resolve to make the gift. Was it not a great and coveted privilege
to be the giver, with one’s palm held higher while pouring down the ceremonial
water of sanctifying a gift, while the palm of the Lord Himself is below, in
the role of the recipient of the gift? For the moment Bali speaks the language
of the ardent devotee of Vishnu in detailing His greatness. Critics have
sometimes said that Bali was actuated by vanity, and this was a weakness on
which Vishnu appropriately wrought to achieve His purpose. A better explanation
is that Bali retained his gentlemanly sense even in the calamitous hour when
the prospect of losing his kingdom faced him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Potana was a Brahmin born at Vontimitta (the
one-hilled) in Cudapah district in the year 1300 of the Salivahan era,
corresponding to 1377A.D. One of his works is dated in the reign of the great
Devaraya of Vijayanagar who reigned from 1422 to 1447. So Potana’s work belongs
to the 15th century. When all other poets lived comfortably under royal
patronage, Potana preferred to endure poverty. Srinatha, the brother of
Potana’s wife, also a great poet lived in affluence, enjoying the patronage of
the Reddi chiefs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>While wandering in the neighbouring town of
Vontimitta, Potana, while yet a boy, received the favour of a sage known as
Jithananda who initiated him in the mysteries of poetic creation. Actuated by
the resolution to render the Bhagavatham into Telugu, Potana journeyed to the
Ganges, and meditated on Rama the great incarnation of Vishnu. Sri Rama
appeared in person, expressed approval of Potana’s great aim, and disappeared.
Though Sri Rama is mentioned at the beginning, Potana names Sri Krishna as the
divinity to whom he dedicates his work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The purity, simplicity, and beauty of Potana’s
style are remarkable. How did such chaste writing belong only to the Cudapah
district, and not to any other part of the Telugu country? In fact, spoken
Telugu is nowhere so free of dialectal eccentricities as in the region long
known as the Ceded districts. Could it be due to the fact that the
neighbourhood of the two sister languages of the same stock, Kannada and Tamil,
helps to check eccentric developments in Telugu?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A number of legends have grown about the life
events of Potana, and these invest the name with a perpetual romance. Potana’s
story attracted the making of a film picture some years ago, which thousands
witnessed eagerly. Fortunately for us, the great scholar Nagapudi Kuppuswami
Aiyar has told the story of Potana concisely and clearly in his Preface to the
monumental edition of the Bhagavatam published originally by Messrs. V.
Venkatakrishriama Chetty and Sons. The legends are of miracles which testify to
Potana’s invincible faith in Vishnu, by which God came to his succor every time
he was faced with personal danger. Once God descended in the form of a white
boar to rid him of the obnoxious messengers of a chieftain, who went to coerce
him into dedicating his work to the chieftain. A famous stanza in the story of
the Elephant-king is said to have been written by God himself, when Potana had
temporarily left his script, feeling quite unable to continue his writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The most significant legends are however associated
with the attempts made by Srinatha, the poet’s brother-in law, to induce Potana
to dedicate his great poem to the ruler of the Carnatic. Srinatha wanted to
impress on Potana the splendour of his own life, and the great powers wielded
by him. Potana’s son was holding the plough, and Potana sitting by, as Srinatha
rode along in his palanquin. With a view to make a demonstration, Srinatha
asked the palanquin-bearers in the fore-part to let go their hold, and the
palanquin continued to move as before. When Mallana the son reported the wonder
to his father, the latter bade his men take off one of the two oxen drawing the
plough, and the plough was found to move on as before. Srinatha next asked the
bearers of the hind part to go off, and still the palanquin moved on. Potana
however retorted by letting go the second ox of the plough, and the plough
still moved on as before. The delighted Srinatha stepped down from his vehicle
and offered his greetings to Potana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>With a numerous company Srinatha arrived at
Potana’s house, as if to put to test his capacity to feed the guests. There
were not sufficient provisions at home, and Potana made a vain attempt to borrow,
sending out his son for the purpose. He then prayed to the goddess Sarasvati
who bade him erect a screen at the end of the dining room. Meanwhile Srinatha
arranged his company to sit down for the meal and demanded it of his sister.
Plates and basins of food appeared miraculously behind the screen and Potana’s
wife was in a position to serve a sumptuous meal to all the guests, according
to the story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Once again Srinatha begged of his brother-in-law to
dedicate his Bhagavatam to a royal personage and so earn the means of a
comfortable life, giving up his poverty. Potana almost yielded to this when
Sarasvati (Goddess of Learning) stood before him with tears flowing from her
eyes. Potana put an end to her misery by assuring her that he would not
dedicate his work to a mere mortal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Another story is of a critical exchange between
Potana and Srinatha over a stanza which occurs in the narrative of the
Elephant-king. Potana tells us the Lord God is upset by the piteous cry of the
elephant for protection when attacked by a crocodile, and He rushes forth
towards the elephant, without a moment’s preparation. He neither tells his
consort Lakshmi nor puts on his divine weapons, Sankha and Chakra. Nor does he
requisition his vehicle, Garuda, the king of the birds. He hardly adjusts even
his clothes after leaving his couch–such is the haste with which God proceeds
to give succour to his devotee. Srinatha mocked at this stanza. Was God so
thoughtless as to run to see the elephant without weapons to kill the enemy
with? Did he go to see fun? Potana heard the criticism in silence only to wait
for an opportunity to give a crushing retort. The next morning Srinatha sat
shampooing his head and body with oil, before his bath. Potana hid Srinatha’s
son somewhere, and went to the back of the house and pushed a heavy stone into
the well, and hastened to tell Srinatha that his son had fallen into the well.
Shocked and started, with disarranged hair, dripping oil and wearing scanty
clothes on his person, Srinatha hurried to the well, and peeped into it. Potana
kept on asking, why this haste? Where is a ladder, and where the ropes with
which to rescue the fallen boy? Where are the men who will dive in the water?
Did you come to see fun? It was for Potana to explain that the Lord God if as
the same anxiety about the safety of his devotees as that which a father owes
his son.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Bhagavatam is an imperishable monument to
Potana’s glory. It is a work of beauty, a source of perpetual joy to all who
hold the key to the Telugu language, whatever their own mother-tongue may be.
The Bhagavatam embodies the most inspiring form of the Hindu faith. The music
and melody of the poetry are untranslatable, and it will be worth pains of any
Hindu to master the Telugu language, the Italian of India, to be able to enjoy
Potana’s Bhagavatam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

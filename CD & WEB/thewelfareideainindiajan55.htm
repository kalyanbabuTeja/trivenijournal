<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
term ‘Welfare State’ is so often used in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> that it has stayed
permanently in our minds. Yet it is not a term used at all about five years
back when our Constitution was on the anvil, nor is it a term whose
significance is understood by all that use it. I propose to <span class=SpellE>analyse</span>
the implications of a Welfare State as understood by us in this country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About
the time when our leaders were busy making the Constitution, they were not
using the term at all, though they again and again mentioned in their speeches
in the Constituent Assembly that their Constitution was mainly intended to do
justice to the ‘common man’–probably the economic and social under-dog. Though
not directly discussed by the Assembly, the question incidentally cropped up
whether the new State of India should be socialistic in conception or not.
Opposing a move on the part of Prof. K. T. Shah to call India a ‘Union of
Socialist Republics’, Dr. Ambedkar vehemently maintained that the State should
not itself be based on any philosophy of life, but should strictly create a
political machinery which will enable political parties from time to time to
execute their policies, as <span class=GramE>approved</span> by the electorate
according to their own prevailing notions. “The Constitution,” he declared; “is
merely a mechanism for the purpose of regulating the work of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>various
organs of the State; it is not a mechanism whereby particular members or
particular parties are installed in office,” and added, “what should be the
policy of the State, how the society </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>should be <span
class=SpellE>organised</span>” on its social and economic side, are matters
which must be decided by the people themselves according to time and
circumstances.”<sup>1</sup> The same idea was reiterated by Sri Alladi. He
said, “While it is not committed to any particular <span class=SpellE>reorganisation</span>
of society, the people are free to adjust and mould the economic condition for
their betterment in any manner they choose.”<sup> 2 </sup>If it was not
intended to usher in a socialistic State, neither was it intensified to
preserve Capitalism. Speaking generally on the ‘property clauses’ in the
Constitution (Art. 19 and Art. 31), Sri <span class=SpellE>Krishnamachari</span>,
on behalf of the Drafting Committee, said: “This does not really mean that
there is any particular right in regard to private property as such, no more
than what any person even in any absolutely socialistic regime will desire,
that what he possesses, what are absolutely necessary for his life...should be
secured to him.”<sup>3</sup> Speaking on Article 31 in the Constituent Assembly–especially
about <span class=SpellE>justiciability</span> of the ‘compensation
clause’–Pandit Nehru said emphatically that there was nothing like a fixed
concept of property nor a fixed right in it–everything should yield before the
good of the community.<sup>4</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus,
while we find <span class=SpellE>thatthe</span> makers of the Constitution were
very vehement on the point that our State should be based neither on Capitalism
nor on Socialism, we also see that on the whole their own sympathies were
leaning more on socialistic conceptions. The same Dr. <span class=GramE>Ambedkar</span>
who said that no Constitution should be based on any particular philosophy of
life, also claimed that our ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’ really aim
at making the State socialistic. “If these Directive Principles of State
Policy...are not socialistic in their conception,” he said, “I fail to
understand what more Socialism can be.”<sup>5</sup> Answering the critics, that
the Objectives Resolution does not contain the word ‘democracy’, Pandit Nehru
claimed that they “had given the content of democracy in this Resolution”, and
even added, “not only the content of democracy, if I may say so, but the
content of economic democracy in this Resolution.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
we find that the makers were in a way wavering in the aim and purpose of the
State they were about to create. There was a desire that it should be a
‘neutral State’ without any aim to fulfill; at the same time, there was an
equally strong desire to make it serve the needs of the ‘common man’. Indeed,
the common man figured so many times in their thought and speech that, if
‘Welfare State’ means the same as the one ‘for the common man’, that seems to
be the exact purpose of the establishment of this Sovereign Democratic
Republic. “We are here to bring about the real satisfaction of fundamental
needs of the common man of the country, irrespective, of the race, religion and
community,” remarked Dr. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span>, the
‘Philosopher-king’ of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
“The first task of this Assembly,” said Nehru, “is to free India’ through a new
Constitution, to feed the people and clothe the naked and to give every Indian
fullest opportunity to his capacity,” and hoped that “this Constitution itself
will lead us to the real freedom that we have <span class=SpellE>clamoured</span>
for, and that real freedom in turn will bring food to our starving peoples,
clothing them, housing them, and bring all manner of opportunities of
progress.” Though the ‘Welfare State’ was not actually in the minds of the
authors of the Constitution, the welfare of the masses was certainly in their
minds. One member went to the extent of saying that they should aim at a State
“where there is no dearth of food or cloth, and distribution is equitable.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
we have to grasp one important point. Even if the welfare of the masses was in
their minds, the Constitution by itself does not contain anything positive in
order to make it work for the welfare of the masses, except in a general way.
And in a general way, we have to remember that <i>all </i>political thinkers
from Plato onwards <span class=SpellE>visualised</span> the State itself as
intended for the welfare of mankind–only all the thinkers did not agree on any<i>
one </i>line of programme to achieve that ‘welfare’. “If you take English
political thought and action from Pitt and Fox onwards, it seems to me,” writes
Professor Gilbert Murray, “that you will always find present...strands of
feeling which are due–of course among many other causes–to this germination of
Greek influence: an unquestioning respect for freedom of life and thought, a
mistrust of passion,...a sure consciousness that the poor are the fellow
citizens of the rich, and that statesmen must as a matter of fact consider <i>the
welfare of the whole State.” </i><sup>6</sup> When Aristotle supported slavery,
or Hobbes supported absolute autocracy, or Spencer attacked the system of poor
relief, or Hitler introduced his Nazi methods, all were thinking of the welfare
of the people only in their minds, and nothing else! We have, therefore, to
find out if our Constitution goes beyond this general conception and sets up a
machinery of government which will positively create a Welfare State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
searching for an answer usually find it in the Preamble and the Directive
Principles of<i> </i>State Policy. But I find nothing out of the way there to
help us in this direction. In the first place, neither of them is binding on
the people or enforceable by any means, including the legal means. In the
second place, both the Preamble and the Directive Principles contain words and
terms which do not carry any fixed meaning, so that they please all <span
class=GramE>creeds,</span> and communities without displeasing anybody. Take,
at random, the idea of ‘Justice’ in the Preamble, the establishment of which is
one of the Objectives of the Constitution. Now ‘justice’ has no fixed meaning;
and from time to time it has meant what the majority meant it to be. Thus,
today, in <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> it means
every man getting and retaining what he produces, while justice in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> means,
roughly, every man producing what he could and getting in return an almost
equal remuneration with others. Justice, according to the Muslim Law, means
daughters getting same share in the paternal property, while, according to the
Hindu Law, it means daughters getting nothing. It is interesting to note that
when <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> enunciated and handed over to
posterity his great truth that ‘All men are created equal’, he was definitely
having in his mind, all white men, but not all men. Similarly when the U. S.
Preamble desired to “secure the blessings of <st1:City w:st="on">Liberty</st1:City>
to ourselves and posterity”, the blessings of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Liberty</st1:place></st1:City> were not meant for the Negroes. Thus
also when our Constitution (Preamble) says that it wants to secure the ‘dignity
of the individual’ it means almost nothing when we remember that the same </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Constitution
provides also for preventive detention and suspension of fundamental rights, or
when our leaders tell us that dignity lies </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
need not be misunderstood. I am not decrying the Constitution, <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>respect
amounting to veneration. All that I am <span class=SpellE>labouring</span> to
prove is that the Constitution of India has not got the <i>idea of a Welfare
State ingrained in it. </i>It is meaningless to say that we have <i>created a
Welfare State </i>in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
welfare idea came after the inauguration of the Constitution, and it came from
outside–especially from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
But it refers to a programme of the party in power whereby <span class=GramE>that
political party want</span> to achieve the welfare of the masses, the common
men and women, by producing more, creating more opportunities for employment,
and raising the general standard of life. To give it any more<i> </i>status
than that, is trying to see the picture with a jaundiced eye. In fact, it is
the exact meaning which Englishmen themselves would like to give it, and this
‘Welfare State’ in England came into vogue during the second world war, more as
an expedient than as a result of any careful thinking; and, as <span
class=SpellE>Laski</span> would have liked to call it–following the line of
thought in his ‘Development of European Liberalism’–a natural corollary of what
England was doing all the time. In fact, the concept of the Welfare State in
England, and the ‘neo-capitalistic’ State America is supposed to evolve in the
20th century, are both the result of a realisation on both sides that absolute
Capitalism based on pure <i>laissez faire </i>should yield to the needs of the
community, but not to the extent of creating a full communistic State. Anybody
could notice a similar but opposite tendency in the U.S.S.R. whereby the purely
communistic idea pf absolute equality has gradually given place to inequalities
of income, private property–though on a very small scale–and family rights. The
‘welfare idea’, whether one likes to call it so or not, is nothing but a <i>via
media </i>between extreme Capitalism and extreme Communism and in this sense, ‘<span
class=SpellE>welfarism</span>’ is a common tendency of all the countries in the
20th century, whether based on Capitalism or Communism. This idea was put
nicely by Pandit Nehru in the Constituent Assembly speaking on Art. 31. “When
we consider equity...we have to remember that the equity does not apply to the
individuals but to the community,” and put the philosophy of the new
Constitution in a nut-shell, when he laid the formula that, “No individual can
override ultimately the rights of the community at large; no community should
injure and invade the rights of the individuals, unless it be for the most
urgent and important reasons.”<sup> 7</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Conceived
thus, the Welfare State may be defined, to use my own language in another
connection, as “one which allows equality of opportunity to all and equal share
in all essential amenities of social life, without impairing individual
initiative and efficiency.” <sup>8</sup> This Welfare State has many facets–the
spiritual, the economic and social. From the spiritual point of view, welfare
is a vague word, often associated with the equally vague term ‘happiness’. On
the economic side it has two facets–the productive and the distributive; and on
the social side, associated intimately with the distributive facet of the
economic aspect, it means the distribution of social amenities, social service
as we ordinarily understand it. Let us not forget that originally Socialism
started in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with the idea of social service. On the productive side of economics, its
manifestation is seen in the State-ownership of the means of production,
running side by side with private enterprise, called ‘mixed economy’ in India;
and on the social side (coupled with the distributive side of the economy
aspect) it is seen in the State running schools and hospitals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is very often forgotten is that we in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> inherited this idea of a
‘Welfare State’ when in 1947 we got independence. By that time the State in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> owned
many means of production, and it was running schools and hospitals. What is
seen now is that the Government wants to carry this on, on a larger scale, with
the triple object of increasing production, creating more employment, and
raising, the general standard of life. So far so good; and we have nothing but
admiration for this<i> </i>attempt. It is the duty of all Indians to co-operate
with the Government in achieving the objectives, as they are concretely
expressed in the Five Year Plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

difficulty comes only when the economic and social aspects are mixed up with
what I have called the philosophic or the spiritual aspect of a ‘Welfare
State’. It is one of the old controversies in Economics whether ‘wealth’ and
‘welfare’ are organically connected with each other, and this new idea of a
Welfare State has once again roused a heated, and a very learned, controversy
on the subject.<sup>9</sup> Two questions are involved here: if the State
should be used to create utilities or happiness; and if the utility which an
individual or a group of people get can be measured at all. While nothing can
be said about the final result of this controversy, one good thing that it has
done is that it has once again connected Politics with its old cousin
Economics, from which it was separated of late. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>, generally two arguments
are advanced against this Welfare State: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) that it
has resulted in less incentive to produce, especially in the nationalized
industries (what we call the ‘public sector’ in this country), and (ii) that it
has interfered with the free choice of the consumer to adjust his own demand
schedule. A third is also occasionally advanced (in which we are all
immediately interested, as this complaint is true of this country also) that
the Welfare State has resulted in the ‘ill-fare’ of the middle class.<sup> 10</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

complaints carefully and watch the progress of our own achievements in this
direction. Apart from the defects or drawbacks noted above, two immediate
manifestations of the Welfare State in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> should be carefully noted. In
the first place, a rapid redistribution of national wealth and capital is
taking place in this country without any heed to the consequences, either to
the productive capacity of the people or their incentive. Secondly, a rapid
re-evaluation of old ideas and institutions is attempted, depending sometimes
upon the fads and fancies of individuals and groups in the name of the Welfare
State, irrespective of the wishes of the people or their obvious repercussions
on the society that has remained intact for centuries, and has been adjusting
itself to the changing needs and circumstances from time to time without the aid
of legislation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

am not opposed to the idea of a Welfare State nor am I oblivious of the great
strides that our country is making in the economic field, ‘this great Adventure
in India’ as our Prime Minister described it the other day. I am only worried
about the great changes rapidly introduced into our social and economic values
by ill-digested ideas and half-baked fantasies. Is this plethora of legislation
justified either on grounds of democracy or ideas of welfare?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Take
for example two ideas, one in the economic field, the idea of redistribution of
land; and the other in the socio-religious field, the Hindu Code Bill. Both of
them are undertaken as a step to implement the welfare idea. As a matter of
fact, every thing that is done today in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> goes in the name of the
Welfare State! We do not know how a redistribution of the land belonging to the
middle-class people is conducive either to our ideas of justice or ideas of
production; nor do we understand how the Hindu Code Bill–with its various manifestations–is
going to improve and <span class=SpellE>revitalise</span> the society. A
greater question is whether the reform of Hindu society is done in the
democratic way. Are the people consulted? And have they expressed their
approval through any mandate at the time of the elections? Even granting that
these steps are for the improvement of the general masses or people of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>; such
reforms could be introduced only as a result of careful thinking and in the
democratic way of seeking a straight mandate from the people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

other course would expose our democracy to the danger of paternalism. Another
point we have to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> is that there are no ‘people
of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’ but only ‘peoples
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’
whose interests </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>are not always identical with each other, so
that a step taken for the welfare of one section might result in the ill-fare
of another section. Two lessons should be learnt by our masters,–that changes
involving great stakes should not be hurriedly introduced without proper
thinking and proper planning; and that all changes need not be introduced by
legislation alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

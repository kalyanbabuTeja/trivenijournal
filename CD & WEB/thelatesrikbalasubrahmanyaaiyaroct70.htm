<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By
the death of Sri K. Balasubrahmanya Aiyar which occurred on the 30th of
September, South India has lost a person of great intellectual eminence, of
high moral stature and of deep spiritual instincts. Fortune had provided him
with a noble lineage whose benefits he enriched by assiduously cultivating the
opportunities that came to him for the perfection of his personality. His
father had made his mark in the public life of this part of the country not
only as an eminent lawyer, a great jurist, a famous judge and an able
administrator, but also as one who, with a profound knowledge of the treasures
of our classical culture, had an abiding passion for everything that was
enduring in it and dedicated himself to its preservation and enrichment.
Intimate association with his father during the formative years of his youth
enabled Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar to imbibe these traits which stood him in
good stead as an inheritance superior in value to the wordly goods that were
bequeathed to him. Practically every all-India leader of distinction, when he
came to Madras, used to stay with Sri V. Krishnaswamy Aiyar in his “Ashrama” in
Mylapore. Among these, to mention a few, were such illustrious personages like
Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, Ranade, Gokhale, Baba Bharati and Subrahmanya
Bharati. Of those who ‘discovered’ Swami Vivekananda, the earliest was Sri
Krishnaswamy Aiyar who watched him during his frequent visits to his residence
with perspicacious penetration into his spiritual personality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
he grew up to early manhood, Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar’s mind was moulded after
these great men and received the impress of their superior scholarship, of
their intense patriotism, and of their culture and character. In those days,
and for a long time since then, Mylapore was the intellectual hub of Madras and
in Adyar, not far from Mylapore, was springing up a global institution : reared
by the versatile personality of Dr. Annie Besant. The great men of those times
were Sri S. Subrahmanya Aiyar, Sri V. Bashyam Ayyangar, Sri P. S. Sivaswami
Aiyar, Sri T. Madhava Rao, Dewan Bahadur R. Raghunatha Rao, S. Kasturiranga <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ayyangar, Sri G. Subrahmanya Aiyar, A.
Rangaswami Ayyangar, the Rt. Hon’ble V. S. Srinivasa Sastri and a host of
others, each eminent in his field, who shed lustre in their spheres of activity
and earned the reverence and admiration of their contemporaries. Sri
Balasubrahmanya Aiyar was an intelligent and discriminating observer of these
great men who were friends of his father and with some of whom he was more
intimately associated, and he greatly profited by such association. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Amazing as it would
appear, taking compulsory respite from the busy life of his profession, Sri
Krishnaswami Aiyar found the time every day to drink deep and full out of the
springs of our Sanskrit lore and attracted to himself outstanding savants in
whose company he used to spend many a fruitful hour acquiring a knowledge of
our classics, secular and spiritual, a distinction shared by few of his
profession in his time. Realising that the roots of our culture lie imbedded in
Sanskrit, and that the home is the nursery of spiritual education, he insisted
that his sons and daughters should acquire scholarship in that language and literature
and grow up with an abiding sense of reverence for our country’s past and the
will to utter it in their modes of thought and forms of life. Sri
Balasubrahmanya Aiyar responded most willingly to this desire of his father and
through the years acquired a proficiency in handling that language with
effortless ease both in its understanding and in its expression. In tune with
this, he had the benefit of another inheritance which his father bequeathed to
him. Sri V. Krishnaswami Aiyar found the fulfilment of his yearning to promote
the study of Sanskrit by the establishment of an institution wholly devoted to
it. That was the first endowment of its kind from the benefaction of a private
individual. Scholars of great repute and distinction, rarely equalled in the
areas of studies which they had made their own, were appointed to the staff of
the Madras Sanskrit College. Among them were eminent Mahamahopadhyayas like S.
Kuppuswamy Sastrigal, Padmanabha Sastrigal, Chandrasekhara Sastrigal, Srinivasa
Sastrigal, Krishna Sastrigal and others. Both as the son of his father and
later as the Secretary of the college, Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar availed
himself abundantly of this opportunity that came to him to learn from them all
and from others who came after them and acquire such grasp of the various
sastras as to enable him to expound them himself with remarkable facility and
to participate in the deliberations of learned assemblies in which subtle and
intricate subjects were discussed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the pursuit of his
literary and sastraic studies, Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar was aided by two
circumstances which he converted to his advantage by dint of his will power.
The first was the death of his wife when he was just thirty-five years of age.
Any other person of his youth, affluence and status would have married again.
But he made this event the turning point of his domestic life. He sought the
advice of the Kanchi Acharya to control the impulsions of sex and, as
instructed by him, engaged himself ever after in meditation on Siva the
vanquisher of Kama. This disentanglement from connubial life which came to him
so early in his years gave him the leisure and the bent to spend his days in
the company of the masterminds of all times and sublimate his thoughts and
feelings to the region of the Spirit. Secondly, unlike most others, even when
he was ascending the rungs of a promising professional career, he retired from
it in the prime of his life and diverted his faculties to the quest of things
more enduring and so more worth while. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Above all, he had the
inestimable good fortune of close proximity with two saintly personages, Their
Holinesses, the late Sankaracharya of Sringeri and the present Sankaracharya of
Kanchi. This “mahapurusha samsraya” dowered Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar with a
grace abounding which invested him with an honoured place among the disciples
of these Jivanmuktas of modern times. Sri Chandrasekhaia Bharati of the
Sringeri Peetha evinced more than once a special consideration for him, blessed
him with a mantropadesa and gift of his padukas for his worship. To Sri
Chandrasekharendra Saraswati of Kanchi, Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar was the first
and foremost of his lay disciples on whom he used to confer special marks of
loving benediction and consult him frequently on all important matters in which
the Math had concern in some manner or other. So deep was his attachment to his
Guru in love and reverence that at the very mention of his holy name or during
the narration of incidents connected with him, Sri Aiyar would falter in his
speech and shed tears of devotion which he could scarce suppress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This gurubhakti was
matched only by his passionate devotion to Sri Adi Sankara all of whose works
he had studied in the traditional way under competent teachers all his life and
he delighted to discourse on them with a fervour born of clear understanding
and deep conviction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All this contributed to
fashion his personality which expressed itself in diverse ways in various
aspects of public life which he enriched by his wise counsel and active
participation. Starting from even before the time when he was made Treasurer of
the Madras Session of the Indian National Congress in 1927 to the moment of his
death, he was connected with a large number of public institutions and the charge
of their funds. His management of them all was marked by a fidelity which, much
to the impatience of his colleagues, would not permit him to take risks, and by
a supreme integrity in the handling of these funds. As if to fulfil the ‘curse’
which an elderly friend of the family pronounced on him, his cash box at home
used to be smothered with a large assortment of cheque books relating to a
variety of trust funds in his keeping. No wonder that the Jagadguru of Kanchi
invested him, with the title of “Dharmarakshamani.” Like his father, he would
delight in the company of scholars with whom he would hold long converse
unmindful of the passing hours. When there was none with him to talk to, he
used to beguile the weary hours by studiously diving into books of grave import
in Sanskrit, English or Tamil. Belonging as he did, to a generation that went
to school and college before English fell out of favour in the scheme of
education and, what is more, when proficiency in that language was the hallmark
of an educated person, Sri Balasubrahmanya Aiyar used to feast his mind by
reading over and over again the masters of that literature. And, long before
Tamil books became the fashion, he used to read and sing the poetic hymns of
the Saivite and Vaishnavite saints whom he would quote profusely in his public
discourses. Thus, in a very true sense, he was a linguistic Triveni embodying
in himself a confluence of Sanskrit, Tamil and English. For this reason he was
very popular with all sections of people and was much sought after by every
organisation wedded to the preservation and promotion of the verities of our
Sanatana Dharma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri Aiyar’s contribution in the fields of
legislation and education will be fresh in the public memory and will not need
iteration. As a member of the Madras Legislative Council for sixteen years, he
brought to bear on its deliberations the insight of his legal mind to stave off
much of hasty and ill-conceived legislation and evinced the deep concern of his
heart to prevent the perpetration of hardships on his helpless fellowmen. The
members of the Treasury Bench used to listen very deferentially to the points
that he made both in the open sessions of the Council and in the committees in
which he participated. In the field of education, his contribution was no less
valuable. Serving on the Senate of the Madras University for about 40 years and
on its Syndicate for more than half that period, he guided the deliberations of
both those bodies with an eye to the maintenance of the prestige that the University
had built up during the century and more of its glorious career. Both in
respect of the University and of the Indian Bank of which he was Director
continuously for 44 years, he applied to their working his steadfast
conservative mind and never permitted himself to be hustled towards the
spectacular in scorn of what was sure and sober. In this, Sri Aiyar was a much
misunderstood–one had almost said, maligned-man. People were not wanting who
used to accuse him of lack of independence and referred to him in much harsher
words. He was patient to live down all that calumny and was generous in his
treatment of those who could not understand him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Those who have moved with him intimately will bear
testimony to his instinct for loving friendship with like-minded persons who
were drawn to him and whom he would take into his confidence. In his own
measure, he was a generous patron who gave freely in appreciation of
scholarship or to succor the indigent. A remarkable feature of his character
was that he never permitted personal differences to come in the way of the
over-riding interests of the institutions committed to his care. He often used
to say that, as the guardian of an institution, he could not afford to make any
enemy. In domestic life, as the surviving senior of a large and widespread
family, he exuded a spirit of fostering care and affection in respect of every
member, counselling them in their difficulties and consoling them in their
afflictions. His strong faith in God and robust devotion to his Guru were the
sheet-anchor of his life lived in perfect peace and Contentment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such was the good and
noble person that we have lost. Admitted that he had certain defects, (who has
not?) for instance, his occasional irritability and impatience. Even these softened
during his last days. But these spots did not dim the lustre of a rich and
plentiful life marked by discipline and dedication. He was one of the lingering
rearguard of our ancient culture and his presence will be missed for a long
time wherever scholars and good and godly men gather in this part of our
country. So far as he was concerned, he died a “kritakritya”. Thinking of Sri
Balasubrahmanya Aiyar, one quickly recalls the Kural which says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

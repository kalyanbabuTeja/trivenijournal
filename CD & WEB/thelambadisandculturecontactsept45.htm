mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The problems relating to the aboriginals in India
ought to be viewed with a scientific and anthropological vision. The
aboriginals in our country are of several types and belong to various ethnic
groups. Though some of these Indian tribes live in remote hills and forests and
have thus preserved their customs unimpaired, the bulk of them have to face the
battle of culture-contact, and, unable to withstand its formidable force, are
suffering from various handicaps and difficulties. Among these who have to face
this battle of culture-contact, the nomadic branch deserves the immediate
attention of the administrators and the general public. This culture-contract
has, no doubt, done them some good. But in various instances it has produced
upon them certain harmful effects. Among these nomadic tribes the Lambadis
present several complex problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Undoubtedly, the Lambadis were an aboriginal tribe.
But they came in close contact with other tribes and got miscegenated. Thus
today, “they possess physical traits characteristic of the important racial
stocks in varied proportions.” But there are differences of opinion among
scholars as to the antiquity of this tribe. For instance, Mr. W. V. Grigson,
I.C.S., in his introduction to the “Chenchus” observes as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“This tribe must not be regarded as aboriginal in
view of its undoubted Rajaputana origin, but, has clearly been influenced by
many aboriginal contacts in the long centuries during which, in peace and war
alike, it was the true carrier of goods between northern and southern India. It
is recorded that in the Nimar District of the Central Provinces, the Gond and
Korku aborigines used in the carrying days to be admitted in to the Banjara
community and there is little doubt that this admission of members of local
tribes into the community was clearly more extensive than would be confessed by
the modern Banjara………..”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Mr. R.E. Enthoven, in his “Tribes and Castes of
Bombay”, however, held a different view with regard to the primitiveness of
this tribe. He has suggested an aboriginal descent to these people. For he
writes that “in the Ptolemy’s list of Indian castes the name ‘Lambatai’ is to
be found. According to Mc Crindle these were the inhabitants of Langham, a
tract lying on the northern bank of the Kabul river, but it seems equally
probable that ‘Lambatai’ is merely a form of the modern Lambadi.” His arguments
throwing light on the primitive character of the Lambadis can be very well
strengthened by the nomadic and precarious existence of these people and their
crude material culture. But in the following lines, he has added “that though
in origin the tribe may have been an aboriginal section of the population with
a distinct identity, named from its occupation of carrying, supplies on
bullocks, it has since been so overlain with additions from Rajaputs, Mahrattas
and Mahars and a number of other well known tribes and castes that it can only
be described as a miscellaneous collection of the flotsams and jetsams of
humanity.” It is evident from the above statement of Enthoven that the Lambadis
were a primitive tribe but from a long time have assimilated peoples of various
stocks and are a heterogeneous lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Lambadis were noted transporters of goods. In
those parts of the Deccan where roads were absent, which would not admit of
wheeled traffic, it was by these tribal men, with their large flocks of
bullocks that extensive intercourse was carried on. In those days they earned a
high reputation in the capacity of carriers of important commodities. It was
recorded that during the period of the Moghal invasion of the Deccan the
Lambadis supplied a fearless and reliable transport service. Their efficiency
was so much needed by the British that they held great influence with the
latter, so much so they objected to capital punishment without the sanction of
a regular judicial authority, as Wilks tells us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>With regard to the kinds of goods which they
transported, there are differences of opinion among scholars. Since the tribe
is widely scattered all over the country, they are known by different names in
different Provinces. Thus in parts of Hyderabad State, C. P., U. P., Central
India, Rajaputana and Mysore, they are known as Banjaras (Brinjaries)–while in
the Telugu districts of the Madras Province the Telingana parts of the
Hyderabad State and the Karnatak districts of the Bombay Presidency, they are
known as Lambadis (Lambadas), Lamanis and Labhanis. In some parts of the Madras
Presidency like North Arcot and Coimbatore, they are known as Sugalis. In
Orissa and Jeypore Zamindari they are styled as Boiparis. It is clear that each
name indicates a particular economic pursuit. But my investigations and me to
suppose that they were the carriers of salt and grain, while others hold that
they were the traders in rice, betel nuts, etc. Many Nayaks of the various
Lambadi settlements say that, up to the time of their grandfathers, all the
members of the tribe were barriers of salt. In Huzur Nagar taluk of the Nizam’s
Dominions I came across an old Lambadi woman who told me that she accompanied
her father in the salt ‘Bedari’. Even today it is very common for the Tribal
Panchayat of the Lambadis to impose heavy penalties on persons found guilty of
having stolen, or lost, the needles used to stitch the gunny bags which were
generally filled with salt or grain. Mr. W. V. Grigson, the celebrated field
worker, in his “Maria Gonds of Bastar” referred to the writings of a Mahratta
Amin of Deolmari who observed that the Banjaras had done much to conciliate and
to partially civilise the Gonds: the traffic which they carried on,
particularly in salt and sugar, had introduced a taste for luxuries which many
of them could not easily dispense with. Further, if we refer to the meaning of
the term ‘Lambadi’ it throws light on the profession of the Lambadis as the
carriers of salt. Undoubtedly the word Lambadi is another form of ‘lavan’ a
Sanskrit word for salt. Mr. R. E. Enthoven also is of the same opinion, for he
says that the term ‘Lamani’ is derived from ‘lavan’, salt, the tribe being the
chief carriers of salt before the opening of roads and railways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus the Lambadis were a caste of carriers of goods
like salt, and grain, which they used to transport from one place to another on
their pack bullocks. Their economic activity was purely a professional nomadism
and they served the country in that capacity for a long period. But the times
were fast changing; better methods of transport were introduced; the British
Empire in India was consolidated; and the railway routes were opened. This
improvement in the transport service and the establishment of a systematic
centralised Government offered greater facilities to the public in the matter
of trade and business. With these developments, the services of the Lambadis
were no longer required. Thus they were deprived of the very profession by
which they made their living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Being a wandering tribe, they had no fixed homes,
and they had decided to settle down wherever they had camped. But the surroundings
were quite unfamiliar; they had to speak a tongue alien to them, the
inhabitants were strangers. Their very existence became precarious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The tracts of the Deccan in which they settled down
are inhabited by pastoral castes, hunting tribes, and agricultural communities.
The ecological environment of the Lambadis has shaped their society
economically and otherwise. For a considerable time the lands had been taken up
for cultivation by the surrounding people, and similar agricultural pursuits
were the mainstay of the inhabitants of those parts. Therefore, it became
unavoidable for the Lambadis to resort to agriculture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Besides agriculture, cattle-breeding also forms an
important subsidiary occupation in the economic life of the Lambadis. Various
factors have enabled them to prove themselves expert cattle-grazers. As we have
noticed previously, they were the drivers of pack bullocks. Their long
association with the cattle trade had given them a valuable experience in the
breeding of cattle. Their culture-contact with the Chenchus, a semi-nomadic
tribe who have taken to cattle grazing, and the Gollas, a pastoral caste of the
Telugu country, has played no little part in giving impetus to this profession.
Manure collection also is another occupation which the Lambadis have taken up
in recent times. This is economically profitable to them and thus we find that
in the Guntur District the Lambadis evince a great interest in this occupation.
Besides, rope making and cucumber selling also are newly taken up by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The culture-contact has brought a change in their
social life as well. The structure of the Lambadi society has been modified
from time to time, whenever it has come in touch with other tribes and castes.
It is interesting to note that their contact with the Chenchus, as Haimendorf
observes, has brought about a certain amount of miscegenation among the latter.
But the changes brought into the Lambadi society are the results of the impact
of a higher civilization. When the Lambadis were conducting the ‘Bedari’ trade,
they used to indulge in such barbaric practices as human sacrifice. They were
mainly prompted by a belief that such sacrifice would please their Goddess who
would bless them with great wealth and prosperity in their trade. The
prevalence of sorcery and witchcraft was another social evil which took a toll
of the lives of many faithful and innocent women of the tribe; the cruelty
practised upon these unfortunate victims was largely based on the revengeful
motives of selfish members of their society. During modern times it is a matter
for satisfaction to note that these evil practices have almost disappeared. No
doubt, this is partly owing to the strict police vigilance but it is equally
the result of the settled economic pursuits of the Lambadi and their long
social association with the people of the plains.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Another important and interesting feature of their
social life is that of marriage. Polygamy was tolerated and, in some cases,
even encouraged. But in recent times this system of plurality of wives is
deprecated, and many members of the tribe have told me that the joy of married
life is experienced only in monogamy. It is fairly common among them to perform
cross-cousin marriages. But in earlier times this form of marriage was not in
vogue. There are strong reasons to believe that this is a new introduction in
their social pattern. Their long associations with the members of more
civilised castes, and contact with other surrounding tribes like the Yanadis,
the Yarikulas, the Chenchus, among whom cross-cousin marriages have long been
in vogue, have introduced this innovation in their marriage practices. However
distinct their social life of the Lambadis from that of other tribes, this form
of marriage and the circumambulation round the marriage poles seven times are
some of the changes that have crept in their social life as a result of culture
contact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The culture-contact among the Lambadis has intruded
into their social fabric, even to its roots. It is mainly responsible for the
division of the tribe into several sects, which are both religious and
occupational. It is highly improbable that such a classification of social
units and divisions as is witnessed today among the Lambadis could have been
instituted when the tribe was originally formed, especially in the light of its
nomadic behaviour with no possibilities of a settled abode, or fixed patterns
of social life. At present the tribe is divided into six important sects, each
having it own economic behaviour and social status. Within their society the
Lambadis have the system of division into castes parallel to those that are
found in civilised society. The tribe has Rasputras, corresponding to the
Brahmins in Hindu society. This particular sect is held in great esteem by the
members of the other sects, and they are distinct from others in the matter of
cleanliness, diet and observance or religious duties. They are strictly
vegetarian and they never take to drink. Generally, inter-marriage and
inter-dining with, other sects are prohibited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Lambadis have a separate agricultural caste
among them, though during modern times all these sects have taken to
agriculture. This caste is known as Bhukya, and most of its members live upon
agricultural pursuits. This sect during recent times has ceased to follow a
nomadic life, while the tribe itself, as Mr. Grigson says, is rapidly becoming
a settled community in Hyderabad State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Navis are among the Lambadis what the barbers
fire in Hindu society. They usually shave the Lambadis in their settlements and
get annual grants from each “Tanda”. Besides, they attend the entire social
functions and collective dinners, when they serve the community as cooks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Among the Lambadis we find the Pariah caste which
is known as Dhalia. They are the drum-beates of the tribe during funeral
ceremonies arid marriage festivities. Begging is a traditional occupation among
them, but they are allowed to beg only within the Tanda limits. It is a taboo
among them to beg outside, and the tribe treats them as untouchables. Nothing
can serve as a better illustration to indicate that the formation of sub-sects
and castes is the direct result of culture contact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Bhats, another important sect among the
Lambadis boast of a respectable antiquity. It has received high credentials
from no less a historian than Col. Tod, as sacred and chivalrous. Today its
members are treated as muslims within their tribe. L.A.K. Iyer writes that in
Mysore they follow the Muslim faith in all their ceremonies. Yet a Bhat is
permitted to live within the Tanda (Lambadi settlement) and even take the food
prepared by others, but no other sect m the tribe will dine with him. The Bhats
serve the tribe as genealogists and bards. Their presence is necessary on all
important occasions like marriage, settlement of disputes, festivals etc; when
they sing of the heroic achievements of the tribal ancestors, and receive
rewards from the members of the Tanda. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as in some communities in India strangers were admitted into their social fold,
the Banjaras also used to admit outsiders into their caste. The converts
occupied a decidedly lower position in the tribe. They are known as Jangars. In
former days, when the Lambadis were in Bedari trade, girls often used to be

of the tribe.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the division of the tribe into occupational and religious sects, is the result
of culture contact. I have previously mentioned that the Gond and Korku tribes
were admitted into the Banjara community, and it is quite probable that these
new additions were given the status of Jangar caste. This caste is formed
purely because of occupational necessities. Nevertheless, the remaining sects
like the Navi and Dhalia afford illustration as to the strata and stratifications
that the Lambadis have fixed within their tribe. This is, however, an acquired
social trait, the result of the culture contact which they have with Hindu
Society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

late, the Lambadis have learnt to invite the Brahmin to conduct the marriage
function and to fix the auspicious day either for naming the child or for going
out on any particular journey. Formerly, this system was not in vogue among
them. Just as they have adopted the cross-cousin marriage, which is fairly
prevalent in civilised communities, so also their long association with the
Brahmins, in whose houses they serve as domestic servants, has led them to ado</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Each
sect among the Lambadis is split up into various Gotras and the members of each
Gotra claim descent from a common ancestor and behave among themselves as
brothers and sisters. These Gotras are exogamous, though the sects are
endogamous–a similar custom is found among the members of the higher castes in
Hindu society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
culture-contact has brought another important change in their external
behaviour as well. Those educated members of the tribe and their wives who
migrate to town or other distant places in order to eke out their livelihood,
do not wear their tribal dress. I came across many Lambadi women who are dressed
after the Hindu fashion, a jacket, and a sari being the only garments which
they put on. Further, a taste for flowers, a fondness for simplicity of
ornamentation, and a desire to prepare new types of food, tasteful and
well-boiled, are the innovations brought about by the impact of a higher
civilisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
religion of the Lambadis itself has undergone some change in recent times. In
the Madras Presidency, as early as 1871, they were classified with other
Hindus, while according to the Mysore census report of 1891, they were treated
as Vaishnavites, their principal God being Lord Krishna. An investigation into
their religious life and the Gods whom they worship </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>certainly
enables us to rank them as low-caste Hindus. In the districts of Krishna, Guntur
and Nalgonda where I conducted my investigations, the principal God of the
Lambadis is Balaji or Venkateswaraswami of the famous Tirupati. Besides, they
worship various other deities like Maremma, Ankalamma, Mahalakmmi etc., which
are likewise worshipped by the other lower caste Hindus in those parts. Each
deity is credited with a certain evil influence, particularly Maremma, who is
dreaded both by the Lambadis and the other Hindu castes, associating her with
epidemics. What we find in their worship is only a fear of the deity, and the
various modes of worship are attempts on their part to appease her and win a
happy and peaceful life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with civilisation resulted in the preachings of some of the reforming minds
among the Lambadis, like Hemasadhu and Iokya Nayak, who insisted on
cleanliness, change in the mode of dress, honesty, vegetarian diet, sexual
abstinence and prohibition of toddy among the members of the tribe. These
reformers had a good response from the Lambadis for some time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the position of the Lambadis slightly differs from that of the other tribes and
untouchables, yet, decidedly they form the lower strata of the society. Their
social behaviour, their diet and their traditional secluded ways of life–all
these are responsible for their degraded social status. Besides, most of them
are members of the Criminal Tribes Act. Though serious forms of crime, such as
human sacrifice, kidnapping, dacoity and high-way robbery have disappeared,
cattle lifting, cart stealing, grain stealing, and, occasionally, house
breaking are practised by them. But these crimes are committed only in those
Tandas where the economic conditions of the members are so bad that they have
no other means of living. Should there be no economic want, the Lambadi may not
indulge in crime at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>As Shantabai entered the common room, her eyes fell
on the big bold figure of ten in the calendar, and she felt not a little
relieved. The long tedious vacation seemed endless, but it had ended at last.
Now she could be in the midst of those hundred girls who danced like tops,
talking excitedly, giggling and crying shrilly. In that familiar rhythm of work
she could easily forget herself, and in those cobweb-like thoughts that came to
her stealthily when she was alone. She had no near relative whom she could
visit. Long ago she had had a brother–a pale boy with bluish dreamy eyes, who
sat in a corner and always read an old volume of the <i>Arabian Nights </i>and
became restless with ecstasy when he saw the golden splendour of the dying sun.
One day he was lying quietly with one hand lying out as if he had dozed off
when he was reading. But he was not sleeping. That was ten years ago, but he
was not forgotten. Shantabai always remembered him when the Parijata tree next
door was heavy with delicate red-stemmed flowers, for he liked them so much… <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Her own life in the small two-room block in the
College street was unbearably monotonous. It was not only a tedious tale, but
it was also an unending one. There was nothing in her life, except perhaps a
few memories, where it could come for a moment of rest. There was no prism that
could refract her life into pure rainbow colours. From the time the sun’s rays,
soft like silk ribbons, crept in stealthily from the window, till they became
yellow in the evening, she sat in a wicker chair and knitted. When she did not
knit, she stood near the window and looked at the Gulmohur tree across the
road. It was in its red, burning splendour only a month ago. But that red glory
was dead and a small bouquet of soft green leaves had taken its place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she sometimes wondered. “When one comes, the other disappears.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>And then slowly the thoughts came. She had a horror
of those thoughts that came to her when alone, ugly like veins in a dead face.
And when she had, against her will, a peep at the bottom of the past, she saw
strange things wriggling like worms when a flat stone is lifted. She shuddered;
she hurriedly took up her needles as if those things were ready to pounce on
her, and knitted, knitted feverishly... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the afternoon the boy from the boarding-house
brought her food. He kept the food on the small triangular table in the corner,
and went out insolently. When going, he slammed the door. He always slammed the
door. Shantabai used to look up with pain, and shut the door as if cutting off
her own little frail world from the boisterous world outside that was so cruel
and strong. Then everything used to be quiet in the room. The clock ticked on as
if it was shedding tears. Only her long slender fingers moved rhythmically and
her bangles clinked occasionally. The tree outside rustled and the window panes
creaked as if some invisible creature was pressing them from outside. Rarely a
bee came in humming, and Shantabai lifted her tired eyes to look at those blue
vibrating wings. But the next moment the bee was gone as if it did not like the
place. Then she took up the stitches and continued to knit. The corners of the
room became dark, and the darkness, slowly getting bolder, soon filled the
room. Her fingers ached and she could hardly see the thread. Then she lit the
kerosene lamp that threw a circle of pale yellow consumptive light, and as she
placed the lamp on the table, she picked up one or two jasmine flowers which
little Neela who lived next door always brought for her ‘Bai’ (teacher).
Shantabai always felt something exquisitely poignant when she smelt those
already fading, dying flowers. Occasionally she took a paper, and if it was
such a day, she skipped through it, indifferently, almost antagonistically. It
was always full of riots, murders, and long tedious speeches of old, senile
politicians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But now she could be at least busy in the school.
The sight of the common room after such a long time was so exhilarating. She
opened the window. When the long familiar breeze from the school compound, that
always played so merrily with the papers of the teachers, came, and the shrill
laughter of girls along with it, she was pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Yesterday the school building looked desolate and
abandoned like an old woman taking shelter in rain under a tree. But today it
had blossomed. It was alive with the happy laughter of the girls. They talked
excitedly and often they merely laughed. Shantabai remembered what Sudha Apte,
the common-room poet, once said, “God was immensely pleased with the world he
had created, and his happy tears came down on the earth as children and
flowers,” and how Meera Sathe said a big ‘Phew’ to it and how there was yet
another fight between the two veterans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Shantabai worked in the High School, but she loved
to go occasionally to the Primary School attached to it. The shy love of those
little girls for their ‘Bai’ and their smiles; their whispered comments on her
dress, and their secret nudgings were so amusing…. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nobody knew. Shantabai was not very communicative over that. Her life was like

indifference. And inside, Shantabai sat crushed, alone in its twilight, and
often thoughts and broken memories danced round her, became red like live coals

that Shantabai felt very happy, and the sudden gloom that had alighted on her
mind like a vulture was lifted for a moment: She liked the girl’s enthusiasm

beautiful. It had a clock that gave out wonderful music when it was twelve, a
small railway train that ran round and round as if it had forgotten the station

them. She was not a little disappointed, but she slowly turned the pages and
began, “Page twenty-one. The Story of Doggy the Dog.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

out as if all her energy had suddenly ebbed away from her. She ran her hand on
her forehead. It was almost burning, and somebody seemed to be hammering on it
from inside. The faces of the girls that sat in a semi-circle, like beads in a
chain, slowly disappeared, as if they were merely figures on the blackboard
completely wiped out by somebody. She could not hear what the girl was reading.
Only some stifling noise, accompanied by scalding heat, like the shrill noise
when steam is let off, filled the room and made her giddy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

“Yes, dear,” her heart ached with tender love and pity for Vasanti who was so
small, quiet, and shy. She was always silent as if thinking to herself and
rarely after mother for anything. She had lost her father when she was a
kid,–in a motor accident. Shantabai remembered the nightmarish day so
distinctly. It was the gloomiest day she had known, with the sky gray like a
dirty piece of cloth, and the oily rain pouring down incessantly. She had been
waiting for him, for such a long time. The lamp burnt out and there was a thin
gray line on the wick. She took out a candle and lit it. The flame flickered in
the wind and shadows moved. Her eyes became heavy and she rested her head on
the table. Then somebody came and gave loud impatient knocks on the door… <o:p></o:p></span></p>

its eternal tick-ticks. The boy came with the tiffin-carrier and placed it on

floor moved a little, and half climbed the wall. The street outside seemed to
be panting in the hot sun like a thirsty dog, and its sultry silence was
occasionally shattered by the raucous horn of a stray car. Within two hours the
bundles were finished. Shantabai tied them with a piece of string and threw
them aside as if they were all odious toads. When she looked up at the clock
she thought of Vasanti, and said to herself: “Today I must get her frock or she

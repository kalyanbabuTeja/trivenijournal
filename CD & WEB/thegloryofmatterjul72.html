that the Yoga of the <span class=SpellE>Gita</span> supplements the Yoga of the

many ideas and complete the view of <span class=SpellE>realisation</span> laid
down in the more ancient scriptures. While the <span class=SpellE>Isha</span>

<span class=SpellE>Aurobindo’s</span> unerring vision has reiterated the
age-old perception of the Vedic and <span class=SpellE>Upanishadic</span> <span
class=SpellE>Rishis</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Tantric</span> Yogis that
Atman has become everything, that Brahman is all. If Atman is pure Spirit, if
it has become everything, <span class=SpellE><i>sarva-bhutani</i></span><i>, </i>it
stands to reason to conceive a power of concealment in the Self-Creative Force
of the Self. Its function would in other words be described as a process of
involution, a progressive hiding of the spiritual nature of the Spirit. As Sri
Aurobindo has shown, the seven rays or the seven streams of the Veda are
symbols of seven planes of being or consciousness. Thus the Self has become
Matter. It was not without reason that <span class=SpellE>Bhrigu</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Varuna’s</span> son, after doing <span class=SpellE><i>tapasya</i></span><i>
</i>went to his father and declared: Matter is Brahman. <span class=GramE>True
that his father, a knower of Brahman, sent the aspirant son back to do further <span
class=SpellE>tapasya</span>.</span> Obviously this means that his son had not
known everything about Brahman. Indeed it appears from the context that <span
class=SpellE>Bhrigu</span> <span class=SpellE>Varuni</span> was only at the
beginning or the spiritual journey. But it is also to be noted that he did not
contradict his son or point out that he was wrong. And this would obviously
mean that the young aspirant’s initial perception of the nature of Brahman was
not wrong though it was not complete. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to see that <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>, Bliss, is Brahman. He ascended
from Matter to the planes, one after the other, of the Vital, Mental, the <span

would appear from this account that from <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span> to
Anna, Bliss to Matter, there is the one and the same Reality which has arranged
itself in a hierarchy of categories projected from itself. We can in this
connection remember the four-fold Self of the <span class=SpellE>Mandukya</span>
Upanishad, the <span class=SpellE>Turya</span>. <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Sushupti</span></span><span class=GramE>, <span class=SpellE>Svapna</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Jagrat</span>.</span> These according to Sri <span
class=SpellE>Aurobindo’s</span> interpretation are respectively the absolute
and the original status of the Self, its aspect of the omniscient and
omnipotent Lord in the causal world, its aspect of the enjoyer of the subtle
world and its aspect of the enjoyer of the gross world. Nowhere does the
Upanishads assert that the three lower aspects are unreal. Sri Aurobindo
concedes that according to a strict and rigid logic, these three may be
regarded as illusion but he also emphatically states that this is not a
necessary conclusion. It is not our purpose here to enter into a discussion on
this question. We would content ourselves with noting that Sri Aurobindo
accepts the realistic <span class=SpellE>Adwaita</span> of the Upanishads
though he does not deny that an element of illusionism crept into some of them.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
if the Self has become or at least has manifested itself in the gross world of
our waking consciousness after manifesting itself as the causal and subtle
worlds, no question is more pertinent than this–why should the Self manifest
itself as the World? Is it an exercise without any purpose whatsoever? Or if
there be a goal, what can it possibly be? The traditional answer is that the
Divine creates the world as Lila, as a spiritual sport. The creative Energy of
God overflows and takes concrete shape in the things of the world. And even if
the Divine has involved Himself in Matter, he, as an individual soul, evolves
back to its original divinity. The soul <span class=SpellE>realises</span>
itself as a portion of the universal Lord or one<i> </i>with the cosmic Self,
or identical with the transcendent Absolute. This is why the soul comes into
the world. Matter has not been c</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>reated for any higher
aim than to provide a temporary abode for the Lord who dwells in everything. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Aurobindo joins issue with this view of creation. <span class=GramE>Not that it
is not true at all</span> but it is not the whole truth. The world is created
so that the Creator can have the delight of Becoming, it is Lila. But if Matter
is a form of conscious Self, if it is sustained in its existence by the
conscious power of the self-same Spirit, we can surely say there is a concealed
consciousness in Matter itself. The <span class=SpellE>Prakriti</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Samkhya</span> has to be moved into action by the static conscious
<span class=SpellE>Purusha</span>. The Maya of <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span>-Vedanta
is moved and controlled by <span class=SpellE>Ishwara</span>, the personal,
qualified Brahman. Nowhere do we come across an explanation of the work of <span
class=GramE>an intelligence</span> in the apparently non-spiritual universe
except on the basis of asserting some connection between the active power and
the foundational Consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Vedanta. But would it not be wiser, asks
Sri Aurobindo, to accept the fact as it is actually found and experienced? The
logic of existence and developing spiritual experience <span class=SpellE>outsteps</span>
the boundaries of the logic of mind. If there is observed a secret intelligence
functioning in the operations of universal Nature, it is perfectly reasonable
to assert that there is a conscious Force inherent in it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Matter
is only a concrete presentation of itself by this conscious Force to itself.
Sri Aurobindo believes that not only can the consciousness in Matter be aware
of its own essential nature beyond the universe, but that it can come to its
own, be aware of itself even in Matter. Another way of stating the same idea
would be that Matter can become conscious of what it truly is, namely, a form
of Brahman. To prepare Matter for this consummation is the purpose of creation.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
idea may be explained from another point of view. While everything is a
manifestation of the Divine, nothing in the universe manifests the indwelling
Spirit. The Divine is <span class=SpellE>unmanifest</span> in the world which
he has manifested out of his own being. Yet every- thing points to something
beyond itself, all things are symbols of God. If this is true, it is a
worthwhile ideal to make the symbols capable of not merely suggesting the <span
class=SpellE>Symbolised</span> but to express it overtly. The <span
class=GramE>most dense</span> symbol of conscious Spirit is Matter. This last
stronghold of unconsciousness is to be radically changed into a conscious
instrument for the manifestation of the Divine in the world. Pure Spirit must
be <span class=SpellE>realised</span> in such a way that Matter can become
Spirit. God having become entirely Nature, Nature wants to be God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

idea has not been seriously entertained before in the Indian Yogic tradition,
or for that matter, anywhere else in the world<i> </i>because the specific
principle and force of God that can <span class=SpellE>realise</span> it has
not been attained and made operative in mind, life and body. Man has in the
spiritual quest ascended to high levels of mental consciousness which are
capable of opening to and receiving in the spiritual Knowledge, Peace, Joy,
Power. These levels of the mind are divine and the spiritual experiences
attained in them are genuine and highly satisfying. But mind even on its
highest level is a limited consciousness. It is not able integrally to <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> the Divine in all its aspects, far less <span
class=SpellE>harmonise</span> Spirit and Matter. Consciousness in man must
evolve into a level higher than mind, a plane which has Knowledge inherent in
it and where there is no need to seek it. It is Consciousness turned into
integral Knowledge and invincible Will. This is what Sri Aurobindo calls the <span

is also the Idea, based in Brahman, of the whole Universe which is to be
created, the inherent Law and process of its manifestation. At the same time it
is the substance, the essence of everything in the world though overlaid by the
limitations of mind, life and matter. When the concealed but inherent <span
class=SpellE>Supermind</span> in Matter wishes to manifest itself more openly
and in a less hampered way, it brings about the emergence of Life and then of
Mind in living Matter. The physical organism undergoes great changes as a
result of the evolution in it of Life and then of Mind in living Matter. But
the urge of evolution presses further forward, says Sri Aurobindo, and the <span
class=SpellE>Supermind</span> is now asserting, itself in order to effect a new
and obvious manifestation of itself in the world. The soul in Mind will ascend
to the plane of<i> </i>integral Knowledge-Will and become the soul in <span
class=SpellE>Supermind</span>. Then it will not have to despise Matter, or be
frightened by life or limited by Mind. The emergence of <span class=SpellE>Supermind</span>
in them will transform them, enable mind to shed all limitations and receive
the truth perfectly, make life serene and self-sustaining devoid of desires and
cravings, yet dynamic as a channel of conscious force, change body into divine
substance enabling it to know and enjoy the Immortal in it. The most despised
would be the most fulfilled. Spirit will embrace Matter which will know and
enjoy Brahman as its soul, and what could be a greater glory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

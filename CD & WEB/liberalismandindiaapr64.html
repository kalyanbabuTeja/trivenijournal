then in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The word ‘Liberal’ as a party label gained currency in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a
result of sympathy felt for the Spanish Liberals. But the great <span
class=GramE>corpus</span> of ideas, which constitute the doctrine of
liberalism, are as old as humanity itself. Causes of the decay of liberalism
are to be found in the technique of war, and in the technique of production, in
the increase of propaganda facilities, and in nationalism. Though paradoxical,
yet it is true, that liberalism is the one doctrine which drew the attention of
its admirers only<i> </i>when it ceased to occupy the <span class=SpellE>centre</span>
of the stage. As per the chosen description published by the “New York Herald
Tribune” in 1949, it has ceased to be either a concrete programme of action or
a consistent body of doctrine. It is the most disputed term of our generation.
It is a philosophy of property just as <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>protestantism</span></span>
is connected with capitalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

during the course of one or two centuries, were compressed into a few decades
in an Indian setting in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Principles of Civil Liberty, Rule of Law and Freedom of the Press constitute
the background of Indian liberalism. It may not be out of place to note that

the Congress rejected the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, popularly known as <span
class=SpellE>dyarchy</span>, and began to take to unconstitutional means, by
way of direct action, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. It is necessary
to distinguish it from the South Indian Liberal Federation, which is a communal
<span class=SpellE>organisation</span> known as the Justice Party, designed to
foster the interests, of the non-Brahmin community, in the composite State of
Madras. Throughout the world Liberalism suffered an eclipse after the First
World War. The swing of the pendulum was, ever since, either to the extreme
left or right, but it has never rested at the <span class=SpellE>centre</span>.

was never a mass <span class=SpellE>organisation</span>, but a mere collection
of individuals, personally eminent but politically without any popular
following. They established a tradition of sincere conviction, sustained
service, and sound patriotism. They were no <span class=SpellE>respectors</span>
of persons. Their mind revolted against, the emotional exploitation of a
situation. They stood for Civil Liberty, Rule of Law and Freedom of the Press.
They were unruffled under the gravest provocation and were never rude to
anybody. In moments of crisis their cold logic might not have received the
attention it deserved. Their approach was objective and their conclusions were
dispassionate. They felt that politics were vulgar without a liberal touch.
They were throughout constitutionalists. As a matter of fact they supplied the
constitutional background for the other parties and <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>

<span class=SpellE>Surendra</span> <span class=SpellE>Nath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Banerjee</span> was the President of the First Conference of
Liberals held on 1-11-1918 at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>.
To many, separation from the Congress was a painful wrench. They contributed to
build up the institution with their life-blood. They nursed it from infancy to
adolescence, from adolescence to maturity. They could not but secede because
the differences, between them and those who captured the Congress, were
fundamental. Each followed their line of work with something of the bitter
reminiscences familiar to the members of the Hindu joint family, broken up
under the pressure of internecine strife. The extremist Congress sites were the
loudest in their denunciation of the Liberals. The meetings organized by the
Moderates were broken up by noisy demonstrations and <span class=SpellE>rowdyism</span>.
The words ‘traitor’ and ‘shame’ became familiar terms applied to Moderates. There
was more brute-force than soul-force in these exhibitions. The ancient spirit
of tolerance that has been our heritage disappeared, and practices have been
encouraged that were disastrous to the interests of the country, and tended to <span
class=SpellE>demoralise</span> the people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
achievements of each member of this party were unique. The persuasive eloquence
and poise of Rt. <span class=SpellE>Hon’ble</span> Mr. V. S. <span
class=SpellE>Sreenivasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Sastry</span> raised the
status of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the estimation of the English-speaking world. He was a true servant of the
country throughout his life. The only official position he ever accepted was
the post of Agent-General in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>, in an honorary capacity, at the
instance of Mahatma Gandhi. Even ill health, advancing years and pecuniary
difficulties could not tempt him. The positions he declined were a legion. He
declined to be the Chief of the Interim Ministry in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> during 1937, before Sir K. V. Reddy <span
class=SpellE>Naidu</span> was sent for. Similarly he refused to accept the <span
class=SpellE>presidentship</span> of the Council of State, a seat on the <span
class=SpellE>Viceregal</span> Cabinet, and membership of the Secretary of
State’s India Council in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>.
Thinking public wondered–whether he was a statesman or a politician. But every
one agreed that he was a patriot at heart. As a matter of fact, he thought as
he felt and acted as he thought. On this score he was often misunderstood. When
he disapproved of the Home Rule Movement inaugurated by Dr. Annie <span
class=SpellE>Besant</span>, it was said that he was responsible for her
internment, since he happened to enjoy the privilege of friendship with Lord <span
class=SpellE>Pentland</span>, the then Governor of Madras. It hurt him deeply
but he suffered the indignity silently. He was unsparing in his criticism of
the sayings and the doings of the British rulers. Eternal conflict raged in him
between extremist inclinations and moderate convictions, between the principle
and the expediency, the ultimate and the immediate. People were bewildered when
he proposed cheers to the <st1:place w:st="on">British Empire</st1:place> at
the Imperial Conference. Mr. T. R. <span class=SpellE>Venkatrama</span> <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Sastri</span></span> who resigned his post as
Law Member in the Government of Madras, three days after he assumed office, as
the control over the Police was taken away from him, was a faithful <span
class=SpellE><i>chela</i></span><i> </i>of Sri <span class=SpellE>Srinivasa</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sastri</span> in every respect. He was the last to preside
over the successive gatherings of the liberals from time to time and the
celebrated its Silver Jubilee under his auspices. He continued the hobby of
issuing statements on all public problems even from his sick-bed. Mr. A. D. <span
class=SpellE>Mani</span>, as the Editor of the ‘<span class=SpellE>Hitavad</span>’
of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Nagpur</span></st1:place></st1:City>,
<span class=SpellE>popularised</span> the liberal way of thinking. Mr. E. <span
class=SpellE>Vinayaka</span> Rao of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
was a loyal camp follower. Sri G. K. <span class=SpellE>Devadhar</span>, Sri P.
<span class=SpellE>Kodanda</span> Rao, and Sri <span class=SpellE>Lakshmi</span>
<span class=SpellE>Narayana</span> <span class=SpellE>Sahu</span> of the
Servants of India Society have all along been good Liberals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

come the trio that preserved and fostered Liberalism to the last <span

<span class=SpellE>Aiyer</span>, the great Jurist, was reputed to be an erudite
scholar and the most accurate thinker in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Sir C. Y. <span
class=SpellE>Chintamani</span>, the distinguished Editor of the ‘Leader’, the
leading daily that <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> public opinion in <st1:place
w:st="on">Upper India</st1:place> for over three decades, was rightly regarded
as the index of Indian politics. He resigned his <span class=SpellE>ministership</span>
in U. P., as a protest against interference in the discharge of his duties. Sir
<span class=SpellE>Chimanlal</span> <span class=SpellE>Setalwad</span>, a
leading lawyer and the distinguished father of Mr. M. C. <span class=SpellE>Setalwad</span>,
a former Attorney-General of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
was noted for his keenness and clarity. These three persons proudly proclaimed
their faith from house-tops as a panacea for all political ills. <span
class=SpellE>Chintamani’s</span> respect for constitutionalism was so intense
that he never advised anyone to non-co-operate on any issue, but suggested that
it would be increasingly difficult for the people to co-operate. On the puppet
stage of the <span class=SpellE>Montford</span> regime they spoke the language
of Fox and Pit. They could be pithy and <span class=SpellE>epigramatic</span>
as Bacon, quaint, whimsical and allusive as Lamb, learned and mock-serious like
the Editor of the ‘London Times’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

purposive and businesslike in their approach. Mr. G. A. <span class=SpellE>Natesan</span>
the founder-Editor of the celebrated monthly “The Indian Review” was the
self-appointed publicity agent in the cause of Liberalism. But for his efforts
most of the distinguished Liberals would have remained unknown. Sir M. <span

<span class=SpellE>Tej</span> <span class=SpellE>Bahadur</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sapru</span> and Dr. M. R. <span class=SpellE>Jayakar</span>
deserve special mention. The one supplemented the other. <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span>
was a great scholar in Persian and Urdu, whereas <span class=SpellE>Jayakar</span>
was devoted to Sanskrit and was well-versed in our epics and classics. <span
class=SpellE>Sapru</span> personified Islamic culture and <span class=SpellE>Jayakar</span>
represented Hindu <i>Dharma. </i><span class=SpellE>Sapru</span> began his
career as a Congressman, supported the Home Rule Movement of<i> </i>Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Besant</span>, joined the Liberals and ultimately in his own words
became a political orphan. But he was always an admirer of the British
traditions and the Commonwealth. At the Imperial Conference <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span>
was reported to<i> </i>have said that he was proud to proclaim that it was <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> which
made the Empire imperial. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Jayakar</span> began his
public career as a <span class=SpellE>Swarajist</span> and oscillated between
Liberalism and Hinduism. Thus <span class=SpellE>Sapru</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Jayakar</span> formed a comprehensive and full personality. They
were such as to be, separately rare, and wonderful in combination. Ardent love
of constitutionalism was common to both. Their contribution to the conclusion
of the <span class=SpellE>pandhi</span>-Irwin Pact and the Poona Pact is a
matter of<i> </i>history. During the Second World War, their efforts as
constitutional experts at the Non-Party Leaders’ Conference brought the
national demand to the forefront in spite of severe repression and stifling of
public opinion. Their study was marked by industry and thoroughness. They gave
the correct lead on crucial issues and tendered the proper counsel at the
opportune moment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is now a thing of the past, they left their beneficent impress on the course of

Emperors <span class=SpellE>Asoka</span>, <span class=SpellE>Harsha</span> and <span

class=SpellE>Bharataratna</span> Dr. <span class=SpellE>Bhagavan</span> Das
successfully blended ancient tradition with modern temper in his monumental
work “The Essential Unity of All Religions” which deserves to be read, re-read
and digested inwardly. Scholarly in exposition, judicious in presenting rival
systems of thought, this great philosopher and thinker imparted to our
composite and catholic heritage the quality of a vital tradition. Thus our
national tradition has all along been one of live and let live, of tolerance
and of toleration, and above all, realization of unity in diversity. It is
hoped that we will soon succeed in raising a pantheon dedicated to the great
liberal-minded men and women of our country. Such an institution will be an <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> to the dead and an incentive to the living. In that
temple of peace and reconciliation all feuds will be forgotten. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

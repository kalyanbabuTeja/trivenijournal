<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">High School</st1:PlaceType> for a brief period and

 w:st="on">Central</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
here. Then it was that I had the good fortune to be a student of his. He used
to wear a suit and a turban, looking very much like a sanitary inspector of the
old days. That was the heyday of the non-co-operation movement and as you all
know, one of the constructive items of activity propounded by Gandhiji was
‘national education.’ Even during this brief period of his career as a teacher
in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Central</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, Sri Sampathgiri Rao must have
been feeling restless under the urge to find his place in the National
Movement, a place suitable to his equipment, aptitude and temperament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
college closed for the summer vacation. But before it reopened I found him one
day merrily riding on a bicycle <span class=SpellE>apparelled</span> in the
manner that has become familiar to all of us<sup>1</sup> and with a look on his
face which betokened that the long-awaited dawn had broken. He had joined the
re-constituted <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">National</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">High School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> as its
Headmaster. That was a lucky day for the institution. It was then housed in a
building in New <span class=SpellE>Tharagupet</span>. A few years later I
joined the staff of the school and even today I remember with a feeling of exhilaration
and nostalgia the life we led with him as our captain. This decision by Sri
Sampathgiri Rao to change-over meant a great deal more than a sartorial
metamorphosis. It made a great change in prospects and security of tenure, the
consequences of which would last through his life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But obviously it was done after full
deliberation and ever since then his mind has not turned back on the decision.
Not only did he fit himself into the new environment of work but whole-heartedly
reconciled himself to the economic consequences of the change. The latter means
much more than appears on the surface and requires much greater strength of
mind and firmness of will than he allows people to discern in his mien.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

is a matter of the greatest pride for this institution that all along it has
been broad-based upon the generosity of the many and does not owe its existence
or functioning to the munificence of a few. Sri Sampathgiri Rao became such a
natural </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and indeed an inevitable part of the school that
he was identified with the institution and the institution with him. That is
indeed, what one of his old pupils and colleagues, who <span class=GramE>is</span>
now in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
says in a letter written after he learnt of Sri Sampathgiri <span class=SpellE>Rao’s</span>
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>impending retirement. Numberless batches of students have
studied under him, and there is hardly any place in this State or even in the
far corners of this vast country where be does not find his old pupils to greet
him, with eager affection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>You know that even the teaching personnel of the
school had a democratic basis and that one or the other of the teachers would
become the Headmaster by the consent of his Colleagues. Though Sri Sampathgiri
Rao was the Headmaster of the school <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>for
the larger part of his tenure, there were substantial periods when he was only
a teacher. But every Position he has held, he has held as by natural right. You
know that from being the </span>‘Prince of Headmasters’, to use Sri V. S.
Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> apposite phrase, he became the
first Principal of the Second Grade College when the Society started one. It
looked to everyone as if that was his appointed place. So did it appear when be
ultimately evolved into Principal of a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">First</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Grade</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Now, that a man
should be the teacher of a High School, the Headmaster of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>a High School, the Principal of a Second
Grade College and the Principal of a First Grade College, and that it should be
taken for granted that he discharges each one of these duties with more than
the requisite competence, is in itself a testimony to the stuff of which he is
made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
work in the institution, however, hardly exhausted his energies or resources.
He was associated with many other activities and amongst them I may mention the
work he did for the Amateur Dramatic Association and in helping his friend Sri
T. T. <span class=SpellE>Sharman</span> to run his weeklies, particularly the
‘Mysore Chronicle’. This has not been his sole essay into journalism. He finds
himself equally at home in the humdrum business of writing for a daily or a
weekly, in the more staid avocation of editing a School magazine, and in the
exacting task of steering a patrician periodical like the Triveni. Nor can one
forget that, in collaboration with a life-long friend of his <sup>2</sup> he
edited, under the auspices of the Amateur Dramatic Association, the journal
‘The Theatre’ during its brief but <span class=SpellE>colourful</span> career.
Talking of <i>Triveni</i>, I may mention incidentally that when its
distinguished Editor, who had made the cause of culture through the medium of
that magazine his life mission, was kept under preventive detention, Sri Sampathgiri
Rao took it upon himself to run the magazine from Bangalore, secured the
co-operation of friends and did the job so well, that even after the Editor’s
release, Bangalore continued to be the home of <i>Triveni</i> until other
exigencies dictated its transfer to another venue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Sampathgiri Rao was in the thick of the movement for the renaissance of
Kannada. He has been intimately associated with the Kannada Sahitya <span
class=SpellE>Parishat</span> and he has wandered all over the land on its
mission and similar missions. You all know that he has translated into Kannada
most of <span class=SpellE>Rajaji’s</span> writings. This incidentally brings
to my mind that he is a great linguist. His so-called second language in his
early educational career was Telugu. He lived in the Tamil land and became
proficient in Tamil. He <span class=SpellE>specialised</span> in English. He
was one of the earliest workers in the Hindi field and has picked up more than
a working knowledge of that language. It is refreshing to remember in today’s
context, when there has been an unfortunate recrudescence of linguistic
controversy, that Sri Sampathgiri Rao stands as the personification of
linguistic harmony and establishes the futility of such </span><span

the purely political aspect of our National Movement did not leave him totally
untouched and many of those who actually participated in the movement claimed
his tutelage, his work has mostly been in the constructive field. He has been
associated with the <span class=SpellE>Khadi</span> movement right from the
start and is himself an excellent spinner. It is his pride that a good part of
his clothing is made of yarn spun by himself. He has been a living exponent of
all that Gandhiji stood for and it is but fitting that he should be the
President of the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Gandhi Study

of an educational institution in <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>. His
contacts will thus be further extended and he will be our ambassador there. And
if we had the choice in our hands, we could not make a happier choice. May I,
on behalf of you all, extend our best wishes to him for the success of his
mission?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
long and deep educational experience has naturally been availed of by our
University and educational authorities and it is but natural that for long he
was associated with the management of the <span class=SpellE>Gurukula</span> at
<span class=SpellE>Kengeri</span>. He represented the Teachers’ Constituency in
the Legislative Council and was its temporary Chairman. I do not, however, want
to make this a catalogue of all his activities. But I cannot fail to refer to
his association with the <span class=SpellE>Gokhale</span> Institute of Public
Affairs as a member of its Governing Body right from the start. I am too close
to that institution to say more about it. I shall content myself with saying
that it looked as if he built his abode at the threshold of the site given to
the Institute so as to be its guardian angel. We shall, indeed, sadly miss him
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall now turn to what I may call his human or non-institutional side. He is
richly endowed by nature with the gift of an alert mind, a warm heart and deep
interest in all matters of culture. He has read widely and deeply and he is one
of our most accomplished speakers. He is a great connoisseur of music, art (not
excluding the culinary art) and the drama and I know that he has himself
appeared on the stage. I particularly remember how at a Conference of the <span
class=SpellE>Pandits</span> <span class=SpellE>Parishat</span> at <span
class=SpellE>Srinivasapur</span> it was decided to get up an impromptu drama
under the leadership of Sri <span class=SpellE>Kasturi</span> and they not only
improvised the drama itself but Sri Sampathgiri Rao played one of its leading
parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a personality like this has necessarily to pay the penalty by giving the
impression that he has the defects of these very qualities. Many think that his
general attitude is one of undiscriminating benevolence, that he is soft, that
he is not sufficiently assertive, that he yields far too much when he ought not
to yield </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>at all, and that he allows himself to be dragged
hither and thither, while his stature is such that he can stand up to any one
that he has to deal with. But that would be a very superficial assessment.
Obviously he makes a distinction between what is fundamental and vital on the
one hand and what constitutes the subsidiary things in Life in which it is wise
and proper to accommodate other points of view and others’ desires. He does not
needlessly enter into controversy. But in regard to any matter which represents
the core of his beliefs and values you will find that he will deal with it
firmly and effectively. His mind is a rich store-house of knowledge and
experience. The demands made on him by educational and students’ <span
class=SpellE>organisations</span>, by cultural <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>
like All India Radio and sundry other <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>,
are endless. His generous heart does not permit him easily to refuse and you
find him scheduled to talk not only in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City>,
but in a hundred places all over this part of the country. Could you find a
better companion? Association with him is a continuous process of education and
joy, enlivened as it is by a keen sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span>,
which, normally gentle in its manifestation, can occasionally be devastating;
but it is never tinged with malice or bitterness. This flows essentially from
his outlook which is based on equipoise of mind. He has had his quota of trials
and misfortunes in life. But he has not allowed them to sour his heart or daunt
his spirit. On the positive side, he exemplifies the principle that the most
effective way of enriching one’s life is to enrich the lives of those around <span
class=GramE>oneself</span>. He gives of his very best to the community and he
draws the utmost <span class=SpellE>flavour</span> that life offers him. Never
seeking to reach beyond the severe limitations that he has imposed upon himself
by the choice of his career, he husbands his resources with great
judiciousness. This enables him to be always in good cheer and to radiate cheer
to those around him. I shall only say that a man who has attained such a scheme
of values and lives by them can with justice be described as a <span
class=SpellE>practising</span> philosopher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me say, this institution is much more than the brick and mortar in which it is

His personality is a permanent part of its very constitution. It is therefore
most appropriate that his portrait should adorn this hall. I consider it a
great privilege that I should be asked to unveil his portrait and I do so with
the utmost pleasure. And may I express my gratitude to the management for

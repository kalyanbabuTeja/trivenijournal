consciousness is of recent origin in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It took <span class=SpellE>organised</span>
form with the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885, when eminent
individuals, hailing from different regions of India and professing different
religions but all educated in the English language, English literature and <span
class=SpellE>EngLish</span> history, and inspired by an Englishman, Alan <span
class=SpellE>Octavian</span> Hume, come together, conscious of their common
Indian nationalism. Though they were a small minority in the vast Indian
population, they constituted the brain of the community. In 1905 <span
class=SpellE>Gopal</span> Krishna Gokhale was able to record with satisfaction
that the growth of the feeling of common, nationality, based on common
traditions and ties, common hopes and aspirations, and on common disabilities,
was striking. “The fact that we are Indians first, and Hindus and <span
class=SpellE>Muhammadans</span>, Parsees or Christians, afterwards, is being <span
class=SpellE>realised</span> in a steadily increasing measure, and the idea of
a united India, marching onwards to a place among the nations of the world,
worthy of her great past, is no longer a mere idle dream of a few imaginative
minds, but is the definitely accepted creed of those who form the brain of the
community–the educated classes of the country.” By ‘educated’ he meant educated
in the <span class=GramE>English language, literature and history.</span>
Today, over fifty years after Gokhale expressed his satisfaction, and about
fifteen years after <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
attained <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>,
Indian nationalism is very much in retreat. The feeling that we are “Indians
first” has given place to the feeling that we are “Indians last”! With rare and
noble exceptions, the citizens of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> have become intensely and
lamentably conscious of divisive sentiments based on region, race, religion and
language, caste and out-caste. Instead of nationalism blossoming into
internationalism it has <span class=SpellE>shrivelled</span> into tribalism,
marred further by too frequent </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

non-violence preached as first </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

first serious blow to Indian nationalism was struck in 1905 when Lord <span
class=SpellE>Curzon</span>, the British Viceroy of India, vivisected Bengal,
professedly on administrative grounds, but really on a communal basis, and
carved out the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Muslim</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Province</st1:PlaceType> of East <st1:place w:st="on">Bengal</st1:place>,
and drove a wedge between Hindus and Muslims in the interest of British
imperialism. While Indian nationalism strove to undo the mischief by the
anti-Partition agitation, Lord <span class=SpellE>Minto</span>, who succeeded
Lord <span class=SpellE>Curzon</span>, dealt a more deadly blow to it by
conceding separate electorates and excessive representation to Muslims as
Muslims. Indian nationalism made a great effort to restore Hindu-Muslim unity
for constitutional advance at the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Lucknow</span></st1:place></st1:City> session of the Indian
National Congress in 1916, but had to concede separate electorates which <span
class=SpellE>Minto</span> gave the Muslims, and hoped it would be temporary.
But the hope was not <span class=SpellE>realised</span>. On the other hand, the
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Lucknow</span></st1:place></st1:City>
compromise stood in the way of eliminating communalism in the <span
class=SpellE>Montagu</span> Constitution of 1919. Finally, it led to the
Partition of India in 1947 and the creation of the Islamic State of Pakistan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian Constitution of 1935, enacted by the British, distinguished the
Depressed Classes from the rest of the Hindu community and gave them separate
representation. Mahatma Gandhi protested against it on the ground that, while
Muslims might be proud of Islam and its survival, the Depressed Classes might
not be proud of their untouchability and its survival. But, ultimately, even he
admitted separate representation of the Depressed Classes, though somewhat
indirectly. <span class=GramE>After attaining <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Independence</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>
made a heroic attempt to build up nationalism by abolishing separate
electorates and outlawing untouchability.</span> But, unfortunately, the Indian
Constitution recognized the separate identity, for certain privileges, of the
Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, the Backward Classes and the
Anglo-Indians, but limited it to ten years. The exceptional status has since
been extended to another ten years and threatens to be permanent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are the problems peculiar to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes to which
reservations in schools, services and legislatures are the appropriate
solution? Caste and tribe, like race and sex, are <i>biological </i>inheritances,
fixed at the birth of the individual and immutable during his lifetime, whereas
political, educational and other attainments are <i>cultural </i>factors,
acquired after the birth of the individual and mutable during his lifetime. No
citizen can change his caste, even as he cannot change his race or sex. Since
the days of British rule, and more so since Indian Independence, the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes suffered from no disabilities which the Constitution imposed
and which it can remedy. Their disabilities were, and still are, <i>social </i>in
the limited sense of eating and marrying. Members of a caste or sub-caste
generally eat with and marry members of their own caste or sub-caste, and not
across. In this respect the Scheduled Castes and Tribes are not a homogeneous
caste; they are divided and sub-divided to numerous sub-castes. The Census of
India (Paper 2 of 1960) enumerated 405 Scheduled Castes and 255 Scheduled
Tribes! The immiscibility in dining and marriage is not, however, special to
them, but prevails in the other and very numerous castes in Hindu society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
addition to horizontal and impassable social stratification, the caste system
constitutes a vertical hierarchy of “superior” and “inferior” castes and
“out-castes”, involving humiliations and indignities in social relations.
These, however, are extra-constitutional and cannot be remedied by reservations
in educational institutions, Government services and legislatures, but only by
social remedies like inter-caste marriages. The law has removed barriers to
such marriages; but cannot compel them. Government can, however, encourage
voluntary action by offering prizes and subsidies in the interest of national
integration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
plan for reservations for Scheduled Castes, etc., is often urged on the presumption
that these castes are unable to compete with the “higher” castes in open
competition. If the disability of biological origin, reservations in schools,
services and legislatures, cannot cure it, but will only result in government
by the less fit. It can be modified only in succeeding generations by
cross-breeding, as in the case of plants and animals. But there is no
justification for the presumption. Intelligence, character and competence vary
with individuals and not castes or races or sexes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Government of India amended the Electoral Law of India to <span class=SpellE>penalise</span>
appeals to caste sympathies and ‘antipathies for winning elections. They also
proposed to withdraw exemption from income-tax donations to communal charities.
While these are very wise steps, Government may not overlook the fact that <span
class=SpellE>casteism</span> is rampant in administration allover <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and is
the avowed policy in several States. In the interest of national integration, <span
class=SpellE>casteism</span> should be <span class=SpellE>penalised</span> in

Constitution also <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> “Backward Classes <span

class=GramE>The President’s Commission, appointed under Art.</span> 340 of the
Constitution, failed to arrive at an acceptable definition, and fell back on
caste and enumerated over 1700 of them! The Government of India rejected its
Report and <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> the economic criterion. Caste has
no correlation with educational attainments and economic status. Individuals,
in every caste, vary considerably in these respects, and at different times.
Everybody, irrespective of caste, is born illiterate. Some of them achieve high
educational attainments in later life. Some are born of comparatively poor
parents but may later amass considerable wealth. It is a universal phenomenon,
not confined to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The best solution in the interest of national integration is to <span

mischief. It took three forms: the re-drawing of the provincial boundaries, to
create <span class=SpellE>uni</span>-lingual units, the elimination of the
English language as the medium of higher education and administration, and the
adoption of Hindi in its place. The attempt to <span class=SpellE>reorganise</span>
the multi-lingual Provinces in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
into <span class=SpellE>uni</span>-lingual Provinces has failed utterly, since
no <span class=SpellE>reorganised</span> unit is <span class=SpellE>uni</span>-lingual,
but continues to be multi-lingual. The only result has been that the language
of the new majority in each Province has been encouraged to impose its
linguistic imperialism over the languages of the minorities, resulting in
bitterness and even violence. The argument in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of <span class=SpellE>uni</span>-lingual Provinces was that there should be a
common language between the Government and the people for the efficient
operation of parliamentary democracy which <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

be valid, there should be a common language between the Government of India and

In which case, the whole of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will be <span class=SpellE>uni</span>-lingual, and the case for <span

attempt to displace English by Hindi as the medium of higher education and
administration is fatal to Indian nationalism, not only because of the merits
of English but also because of the demerits of Hindi. It is a matter for some
satisfaction that the Government of India, led by Prime Minister Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, has categorically affirmed that English would continue
indefinitely, and would not be displaced by Hindi unless non-Hindi people
requested it. But the proposed legislation does not implement the assurance. On
the other hand, the action of the Government of India in forcing Hindi on the <span

all-India cadre, and officers should be transferred periodically from one State
to another and shuttle between the States and the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>.
Certain officers like the Chief Justice, the Chief Secretary and the

political parties are essential for democracy, though there are innumerable <span

and cultural associations and business concerns, which are democratic without
the party system and where the party system is considered a weakness and a
curse! If freedom of speech and vote are essential for democracy, the party
system denies them in the duly constituted legislatures, whose decisions bind
not only the party but also the nation. If a member is in a minority in his
party, he is not free to speak and vote according to his conscience in the
legislature but has to toe the majority-line. Party system, is thus not only
undemocratic but also anti-democratic. It is majority tyranny within the party
and between the parties. The Opposition is tempted to wage an unrelenting cold
war against the Government Party with a view to discrediting it, dethroning it
and taking its place. The nation asks, “<span class=GramE>all</span> for the nation
and none for a party”; the party system responds, “each for his party and none
for the nation”. Only Independents, not tied by party mandates, can be
democratic and national. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is noteworthy that no Constitution, however democratic, has <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
the party system, which it would have done if it were essential to democracy.
No instrument of the Constitution, like the Election Commission, should
therefore <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> political parties, give them
symbols at elections, <span class=GramE>much</span> less prescribe arbitrary
criteria for such recognition, such as the voting strength at the last
election. Political parties are extra-constitutional <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>,
which are sometimes formed after the last general election. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

struggle of individuals and parties is largely for political power and for the
patronage and perquisites it carries, and only incidentally for service to the
nation. It is, therefore, desirable to <span class=SpellE>minimise</span>, if
not eliminate, party and personal politics. The Parliamentary system should be
replaced by the Presidential system, or a variant of it. The executive
Government should be elected by the legislature by proportional representation
and hold office during the normal term of the legislature. It should be
“responsive”, but not “responsible”, to the legislature. The Swiss Constitution
seems best for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It was recommended by the late <span class=SpellE>Rt</span> Hon. V. S.
Srinivasa Sastri. Prof. V. A. Dicey described it as government by a “Board of
Directors appointed to manage the concern of the Federation in accordance with
the wishes of the Federal Assembly”. Prof. R. C. <span class=SpellE>Ghose</span>
of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> said that the Swiss
Government was remarkably free from bitter party rivalry or monopoly of power,
and gave no opportunity for professionalism and demagogy in politics, and that
the administration was highly businesslike and efficient. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is obvious that, though <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
inherited some divisive factors from the days of the British, she added some
more since <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>,
owing to the weaknesses of her leaders. Among the weaknesses is the toleration
of corruption, particularly financial, among politicians. While it is some
consolation that, according to the American expert, Dr <span class=SpellE>Appelby</span>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is not the worst in this respect, it is generally and <span class=SpellE>regretably</span>
admitted that corruption in absolute terms has increased to huge proportions.
Government of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
promulgated rules to check corruption in officials by obligating them to send
annual returns of their immovable properties and to seek permission for
acquisition of properties worth <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 1,000 and more
and for the employment of their near relations in firms, etc. Such rules should
be applied first and foremost to legislators and politicians generally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of financial corruption, it is not easy to prove it to the
satisfaction of the courts and then punish those found guilty. Even if a person
be acquitted, the humiliation of having been accused in the first instance
cannot be entirely wiped out; it will be said <span class=GramE>that the charge
was not proved but not that it was not true</span>. Prevention is better than
punishment. It is, therefore, highly desirable that all those in authority,
particularly ministers and legislators, should be obliged to submit their
annual statements of assets for publication. If a person failed to disclose a
debt due to him, he should not be able to recover it by legal action.
Publication is the best single deterrent to financial corruption. Publication
of tax assessments is in vogue in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Sweden</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>, and was proposed
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
it was supported by <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> C. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Mr</span> A. D. <span class=SpellE>Shroff</span> and by the
Indian Direct Taxes Inquiry Committee, presided over by <span class=SpellE>Mr</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mahabir</span> <span class=SpellE>Tyagi</span>. Such
publication should begin with the ministers and legislators. If they are
deterred from corruption, they are likely to deter it in the officials, and all
along the line. Personal integrity is essential for national integration.</span><span

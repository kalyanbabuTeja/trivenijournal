pass any verdict on contemporary literature would be involving oneself in
controversy. Much of the present endeavour in letter has to stand the test of
time till it is added on to our store of permanent literature. But in the
meanwhile we need not be different to the various ideas and ideals, and hopes
and aspirations of our country that invariably find their expression in the
visions of our bards and story-tellers. When their achievement is coordinated
and further helped by new creative activity, it might flower into richness of
life and bring forth a happier understanding of its abiding values.
Disillusioned critics often tell us stories of doom and disaster and bemoan the
desecration of a golden heritage by the modern poets. But in their work,
whatever professional aesthetes might have to say, we can clearly visualise a
golden Renaissance and a brilliant future for Indian literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
Spenser was to English literature so has been Rabindranath Tagore to modern
Indian literature: be has been the poets’ poet. Western education broadened the
horizon of Indian experience awakening the country’s sleeping soul to the
enchantment of sudden life and manifold striving. The spell of age-long
indolence was broken and, at last, the nation found herself endowed with mighty
and puissant wings. Almost inevitably, every new idea that entered the country
due to the impact of the West gained currency through Bengal and Bengali. With
their trembling awareness to novelties and their shifting sensibility for
realities, the Bengalees have contributed a lion’s share to the social ferment
that took place in the early decades of the century. The modern Renaissance in
our art and literature may be attributed to the pioneering work done by Raja
Ram Mohan Roy, Maharshi Devendra Nath Tagore, Iswara Chandra Vidyasagar, Chitta
Ranjan Das, Aurobindo, Dwijendra Lal Roy, Bankim Chandra Chatterji,
Rabindranath Tagore and other stalwart in their own way. Rabindranath Tagore
presented in his poetry a synthesis of the past and the present, embellished by
a glorious vision for the future. He stands in the direct line of ancient Hindu
culture. He is of the brotherhood of Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti and Jayadev. Yet
he is unique in having combined the great heritage with a wider and more
comprehensive and universal sympathy for the burning problems of present-day
life. He explored new possibilities in rhythm and expression and showed that
the Indian poet lacks neither imagination nor invention. A more popular medium
of communication than in the past was sought to be employed by all those who
versified under his inspiration. The movement for the use of the ‘spoken
language’ for literary purposes gained momentum everywhere and resulted in the
recognition of ‘Khadi Boli’ for Hindi poetry and ‘Sishta Vyavaharika’ for
Telugu prose. In yet another direction, Tagore’s influence released a strong
lyrical impulse throughout the country. His dreams, his twilight memories, his
crystal verses of fancy brimming with somnolent visions, his pictorial effects
and his lyric dramas set a new fashion for writers who filled the Indian air
with stars and melodies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sri Gurajada Apparao exhorted his fellow poets, and a whole corpus of
imaginative literature was produced under the name of ‘Bhava Kavitvam’ in
Telugu. In Hindi, there arose a group of poets who gave a new colour to the mysticism
of the old Sufis and to the devotional poetry of the ‘Rama’ and ‘Krishna’
cults. Thus they could have claimed to continue the tradition of poetry
hallowed by Kabir, Mira, Tulsi, Sur, Bihari and Dev. After the First War, India
advanced further in the arduous task of self-realisation and, long before the
Second War, her vast potentialities were realised and recorded in every realm
of her resurgent life. The literature produced between the two World Wars in
the several Indian languages has all the merits and, perhaps, a few drawbacks
too, that naturally belong to a transition age. But we can say with some
certainty that the poetic soul–the Sleeping Beauty–has been fully liberated
from the past trends of decadence and is bound to knock at the gates of success
and positive achievement. Modern Hindi literature is a good example to
illustrate this march of Indian literatures which show many common
features,–great imaginative wealth, abundant lyricism and growing awareness of
the problems of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Modern
Hindi had to fight many odds before it could discover its own poetic soul. In
the Age of the Stylists (Riti-Kal) and Rhetoricians there was a wide
dissociation between life and letters and, in the quest for the subtleties of
form, poetry was degraded to mere versification; individuality was tormented on
the Procrustean bed of convention and conformity; and true and sincere feeling
was abandoned in the weary manipulation of tropes and figures, of sentiment and
sophistry. The pure flame of passion and poetry that gleamed through the
immortal works of Tulsi and Surdas was choked by grammatical rule and
rhetorical illustration. The heart–the real seat of genuine poetic
feeling–became a void; or, if it had any semblance of life, it was filled with
ghosts of the past that troubled the joy of glad creation. The modern poet had,
therefore, to emancipate himself from a conservative style on one hand, and an
unhealthy tradition of depicting sensual life on the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
reaction set in, naturally, as one would expect; but, in its empirical stages,
Hindi poetry was faced with the question of a standard medium of expression.
‘Braj-Bhasha’ was the literary dialect in the past and still held its sway over
the poets, though, as a spoken type, it was much changed and was replaced by
‘Khadi Boli’, the variety of Hindi spoken in Delhi, the seat of Mughal power
and centre of Indian culture during their rule. Due to various causes, social,
political and economic, the Delhi dialect assumed the nature of standard Hindi
and it was only a fact of historical necessity that the growing need for a
common medium of literature had to be met by it. There was a movement for
‘Khadi Boli’ and many writers gave up the outmoded ‘Braj-Bhasha’ and, following
the lead given by Maha Vir Prasad Dvivedi, talented poets like Maithili Saran
Gupta, Sridhar Pathak and Ayodhya Simh Upadhyay, ‘Hariaudh’, established it as
the language of modern poetry. It is a mistake, however to suppose that ‘Khadi
Boli’ was an entirely new-fangled medium without a literary heritage. Khusro
Miyan and other courtiers of the great Mughals composed their witticisms and
alert Poetic retorts in this variety of Hindi. In folk-lore it touched creative
levels. Hesitant and trembling with its own possibilities, in its initial
stages, ‘Khadi Boli’ acquired an unusual felicity of expression and a rich
hoard of imaginative literature. It had a great advantage over its predecessor
the ‘Braj-Bhasha’. It was a comparatively simple, flexible and suggestive
language, having reduced by far the inflexions and declensional permutations of
Primitive Hindi which originated from the Apabhramsas of Sanskrit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
there was the question of metre. The traditional patterns of verse were not in
consonance with the new genius of the country, either in themes or in forms.
Research was hence carried on in this direction with enthusiasm. A few metres
of the Vritta type were borrowed from Sanskrit prosody; a few native metres
that had lost their vogue in the decadent period were revived; and, in extreme
cases, Free Verse was attempted. Blank Verse with quantitative metre had come
to stay as the predominant type. The new experiments yielded rich results and
prepared the language and the metre for expressing all the multitudinous shades
and rhythms of life itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Literature
in the past was confined to a single type, namely, the ‘Prabandha Kavya’. The
modern Renaissance extended the frontiers of Indian literature in a variety of
directions. The lyric, the epic, the drama, the one-act play; the novel, the
short story, the biography and the auto-biography–all these types found place
in the writings of the age. This instantaneous blossoming in many directions
led sometimes to romantic excess, and sometimes to anarchic melodrama. But in
the slow process of trial and error, the young plant took root, gained
sustenance and swayed into a bountiful spring with blossom and fruit. The ray
of the new sun that hissed against the frosty splendours of the past soared
into an enchanted noon. The world of letters shone forth with mellow and
manifold radiance.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Revolt
of solitary instincts against the bonds of the past” is the key to the various
forms that the new Romanticism assumed. There had been a dearth of sincere
passion in the poets of the preceding age; no new awareness was brought to life
by their poetry. Poetic convention had thrown a sluggish cloud of familiarity
over the external world which lost its capacity to evoke the elemental sense of
wonder,–the basis of great poetry and the fountain-light of new day, The modern
poet had to discover anew the strange beauty of reality and had to deal with
the whole internal panorama of human consciousness and experience, The problem
that confronted him was not to become a poet in his own language but to raise
himself to a more cosmic level and become a poet of the world and also write
‘poetry of the future’. The narrow domestic walls were being broken, while men
were gathered up into one common destiny. Romantic love, especially when
unfortunate, combined in itself most of the strong and sinuous passions–“hate
and resentment and jealousy, remorse and despair, outraged pride and the fury
of the unjustly repressed, the purity of unrestrained surrender and the ecstasy
of infinite longing.” Encouraged by Romanticism some poets became “anti-social
and even anarchic”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
most of them revived the old mystic creed and produced a highly imaginative
type of poetry abounding in song and emotion: “The mystic acquires a new energy
and sense of power from the cessation of the inner conflict and enjoys a sense
of godlike exaltation in the contemplation of the infinite.” The mystic
experience is by its very nature obscure to ordinary perception; it is not the
less real for that. The living language of a mystic dream becomes all but dead
on awakening. We need an interpreter, a translator. And it is here that the
mystic poet steps in. When poetic vision lushes philosophic contemplation with
fancy and melody, we have a new type of poetry wherein the mystery of the
Universe is unravelled in terms of faith and beauty:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the history of Indian mysticism Kabir reinforced this tendency in order to
counter the extreme formalism of the orthodox cult. It was an effort that might
be compared to the protest levelled by the English Romanticism against the dry
intellectualism of philosophers. It was found that the head could lead the soul
away from Nature and God; in terms of vivid urgency, therefore, the demands of
the heart were sought to be reasserted. Kabir approached God, not through the
vicarious agencies of Love, Beauty or Nature, but through personal adoration
and devotion. “He merges and melts into a unity by ascending to a height of
spiritual intuition where there is no room for incompatible concepts either of
religion or of philosophy. His songs illustrate all the fluctuations of the
mystics’ emotions, the ecstasy, the despair, the still beatitude, the eager
self-devotion, the flashes of wide illumination, the moments of intimate love:</span><span

images or ‘ohayas’ which were, in the old religious verse, a method of apprehending
the mystery of life, lost their spiritual quality and their evocative power and
became mere cliches in the works of the Stylists during the ‘Riti Kala’. We
find a continuity of tradition in the modern revival of the mystic cult; but we
find a new set of images coming into existence, for the new poetry has had to
deal with a wider range of human experience than in the past. Thus Rahasyavada
stands for the modern outlook while Chayavad represents the modern technique.
“Human love is symbolic of divine love; falling leaves are a symbol of human
mortality, because they are examples of the same law which operates through all
the manifestations of life.” Aurobindo employs this technique with great
effect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

modern Hindi poets have primarily occupied themselves “with a mystical
interpretation of life through nature, love and beauty. The constant comparison
of natural with spiritual processes is, on the whole, the most marked feature
of their poetry. The mystic poet of Nature, by introducing rain and cloud, wind
and the rising river, boatmen, lamps, temples and gongs, flutes and Veenas,
birds flying home at dusk, tired travellers, flowers opening and falling,
showers and vessels, has given a new tone to the poet</span><span

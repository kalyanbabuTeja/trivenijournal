mention of the word <i>Sati </i>spurs the imagination to envision the picture
of a woman of utter virtue and self-abnegation who voluntarily consigned
herself to the flames on her husband’s pyre. Literally, the word denotes a
variegated combination of purity, truth and faith. In its heyday, consummation
of the right of widow-burning was believed to confer inestimable beneficence
not only on the prime incumbent of the ministration, which, inter alia, assured
her abode in heaven along with her husband for as many years as hair on human
body–3.5 crores–but also on three races with whom her earthly existence was
linked, i.e., those of her mother, father and husband besides peripheral
benefits that the priests and the general public obtained by accompanying the
procession and witnessing the ceremony and by occasionally receiving floral
gifts from the Sati. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
ancient societies the world over were, at one time or the other, swayed by the
custom of widow-burning, or more rarely burying, but after reaching a certain
point of zenith, it seems to have faded out into total disuse through an
organised social effort or a happy conjunction of natural forces. One possible
reason for its early discontinuance in those societies could be the complete
absence of religious sanction behind the convention which denied its
opportunity </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and expediency of entrenchment. The custom was
observed in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>one form or the other by Chinese, Greeks,
Egyptians, Slavs, Scandinavians. Germans, Teutons, Gauls and Hermites. In fact,
it could be said that at some time or the other on the entire human race the
shadow of this rite was cast in varying degrees. In some cases only funeral
offerings were made which included generous gifts of slaves who were
slaughtered without the slightest compunction. Royal mummies of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> were
entombed in the company of numerous slaves for rendering assistance in the
after-death life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the custom could be traced back to the dawn of </span><span style='font-size:

Proponents of the thesis that the custom flourished in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
Vedic ages are numerous but their interpretation of the scriptural passages of
questionable authenticities is not free from doubt. It is commonly known that
Rig Veda treats of pleasures of life and a diametrically opposite picture of
grim and dolorous rite could </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not be co-existent therewith and is
therefore unsupportable in that context. It may be that in keeping with the
medieval and dark </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>forces of the earth, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> could not be an exception to
the observance of a social custom which was followed in other lands. Some
authorities expound that Scynthians were the original race who gave birth to
the idea, nurtured it and propagated the same in the lands where they settled.
A conjecture is offered that the concept germinated in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> with
Scynthians. However, the rite is said to have formed not an unimportant part in
the funeral ceremonies </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>before Ramayana and Mahabharata or about
300 years B. C. In certain texts, eight centuries before Christ, traces of
reference to Sati are found. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda, rites of the Antyesti Samskara (the last
ceremonies) are delineated where reference to the laying of the widow on the
funeral pyre is available. No trace of concremation is to be found in these
texts. The Purpose of laying the widow along with her deceased husband is
cloaked in indissoluble mystery. A guess may be ventured here. Since it is
believed that the spirit of the departed person hovers around </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
dead body for sometime after the person is commonly believed dead, an ingenuous
system was devised by the bigoted and gullible </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>priesthood of
eliciting permission from the dead person for allowing the widow to abide in
the world and relinquish wealth to the descendants. An address to this effect
was made to the dead man while the widow lay alongside the corpse, whereafter,
a younger brother or any other suitable person held her by left hand urging her
to rise and relinquish the world of the dead, further asking her to agree to be
the wife of one who was willing to marry her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
description is suggestive. It is possible that in certain cases the widows may
have refused to relinquish the side of their dead husbands. Their living
relationship may have been intensely emotional and the woman may have been
bowed down by excessive grief on the loss of her Lord, the visible God without
whom life may have no meaning for her or in whose absence continuance of
existence just could not be contemplated. A further conjecture is that in one
of the symptomatic or pioneering instances the woman may have been compelled to
accompany her partner by vested interests of her domestic life, particularly
those who coveted the considerable wealth that the deceased may have left
behind. Or perhaps the burden of maintenance of the widow may have impelled a heartless
patriarch to enter into collusion with the priestdom for an easy elimination of
the widow, injecting the mundane suggestion with religious respectability and
piousness, holding out, at the same time, a promise of great ethereal splendour
in after life. No religious sanction ever seems to have been attached to the
custom. It is only the perversion of the rooted and vested behoof of the
medieval mind that twisted the scriptural stipulations to interpretation
congenial to its own end. Manu, the Law-giver, does not enjoin the practice nor
for that matter is it supported by later faiths in the strands of Indian social
or religious life. Manu’s directions to the widow is for leading a life of an
ascetic after the departure of her Lord. Provisions in innumerable ancient
texts that a law contrary in spirit to that enjoined by Manu is not commendable
must be taken clear note of. Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism expostulated against
the practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is therefore apparent that no single factor or consideration can be held
responsible for transfixation of the practice in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, though due primarily to
local influences its predominance in certain parts of the country can be
explained, even as its sparse acceptance in others can be accounted for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Aryans–among them principally the aristocracy ­may have followed the rite for
over a thousand years, yet the earliest, recorded instance of Sati is provided
in the account left to posterity by a Greek historian. Diodorus Siculus, who may
have be approximated to have lived in Julius Caeser’s time. The event described
is the death and funeral of a Hindu General named Keteus serving under Eumenes,
the Greek Commander of Alexander’s army. While fighting Antigonos somewhere in
316 or 317 B.C., the Indian General was killed and an obstreperous contro­versy
raged between his two wives who vied for the honour of concremation. The issue,
in deference to the accepted convention then prevalent, was settled in favour
of the younger spouse as the elder was big with a child. Bedecked as bride, she
laid herself by the side of her husband on the pyre. A detachment of the army
marched three times around the pyre platform. The violence of flames could not
draw a cry of anguish from the voluntary participant; she is reported to have
bid adieu with a smile, perhaps with a wave of arm even as the flames
completely engulfed her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

assigned full approbation to the rite. However, no explicit legal or religious
sanction seem attached to the fashion. Successive cases of selflessness, grit,
valour and chivalry, loftiness of purpose and sublimity of action that the once
languishing custom leaped into a raging fashion embraced by all castes and

time. This may well have been influenced by Scythian practice of similar nature.
Bana quotes instances where concubines, sisters and even mothers concremated
themselves the practice being known as Sahamarana, or Sahagamana or Anvarohana.

later, the famous French traveller Jean Tavernier, who made a number of trips
to India, clearly portrays the custom in his reminiscences which relate to a
period between 1640 to 1667 A. D. He states that the alternative to Sati open
to the widow was to lead a life of unbroken misery, disgrace and contempt–an
existence of a worth lesser than even a slave enjoyed. Most often the balance
of choice tilted in favour of the custom, the decision in no small measure being
dictated by the over-zealous relations and priesthood who did not tarry in
portraying the pictures of glory and edification that awaited the deceased and
the widow in the other world. The woman who had decided to go the way, had her
head shaved and ornaments, e.g., arms and leg bracelets which were presented by
her husband symbolising her faithfulness to him, were taken away. Though during
the period in reference the Muslim rulers had, in a half-hearted fashion,
forbidden the commission of the rite as their permission to consummate the rite
was mandatory, such permission appears to have been freely granted in
consideration for a sizable bribe offered to the Muslim governors. Other
ingredients, such as bedecking the lady as a bride, playing of music, distribution
of relics by the would-be Sati and the possible administration of drugs,
narcotics and potions to induce insensibility were common to this period as in
the immemorial past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

accompanied by defeaning beating of drums and cymbals. In certain places,
mostly near the sandy shores, instances of burying the dead and the living have
been recorded. The woman was placed upright with the husband in her lap in a
deep hole and each relation poured a bucketful of the earth and sand until the
hole was covered a level with the ground or a foot or two above ground level.
The relations then jumped thereat to ensure that the Sati was smothered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

enlightened minds saw the evil in the practice of Sati and each great man who
supported its abolition expressed forcefully the need for its total prohibition
and took practical steps in this direction. Mahanirvana Tantra condemned the
practice in no ambiguous terms and stated that those who perpetrated the crime
of burning the woman with her husband earn for themselves only a place in
eternal hell. The practice is likened to the act of performance of black magic
in Medhatithi on Manu. Annmarana, the pathetic act of dying with any article
left by the husband e.g., Padukas, loin-cloth, turban etc., which is nothing
short of suicide, is deemed an act of irreligion against the spirit of the
Sastras. Vedas have laid down the cardinal principle of completing one’s span
of life on earth which should not be shortened by any voluntary or deliberate
act, however socially justified such an exercise might be. Bana Bhatt was one
of the earliest advocates who took an unequivocal stand for its obliteration.
Bana has gone a step further in branding the perpetrators of the custom as
ignorant, short-sighted lot. He has brought out a new angle in that he calls it
suicide by the widows committed purely to obviate the unendurable grief
sustained by them, thus tearing apart the weakness which may in many cases have
been responsible in sending the simple minded young widows to their dooms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a vestige of their culture, these converts continued to practise the rite as of
old, except that they buried their dead along with the living in contrast to
burning them. A case of 10 to 12 year old girl is cited who was buried along
with her husband of the same age. Royal decree prohibited the practice on pain

half-hearted measure adopted by the ruling authority in suppression of the rite
bore no appreciable results, as the Muslim governors from whom prior permission
was to be obtained, were too acquiese for a consideration which was gladly
offered. The social reformer, who went all out for its erosion was largely
unsuccessful for lack of enforcing capability. It was, therefore, essential
that a fusion of both these prerequisites was available to eradicate the evil.
Making perhaps an apparent show of policy of non-interference in the social
conduct of their Hindu subjects, the Muslim rulers followed a policy of passivity.

Macaulay’s encomiums as “the man who abolished cruel rites, gave liberty to the

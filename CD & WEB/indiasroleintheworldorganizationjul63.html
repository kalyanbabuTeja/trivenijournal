the early stages, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
policy was dedicated to the realization of her objectives through the United
Nations which, she thought, was to be used in the fullest measure. She also
thought that the United Nations was to be guarded from the efforts of the Great
Powers to abuse it and make a sterile instrument of power politics. It is
perhaps in terms of this dependence that one can better understand Indian
impatience the transcendent ideological rivalry of the Great Powers, which has
constantly threatened to engulf the United Nations. This was <span

India has been of the view that the great power harmony would make it more

primary objective. But for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
peace becomes an enlarged word taking on a different stature and connotation,
whereas the world feels at home with the elementary proposition that the road
to peace is through security. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
point of view is to secure security through peace. As Mr. Nehru has said,
“There are two approaches to this question of war and peace; one is the
approach of feeling that war is almost inevitable and, therefore, one must be
prepared for war. The other is that war must be avoided at almost any cost…..If
you lay more stress on war coming, you lose the battle for peace and war is
likely to come because your minds have succumbed to the prospects of war”. <sup>1</sup>

further remark of Mr. Nehru over the B. B. C. makes this approach clear: “Are
we so helpless that we cannot stop this drift towards catastrophe? What we need
is a passion for peace and civilized <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> in
international affairs. It is the temper of peace and not the temper of war that
we want….if we desire peace. We cannot seek peace in the language of war

peace depends upon the establishment of an active mode of peace and for the
dedication of our foreign policy to the pursuit of peace. There has emerged a
working formula. Do nothing that will constitute a further enlargement or

this climate of war. It is within this context that the Hungarian problem or

the vast range of affairs coming before the United Nations, many states have
made eloquent appeals on behalf of ‘Freedom, Dignity and the worth of the Human
Personality’. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has often presented itself primarily as a moral force in this regard. This has
contributed to the prestige of Indian foreign policy as embodying the
conscience of mankind. This has also led the Western powers to regard <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a
power haughtily superior to the corrupting influences of politics and the
sterile considerations of power. This explains our attitude towards the
Indonesian or <st1:City w:st="on">Suez</st1:City> problems in which <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> came to a
clash with the Western powers. One thing which is to be noted and which affects
the foreign policy of any country is the fact that there has to be a balance
between the moral judgments and political judgments which cannot be separated
or overlooked. As a general rule, any issue, the pursuit of which is reasoned
as likely to increase Great Power tension, is usually banned as an item for
Indian participation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>But, since 1954
and thereafter, India seems to have abandoned its familiar role as a
comparatively calm, dedicated but not partisan mediator of the Great Power
differences–a <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> that been dictated by its
conclusion that Western-Soviet differences represented relatively minor and
affordable stakes which could be overcome by time and diplomacy. Now a new
‘Strident Activism’ has emerged. This change in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s
attitude and <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> was caused by two factors: (<span
class=SpellE>i</span>) The piercing of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s cherished area of peace by
an American dominated alliance system; and (ii) Emergence of new terrors <span
class=SpellE>symbolised</span> by the rampant Great Power race to develop
thermo-nuclear weapons. That is why we find a new note of urgency in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s views
on disarmament demanding to be heard, not merely to submit written documents,

significant evolution in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
United Nations policy, emanating from her general policy, is the creation of a
Third Force through out the world. Third Force may be <span class=SpellE>abhorable</span>
to Mr. Nehru, in the United Nations. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> has tried hard to reconcile
its policies and attitudes with her Afro-Asian colleagues, and in the process
of this reconciliation sometimes the Indian policies are modified and
influenced by the consideration of this Third bloc in the United Nations. With
the shifting of emphasis from the Security Council to the General Assembly and
the gradual transformation of it as a forum of public conscience, this is bound
to play a very significant role in the future. Her voting is also influenced by
this consideration. In the Fifteenth Session of the General Assembly, the role
India played along with her Afro-Asian friends, though it could not succeed
because ultimately Mr. Nehru had to withdraw the resolution pressing the <span
class=SpellE>Eisenhover</span>-Khrushchev meeting, it is significant to note,
represented a new hope in the outlook of these States. With the increase in the
membership of the United Nations, the old balance of nations in the world body
has changed and under this new balance of nations, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s policy in the United
Nations has greater chances of success and consideration than ever before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few words about our limitations are also to be mentioned here. The general
criticism of Indian policy and role in the United Nations can be <span
class=SpellE>categorised</span>. Usually the criticism <span class=SpellE>centres</span>
round her attitude of neutralism. Critics of Neutralism at home and abroad are
not reconciled to the Neutralism between good and evil. But it has to be
mentioned that now this criticism has lost its sharpness and there is a better
understanding and appreciation for it both at home and abroad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
matter which has come up for criticism is our advocacy of China for its
legitimate seat in the United Nations, especially under the circumstances when
our relations with China are not too cordial and when China has proved herself
to be an aggressor against India. So this criticism has become more vigorous.
But the Indian attitude seems to be to maintain consistency and an attitude of
showing our approach conditioned by the legitimacy of the case even in the case
of a nation with which we happen to be engaged in dispute. The other reason may
be that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the United Nations can be made to behave because of pressure of other
nations and can be dealt with in a better way rather than if it is outside,
which makes it adopt <span class=GramE>a more rigid attitudes</span> in her
foreign policies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second attitude which has come up for a great deal of criticism is in regard to
disputes in which <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> was
herself involved, especially <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place>. No doubt
the Indian Government accepted plebiscite in Kashmir and later it departed from
its promise, but it has to be remembered that in international affairs, things
do not remain <span class=GramE>constant,</span> the very atmosphere which
prompted <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> to accept the
principle of plebiscite was in a context when <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
still thought a solution of the dispute with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> was possible. But <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
alignment with the Western bloc and her joining the military pacts had
completely changed the whole context of Indo-Pakistan problems. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s reaction was also logical in view of the
manner in which the <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> question was
formed into a cold war issue. As a matter of fact the Kashmir problem and the
way it was tackled by the United Nations was a rude shock to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and her
people, and undermined the people’s faith in the Organization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
criticism that may be made about <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s role in the Organization is
the performance of her representatives there. It is said that some of the
earlier representatives like the late Sri <span class=SpellE>Gopalaswami</span>
<span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> and others could not put the Indian point
clearly and that the Indian delegates were new to the job of diplomacy and
could not be expected to be clever in the art of negotiation and lobbying on
which the politics of United Nations is based. There is some truth in this. The
other and more vehement criticism is about the performance of<i> </i>her chief
delegate Mr. Krishna <span class=SpellE>Menon</span> who was said to be
creating more enemies and following a line which was softer to the Soviet bloc
and hostile to the Western powers. There is no doubt that Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Menon’s</span> performance in the United Nations may not be
regarded as perfectly justified on all occasions, but as regards the policy
pursued, it was the Government of India’s rather than his own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the balance sheet of our policy in the United Nations, some constructive
approaches are noteworthy. The role played by <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
in regard to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Korea</st1:country-region> or
Indo-China and more recently in the case of <st1:City w:st="on">Suez</st1:City>
and now in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Congo</st1:place></st1:country-region>,

the essence of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
performance in the United Nations Organization has rested with two <span

her general <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. The dictates of the climate of
war thesis and the particularizations it has pressed upon general subjects, in
terms of the United Nations. The uniqueness of the former has rested in what we
would probably describe as the bridge between the West and the Communist world.
However distrustful the Western powers are, such bridges particularly in the
light of their predilections with us or against us, give an important outlook
in foreign affairs. As for <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s
particularizations, one easily grasps the presence of a historic mission, for
ultimately there is only one constant particularization, the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>redress
of political, economic and social inequalities of Asia and <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>.

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Indian approach to foreign policy is likely to
be interpreted as an idealistic moralistic approach, in other words, one which
was not solely governed by the country’s national interests as such. But there
was, and is, never any question, in the minds of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s policy makers, of
consciously trying to operate on an idealistic or moral plane in world affairs.
Just like the statesmen of many other countries, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s leaders are also primarily
interested in promoting, directly or indirectly, their national interests, of
course, within the framework of the mutual interests of other nations as well
as the overall needs of a progressive world society. It so happens that many of
the policies and actions of the Indian Government and the aspirations of the Indian
people were in harmony with the needs of the world society and the general
moral values prevailing in the world at large. As Mr. Nehru has remarked “A
policy must be in keeping with the traditions, background and temper of the
country. It should be idealistic, aiming at certain objectives and at the same
time it should be idealistic. If it is not idealistic, it becomes sheer
Opportunism; if it is not realistic it is likely to be <span class=SpellE>adventurist</span>
and wholly ineffective.” He adds “<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s approach is dictated by
every consideration of intelligent self-interest”. *** Any success that the
Indian policy has in the World Organization and <span class=GramE>outside,</span>
is largely due to this happy blend of idealism and realism and the earnest
attempt to respect the ethical and moral values of human society. Naturally,
when <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s spokesmen
sometimes talked in idealistic and moral generalities, then one wholly
misunderstood them to be following a wholly moral and ethical policy to the
neglect of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
national interests. But a close scrutiny reveals that Indian policy was always,
and is, largely determined by her enlightened self-interest. <span
class=SpellE>Worner</span> Levi affirms this when he says: “Nehru was neither a
dreamer nor an idealist, but a calculating statesman…..They are based on <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s interest in a world of power politics as
seen from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>”.

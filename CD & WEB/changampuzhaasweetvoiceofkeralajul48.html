<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THAT
these high-strung poets should die young seems to be the inexorable law of
nature. And when Changampuzha Krishna Pillai, that inimitable bard of Kerala,
took to his bed a few months ago, his admirers whispered in agony, that here
was one more poet withering away in the prime of youth. He was only
thirty-five. But they would not speak it out, lest it should hurt him. But the
dear poet bade them farewell as they feared, and a gloom spread through the
length and breadth of Kerala.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Strange
as it may seem, this poet who spread such gloom in the evening of his life made
his debut by spreading no less gloom. His first antho1ogy–<i>Bashpanjali </i>(Garland
of Tears)–was a gospel of gloom. That work startled the public of Kerala
thirteen years ago as the bold attempt of a strange genius who was in the
depths of adversity. He wept profusely, he was almost feminine, but the ring of
sincerity in the work secured for it due recognition and many admirers. The
very announcement on the cover page of the work was a pitiable cry. He
complained that his failure in life was because he alone had fidelity in a
world of hypocrites. There he was outspoken, but outspoken to the limit of
foolishness. But he never flung it as a challenge on the face of the public, as
he had not then turned a rebel. The public, with its proverbial shallow memory,
failed to give succour to the poet even when it enjoyed his exquisite lyrics.
The lovers on their part learned those charming lines by heart, and perhaps
made proper use of them when they taunted their sweethearts. He was himself a
lover, too sensitive and, one may say, sensuous. I remember in one of his
earlier letter-papers he inscribed the famous lines of Shelley: “Love’s very
pain is sweet…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
period of adolescence, however, Soon passed and people no longer saw him with
his Shelleyan curls. He was growing into manhood. The external changes were
almost symbolic of the change in his inner personality. He realised the
futility of mourning and took a firm resolve to fight. Then occurred an event
of far-reaching significance. His bosom friend, another precocious poet who had
been hailed as one of the twin ‘Edappalli Poets’ (both came from the same
village) took his own life at the young age of twenty-seven. His grievances
were almost similar but more accentuated. This incident upset the poet. It was
Kerala’s loss in general, but to Changampuzha it was a personal calamity.
Luckily he soon recovered from the shock and collected his thoughts in
tranquility to write one of the greatest elegies in Malayalam: <i>Ramanan</i>.
That was even a greater event than the death of the poet itself. He gave the
elegy a new form, it was in the shape of a pastoral drama. Ramanan and Madanan
are two shepherds who were ‘virtually two bodies in one soul.’ Ramanan was meek
and handsome. And his rustic songs, which he rendered with profound charm as he
led the flock to the pastures green, attracted the attention of a wealthy maiden–Chandrika.
She fell for Ramanan but the aristocratic arrogance of her father would not
allow such friendships to grow. He gave his daughter in marriage to an equally
arrogant and affluent youth. The rest of the story has little novelty; it
culminates in the suicide of Ramanan. Quite a hackneyed theme, of course. But
the poem, since it symbolised the life of one of their beloved poets, and since
it came from another of their equally beloved poets, went straight to the
hearts of the people. Lines passed from lip to lip, and the work almost became
a testament of romantic love. There is hardly any youth in Kerala who has not
got a couplet from <i>Ramanan </i>at his tongue’s tip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was from the sale proceeds of <i>Ramanan </i>that Changampuzha pursued his
studies and steadily worked his way to the B.A. (Hons.) degree. While at
college, he published two of his mature collections, <i>Sankalpa Kanti </i>(Beauties
of Imagination) and <i>Raktapushpangal </i>(Crimson Flowers). In these he shows
a better grasp of the sorry scheme of things mundane, a greater balance, and a
loftier imagination. Some of these odes possess an irresistible charm; the one
on Kalidasa is a fine instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
two collections announced that Changampuzha was no longer a submissive fatalist
but an aggressive thinker, with a zest for revolution. He became aggressive
with a vengeance, and dealt steamhammer blows on the existing social
institutions. One thought, sometimes, that he was doing it with a callousness
bordering on insanity. It is evident that some of his revolutionary poems lack
the level-headedness of an intellectual. Often he declared that he had no
morals to preach. He flung his anarchistic ideals with a take-it-if-you-want
attitude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
sympathies were definitely with the downtrodden. His <i>Vazhakkula</i>, which became
popular in an instant due to its anti-capitalistic ring, showed that he could
sternly raise his fist against the exploiters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
with all his progressive vehemence, his steps were shaky when it came to a
question of personal sorrows. He could never conquer passion. Passion always
conquered him, nay overwhelmed him. The two works next in importance to the
above, <i>Onakkazhcha </i>(Onam Offerings)<sup>1</sup> and <i>Spandikkunna
Asthimadom </i>(Throbbing Sepulchre), are full of gloom and despair. Though he
was married and comfortably settled in life, love came to him from another
direction and tore his heart to pieces. He was too weak to resist passion.
Critics, as usual, found fault with his unnerving pessimism and rebuked him.
With a scornful smile on his face, he looked at them and asked them in a
defiant tone: “Should I laugh an empty laugh to please your blinking selves
when I have got a thousand things to weep over? Should I laugh because laughing
is the sign of health? Oh, my dear fellows, if I cry, it is because I have got
to do it. You please don’t worry about me and my tears.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Critics
gave him up as incorrigible, muttering ‘hopeless,’ and Changampuzha continued
in the same strain. Latterly, however, he was tossed between the call of pure
poetry and didacticism. But, till the end, the lightning spirit never waned,
and it found joy in the limitless regions of unadulterated fancy. The last poem
which he wrote was a vision of pure poetry dancing to the tune of his heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
adore Changampuzha, the poet. He was a rare phenomenon. But let us also learn a
lesson from Changampuzha, the man, His was a tempestuous life. Extremely
sensitive to environment, a sense of frustration always tormented him. And
success, when it came, drove him mad. Pure peace in this life was not to be
his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless,
he was a miracle in the realm of Malayalam literature. He came and vanished
with the speed and brilliance of a meteor. Endowed with a diction that was the
dream of our mighty minstrels, this poet, when he opened his lips, sent a
thrill through the hearts of Kerala’s thousands. When others strained to
produce a single note of merit, he sang a hundred tunes with angelic ease and
splendour. No other real poet has reached the commoner with such speed and
ability. It was because he was direct and simple. Though he read and digested
much, he never had the mere intellectual’s bent. His was the magic wand that
set stones to music. He wept through art, and made weeping a fine art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

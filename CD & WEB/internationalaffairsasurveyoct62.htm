<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Conference held in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> from the 8th to 19th September
naturally attracted the largest amount of attention of the public. It is
necessary that we should have a right perspective in estimating the
significance of the discussions at the conference, in so far as they related to
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
entry into the European Common Market. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
entry is the logical outcome of a historical process that has been going on in <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> for a long time. Attempts at the unification of
Western and <st1:place w:st="on">Central Europe</st1:place> have been made on
several occasions in the past. The efforts of the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons
and of <span class=SpellE>Napolean</span> and Hitler have all been of this
character. But they have not achieved permanent success. Culturally <st1:place
w:st="on">Western Europe</st1:place> is really one. It is the <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
which values individual freedom and the spirit of democracy. But it has also
been the area where, in modern times, nationalism and national rivalries
exercised a dominant influence. As a result of the tragic experience gained in
the two world wars and the establishment of Communism in Russia, the West
Europeans as well as the West Germans have come to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the inadequacies of nationalism in the new world set-up. There has consequently
arisen a strong movement for bringing about the economic and political
unification of Western and <st1:place w:st="on">Central Europe</st1:place>. It
is this that has given birth to the <st1:place w:st="on">European Economic
 Community</st1:place>, which is only a prelude to the formation of a United
States of Europe in the years to come. The age of nationalism is over so far as
<st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> is concerned. The national State is
to-day too small a unit for either political or economic purposes. No nation is
able to defend itself unless it enters into military alliance with several
other States. And, for purposes of trade, a nation needs an ever-expanding
market. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was by means of temporary alliances that in the past the European nations tried
to defend themselves against a common aggressor. They did so against Louis XIV,
against Napoleon, against Kaiser William II and against Hitler. Such temporary
alliances were adequate to meet the dangers in the past as the dangers
themselves were temporary. But the case is different to-day. The danger to the
liberties of the nations of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> comes from
the U. S. S. R., and this is a permanent danger. It can only be met by a
permanent <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place> among the States on this side
of the iron curtain. The N. A. T. O. was the first step in that direction. But
far-seeing statesmen have come to the conclusion that the European unity should
be built on firmer foundations and that all the free nations in the continent
should be integrated into a single economic and political community. The fact
that <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> forgot
their centuries of<i> </i>rivalry and are actively promoting the cause of West
European political union can only be understood in the light of these new
historical developments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is also another factor which has strengthened this desire for political and
economic unity. Though the West European nations welcome the alliance with the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
they also feel that, so long as they deal with that country as separate States,
the alliance is bound to be unequal. For four centuries in the modern age <st1:place
w:st="on">Western Europe</st1:place> played the leading part in international
affairs. That old position is gone and its place has been taken by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the U. S. S. R. But the West European States do not want to become the
satellites of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, however serious might be the danger
from Soviet Russia. And the only way in which they can escape from the
satellite position, is by forming themselves into a United States of Europe,
which will be, with its large population and rich industrial resources, the
equal in several respects of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States of America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>’s entry into
the <st1:place w:st="on">European Economic Community</st1:place> can be best
understood only in the light of this West European movement for economic and
political unity. Here again a reference has to be made to the past role of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> in the affairs of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>.
She generally followed an insular policy. She built her Empire outside <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> and extended her trade, into other continents. So
far as <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> was concerned, she tried to
maintain a balance of power among the various States, so that no one State
might dominate over the whole continent. Whenever the balance was upset–and
only when the balance was upset–did she intervene in European <span
class=GramE>affairs.</span> She became a leading member of every grand alliance
directed ‘against the aggressive and expanding <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">European</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on"><span class=GramE>State</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span
class=GramE>,</span> and she withdrew when the danger disappeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the present day it is not in her interests to keep herself aloof from the
affairs of continental <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. She has lost
her empire. Though there is the Commonwealth with the countries of which she
carries an extensive trade, she has also close commercial connections with the
richer markets of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. Her influence in
European affairs will become less if she keeps aloof from an integrated <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. The leadership will pass into the hands of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">France</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">West Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Very few among the <span
class=SpellE>Britishers</span>–whatever be the party to which they belong–can
reconcile themselves to the idea of their country which occupied an imperial
position in the past, losing now and in the future all influence in directing
the affairs of Europe. Moreover the danger of the U. S. S. R. dominating the
whole of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> is not a temporary one, and no
temporary alliance can prevent it. The forces that have driven the national
States of Europe towards greater integration among <span class=GramE>themselves,</span>
are also the forces that are driving <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
into the <st1:place w:st="on">European Economic Community</st1:place> and the
European Political Union which is soon to follow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is considerations like these that have influenced the British Conservative
Party and Prime Minister Macmillan in their determination to join the E. C. M.
The only alternative to this is for <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
to lose all her influence in the politics of Europe and become a lone satellite
of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
we should also understand that her entry into the E. C. M. is bound to bring a
large amount of loss to almost all the members of the Commonwealth who have
been receiving preferential treatment in the matter of their exports to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for
nearly a generation. As a member of the E. C. M. she will not be in a position
to admit Commonwealth commodities on preferential terms into her market, which
will become a part of the European Market. She will have to abide by the rules
and regulations of the Common Market. Naturally the Prime Ministers of almost
all the Commonwealth countries opposed her entry into the E. C. M. But they
have also <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that, in spite of their
opposition, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
might not have any choice except to enter the Common Market. The utmost they
could do was to call on <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to press upon the six constituent members of the Market the need for continuing
the preferences to Commonwealth commodities until they enter into permanent
agreements with the E. C. M. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no doubt whatever that, with the ending of the preferences, the Commonwealth
countries will have to face a severe economic crisis. They will not have the
same markets for their commodities as they now have. Even if markets for
agricultural commodities, like tea and jute, may not become narrowed, those for
manufactured goods, like cotton textiles, are sure to become narrower. There is
a widespread impression among the European countries that in India, Pakistan
and other Asian States <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> are not paid
adequate wages and that this is the main reason why they are able to produce
their manufactures cheaper than the European factories. This is, however, a
misconception, as <span class=SpellE>labour</span> productivity is low in Asian
countries. Any reduction in the volume of exports will intensify the acuteness
of the foreign exchange problem in these developing countries and will retard
the execution of the Five-Year Plans. All these points have been brought to the
notice of the British representatives at the conference and, although at
present there is not much hope of the European six granting further
concessions, they will soon see the folly of retarding the economic progress of
the developing countries, and set things right. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
presence of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the Common Market will do much to safeguard the interests of the
Commonwealth. Political considerations are also bound to have their weight on
the deliberations of the Common Market countries. They cannot afford to neglect
completely the interests of countries like <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
whose goodwill and friendship will be a great asset to them in their conduct of
world affairs. Even to-day they are extending a great deal of economic aid to
these countries, and they are sure to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> that,
as Pandit Nehru and others put it, more important than economic aid is the
provision of trading facilities. One, therefore, need not take a highly
pessimistic view of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
entry into the E. C. M. In the present-day world her presence in it will be
more conducive to world peace and to the maintenance of the interests of the
Commonwealth than her keeping away from it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Will
her entry into the E. C. M. break up the Commonwealth? It doesn’t look like
that. It is not because of the possibility of securing special economic
advantages that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and other countries have chosen to become members of the Commonwealth. The
value of the membership lies in giving opportunity for the Prime Ministers to
exchange views on matters of world importance in an atmosphere of complete
freedom and influencing each other’s policies. It is on a powerful sentiment
that the Commonwealth rests, and there is no reason why with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s entry
this sentiment should become weak. <span class=GramE>As Pandit Nehru put it in
his Press conference in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>:
“The Commonwealth’s real value lies in its extreme flexibility.</span> This
enabled people from the four corners of the world to gather together in a
friendly way and discuss matters frankly and yet be able to come to some broad
general conclusions. I think that this new type of association is far better
than an association which limits each country. That is why the Commonwealth has
succeeded in spite of differing opinions.” He also expressed the view that the
Commonwealth Conference and its deliberations have not in any way weakened the
Commonwealth. This, on the whole, is the correct view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City> talks on
disarmament have not made any progress. When the Conference went into recess on
<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>september</span></span> 7, the Soviet
delegate told the other delegates: “We are no closer to an agreement on general
and complete disarmament than on the day (five months ago) when the
negotiations started.” The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> delegate expressed more or less the
same view: “There was agreement that there must be disarmament, but we are not

the talks on the Test Ban have ended in a deadlock. A committee of scientists

appointed by the United Nations, recently reported that continued nuclear
testing could seriously harm mankind for thousands of years to come. All the
same, both the nuclear powers are determined on continuing the tests. It only
shows their callousness. The whole world is woefully unable to bring pressure upon
them to change their attitude. The Western powers have proposed a limited
treaty for outlawing all tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under
water, without insisting on “on-the-spot inspection” on which they were
hitherto very keen. It is only in regard to underground tests that they want to
have inspection. The Soviets have not agreed even to this limited treaty. They
fight shy of inspection as they fear that it would lead to spying. A way out of
the difficulty has been suggested by eight of the delegates of the non-aligned
countries, and it is hoped that, when the conference meets again; their
suggestions will receive consideration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Congress expressed its determination “to prevent, by whatever means may be

President Kennedy has undertaken a scheme of extensive economic aid which would

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thanks
to the revival in recent times of genuine critical interest in Victorian
Poetry, which was under a cloud for some decades, Matthew Arnold's Poetry has
begun to attract considerable sophisticated critical attention. His is in some
respects the most readily appealing Victorian poetic voice, although it is not
certainly the strongest. Although his ‘Scholar-Gipsy’, with which this paper is
concerned, luckily has never lacked admiring readers, it is only of late that
it has been close-read by many with particular attention to its theme, image,
and structural integrity, and its relevance to the present-day reader.<sup>1</sup>
The poem is about a certain spiritual crisis, a crisis of faith, experienced by<i>
</i>Matthew Arnold and many other sensitive minds of the Victorian period. One
of the major causes for the crisis was the retreat of traditional religious
faith and belief, resulting in a dizzy feeling of uncertainty and fluctuation
regarding the meaning and significance of life, a stifling sense of living in a
spiritual vacuum, of loneliness and nostalgia. This, in fact, was a constant
preoccupation of Arnold, and in poem after poem, the most famous being “Dover
Beach”, he returned to the theme of the “withdrawing roar” of the “Sea of
Faith”. If in “Dover Beach” he is concerned mainly with his personal and
subjective experience of the crisis, in “The Scholar-Gipsy”, it may be said, he
is preoccupied with his experience as well as that of his generation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
write poetry in the context of his times, Arnold felt, was not easy. As one who
not only set a very high value on poetry, (Later in life he was to assert that
poetry would increasingly take the place of religion), but also who believed that
poetry was his true vocation, he felt that the times were “unpoetical,” that
is, unpropitious for the writing of poetry. This feeling was shared by other
important poets of the age also. For, not only the material to be turned into
poetry was found to be intractable but the poet himself had to function and
find his destiny in an alien and disintegrating environment, which inevitably
made poetic exploration and communication extremely difficult, if not
altogether impossible. In the absence of a community of belief and of a
unifying reference for the religious, cultural and social life of man, the poet
was driven to be a lonely artist functioning in isolation, and to address
himself to a society for which poetry did not seem to matter. Further, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Arnold
realised that his poetry, to be true to his sensibility, had to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be
different from that of the great Romantic predecessors, in spite of his
admiration for them, especially for Wordsworth and Keats. Sceptical as he was,
he could not share the confident faith of the Romantic poets in imagination and
intuition. Instead, while conserving jealously his own moderate poetic ardour,
he had to hold fast to his own rudder as poet, and devise for his poems
appropriate poetic strategies, sometimes drawn from the Romantic and Classical
traditions alike. These factors largely explain the form and structure of “The
Scholar-Gipsy.” which seems an amalgam of different poetic modes. Though
classified by Arnold himself as an elegy–and Arnold’s temper was always at home
in the elegiac–the poem has for its components landscape description,
narration, romantic dream vision in a pastoral landscape, elegiac argument, and
finally epic simile. This fact has to be borne in mind while examining the
different parts of the poem and the different functions they are made to serve.
Arnold exhibits considerable skill in structuring </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>them
into a unified poem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
Scholar-Gipsy” develops along a sort of dialectical pattern. Broadly speaking,
it juxtaposes two diametrically opposed worlds, the idyllic world of the
Scholar-Gipsy and the sick and inert world of the poet-speaker. The tension of
the poem springs from this juxtaposition. The poem falls into recognisable
sections and grows by discernible stages. The opening section of three stanzas
presents a mellow rural scene of quiet and restful peace near Oxford, as viewed
by the poet from a vantage point, from “this nook over the high, half-reaped
field.” At the end of the description, he settles down to<i> </i>read “the
oft-read tale” of the Gipsy-Scholar from Glanvil’s book. Andrew Farmer finds
this opening description “confusing and indirect” and thinks that it “does not
seem...to serve any special purpose although it is effective in itself”. But,
in fact, it is intended to serve, and it does serve, a specific though limited
function; namely, it serves as a symbolic back-drop for the rest of<i> </i>the
poem. Arnold uses such landscapes in many of his other poems for a similar
purpose. Next, the very details of the landscape–the “high field’s dark
corner”, “the bleating of the folded flocks” borne “from uplands far away”, the
“distant cries of reapers” etc., and the inter-play of light and shade in the
landscape–all these together with the slow elegiac movement of the verse create
a sense of restful calm and quiet relaxation, of disengagement and withdrawal
from the world of brisk activity and from all that might distract one’s
attention, and induce in the poet and the reader alike the mood appropriate to
the elegiac meditation that is to follow very shortly in the poem. Even the
apparent ambiguity regarding the time in the description, whether it is
afternoon or evening the poet here refers to, contributes to this mood. Further
the sense of imaginative withdrawal and disengagement from the immediate and
actual, even as it helps the poet-speaker to distance himself from his own
pressing and disturbing emotions, it also enables him and the reader to follow
on “viewless wings of poesy” the wandering Scholar-Gipsy. The question
regarding the identity of the shepherd addressed in the first line of the poem,
whether it is clough or someone else, seems irrelevant. For, addressing a
fellow shepherd is a part of the pastoral convention, which Arnold adopts here.
This shepherd is asked to go back to his bleating flock for the present, and
pursue his “quest” some other time, for two obvious reasons. Firstly, the poet
wants to be left alone so that undisturbed he can “read the oft-read tale” of
the Oxford Scholar and meditate on it. Secondly, he wants to introduce into the
poem the theme of quest. The quest is for a spiritual order or pattern, for an
integrated ideal, for something that would make life meaningful and purposeful.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next section of the poem begins with a verse paraphrase of Glanvil’s account of
the Scholar-Gipsy. The poem’s indebtedness to Glanvil’s version is only
nominal. For Arnold it is only a devise to initiate his elegiac meditation on
the contemporary spiritual crisis, which is the real argument of the poem.
While he seems merely to retell here in verse Clanvil’s prose account, he
introduces some significant changes into it. Arnold makes his Scholar a person
“of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain.” While he is allowed to retain
his interest in magical powers, he has to wait for “heaven-sent moments” to acquire
the gipsy art. Then, unlike Glanvil’s Scholar, who is accepted as one of the
gipsy crew, Arnold’s Scholar is very much a solitary, isolated from his fellow
human beings including the gipsies even from the start, and he is seen only “by
rare glimpses pensive and tongue-tied”, his gipsy dress only emphasising his
isolation. As the poem develops the image of the Scholar undergoes further and </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>important
changes, so that he becomes a wholly new creation. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
Arnold does is to adopt and recreate Glanvil’s Scholar-Gipsy myth to suit his
aesthetic and ethical needs. Therefore our understanding of the poem’s meaning
depends mainly upon our grasp of Arnold’s fashioning of this myth, and his
attitude to his creation, “The Scholar-Gipsy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Taking
a very slender hint from Glanvil’s story, Arnold next makes his Scholar wander
in the neighbourhood of Oxford, and follows him in a dream vision (which at
once recall. Keats following the Nightingale in his “Nightingale Ode”) through
all the seasons of the year. In his lone wanderings, David L. Eggenschwiler
observes, the Scholar “is seen usually by maidens, shepherds, children, or
mowers and his typical actions–trailing his fingers in a cool stream or
listening to nightingales–are more appropriate to a pastoral character than to
Glanvil’s Scholar...” What Arnold is attempting to do here is to fuse together,
as a part of his poetic strategy, the arcadian world of classical pastoral
poetry and the romantic dream vision. The idyllic countryside through which the
Scholar wanders and quests is very vividly and feelingly described. As a
participant in his own willed dream the poet follows eagerly every movement of
the shy and elusive scholar. His eagerness in following the Scholar suggests
that he not only feels a strong sense of kinship with him but even tends to
identify himself with him. What impells him to do so is made clear in the
immediately following sections of the poem. However, even before the poet is
able to establish such an identity the dream vision snaps, and he is tolled
back to the realisation that it is after all a day-dream deliberately indulged
in, and that the Scholar-Gipsy as a mortal must have died long ago and been
buried in an obscure grave. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The description of the pastoral landscape in the
dream vision is universally and justly appreciated for its charm, its visual
accuracy and fidelity to nature. Admiration of this section, almost to the
exclusion of the rest of the poem, has been for long the stock response to the
poem. Arnold’s idiom succeeds admirably in capturing and recreating
authentically the unique beauty and feel of the countryside in the
neigbbourhood of Oxford, which he knew intimately and loved. There is a view of
the poem, based obviously on this section, that Arnold indulges here his nostalgic
longings for his undergraduate days at Oxford, and that the poem offers only “a
very delightful pastoral week-end.” This criticism implies that this section
stands apart from the rest of the poem and is not integral to the poem’s total
meaning. Arnold himself seems to lend support to such a view. For in a letter
to his brother Tom in 1857 he says that the poem was “meant to fix the
remembrance” of their “delightful wanderings” around Oxford “before they were
quite effaced.” But, in truth, there is in the dream vision much more than mere
nostalgia and indulgence in nature description. It presents one wing of the
poem’s dialectic. Arnold presents here an idyllic world of innocence,
simplicity, health and quiet, which is the extreme opposite of the oppressive
world of actuality presented in the immediately following section, and thus
establishes the poem’s dialectic. Even if one is tempted to view Arnold’s
description of the pastoral world by itself, it cannot be imputed that Arnold
is indulging in escapism. Because, as David L. Eggenschwiler points out,
according to the established conventions of pastoral poetry, adopted partly in
this poem, sequestered idyllic life represents not certainly a world of escape
but ‘a continuingly valid ideal’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the poet says in stanza 14 (which marks a transition) after the dream vision,
that the Scholar-Gipsy must have gone the way of all flesh, it seems as though
he is repudiating the dream vision, its protagonist and its substance. It is on
a similar note that Keat’s “Nightingale Ode.” closes. But in Arnold’s poem,
whose objective is different, the Scholar, after a fleeting return to
mortality, is resurrected and given not just a new lease of life but
immortality. This is done by recreating him on a different plane, without
rejecting the essence of the dream vision. In this new phase of the
Scholar-Gipsy’s career, some new traits are introduced into his personality
without any loss<i> </i>to his essential pastoral character already
established. The shy, wandering Scholar is now viewed at close quarters by the
poet. From now on he is seen in complete contrast to the men of the “modern”
world. As a representative of his times and spokesman for his society, the poet
presents an </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>elaborate account of their predicament. He sees
his society as spiritually sick and debilitated, his contemporaries and himself
as benumbed and paralysed creatures, incapable of any decision or action or
even strong feelings, yet fluctuating “idly without term or scope”, and feebly
striving not knowing “for what”. In total contrast the Scholar-Gipsy and his
world appear healthy and vigorous. Unlike the vacillating Victorians, who in
spite of their anxiety to believe in something are only “light half-believers”
of “casual creeds,” the Scholar is now seen to have “<i>one </i>aim, <i>one </i>business,
<i>one </i>desire”<i> </i>and “unconquerable hope” which is the reason for his
“immortal lot.” He is now endowed with “unclouded joy” and “glad perennial
youth.” Whereas in the dream vision he appears very much of a passive quester,
patiently awaiting the “spark from heaven” to fall, now he becomes an active
seeker, and a symbol of spiritual health and activity, not affected by place
and time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
this stage in his meditation it becomes poignantly clear to the poet that his
desire to become the Scholar-Gipsy and his efforts in that direction are of no
avail. For such single-eyed devotion and steadfastness of purpose as possessed
by the Scholar seems well-nigh impossible of achievement in the poet’s milieu.
As his contemplation of the Scholar sharpens his awareness of the predicament
of his own times, it also drives home to him that he and the Scholar have to
part ways lest “this strange disease of modern life” should incurably infect
the Gipsy-Scholar too. This two-fold awareness makes him appeal to the Scholar
to flee all contact from men like him. Commenting on this situation in the
poem, A. E. Dyson says:.....Arnold never commits himself’ to the
gipsy…..but…..he is aware of him all the time as the embodiment of an
illusion.” His argument implies that in asking the Scholar to flee, Arnold in
effect rejects him, But, in his attempt to impose a Positivist interpretation
on the poem Dyson disregards totally the evolution of the image of the
Scholar-Gipsy in the poem, how from a quasi-legendary figure he grows into an
enduring and valid symbol of necessary qualities, which are difficult of
achievement in modern times and therefore all the more desirable. Had Arnold
really regarded the Scholar as the “embodiment of an illusion,” he would not
certainly have used the same symbolic figure in his later poem “Thyrsis,” which
begins where “The Scholar-Gipsy” ends. It is to be noticed that the Scholar and
the poet remain distinct from each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
section, which presents the poet’s encounter with his own times, is far from
satisfactory as poetry. In his searching analysis of<i> </i>the poem, A. Dwight
Culler draws attention to the “remarkable alteration in the language” of this
section, to the fact that it is starkly, almost bleakly, abstract” in contrast
to the “beautifully imaginative” language or the pastoral section of the poem.
Conceding that “poetically it is a debasement”, he still rather strangely
maintains that one ought not to expect “poetic language” and “lush imagery of
nature” from an account of life which is itself colourless and sick, arid and
barren. That Arnold cannot indulge his fancy here and that an appropriate
change or idiom is necessary consistent with the dialectic of the poem should
be readily obvious. But the relevant question here is not whether the language
used is “poetic” or not, but whether it is adequate to Arnold’s poetic purpose,
that is, to present a convincing picture of his society in terms of appropriate
image and metaphor and to enable the reader to get a feel of its complex spiritual
condition so that he can share the poet’s sense of urgency, anguish and
helplessness regarding it. Even though Arnold does employ images of ill-health
and disease in this long section, and some of the memorable phrases of the poem
such as “this strange disease of modern life” and “light half-believers or
casual creeds” come from it, he seems unequal to his task. To appreciate the
point made here, one may contrast this section with the relevant portions of <i>The
Waste Land </i>of T. S. Eliot, which also explores a similar territory of
experience as Arnold’s poem does. By juxtaposing the contrasted </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>worlds,
the Scholar’s and his own, Arnold seems to have hoped that the reader would
make the best of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
the long-tailed simile with which the poem concludes, an altogether new element
is introduced into the poem. However, as the earlier lines on Dido (St. 21)
anticipate this long passage or classical allusion and myth, the reader is not
altogether taken by surprise. It is not only one of the most sustained of epic
similes ever attempted by Arnold, but it is one of the most poetic passages in
the entire range of his poetry. His creative powers, which seemed to flag and
falter in the preceding section, now are energetically restored. As he conjures
up in the simile a panoramic view of the ancient world, there is a triumphant
return to the earlier sensuously rich and expressive idiom. Yet<i> </i>this
simile has remained the most controversial part of the poem. A good deal of
scholarly ingenuity has gone into its explication, It raises many questions
regarding its meaning and significance, and its relation to the rest of the
poem. The surface meaning of the simile, however, is clear. The Scholar-Gipsy
is asked to flee al the “Tyrian trader” did as soon as he espied the new “masters
of the waves” intruding “on his ancient home.” The similarity between the
Scholar and the Tyrian is at once apparent. But it is equally apparent that
there is only a contrast between the confident, energetic, and enterprising
young Greeks who master the seas and the “timorous” and “unfixed” Victorians “who
hesitate and falter life away.” It will not help to see an analogy between the young
Greeks and the “smock-frocked boors” from whom the Scholar flees (St. 6). For
it also implies a parallel between the “boors” and the sick and fatigued
Victorians. There seems to be nothing in the poem to establish a one-to-one
correspondence with all the details of this long-tailed simile. Further, like
all such similes, this one too develops into an elaborate and autonomous world-picture
which has to be contemplated initially for its own sake before its meaning and
function in the poem can be thought of. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>According to Andrew Farmer, the
simile merely repeats “the feelings of the first section in different terms:
something ‘fresh’ to set against the ‘strange disease of modern life.’ Arnold, it
is contended, allows himself the “indulgence” of an elaborate picture; but as
it yields “good poetry” one hardly regrets it. However, Wilson Knight and
Dwight Culler, among others, see in the simile a resolution of the tension
generated earlier in the poem. They also find that Arnold here suggests a cure
for the contemporary malaise. For Wilson Knight, the Tyrian trader symbolizes
“oriental powers,” and such “qualities” are to be found in the Scholar-Gipsy
himself. The critic sees the poem’s total meaning as striving “towards a fusion
of the two traditions, Western and Eastern.” Dwight Culler”s exegesis of the
simile is rather elaborate, and one can only refer to some of his conclusions
here. He finds rich allusiveness in the passage, and discovers in it the
transmission of the traditional spiritual wisdom of the East to the spiritually
sick West. For him Dido’s conflict with Aeneas, alluded to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>earlier
in the poem, “represents the heroic conflict between East and West, of which
the Scholar-Gipsy’s conflict with the world </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is a modern variant.”
Pointing out that Arnold was interested in the role of the Phoenician “as a
transmitter of ancient culture,” he maintains that Arnold “makes this point in
terms of this smile.” Finally he assents that, contrary to the complaint in some
quarters, Arnold’s hero does impart his knowledge to the world and “this is
what is meant by the last line of the poem.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Fascinating as all this is, it is
pertinent to ask: whether all this really emerges poetically from the poetic
context? Whether this complex meaning is really made actual to the reader? Does
not the critic seem to read into the passage a meaning he would like to find in
it? Is not such intricate allusiveness rather foreign to Arnold’s poetic
practice? Judging by the poem as it is, it is very much doubtful whether Arnold
ever suggests in it a way out of the spiritual crisis and thereby resolve the
tension. For, the Scholar-Gipsy holds his attention, ultimately because he has <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>“<i>one </i></span>aim, <i>one </i>business,
<i>one </i>desire”, perennial youth and gladness, and not because he finds any
“knowledge”, although <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it<i> </i></span>is
very much time that he is sent on a “quest” for it. It is to be noted that
Arnold is not able to be more specific than saying vaguely that the Scholar is
waiting for the “heaven-sent” moment to catch “the spark from heaven.” Unable
to find a tangible goal for the quest, his own as well as that of the
Scholar–for nothing seems to be in sight–Arnold has to be content with finding
the right temper and frame of mind to endure and live through the present
difficulty and uncertainty. In other words, having set out to find an
epistemological solution, the poet is able to find, in the context of the poem,
only a psychological and moral solution. The pastoral machinery, as he uses it
in the poem, enables him to suggest the validity of such a solution. To find,
therefore, a place for the <i>Bhagavad Gita </i>in the concluding simile, as
Dwight Culler seems to do, is rather farfetched. This is not to deny at all
Arnold’s enthusiasm for this Indian philosophical classic, or his respect for
oriental wisdom. He was so deeply impressed by the <i>Gita </i>that he even
chose to recommend <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it<i> </i></span>to
his friend Clough, who too was a troubled soul like him. One imagines that it could
have certainly shown a possible way out of the Victorian spiritual crisis.
Probably the spirit of simultaneous involvement and detachment in all actions
that the <i>Gita </i>emphasizes, specially appealed to Arnold. But
nevertheless, there <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is<i> </i></span>little
warrant in “The Scholar-Gipsy” to induct the <i>Gita </i>into it. Very little
of the robust spirit of the <i>Gita </i>gets assimilated into Arnold’s poem
which is closer to the stoical. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

poem, then, does neither resolve tension created by the earlier sections, nor
suggest a cure or “knowledge” or an integrated ideal even obliquely, as
maintained in this paper, what then is its function, its justification in the
poem? How does it fit into the imaginative scheme of the poem? At the end of
his “criticism” of the contemporary crisis, the poet realises that there is no
cure for it except a moral and psychological one for the present. His frantic
appeal to the Scholar to flee amply shows how desperate his situation is. Had
the poem been closed at this point, it would have been abrupt, and marred the
poem’s construction, its structural integrity. Because it would have only a
beginning and a middle, but no end. Therefore to give the poem an end, a formal
close, so that it becomes an aesthetically satisfying whole, and to induce in
himself and the reader a measure of calm of mind after so much of turbulence,
the poet introduces this deliberately elaborate simile. (To appreciate its
specific function one may contrast it with the much shorter simile with which “Dover
Beach” concludes.) By pressing into service all his artistic resources and by
an effort of his creative imagination Arnold conjures up a lovely and
compelling picture of the world of classical antiquity, richly suggestive in
its visual details, into which he transports himself and the reader. Since the
situation in the simile has at its heart a conflict and a quest, it does not
take away the reader’s attention from the central issues of the poem. There is
also the consolation of hope implied, since the Tyrian in the simile reaches at
long last the Iberian coast. By a deliberate change of mood, then, the tension
of the poem is only <i>temporarily </i>resolved. And the poem ends on a note of
objective calm. There is a certain obvious functional similarity between the
opening and concluding sections of the poem, with this difference that the
opening stanzas induce a mood of subjective withdrawal necessary for the poet’s
meditation, while the concluding passage induces in him a mood of objective
calm and thus enables him to pull himself away from the brink of suicidal
despair. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

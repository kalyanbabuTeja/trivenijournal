president of the Association, <span class=SpellE>Murugesa</span> <span

was fond of such functions. Himself a good speaker, he never missed
opportunities for displaying his talents. Moreover such ceremonial occasions as
entailed presentation of souvenirs and addresses of felicitations were near his
heart. He always drew willing audiences to his harangues, which generally
contained sallies of wit and pun, so much enjoyed by the crowds. There were
some among his hearers </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

particularly looking forward to such an opportunity to make known to the public
of the unostentatious services of <span class=SpellE>Sivaprakasa</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mudaliar</span> to the community and country. The man, he felt,
was hiding his light under a bushel. His merits needed <span class=GramE>broadcasting</span>
by all means. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

secretary of the Association, <span class=SpellE>Kuppuswami</span>, was driven
mad by the chairman in carrying out his behests for the forthcoming function.
Every minute he was reminded of all the details to be attended to; nothing,
according to him, should be left wanting at the nick of time and people made to
remark about the shortcomings of the day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

you placed orders for the lace garland? Why do you look blank? Have I not
warned you of your forgetfulness about such details? I told you that a lace
garland should be offered while the chief guest is, at the entrance, received;
and that the rose garland can be afterwards used when actually he takes his
seat on the dais. Well, well; evidently you have been sleeping over all these
injunctions of mine.” Poor <span class=SpellE>Kuppuswami</span>! <span
class=GramE>he</span> was spared no moment of peace as the day of the function
drew near. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Frankly,
<span class=SpellE>Kuppuswami</span> did not share the enthusiasm of the
chairman in the matter. He had his own misgivings regarding <span class=SpellE>Sivaprakasa</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mudaliar’s</span> <span class=SpellE>acquiesence</span> in
the preparations. For he was aware of <span class=SpellE>Mudaliar’s</span>
aversion to any fuss regarding personal affairs of his. Further, he would not
approve of any expense of public money in functions of the kind arranged. Above
all, the fact that <span class=SpellE>Mudaliar</span> had no previous inkling
of the way the whole thing was getting done might disgust him and drive him to
cancel everything, causing unnecessary wastage of both energy and funds.
Therefore was <span class=SpellE>Kuppuswami</span> a bit lukewarm in his
allotted duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there was another side to the picture. <span class=SpellE>Sivaprakasam’s</span>
wife, <span class=SpellE>Devasena</span>, was already made aware of the
approaching event through some source. She became really proud of it and sought
to find out how her husband would take it. She was also a bit doubtful of her
husband’s agreement to any showy function of the kind intended. So she began
sounding him cautiously: “Are we having any religious ceremonies in the house?
If there is any idea of entertaining a few guests, we may have to plan
everything in time, lest a last minute attempt to get things done should land
us in difficulties. You know, my dear, everything is not only costly now-a-days
but also very difficult to get. Unless we are in advance able to secure things,
we may not at all be sure of having satisfaction in what we do.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“What
is the function you are contemplating, may I know<span class=GramE>?...</span>You
said of religious ceremonies. May I know for what<span class=GramE>?…</span>.My
birthday! Who told you of ceremonies in connection with my birthday? What is
there special about one’s birthday? <span class=GramE>When everything is going
up, natural for one’s age also to go up.</span> Let it go up as it pleases.
None need stop it. <span class=GramE>should</span> we worry for what cannot be
helped.” His tone betrayed his sarcastic approach of the whole thing. There was
also lurking underneath his remark a strong resolve not to yield to any
sentimental reason for going on with the celebrations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

silenced by his contempt or caustic remarks. She started again: “So, you think
you should make yourself the laughing-stock of people. Everyone here will deem
you stingy and unsocial of <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. It is silly
that anyone could be objecting to the observance of the sixty-first birthday–an
event which is sure not to happen again in one’s life!” She stood before him,
holding her chin in the cup of her right hand, expressing real amazement at his
total want of common-sense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

should it matter to you what I feel about it so long as you are sure of going
in for a fine <span class=SpellE>saree</span> for the occasion! You can have
one for the <span class=SpellE>Deepavali</span>, my dear. Do not try to create
an occasion earlier for it. Do you follow me?” Saying this, <span class=SpellE>Sivaprakasa</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mudaliar</span> wanted to appease her by change of his<i> </i>tone
and persuasive arguments. He assumed a softer voice and added: “Don’t you <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> the times we are passing through are hard? None
should spend any more than absolutely necessary. Food and raiment are getting
scarcer everywhere for people. We must set a better example by completely
avoiding all these extra expenditure. Look here, don’t get angry. If you are
eager about one more knot to your <span class=SpellE><i>thali</i></span><i>, </i>I
shall do it with all my heart, here and now. But that does not require all this
commotion and hubbub.” He paused, revolving within as to how best to find out a
way to end all this extravagance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

think of anything else except the birthday function. She thought of catching
him otherwise, by mentioning how there were public functions to be had in his <span
class=SpellE>honour</span>. Unable to restrain any longer her feelings, she <span
class=GramE>blurted ,</span> out: “You can stop, if you please, my mouth. But
can you ask the public to cease their preparations to <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
you? I know it is the easiest thing for you to accomplish at home, your sway.
But can you dare to control outside the home any being who will not be so
docile and abjectly allowing <span class=GramE>herself</span> to be led as I
am?” She ceased, and for a second looked triumphantly at him for what she
thought was an unanswerable argument of hers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his voice and enquired of her: “Who told you of a public function? Are
arrangements getting ready?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Devasena</span> <span
class=SpellE>realised</span> her own folly. It was only a day previously that
she had got the information from a confidential source, which she was asked to
keep secret and not to let out before the actual day of the celebration. She
had thrown all such cautions to the winds with the result that now her husband
became exercised over it. She feared the consequences of her indiscretion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no point thereafter in concealing facts. She was in a dilemma. Nevertheless
she tried to be vague. “Pray<span class=GramE>,</span> do not get uneasy at
what I thought I could guess. Nobody has actually given me any information. I
felt that in the natural course of events, your Association may also arrange
for a function to felicitate you. You are an important member of the Welfare
Association, and the rest of your colleagues and friends are not fools to be
sitting quiet when an important occasion like a sixty-first birthday for a
friend has to be treated with at least the normal greetings that it should
elicit from them.” She vainly attempted to make it all appear insignificant and
not a serious affair. She tried to retrace her steps from an awkward situation.

man, he was completely absorbed in another matter which gave him little room
for anything else. For nearly a week, he was caught up in the agitation started
by the fisher-folk over the Government’s action in forming a highway for motor
traffic along the sea-shore which meant that their huts on the sands of the
beach had to be removed. They were very much disturbed over the matter, as it
would dislocate their long habitation near the sea which in every way secured
their fishing trade from being adversely affected. The promise of better
dwellings in the interior did not in the least satisfy them as they were
considering the nearness of the sea as the only advantage for their fishing
activities. <span class=SpellE>Sivaprakasam</span> felt their objections as
legitimate, and so he was for a strong agitation on their behalf against the
Government, in case the Government was not likely to listen to their protests. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was, therefore, thinking of meeting <span class=SpellE>Murugesa</span> <span
class=SpellE>Naicker</span> in connection with the pending question whether to
allow the Government to have their own way or to prevent it at the earliest
possible moment by concerted action on the part of a sympathetic public. He was
contemplating the convening of a meeting of the members of their Association to
discuss the matter and draft some resolutions in that behalf. Time was precious
for him and the attention of the Association should not be distracted by any
other activity. So he wished to delay no longer in approaching the chairman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are not allowed to pursue their time-<span class=SpellE>honoured</span> trade

community as the fisher-folk to live where they have been accustomed to ply
their profession all these years. The Government in taking the decision <span

this violation of a fundamental right to go unchallenged. Unless in time we

satisfaction that a long-felt amenity for the public was in the process of
preparation. After all, the fisher-folk also will benefit by a better housing
arrangement for them on the pretext of a road being laid along the beach and
forcing them to change their mode of habitation which would be safer in the

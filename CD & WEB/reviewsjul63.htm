<p class=MsoBodyText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>The book is an excellent
politico-economic analysis of the contemporary American Economic System and the
malaise it suffers from, in spite of its staggeringly high figures of production
and productivity. The author is of the view that a correct diagnosis and
prescription of remedies is being rendered impossible by the miasma created by
“Conventional Wisdom”. In his attempts at diagnosis and prescription of
remedies for the American maladies the author is, of course, shot with a
certain amount of iconoclastic zeal. But his approach to economic problems is
refreshingly original, novel, breaks new ground, suggests new possibilities and
is impeccably logical and psychological. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
book runs into 277 pages and is divided into 25 chapters. Starting with the
thesis, in Chapter I, that wealth is the relentless enemy of understanding and
that a rich society, unlike the poor, can have no precise idea of knowing its
problems, and hence does a lot of shadow fighting, he arrives at the conclusion
that the old economic attitudes rooted in poverty, inequality and economic
peril, are inadequate for the changed society of America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rejection of the conclusions based on the concept of Conventional Wisdom
(Chapter II) is the hub round which the rest of the book revolves. Conventional
Wisdom may be defined as the structure of ideas which bear the hall mark of
acceptability and which have stability and predictability. However, the author
feels that “Circumstance”, or the march of events, is the enemy of Conventional
Wisdom or conservative ideas. For example, the idea of Balanced Budgets has
been thrown overboard by the onset of depression. Again our old preoccupation
with production, the culminating consequence of powerful historical and
psychological forces…..which has become central to our strivings to reduce
insecurity, which is rooted in the psychology of ‘Want’, is no more tenable in
an affluent society. He argues that wants do not become less urgent, the more
amply the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>individual is supplied, because of Dependence
Effect (Chapter XII). Wants can be <span class=SpellE>synthesised</span> by
advertising, <span class=SpellE>catalysed</span> by salesmanship, and shaped by
the discreet manipulations of persuaders…..As a society becomes more affluent,
wants are increasingly created by the process by which they are satisfied. In
other words Dependence Effect <span class=GramE>means,</span> wants grow out of
the process of production itself; if production is to increase wants must be
effectively contrived, at least of privately produced goods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>According to the author the main purpose of the book
is to deal with the <span class=SpellE>thraldom</span> of the myth ‘that
production, by its overpowering importance and ineluctable difficulty, is the
central problem of our lives’. He feels that the nexus between production and
Income Security cap be broken by Unemployment Compensation, which should
increase as unemployment increases and diminish as full employment is
approached. He calls it the cyclically Graduated Compensation Scheme. According
to him the Affluent Society which has solved the problem of production of
goods, has still to solve the problem of their studied and rational use. It is
yet to eliminate toil as an economic institution, has to eradicate case
poverty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
brief, the book focuses our attention on the inherent inability of people and,
in particular, economists, to adjust themselves to changing conditions, to
forestall action to suit the changing current of events. The Indian reader of
the book need not feel <span class=GramE>disappointed,</span> need not feel
that the book contains discussion of problems which have no relevance to him.
For example, the case for increased public expenditure made by the author has
great significance for us, engaged in building public sector enterprises.
Chapter XII “Illusion of National Security” again has lessons for us, in the
context of the Chinese invasion, and should convince us that “Military Power is
not a function of economic output, or size of economy, and rate of growth
alone.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writer belongs to a group of European savants engaged in presenting and
interpreting to the moderns the traditional wisdom of the East, rooted in
Gnosis or Knowledge of the Self, which, according to them, is at the core of
all religions, though it is in Hinduism that it is found in the most pronounced
form and it is among the Hindus that various techniques for <span class=SpellE>realising</span>
it have been evolved, <span class=SpellE>practised</span> and preserved. These
modern <span class=SpellE>orientalists</span> have, as Dr <span class=SpellE>Raghavan</span>
points out in his invaluable Foreword, by their expositions in the West, of the
traditional wisdom of the East, contributed in a unique manner, to a true

authors of the two books under review have a “Grace de eminence” about them.
Swami <span class=SpellE>Pratyagatmananda</span> Saraswati (known as Prof. P.
N. <span class=SpellE>Mukhopadhyaya</span> in <span class=SpellE>Purvashrama</span>)
had published scholarly treatises on <span class=SpellE>Tantrik</span> works
and <span class=SpellE>Sakti</span> and in <span class=SpellE>conjuction</span>
with Sir John <span class=SpellE>Woodroffe</span>. Dr P. T. <span class=SpellE>Raju</span>
is a co-author with Dr <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span> of a monumental
philosophical treatise. Naturally therefore, the two books represent a highly
original approach to the interpretation of Vedanta Philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

the <span class=SpellE>Swamiji</span> and Dr <span class=SpellE>Raju</span> are
concerned about examining the basic tenets of the Vedanta in the context of
modern scientific data and theories. In fact, the <span class=SpellE>Swamiji</span>
says explicitly that his object is not to tread the beaten track but to state
the essential features of the <span class=SpellE>Vedantic</span> doctrine, as
far as possible, in current scientific-philosophical terms and indicate its
place in the economy of modern Western thought and estimate its value. This is
by no means an easy task; but the author, in the course of twelve lectures
under the auspices of the Calcutta University, succeeds in more than one
respect in bringing out the value of <span class=SpellE>Vedantism</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>The <span
class=SpellE>Swamiji</span> tries to show that many of the deeper currents in
the realms of science and philosophy are now converging to a position that is
essentially similar to the position of <span class=SpellE>Brahmavada</span> in
the Upanishads. Atomic Physics, according to him, represents a movement towards
the dematerialization of matter and narrows the gulf between matter and energy.
“The Relativity Theory has postulated a still more <span class=SpellE>undefinable</span>
framework for the universe–the four dimensional continuum of points. And so,
though some kind of continuum is strongly indicated in physical speculation, we
have to start in the last resort, with what Russell calls ‘an apparatus of the
undefined’. Hence the victory of fundamental unity and continuity is achieved
in science at cost of definability and measurability.” The argument appears
quite convincing, but, the author shows that basic <span class=SpellE>undefinability</span>
and <span class=SpellE>unmeasurability</span> are the characteristics not
merely in Physics but in other sciences like Biology, Evolution, Psychology
etc., also. This will have to be the result if unity and continuity are to be
achieved. The relation of the cosmic psychic stuff to individual stuff, the
relation of matter to mind–have tended to become a monistic relation. “A
‘Neutral Being’ with ‘an apparatus’ of the <span class=SpellE>undefinable</span>
and <span class=SpellE>unmeasurable</span> given in it which, in the words of
Russell, makes ‘matter less material and mind less mental’ is indicated at the
root. It need not, however, be the ‘Thing-in-itself’ of the <span class=SpellE>unknowabilist</span>.
It may be Being-experience whole or ‘Fact’. This is the fundamental ‘Brahman’
of Vedanta.” The author goes on to expound in a brilliant way the basic theory
of <span class=SpellE>Sruti</span> as he sees it in terms of “the Continuum
Point and the <span class=SpellE>centres</span>” and concludes that all ancient
cultures have accepted the theory, even though rival claims, mostly subjective,
may be put forward about particular Revelations alone being the true ones.
There is something <span class=SpellE>Hegellian</span> in the devastating
manner in which the learned author goes about interpreting and setting up
various concepts like Continuum Points, Karma, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author’s partiality for the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

its inadequacies in the light of the conclusions of Evolutionism,
Phenomenology, Existential</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ism, Depth Psychology etc., and finds that
there is much that Eastern idealism (meaning Indian idealism) can learn from,
as well as contribute to, its Western counterpart. “What the world needs now is
the restoration of a systematic unified outlook, not the scientific outlook
which ignores man’s conscious being, not the old religious outlook which, in
its institutionalized forms, has proved to be one-sided in several ways and
ignored the material being of man and his mundane values, but an outlook that
can do full justice to all the aspects of man’s being.” This, according to the
author can be achieved by an affirmation of man’s own conscious being with its
two directions–inwardness and <span class=SpellE>outwardness</span>. In terms
of this new approach, idealism will be a new study of man which may be called ‘<span
class=SpellE>Critico</span>-integral-humanism’. “Both the Supreme Spirit and
matter are real for man’s consciousness, which cannot therefore be unreal. If
man’s consciousness has no existence, then neither the Supreme Spirit nor
matter can have existence. For it is man’s consciousness that has to assert the
existence of either.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

little anthologies of Indian Short Stories in translation are a valuable
addition to literature of this kind, which is none too abundant. The Writers
Workshop of Calcutta (conducted by P. <span class=SpellE>Lal</span> and his
enthusiastic colleagues), which has hitherto been preoccupied with original
writing in English by Indians, with the accent on verse, has in this slim
volume, turned its attention to contemporary writing in the Indian languages,
making a good beginning with Hindi, to be followed by other languages in course
of time. It presents fourteen short stories (Selected and translated by Jai <span

the exception of <span class=SpellE>Krishan</span> <span class=SpellE>Chandar</span>
and one or two others who are fairly well-established names) with a new way of
looking at life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the hundred odd pages of this volume, we come across a delightful multiplicity
of themes worked upon by a wide variety of techniques. ‘The Boss came to
dinner’ by <span class=SpellE>Bhishnu</span> <span class=SpellE>Sahni</span> is
a witty, amusing account (but not without a touch of sentiment) of the struggle
undergone by the ambitious employee of a foreign business firm to put up his
best for the boss who is invited to dinner at his house and the unexpected
encounter with the old-fashioned mother, which he was so anxious to avoid. The
touching affection so typical of the mother’s instinct shines by contrast with
the snobbery and showy superficiality of the son. More serious in tone is the
story entitled ‘Leech’ by ‘<span class=SpellE>Amarkant</span>’ full of irony
and satire, with a deep under-current of pathos. The writer concludes on a note
of wonder if the beggarly vagabond, living on the crumbs thrown by the
residents of the locality, was a leech on life or life was a leech on him. The
reader is however left in little doubt on the point. ‘Of Love and deliverance’
by <span class=SpellE>Mannoo</span><i> </i><span class=SpellE>Bhandari</span>
highlights the lurking craving for life and the love of self which survive the
most grievous of bereavements. The apparently contrary but loving nature of a
housewife is brought out in the beautiful story by <span class=SpellE>Maheep</span>
Singh depicting a few homely incidents in the life of a young and loving Sikh
couple in Bombay. Jai <span class=SpellE>Ratan’s</span> translation is
sensitive and has an elegance of idiom that would do credit to any original,

volume of stories from <span class=SpellE>Gujerat</span> seems to suffer by
comparison, as a work of art, in translation. Most of the 16 stories are by
established writers and there is evidence of care in their choice for inclusion
in the anthology. ‘Smoke Rings’ by <span class=SpellE>Gulabdas</span> Broker is
primarily psychological in its approach. It brings out, with a deep poignancy,
the <span class=SpellE>sombre</span> musings of the penitent father of a
youthful martyr in the <span class=SpellE>Swadeshi</span> agitation. <span
class=SpellE>Kapadia’s</span> ‘Small Matter’ and <span class=SpellE>Khatri’s</span>
‘To the Ultimate End’ both serve to spotlight the urge for motherhood, but in
different ‘The Queen of Night’ by <span class=SpellE>Shivkumar</span> Joshi
uncovers the tragedy lying hidden under the cheapness and gaiety of a soprano
at a restaurant. The stories leave the impression on the reader that there is
not enough of local <span class=SpellE>colour</span> or other regional touch,
in this version at least, to go with <span class=SpellE>Gujerat</span> in
particular, but then this may be nobody’s fault, as in a common medium like
English, we may all look so deceptively alike. Even then, in the hands of
accomplished translators, the stories are likely to retain the strange <span

the three great poets <span class=SpellE>Nannaya</span>, <span class=SpellE>Tikkana</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Errana</span>, in the three stages in the history of
Andhra, the author managed to cover and present in an attractive form the
political and cultural history of the Andhra people over several centuries and
also to impress on the readers the soul of the people which has always stood up
in <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of the cherished cultural heritage of the
nation and the spiritual values at its basis. As such these novels constitute
at the same time a high class literary achievement and a valuable piece of
national service. In the absence, as yet of any comprehensive and authoritative
history of the <span class=SpellE>Andharas</span>, these novels serve to
provide the youth of the country with a fairly correct (in essentials)
knowledge of the history of the people, and inspire them with noble ideals of
true patriotism, and contribute to the flowering of the national genius, the
progress of the Andhra State, arid the strength and prosperity of Independent <span
class=SpellE>Bharat</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his latest novel, <span class=SpellE>Kavisarvabhowma</span>, the volume under
review, the hero <span class=SpellE>Srinadha</span>, the most famous and
popular poet in Telugu after the Trio of the Telugu <span class=SpellE>Bharatam</span>,
the author brings up the history to the period of the <span class=SpellE>Rayas</span>
of <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagar</span> and brings out the position occupied
and part played by the Telugus in the political, social and cultural life of
the empire and the imperial capital. In this novel the plot is practically
confined to a single famous episode in the life of the great poet, the
disputation with the <span class=SpellE>Gowda</span> scholar <span
class=SpellE>Dindimabhattu</span>, and his journeys to <span class=SpellE>Vijayanagara</span>
and back in that connection. It is therefore of greater artistic value and
should be more popular with students of literature and literary history than
the earlier novels of the trilogy in which the attempt made, however
successful, was to mould into the unity of a single plot enormous and various
material of political, social as well as literary interest. This novel should
therefore find greater <span class=SpellE>favour</span> in the literary circles
and whet our appetite for similar volumes which we are encouraged to expect
from him, on <span class=SpellE>Pothana</span> and the poets of later times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

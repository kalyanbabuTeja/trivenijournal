<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Shakespeare’s vision on
life in the light of Indian thought is both a challenging and intriguing title
for a short article attempt. For neither Shakespeare’s vision of life, if any,
nor Indian thought, lends itself to any facile definition or description. In
the first place, it is doubtful if Shakespeare set out to present an integrated
vision of life in his comedies and tragedies, even if we left out the
histories, as chronicles, with no such intellectual or spiritual ambition
behind them. In fact Bradley himself starts his first lecture on the substance
of Shakespearean Tragedy with the poser “What is the nature of the tragic
aspect of life as represented by Shakespeare” and immediately proceeds to
answer, that by that it is not implied that Shakespeare set himself to reflect
on the tragic aspects of life, that he framed a tragic conception, and still
less, like Aristotle or <span class=SpellE>Corneille</span>, he had a theory of
the kind of poetry called Tragedy. We cannot be sure that in his works he
expressed his deepest and most cherished convictions on ultimate questions or
even that he had any. He was first and foremost a dramatic artist who freely,
borrowed his material from many a source, though what he made out of the
borrowings was a perfect work of art. The complexity of his material <span
class=GramE>can</span> be seen in his tragedies as well as comedies. Talking of
his tragedies Prof. Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>, the well known
Shakespearean scholar, says “they are a vast continent, jungle-like in their
complexity and range with royal oaks reaching up to the sky, seductive but
deceptive pools here and there, forest fires raging in inimitable fury, wild
beasts roaming, tigers and lambs thrown together into the same incalculable
scheme of life.” To sort out a vision of life from this kaleidoscopic material
and correlate it with the basic strains of Indian thought is a difficult enough
task but even if we did succeed in arriving at some conclusions, it would
represent only one aspect of life, namely, the tragic aspect and not the whole
of life. We cannot arrive at a total conception of Shakespeare’s vision of life
from his tragedies exclusively as for instance we can to some extent comprehend
<span class=SpellE>Kalidasa’s</span> way of looking at things from any one of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>his
important works like the <span class=SpellE><i>Abhijnana</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Sakuntala</span> </i>or <span class=SpellE><i>Raahuvamsa</i></span><i>.
</i>Let us, therefore, have a brief glance at the world of Shakespeare’s
comedies also. Even though the comedies have received far less scholarly
attention than the intellectually more fashionable tragedies, nevertheless,
they constitute an integral part of Shakespeare’s genius and reputation as a
dramatist. Without the comedies our understanding of Shakespeare would be sadly
incomplete. The world of the comedies, despite the jungles there also, is not <span
class=GramE>so</span> terrifying as that of the tragedies with their gigantic
oaks, forest fires, seductive pools and man-eaters, as observed earlier, but
they are, on a different plane, equally complex and often confusing. Anything
may happen and many things do happen in the towns and jungles of the comedies.
In the first place, few of them are identifiable in point of space or time and
they are peopled with both fairies and mortals jostling cheek by jowl with one
another. The mortals range from banished dukes to daily <span class=SpellE>labourers</span>
all in such a highly curious mental state as to draw the derisive but probably
deserved comment from Puck “What fools these mortals <span class=GramE>be</span>.”
Here also it looks, at least on the surface of things, as if Shakespeare made
it his main business as a dramatist to entertain though not through sheer
frivolity and he did not consciously project any comic vision of life as for
instance Ben <span class=SpellE>Jonson</span>, his great contemporary,
attempted to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Equally
difficult is the attempt to define or describe what constitutes the
quintessence of Indian thought. It resists classification into any scheme of
bloodless categories. So protean has been its character from the earliest <span
class=SpellE>Upanishadic</span> teachers down to more recent mystics,
philosophers and saints like Kabir, <span class=SpellE>Paramahamsa</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Ramana</span>, Aurobindo, <span class=SpellE>Vivekananda</span>,
Tagore and a Karma Yogi like Gandhi. If we turn to Indian literary tradition,
we find here again that tragedy as a form has been ruled out. In the whole
realm of Sanskrit drama there is no tragedy in the Western sense of the term
except probably the stray play <span class=SpellE><i>Urubhanga</i></span><i> </i>attributed
to <span class=SpellE>Bhasa</span>. But this does not mean that the Indian mind
was either ignorant of, or had deliberately buried its head <span class=SpellE>ostrichlike</span>,
and was blind to the tragic aspect of life. A play like <span class=SpellE><i>Sakuntala</i></span><i>
</i>for instance has a great deal of the tragic element in it though it is not
a tragedy in the Aristotelian or Shakespearean sense. However, one fundamental
postulate of Indian thought despite its otherwise complex skein is the
recognition of <i>Dharma </i>or the moral order and that is amply reflected in
its religious, philosophical, ethical and literary creations. This moral order
so basic to Indian thought can be seen as the constant undercurrent in the
plays of Shakespeare also whether they are comedies or tragedies. Whether
Shakespeare consciously projected this moral order into his plays, we are not,
as already observed, certain, but beneath the complexity of character and
action in both the tragedies and comedies, there is, to the discerning reader
or spectator of Shakespeare’s plays, this unmistakable moral order. In both the
comedies and tragedies ultimately, it is Truth, Goodness and Beauty that
triumph, though a great deal of it is crushed in the process. It is probably
this universal element in Shakespeare’s plays that has exercised such a
fascinating appeal to the Indian mind ever since it came into contact with
Western literature and thought. The appeal in the case of Shakespeare was not
merely literary as in the case of many other great writers like Chaucer, Spenser,
<span class=SpellE>Marlowe</span>, Ben <span class=SpellE>Jonson</span>,
Milton, Keats and a host of others but deeply spiritual and philosophical. That
is because we see in the plays of Shakespeare beyond the tomfoolery of the
comedies and the purely macabre happenings in the tragedies, a deep affirmation
of the values which constitute the warp and woof of Indian thought through the
ages. It is probably this affinity between Indian and Western thought, that can
explain the spell that a play like <span class=SpellE><i>Sakuntala</i></span><i>,
</i>which represents not only Kalidasa at his <span class=SpellE>maturest</span>
but also Indian thought at its most comprehensive, has cast on some of the
greatest minds of the West like Goethe, Max Muller and <span class=SpellE>Monier</span>
Williams. This is true of all the classics of the world. For instance, in his
lecture to the Virgil Society on ‘What is a Classic’, T. S. Eliot places the
strongest emphasis on the universality of a classic. Apart from other character­istics
like maturity of mind, language, manners and civilisation, a classic must have,
according to Eliot, <span class=GramE>an amplitude</span> and a catholicity
extending far beyond not only its times but also its national frontiers. It
must have a deep significance also for another civilisation, however divided
and distant it may be by space and time. Shakespeare is definitely a classic
even by the hedging definition that Eliot lays down and that is the secret and
significance of his appeal to Indian </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
his comedies as well as tragedies, there is ethical seriousness. In the
comedies there may be the occasional spectacle of a <span class=SpellE>Titania</span>
doting in the arms of an ass or the lovers running after wrong quarries under
the dominating influence of a love portion but ultimately it is married love
that is exalted and enthroned, even as in <span class=SpellE><i>Sakuntala</i></span><i>,
</i>it is married love and the sanctity of the family that eventually triumph.
In the tragedies it appears on a superficial view that there is a great deal of
senseless waste of all that we cherish, namely, the death of a <span
class=SpellE>Cordelia</span> or a Desdemona or a Hamlet but on deeper
reflection they are triumphant vindications of rightness, wholeness, beauty and
strength. <span class=SpellE>Cordelia</span> may have to die in order to prove
the hollowness of Regan and <span class=SpellE>Goneril</span>; and Desdemona’s
death <span class=SpellE>neutralises</span> the fabrications of <span
class=SpellE>Iago</span>. As Prof. <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> has said
“Tragedy thus involves not the seeming end but the intuition of the conclusion
yet to be concluded.” It is this which brings Shakespeare so close to Indian
thought that he is as much an integral part of the Indian intellectual
apparatus as <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bhasa</span>,
Kalidasa or Bhavabhuti.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

C. Bentley’s simple definition that “history is about chaps just as geography
is about maps” underlines the human factor in the chronicle of countries and
kingdoms. History, like philosophy, is invested with a monumental dullness by
pretentious pedants, who identify it with a catalogue of kings and a diary of
events and incidents. To the great Gibbon must go the credit to some extent at
any rate, of enlivening the dusty pages of ancient history with vivid and
virile men, pulsating with life and throbbing with human emotions. His grand
manner and nervous prose have enhanced the appeal of his method of narrating
the fortunes of Rome like an exciting novel. Macaulay, who was an ardent
admirer, though not a mechanical imitator of the Author of the <i>Decline and
Fall, </i>worked on similar lines and sought to go one better in his ambitious <i>History
of England, </i>which is a picturesque panorama of people, in their varied hues
and variegated shades. Compton Mackenzie and Arthur Bryant, among others in
English literature, can be considered living exponents of the biographical </span><span

is an eminently human art that forms an agreeable branch of literature. The
overwhelmingly large number of classical </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>works in this category
written in England is ample proof of its popularity which persists, pervading
all channels of expression like books, newspapers and broadcasting. Hardly can
one open a ‘class’ magazine or weekly journal without coming across a biography
in miniature. The ‘profile’ feature of the <i>Observer </i>is as well-written
as it is widely read. Done by experts who know the job, the weekly dish is
delicious and digestible. It is as interesting as it is informative, adequate
in matter and flawless in manner. The sketches in the <i>Sunday Times </i>are
in a smaller compass, drawn with a severe economy of expression. The portraits
in the <i>Picture Post </i>and other such ‘popular’ periodicals are naturally
more breezy, if less authoritative. Readers of the <i>English Review </i>are
not likely to miss the regular ‘personality paragraphs’ which are homely and
refreshing. One may have one’s likes and dislikes, preferences and
predilections, but it is only too clear that pen-portraiture is a precious and
popular feature of<i> </i>English journalism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For some reason or other the Profile has not yet
become a regular or readable feature of journals and newspapers over here. The
reason is evidently the same as for the paucity of good biographies, with a few
notable exceptions like R. P. Masani’s <i>Dadabhai Naoroji</i>, H. P. Mody’s <i>Pherozeshah</i>
<i>Mehta</i>, P. C. Ray’s <i>C. R. Das </i>and D. G. Tendulkar’s <i>Mahatma</i>
<i>Gandhi</i>. Seldom does the reader get a satisfactory pen-portrait of any
person of importance, or one of no importance who suddenly flits across the
scene into the limelight. It is quite possible that the subjects are more often
than not gluttonous to flattery, but over-sensitive to criticism as the writers
are sometimes willing to wound, but afraid to strike. There is therefore, no
dearth of hysterical and unabashed panegyrics of those with pelf, power and
position, and loud lampoons against those who might have fallen from grace.
This only highlights the position, by contrast, of conscientious craftsmen of
the ‘Profile’ art like K. Iswara Dutt, Khasa Subba Rau, Frank Moraes, and M.
Chalapathi Rau, who are all unlike one another, and at the same time far above
the common run of sketch-writers.</p>

D.’ are familiar initials to readers of the <i>Hindustan</i> <i>Times</i> and
represent Mr. K. Iswara Dutt, who is really a man of letters in the Street of
Ink. His weekly ‘Miscellany’ is an engaging mixture of politics and
personalities, lending a literary flavour to the rough and tumble of daily
journalism. Iswara Dutt took the reading public of Madras by storm over two
decades ago by his sparkling booklet <i>Sparks and Fumes</i>, which was in fact
a collection of sketches published earlier in <i>Swarajya</i> and elsewhere.
The 13 portraits (the number was more accidental than ominous) were marked by
keen insight and fair judgment. The analysis of character was shrewd and subtle
and the expression was lucid and luminous, with a phrasing that is crisp and
convincing. Among the ‘victims’ (all Andhras), who came under the author’s
‘knife’ are Dr. Pattabhi and Messrs. T. Prakasam and B. Sambamurthi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘I. D.’ dances round his subject with sparkle and gaiety, ‘Saka’ (Khasa Subba
Rau) grapples it with a firm grip and an infectious gusto. The <i>Men in the
Limelight </i>published over a decade ago is a dazzling gallery of a dozen
luminaries of Madras,–politicians, pressmen and lawyers. As indicated by the
expressive title of the booklet, the author focuses the searchlight of candid
criticism on the men who happen to be in the limelight for the time being. To
this he has later added a collection of his <i>Side-lights </i>which are of the
same texture as the once famous <i>Comments of Bagshot </i>by J. A. Spender. If
Iswara Dutt has tried his best to write like Gardiner, Khasa has attempted,
with a commendable degree of success, to look at his subjects with the sharp
and piercing eyes of Spender. He is more anxious to analyse the character and estimate
the personality of the man under his merciless microscope than to exhibit his
mystery of language or indulge his whims of style.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

patience with straw Caesars who might strut about the bargain basement, he is

seeing them whole, he is particular about including the “warts and all” in his
pen-portraits. While his sense of style is usually unerring, the consuming zeal
with which he plunges into his subject makes him look more like a crusader than
a craftsman. A philosophical background has given him a distant vision and a
wide perspective that help him in making apt and illuminating generalisations
on public life and private conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

As is only natural, he is more concerned with men than with matters, and deals
with matters when both happen to be synonymous. He has not missed his vocation;
as his wide travels (again like the winged elf) and interviews with the men–and
women too–who matter, as well as his familiarity with masters of prose and
poetry provide him with the equipment for a job that he obviously enjoys doing.

compact cameos are characterised by a commendable conciseness of treatment and

idea, and the result is a rare harmony of substance and style. How correct and
convincing is his appraisal of ‘C. P.’ who has a ‘mind that scintillates’. “He
has a quickfire brilliance which has partly proved his undoing. Quick to grasp
the intricacies of a subtle problem, he is apt to be impatient with those whose
cerebral processes move rather slowly. If his light dazzles others, it
occasionally blinds himself.” Here is a crisp comment on the Communist orator,
Prof Hiren Mookerjee: “In the parliamentary arena he gives no quarter and asks
for none. His chiseled English intonation must seem a little out of place in
the serried ranks of Tuscany.” Of President Prasad he says: “Though a lawyer by
training, he is by temperament a peasant. He has peasant’s humility and
gentleness, something of his stubbornness and the shrewdness which often goes
with men who eke their living from the soil.” “Dr. Radhakrishnan must have
found Stalin a tougher proposition than Schopenhauer and Kant. The dialects of

of <i>Shankar’s Weekly </i>are often in the habit of eagerly looking out (after
a glance at the cartoons) for the scintillating sketches appearing under the
pseudonym of ‘Magnus’ or the initials ‘M. C.’ The man with the mighty pen,
hiding under this inadequate mask is, of course, the formidable Editor of the <i>National
Herald</i> and the popular leader of working journalists, M. Chalapathi Rau.
The ‘imaginary interviews’ with the ‘pillars of society’ and ‘people of
importance’ are brilliant sketches, done with savage satire and purposeful parody.

Jawaharlal Nehru. Balloons are pricked with unerring precision and masterly

cutting pen, which can sometimes be mightier than the sword. The foibles of
human character are exposed with merciless and malicious humour. It is not
certain if the same writer is behind the ‘man of the week’ in that journal, but
the master’s touch is often in evidence in those exquisite character-sketches.
Gifted with a marvellous memory ‘Magnus’ has acquired a deep scholarship that
has served to refine the sharp edges of his massive intellect. His wide
literary background provides him with a cultivated taste and has helped the
evolution of a splendid, if gorgeous, style, scintillating with epigrams and
sparkling wit that reveal his closeness to Lytton Strachey and Philip Guedalla,
two writers who seemed to have influenced him most in the manner of his
writing. A certain sophisticated sourness is visible in the jewelled epigrams
of this fastidious stylist, who is equally a satirist, who lashes with a whip
of scorpions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

writers discussed above are illustrative rather than exhaustive of the
practitioners of this exacting art. Among others deserving mention is K.
Chandrasekharan, who has drawn thumb-nail sketches of some Madras lawyers in
his <i>Persons</i> <i>and Personalities</i>. There are, however, more persons
in it than personalities, as the author’s sense of too much caution and balance
has made the portraits less vivid than they would otherwise be. His recent <i>Studies
and Sketches </i>is also in the same decorous and conventional tradition. Yusuf
Meherally, in the booklets about the <i>Leaders of India, </i>gave us a number
of passable ‘miniatures in biography,’ which are rather elementary in their
scope and treatment. Other aspirants in this field were less successful.
Joachim Alva’s ‘Men and Supermen of Hindustan’ is informative and interesting
in its detail, but somewhat amateurish and scrappy, lacking in the unerring
touch that marks out good writing from<i> </i>the bad and indifferent. G.
Venkatachalam’s <i>Profiles </i>is diffuse and desultory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Pen-portraiture, like the writing of a poem or a
short-story, is a fine art with exacting standards of style and workmanship. A
good ‘profile’ is a sonnet in prose. It is a compact cameo, characterised by a
severe, even austere and astringent, economy of expression, which realises the
importance of the waste paper basket. But as literary fashions change like
ladies’ clothes, any evidence of careful writing or lucid exposition is
nowadays suspect in the eyes of the elite, who profess a fondness for anything
as staccato and strident as Hemmingway or as vague and inscrutable as James
Joyce. To such sophisticated souls, any semblance of accepted idiom and
conventional form must be anathema. It is difficult to tell what form the
‘profile’ takes under ultra-modern masters of fashion, and whether it will
resemble Picasso’s paintings or other unrecognisable experiments in cubism and
surrealism. We can only hope that there are still at least a few, who are so
old-fashioned as to like A. G. Gardiner, Lytton Strachey and Winston Churchill.</p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“During
the week-end I felt so bored, time hung so heavy on my hands, that I felt like
committing suicide” bemoaned not a character out of fiction but a typical ‘mod’,
hardly yet out of his teens. If we make some allowance for the exaggeration
characteristic of youthful utterance in general, we will not be too far amiss
in detecting in it a symptom of a malady with which a sizable number of our
young are afflicted: the malady of boredom. And yet it is nothing short of a paradox
that this malady should claim its victims from among those who should, as a
matter of fact, be most resistant to it. Is not youth the springtide of one’s
life with its ebullience, exuberant spirits and dizzy raptures? Should not lust
for life <span class=GramE>be</span> at its most virile and zest for living at
its knees just then? The prospect of autumnal gloom and pensiveness settling
down where one had looked for vernal glory and freshness of a dream is
disturbing indeed. The young should, in fact, be too busy-living, snatching for
fun and excitement at each passing moment, to have any spare time to feel
bored. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This,
however, is easier said than done, I would readily grant this. But to say that
this is an impracticable piece of perfectionist <span class=GramE>advice,</span>
or to dismiss it as a pious platitude is not right. It does of course take some
effort to ward off boredom but it is nothing unachievable, to be sure. The very
consciousness that boredom should be prevented from spreading its tentacle and
enmeshing us is the first significant step in the right direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
notion that to feel bored is a sign of culture on the part of an individual has
somehow insinuated itself into the minds of some of us and has acquired a kind
of snob value. By complaining that he was bored in the company of so and so one
is possibly trying to give an oblique hint that he is of a superior taste,
higher <span class=SpellE>calibre</span> or finer timber. For reasons not hard
to guess, this is never stated overtly, though. Now, it may or may not be so.
If in a seminar on hydraulics, I am reduced to the pathetic condition of
throwing my jaws apart in frequent yawns, I can’t lay the fault at the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>door<i> </i></span>of the specialists. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If,
however, for the sake of argument, it is assumed that my boredom is due to the
banal level of discussion, it may be fairly retorted that “small talk” too has
its place in our human scheme of things. It is priggish to be for ever striking
a pose in order to appear sophisticated, urbane and academic. We all know that
by nodding occasionally Homer loses nothing of his stature, nor does Socrates,
while relentlessly pursuing his logic, by unbending. One misses a great deal by
staying tense and <span class=SpellE>tant</span> all the time. There is an
infinite variety of human comedy unfolding itself before us even in what looks
like prosaic and humdrum company. Viewed in a spirit of humanity and tolerance,
it will afford us plenty of mirth and amusement. Who could have imagined an
ill-assorted, chance-gathered motley crowd of pilgrims anything but dull and
monotonous, if not chilling and forbidding? But Chaucer found in it a perennial
source of good <span class=SpellE>humour</span> and delight. Similarly, the
French essayist <span class=SpellE>Montaigne</span> never thought it wise to
keep his glance averted from the follies and foibles of mankind. Since he was
never disdainful or supercilious, he garnered a rich store from a loving
observation of them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If,
therefore, you happen to be travelling in a second class railway compartment
(and that will depend on the <span class=SpellE>locomen</span> not striking and
your being able to somehow squeeze in), you can – and hopefully you will – find
in the incessant flow of twaddle something to keep you amused gratis. And what
is more, you don’t have to do a thing about it; neither to lift your little
finger nor, for that matter, raise your small voice. Just relax and listen, or
preferably, eavesdrop by feigning indifference. Merely by remaining a spectator
you will enjoy yourself better than, to use Francis Bacon’s word, the gamester;
I can vouch for this. Precariously perched at the edge of the all-too-cramped
berth you cannot deny yourself a chuckle or two on <span class=SpellE>savouring</span>
some specimens of mother-wit in the cacophony of the simple and the homespun.
Where the eyes are a glitter and the spine is <span class=SpellE>fingling</span>
with strange sensations, boredom dare not descend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

place is apparently more conducive to weariness of spirit and vexation than <span
class=GramE>goal.</span> Yet, Oscar Wilde found it most congenial to his
creativity. The artist in him found its peace and solitude a haven for his
trouble-tossed spirit, its lack of human company a balm for his lacerated sensibility.
Rescuing as it did Nehru from his inevitable involvement in the nation’s
affairs, the loneliness of prison gave him his all-too-rare and precious spells
of contemplation and discovery. Nobody who had any substance in him ever died
of ennui in the sunless caverns of a dungeon. Outside jail also, there are
bound to be, at one time or other, hours of utter and unrelieved solitariness.
How is one to survive them and not succumb to boredom? Well, to put it at its
simplest, by rubbing one thought against another. A man with a cultivated mind
need never fear boredom, for he carries within him a whole world vibrant with
vitality. He has only to ransack his riches. Ruskin tells us how he would keep
his spirits from drooping by reminding himself that “Apricot” was derived from
the same root as “precocious” because the apricot matured early. There are so
many intangibles that will arise like a bulwark against boredom. At a pinch,
all’s grist that comes to the mind’s mill, even controversies long since
silenced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since
this inner culture is not available to everybody to draw upon, nature has
provided its own anodyne against boredom. To realize this, one has only to take
a look at the tremendous drama that is being enacted right before him under the
blue sky and above the green earth. One can be thrilled by and respond to
everyday sights and sounds without getting into the transcendental mood of the
Vedic Sage or the mystic trance of a Wordsworth just by purging his senses of
the film of familiarity. If that is done, then the dismal round of dreary
existence will, no doubt, be illuminated by a thousand phenomena and scenes
which, although they seldom press themselves obtrusively on us, encompass us
all the time: a peculiar slant in light, a configuration of clouds, a movement
in water, a drift in the breeze, a splash of <span class=SpellE>colour</span>
on the horizon. Each moment being unique, how can one afford to turn an
imperceptive eye or an impervious ear to what it brings? One might as well be
touched by Gorgon if one cannot shake off one’s apathy and indifference. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

class=SpellE>Aldous</span> Huxley hoped to hold boredom at bay on a desert
island with the help of a couple of books. Robert <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Southey’s</span></span><span class=GramE><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>counsel</span> comes direct to our business
and bosom: even the greatest of authors will unfailingly turn up at our bidding
at the most unearthly hour to cheer us and comfort us. Book-reading is not to
be equated with an idle pastime like playing cards, <span class=GramE>nor</span>
with a visit to a cinema house. “We go to the movies”, laments a character of
Tennessee Williams, “instead of moving”. Only that recreation is most
worthwhile which answers to a hidden longing in us to live a richer, fuller
life, may be, vicariously through imagination. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Hobbies
too are a great help in fighting boredom and overcoming tedium. Particularly
when old age comes on a man, then he must have something to fall back upon to
save his last few years from frustrating emptiness and to keep himself
obliviously occupied. But they should be cultivated well in time before the
feeling of being at a loose end sets in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

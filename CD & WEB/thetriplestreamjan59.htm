discussions following upon the publication of the Official Language
Commission’s report, and the presentation to Parliament of the Parliamentary
Committee’s views on that <span class=GramE>report,</span> make it imperative
that some amount of re-thinking should be done by those amongst us who wish to
preserve a proper balance between the claims of reason and of emotion. A decade
has passed since the framers of our Constitution declared that within fifteen
years Hindi should replace English as the Official Language of the Union for
Central and inter-<span class=SpellE>Statal</span> purposes. That decision was
epoch-making and registered the will of a nation emerging into freedom and
over-anxious to wipe out whatever was likely to remind it of the ugly days of
subjection to foreign rule. The advocates of English could make no headway <span
class=GramE>against</span> the prevailing sentiment, and a battle-royal had to
be waged even for the preservation of international numerals!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
protagonists of Hindi were not content with the success they had achieved. Led
by scholars of distinction like Sri <span class=SpellE>Purushottamdas</span> <span
class=SpellE>Tandon</span> and Seth <span class=SpellE>Govind</span> Das, they
launched an India-wide campaign for the speedy elimination of English from all
spheres of public activity. They looked upon those who pleaded for the
retention of English for a longer period or for the acceptance of a bilingual
formula–English and Hindi–as the lingering remnants of a by-gone age, and,
worse, as the unconscious agents of our erstwhile masters. They talked, in and
out of season, of the final banishment of English and the enthronement of Hindi
in our courts and legislatures, schools and colleges, offices and business
houses. They rendered lip-service to the other regional languages. But, while
they were keen on the immediate and compulsory teaching of Hindi in non-Hindi
regions, they made not the slightest effort to induce their Hindi brethren to
learn any one of the other Indian languages. These stalwarts were in a majority
on the Official Language Commission, and overcame the objections urged by
leaders of thought representing the non-Hindi areas. A recommendation that an
Indian language other than Hindi should be taught in schools in the
Hindi-speaking States was not <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> by the
majority, though it must be said to the credit of the Parliamentary Committee
that they <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> this eminently reasonable
suggestion in the interests of the emotional integration of the people all over

slow degrees the intellectuals in the East and South of India found their
voices. A leader of the stature of Sri Rajaji who was formerly at the head of
the Hindi <span class=SpellE>Prachar</span> movement in <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>,
and who, as Chief Minister of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
in 1937, had urged the compulsory teaching of Hindi in South Indian schools,
was irritated by the un-seemly onrush of the Hindi enthusiasts. He did some
quiet re-thinking and was convinced that the retention of English as the
official language of the Union for an indefinite period, and its replacement by
Hindi only with the willing consent of the people of the non-Hindi regions at
some future date of their choice, offered a proper solution of the problem.
Hindi could be the language of administration in due course in the States of
Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, even as Telugu, Tamil,
Bengali or Marathi could be adopted as the official languages in the other
States whenever the respective Legislatures’ so decided. Sri Rajaji was also in
<span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the gradual spread of <span class=GramE>a
knowledge</span> of Hindi all over <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and the employment as soon
as possible of Hindi and other regional languages as media of instruction at

Rajaji and others who saw the force of his contention banded themselves and set
up <span class=SpellE>organisations</span> to focus public opinion on this
vital issue. They made out an excellent case for the maintenance of the <i>status
quo </i>and for a fresh examination of the issues involved, in an atmosphere of
calm, <span class=SpellE>unswayed</span> by emotion. They were not suggesting
that English should be the sole official language for all time; that was a
matter for a future generation to decide in the light of circumstances then
prevailing. But at the moment it was not wise to throw away the advantages we
had reaped through an effective medium of national and international
significance which had served us so well. To treat it as ‘foreign’ would be
utterly at variance with the experience gathered and expressed through our
cultural and political life for over a century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there are publicists, like my esteemed friend Sri P. <span class=SpellE>Kodanda</span>
Rao, who have set up contrary currents of feeling by evolving a new slogan:
“English ever; Hindi never.” They seem to think that at no foreseeable future
could any Indian language–much less a comparatively undeveloped one like
Hindi–aspire to be an official language of the Indian Union. By this
intransigent attitude, they have weakened an otherwise good cause. Between them
and the <span class=SpellE>Tandons</span> and <span class=SpellE>Govind</span> <span

<span class=SpellE>Subbaroyans</span> and <span class=SpellE>Suniti</span>

regional languages at the State level, and English and Hindi at the all-India
level, may have to be accepted as a working formula for some decades, even
after 1965. If, as seems likely, the regional languages are accepted as the
media of instruction in our Universities, English must be taught all over <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, right
from the commencement of the secondary course. And it should be taught well, so
that our students, while attending lectures in Bengali or Kannada, will be able
to read the latest books in English and keep abreast of recent developments in
literature, science or technology. Eventually all our students must become
familiar with the best in their own language, in English, and in another Indian
language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Official Language Commission and the Parliamentary Committee treat the
time-limit of 1965 as sacrosanct, and wish to make some transitional provisions
to satisfy the people of the non-Hindi areas. They argue that, <i>because </i>the
States will soon switch over to the regional languages for administration, the
all-India official language cannot be English but only Hindi. This does not
necessarily follow. It would be a great advantage, from every point of view to
accept <i>both </i>English and Hindi as the principal official languages of the
<st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place> and allow the generation now at school
to shape the future in accordance with its wishes. Even then, the complete
elimination of English as an official language can be achieved only as the

ease the present tension and restore harmony between the Hindi and non-Hindi
regions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not a member of that body. But the Prime Minister of India can exert his
great influence and achieve a peaceful solution through diplomatic channels.
There is no intention to revoke the Sino-Indian agreement of 1954 which
referred to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Tibet</st1:country-region> as the
“Tibetan region of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.”
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Tibet</st1:country-region> can continue to be an
autonomous State under Chinese suzerainty, though the just implications of that
autonomy are for the moment ignored by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The Dalai Lama cannot be a
refugee for long. With the return of normal conditions in his homeland, he must
return to lead his people in the paths of peace and maintain the traditional
institutions of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tibet</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Such progress as is in consonance with those traditions, and likely to advance
the interests of the people, will always be welcome to the Dalai Lama and his
advisers. What they seem to resent is violent and enforced change, unsuited to
their way of life and their spiritual outlook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and the character-traits of their significant personalities have been vividly
portrayed in the novel with a mastery of technique and a force of style all his
own. The story <span class=SpellE>centres</span> round the Court of Queen <span

contemporary of the famous <span class=SpellE>Hyder</span> Ali. It is on
record, from the pen of old historians like Wilkes and Rice, that the great
lady’s reputation in the sphere of private life was not free from the
imputation of certain peccadilloes. They affected her public position and
policy in certain material respects. And to have brought this out in the novel
is, in the eyes of a few persons of the Lingayat community, the offence of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Venkatesa</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>. It is
important to note that the grouse is not of the entire Lingayat community as
such, or of even the bulk of<i> </i>it. Indeed, there are a good many Lingayat
gentlemen who have openly dissociated themselves from the few objectors to the
book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

available in translation to the public of other Indian languages. The Kannada
Advisory Board of the <span class=SpellE>Akademi</span> supported the idea and,
perhaps, initiated it. The prospect of a greater vogue for the novel thus
seemed near. It was at this stage, some nine years after the first publication
of the book, that certain Lingayat gentlemen came to fancy in the work
something disparaging to their community. It was nothing to them that the

is an accepted canon all the world over that the imaginative writer–poet or
dramatist, novelist or fabulist–serves his fellowmen by revealing to them a new
vision of life, its unsuspected heights or its undiscovered depths; that, for
this purpose, he might draw his material from anywhere; that he may re-shape it
anyhow; and that for any one to interfere with the free flow of his speech or
song is to deprive the community of the very best that he has in him to give.
The imaginative writer has to deal more with possibilities and probabilities
than with actualities. He has to speculate, re-fashion and bring convincing
verisimilitude into his picture. To do this successfully, he has to take
liberties with his raw material, whether it <span class=GramE>be</span> drawn
from history or from legend, from folklore or from street gossip. All great
writers have done it. Shakespeare has done it. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Puttappa</span>
the <span class=SpellE>Akademi</span> <span class=GramE>Laureate,</span> has
done it. Has the Sahitya <span class=SpellE>Akademi</span> examined this aspect
of the matter? Shakespeare, for example, is taken by some to have <span
class=SpellE>libelled</span> the proletariat–the god of our day. Why does the <span
class=SpellE>Akademi</span> want that Shakespeare translated? If there are
people who have made it their business to raise a grouse, they are not without
provocation in ‘<span class=SpellE>Kuvempu’s</span>’ writings. Has any one
squirmed? It is a compliment to the ordinary good sense of our people that they
generally let a writer pursue his path. Whether the writer succeeds in what he
sets out to accomplish is a different matter altogether. The vision he saw
might have been a false one. His own workmanship may have been faulty. He may
be lacking in any of a hundred factors needed in him and necessary for success,
or these may be in maladjustment and out of proportion. But, in any case, the
State ought not to give room for it to be said that he either failed or
suffered <i>because of its meddlesome hand. </i>In the present case, the
Government did not interfere directly with the writer’s liberty, but it has
approved of the raising of a wall around the light of his vision; and, in this,
it has proclaimed its readiness to discountenance certain altogether allowable
and even desirable forms of imaginative effort in literature. Is this doing
respect to republican freedom?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

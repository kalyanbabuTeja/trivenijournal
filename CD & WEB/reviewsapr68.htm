together that one cannot tell them apart: <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Beaumont</st1:place></st1:City>

could so catch up with the father who is a veteran in the field. It is possible
to detect the difference, however, between father and daughter, the <span
class=SpellE>syncretist</span> and the specialist–the difference between age
and youth, experience and innocence, a sense of facts and facts, the abstract
and the concrete, philosophy and scholarship. The aims are modest; the means
are exacting and the ends are admirable. The book is not merely an introduction
to the study of English Literature; it is an introduction to the study of
literature ‘from <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Peru</st1:place></st1:country-region>.’ The
tremendous commonplaces of criticism are emphasized because we need oftener to
be reminded of vital ideas than revolutionized in our ways of thinking. The
amount of <span class=GramE>reading</span> that has gone into the book is
amazing; it is almost <span class=SpellE>encyclopaedic</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Saintsburyan</span>. Everywhere the Indian reader is exhilarated
by parallels from Indian literatures. On any given topic the books that matter
make their appearance and neat summaries of the views are given. For instance,
in the chapter on the novel the <span class=SpellE>inevitables</span>: Lubbock,
Forster, Muir pop in. But all such <span class=SpellE>encyclopaedic</span>
introductions suffer from some lacunae: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</i>Similarly after studying what C. S. Lewis has written on the structure of <i>The
<span class=SpellE>Fairie</span> <span class=SpellE>Queene</span> </i>in the <i>Literature
of the Sixteenth Century </i>and on the philosophy in the <i>Allegory of Love </i>there
is no excuse for making the <span class=SpellE>cliche</span> statements on
Spenser on pp. 128-129. Today we cannot ignore Janet <span class=SpellE>Spens</span>
or C. S. Lewis. It will be a sad day for us if we cannot regard Holiness,
Friendship, Courtesy, <span class=GramE>Chastity</span> as <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span>
and friends. If these are real, then Spenser is real. That is why it can be
even stated that the allegory is more real than the story–particularly to a
non-English reader. Courtesy is more real than Sir <span class=SpellE>Calidore</span>.
It is the allegory that <span class=SpellE>energises</span> the poem; to regard
it as confusion is to regard the legs of the centipede as confusion in its
anatomy. And to talk of the Platonism of Spenser is not to know either Spenser
or Plato; Spenser is a <span class=SpellE>syncretist</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

In the rapid survey of English literature from Beowulf to <span class=SpellE>Achebe</span>
the reader is stunned by a hailstorm of facts. I personally wish that the
author recorded new perceptions which may liven up the reader jaded and
fatigued with the old facts. It could have been mentioned that the Renaissance
is not only New Learning but New Ignorance too, that the Augustan <span
class=SpellE>mathematization</span> of language regarded metaphor as a bluff to
be called, that the Romantic Imagination is a snapped kite on the viewless
wings of poesy, that the Age of Tennyson is not one of smugness and complacency
(as vilified so long), that the Bible is more oriental than Western and hence
not a good model, that Bacon is as personal as Lamb because it is said that
from his essays alone we can easily reconstruct his life, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

In the chapter on tragedy and comedy the most significant discussion should be
the mixing of the funerals and the hornpipes as aesthetically satisfying. Dr.

and fiction are not synonyms as they </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

and then discuss if a book like <span class=SpellE><i>Moby</i></span><i> Dick </i>is
a novel at all. Is it not a series of essays? It is not enough to say that it
is a novel and that Melville had a vision. If he had, why is it Melville does
not seem to know his own round in the book? Shall we vote for Ishmael or Ahab
or <span class=SpellE>Moby</span> Dick? Is <span class=SpellE>Moby</span> Dick
God or Devil, Good or Evil or some It transcending good and <span class=GramE>evil.</span>
The very fact that critics mention seven <span class=SpellE>Moby</span> Dicks
posits that Melville’s vision was ‘<span class=SpellE>sithila</span>’ (as we
say) or dim. That is, the reader should not be magisterially told or dictated
to but made to discover things by <span class=GramE>himself</span>. What I have

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Irrespective of the numbers attending its earliest
sessions, the Indian National Congress was a truly national organisation and
its secular character had provided the necessary inspiration for the secular
basis of the Indian Republic. It had, from the beginning, attracted the imagination
of the cream of the Indian <span class=SpellE>intelligentia</span> and the best
minds of the generation were represented in the list of presidents which would
indeed read like a roll call of <span class=SpellE>honour</span> in this
country. The first session of the Congress held in Bombay was attended by 72
delegates, of whom more than 20 were from Madras, and it is supposed to have
cost only some three thousand Rupees. A far cry indeed from <span class=SpellE>Faizpur</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Haripura</span> and <span class=SpellE>Tripuri</span> in the

could be any body’s guess, but even an A. I. C. C. meeting of recent times
would have cost any number of times more than an open session in days of yore. </p>

largely to the multiplicity of languages in this country, Indian readers are
proverbially ignorant of what is happening in the literatures of the <span
class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> regions. Even the better read of them, for no
fault of theirs, are likely to be more familiar with the literary situation in
England or America, Russia or France than that in another linguistic state in
our own country. It will be difficult to find a sizable number of critics or
readers who can claim to know at least a couple of languages besides their own
and English. The last-mentioned language, by some historical accident, lucky or
unlucky according to one’s own way of looking at things, still happens to be the
only effective medium for the intellectual elite, unencumbered by parochial
sentiment and regional prejudice. Quite a few periodicals like <i>Triveni</i>
quarterly, <i>Indian Literature</i>, <i>Quest</i> and <i>Poetry India </i>and <span
class=SpellE><i>Sameeksha</i></span>, besides weeklies like <i>Thought</i>,
have a good record of useful work in this field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

need for an intellectual-literary periodical, exclusively devoted to a critical
understanding of the ever-growing literature available in the different Indian
languages through the medium of English was being felt for quite a long time. <i>Indian
Writing Today</i> edited by Messrs <span class=SpellE>Prabhakar</span> <span
class=SpellE>Padhye</span> and <span class=SpellE>Sadanand</span> <span
class=SpellE>Bhatkal</span> of which few issues have so far seen the light of
day, is almost like a dream came true for the serious reader, specially
interested in contemporary Indian literature. From what one could glean from
the first two issues, it promises to be frank and outspoken, constructive as
well as critical, stimulating and purposeful. Besides the method of survey of
literary trends and biographical notes as a necessary introduction to the
uninitiated reader, it lays the emphasis on textual criticism and local
analysis. The striking feature is that it has a definite point of view and is
quite uninhibited in its intellectual “commitment.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Most of these characteristics could be found in the
inaugural issue which provides a definite point of view on the part of each of
the contributors, besides a variety of useful information. Ten of the major
Indian languages are represented here by <span class=SpellE>practising</span>
writers and perceptive critics who had contributed forthright articles,
refreshingly different from the non-committal, “willing to wound but afraid to
strike” sort of surveys <span class=SpellE>popularised</span> by some of the
popular, safety-first magazines. The editorial has some very thought-provoking
comments on the intellectual situation of the creative writer in India after
freedom. Compared with the writer in pre-Independence India it says, “he is
more self-conscious and more concerned with his destiny as a human being who is
no mere part of a macrocosm,” which is very true! And that is why the situation
is more complex than it was before. </p>

from the well-documented papers read at this seminar is that of the ceaseless
experimentation in progress in many of the languages. The “dialogue” idea seems
to have caught on and indeed it might well gain momentum in due course, so that
the periodical might be able to spearhead a new movement wide enough to cover
creative and critical writing, as the editors hope it would. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and under-rating are likely to be as much a feature of personal assessments in
the field of literature as of stocks and shares in the market-place. The late
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Duvvuri</span> <span class=SpellE>Rami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Reddi</span>, popularly known as ‘<span class=SpellE>Kavikokila</span>’
(and justly too), was one of the most under-rated Telugu poets in the first
half of this century. There should have been more than one reason for this.
While he as a writer of beautiful verse and vigorous prose, he seemed to be a
shy and reserved man in personal life, not given to the shining brass and tinkling
cymbal of self-advertisement, which come naturally to some of the more
successful of contemporary poets. Added to this, he was not a particularly
impressive reader of his own verse, in an age in which versifiers, with a
stentorian voice and a flair for <span class=SpellE>dramatisation</span>,
seemed to get away with their wares while genuine poets without them had often
to take a back seat. His output, quite varied and substantial when one looks
back upon it now, was not perhaps as voluminous as that of some others. And he
never took it into his head to compose a <span class=SpellE><i>Mahakavya</i></span><i>
</i>to perpetuate his name by a <i>magnum opus. </i>But, why should he have to
do it, if he had not the inner compulsion for a work of that kind? His native
genius was presumably best suited to the lyric and the elegy, of which he did
quite a few, of high quality. But the fact remains that, as a poet, he got
rather less than what his real worth due just as many others seem to have got
rather more than what should have been, the due of their real worth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

years after the poet’s death (in 1947 while yet in his early fifties), the
author of the present volume had done his very best to give the reader a vivid
and reliable account of his life, along with a fairly balanced, though
obviously <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>, assessment of his many-sided
achievement. In handling this project, which must have been largely a <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> of love, the author had put in a good deal of
strenuous homework, though he knows enough of the art of writing to be able to
wear his learning lightly. The result is an extremely well-documented book that
draws from all the available sources including the poet’s own letters, diaries
and note-books</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

files of defunct periodicals and the books of other writers. With all that, it
remains eminently readable. The material is used with discretion and <span
class=SpellE>organised</span> according to a <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
method-familiar to the readers of modern literary biographies in the English
language. The chapter arrangement and the appending of footnotes is
intelligently done and the bibliography and index are quite useful. It would be
no exaggeration to say that this is possibly the first modern biography of its
kind, of a Telugu poet in the Telugu language. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

scientific method adopted by the author is in refreshing contrast to the
mechanical compilation of opinions and mass accumulation of facts so common
with the traditional biographies. The early chapters are devoted to a
description of the peasant background, against which the personality of the
poet had developed along the lines of a rational individuality that was
sensitive enough to respond to the mystic and imponderable values of a dream
life in which fancy and imagination must have had an equal play. While <span
class=SpellE><i>Krisheevaludu</i></span><i> </i>(The Ploughman) and <span
class=SpellE><i>Paanasaala</i></span><i> </i>(Telugu rendering of the <span

and <span class=SpellE><i>Gulistan</i></span><i> </i>remain the chief title to
his fame in the public mind, there are many other works of equal, or even
greater merit, which the author examines at length. Among them could be
mentioned the long poem <span class=SpellE><i>Nalajaaramma</i></span><i>, <span
class=SpellE>Karshaka</span> <span class=SpellE>Vilaasamu</span> </i>(play–unpublished),
<span class=SpellE><i>Vanakumari</i></span><i>, <span class=SpellE>Palitakesamu</span>
</i>etc. In fact, the author would like to give a higher place to some of the
scattered lyrics <i>(<span class=SpellE>Khandakavyas</span>), </i>written at a </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>comparatively
mature stage in the poet’s literary career, and quotes chapter and verse to
prove his point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he was no mere poet alone–not a bookish one, at all, with a one-track mind–but
a many-sided personality equally interested in the intricacies of a radio
receiver set and in the metaphysics of Sufi mysticism, in the romance of
languages (he learned German, French, besides Bengali and Persian, on his own)
and the adventure of literature, in the mechanics of practical farming and the
exciting technique of film-production, is eloquently brought home to the
reader. But the author seems to have been carried away too far by his own<i> </i>enthusiasm
about the poet’s versatility to compare him (casually though) with Leonardo <span

Telugu, as in all the other languages the world over, infant mortality has
become endemic to little magazines and literary periodicals. (Such world
languages as English and French are no exception to this pernicious law of
nature where special care by way of subsidy is not forthcoming.) But it does
not argue the case for total contraception, as the<i> </i>population problem
does not resent itself in this field in forms so familiar to us elsewhere. The
urgent need would rather seem to be in the direction of a concerted drive for
more effective maternity and child-welfare measures. He would be a brave man
indeed who would now launch a serious literary periodical on the perilous seas
of an uncertain readership, where the sharks of sex and crime journals and the
whales of the ‘popular’ illustrated weeklies have almost an unchallenged
monopoly all that they survey. The<i> </i>editor and the publisher of the new<i>

(It did act like a vigorous tonic on the present reviewer, who finds most of
the other stuff near at hand so diluted and insipid where it is not too
palpably and sickeningly saccharine.) The fictional treatment of a single,

is easy enough to trot out wisecracks by the score in a bid to show that men of
letters have been distrustful of women. Here, for instance, is a choice
bouquet, if you really care for such a thing: Men are women’s playthings; women
are the devil’s. A woman’s counsel brought us first to woe. Frailty! thy name
is woman. Women, asses and nuts, require strong hands (Our own Tulasidas has
been so much sinned against). When we speed to the the devil’s house, woman
takes the lead by a thousand steps. If you would make a pair of good shoes,
take for the sole the tongue of a woman; it never wears out. A woman’s preaching
is like a dog’s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well, but you are

enough of this. On my own I would not, in all conscience, have gone on like
this in this International Women’s Year but quotations are a different
proposition. My purpose, moreover is to caution the unwary not to take these
utterances without a generous pinch of salt for the following reasons: men
often come out with a provocative impromptu remark to startle those around
them; a personal pique may sometimes be the animating power at work; and,
finally, an author may be quoted out of context. A dramatic speech, as every
Macaulay’s schoolboy knows, does not necessarily reflect the dramatist’s view.

disposed of the negative, let me now proceed to the positive aspect of the
matter to demonstrate, in other words, that writers of weight and substance
have tended to throw in their weight on the side of women. This, of course,
they have done according to their lights, sometimes bright, sometimes dim. The
women’s Lib, as we know it to day, has not all of a sudden come out full-blown
like Jupiter from Minerva’s head. Human consciousness has been stirred and
influenced for generations before it got to the point from where the movement
could be launched. Historical perspective demands that it be related to its
obscure beginnings; its hazy anticipations through the continuum of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Greeks are often accused of treating women no better than chattel. Judged by
the criteria of mid-twentieth century, they will surely be found wanting (and
so shall be we, probably, in our turn by posterity). Plato’s proposal for the
community of wives need not, however be placed in a denigrative context; it
will perhaps bear a better and more consistent interpretation in terms of
cugenics. For Socrates it is immaterial that women bear and men beget children
so far as the education of each is concerned. “The gifts of nature are alike
diffused in both;” therefore it makes little sense to differentiate between
their pursuits. When, of course, it comes to defining their participation in
the toils of war and the defence of the country, Socrates recommends the
assignment of lighter labours to women. Incidentally, the trials and
tribulations of domesticity which a woman is supposed to undergo also call for
the greatest courage. As Media in Euripides’ play puts it: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Socrates, however, cannot get past the ancient prejudice
that the woman has some inherent biological handicaps and limitations. It is
not until recently that the battle against sexism has been carried the whole
hog to establish that what has been traditionally designated as the weaker sex
can supply us with first rate pioneers, adventurers, fighters and aeronauts.
Nevertheless, one fact stands out distinct and indisputable: the Greek poets
and philosophers were very far from desiring their women folk to be cooped up
in their warren-like homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
women are not shown taking part in actual warfare, nor are they exempt from its
dire and disastrous consequences; actually, they have to bear the most
excruciating brunt of the aftermath. Euripides in his tragedy <i>The Trojan
Women </i>describes that after the ten-year war is over, women suffer the worst
depredations. An easy corollary from this to draw is since women are not spared
indignity and humiliation of the worst sort, they would be perfectly justified
in getting involved in momentous issues of national life. That a woman is not
entirely a stay-at-home creature, that she can have a confrontation with the
state and all the power that it symbolizes, is vividly dramatized by Sophocles
in his <i>Antigone</i>. King Creon allows Oedipus’s on Eteocles, who had
defended <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Thebes</st1:place></st1:City>,
to be buried but he denies to the second son Polyneices, who had attacked the
city, the funeral rights that meant so much to the Greeks. Antigone is
determined that he shall be decently buried. Divine laws, she declares, are
internalized in her conscience against which the mandate of the king is
absolutely powerless. In Antigone Sophocles has projected an individual of firm
resolve defying the law, free from any vestiges of a woman’s weakness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Renaissance
in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> was a sharp reaction to the mediaeval
outlook on women. * This is best exemplified by the Italian poet Dante
narrating how his entry into the <st1:place w:st="on">Paradise</st1:place> is
accompanied by his vision of Beatrice. Similarly, Shakespeare recognizes the
role of woman, both as mother and wife, in <i>Coriolanus</i>. When all efforts
prove unavailing, the Romans in sheer desperation turn to Volumnia and Virgilia
and persuade them to go and to beg of the incensed general poised for attack
not to destroy <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rome</st1:place></st1:City>.
And this works. It is essentially a tribute to the power of womanhood. In <i>Julius
Caesar </i>Portia is shown successfully arguing with her husband Brutus that
she has a right to be admitted to his secrets, whatever their nature. This
elevation of women to the status of a comrade achieves its fullest flowering in
Shakespeare’s comedies. In them we find a world not so much dominated as made
radiant by the heroines, by Rosalind, Olivia, Beatrice, Portia and others of
their sisterhood. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Orlando</st1:place></st1:City>
most certainly meets more than his match when he is admonished by that very
Rosalind over whom he is breaking his heart. With her grasp never relaxed on
herself, she castigates his sentimentality–a curious instance of the turning of
the tables. There is a man who haunts the forest that abuses our young plants
with carving “Rosalind” on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies
on brambles; all, for sooth, deifying the name of Rosalind: if I could meet
that fancy-monger I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
quotidion of love upon him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
concept of women’s emancipation, it will have to be ruefully admitted, received
a set-back among some writers of the Romantic and the Victorian era. To be
afflicted with the desire of the moth for the star is, without doubt, to
idealize the woman out of a flesh-and-blood reality, to exile her from a
work-a-day world. The chivalric tradition of Sir Walter Scott denuded her of
all vitality by reducing her to a more stereotype: abrittle, shy and
languishing female waiting to be supported like an ivy by a strong oak tree. Tennyson
mocked at her attempt to achieve an equal status with men in <i>The Princess. </i>Ruskin
tried to beguile her by vain and inane rhetoric: “Wherever a true wife comes,
this home is always round her. The stars only may be over her head; the
glow-worm in the nightcold grass may be the only fire at her foot; but home is
yet wherever she is.” But this back-sliding was to some extent countered by the
Brontes. Catherine in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><i>Wuthering</i></st1:PlaceName><i>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Heights</st1:PlaceType></i></st1:place><i> </i>asserts
her absolute equality with Heathcliff. Jane Eyre refuses to be treated
condescendingly by the wealthy <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rochester</st1:place></st1:City>.
She comes back to him when he is maimed and blinded and needs help. The typical
Bronte heroine stands on her own feet, braving all the stresses and strains of
a rough world and making her own living. Nothing thrills her more than the
prospect of economic independence; she longs to install herself in a seminary
of her own. The modern working woman is right there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

woman is not a sweet song-bird in a gilded cage; she is very much a creature of
the earth, earthy–by obscuring this fact men had managed to wrap her up in a
cocoon of illusion. The Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen set himself to
destroying it. When he causes Nora Hialmer in <i>A Doll’s House </i>to walk out
in protest against her husband’s treatment, the slamming of the down-stairs
door was heard around the world. Its obverse picture is presented in <i>Ghosts </i>where
Ibsen shows the outcome of stifling one’s vital impulses for the sake of dead
conformity. Through Mrs. Alving’s empty and frustrated life, he wants to
emphasize the need on the part of a woman never to submit to obsolete social
usages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
Bernard Shaw, continuing with Ibsen’s feminist crusade, takes delight in
puncturing the inflated male ego in <i>Candida. </i>The woman in the play
ultimately decides to stand by her husband in preference to her poet-lover
because the former, being the weaker of the two, needs her more. In <i>You
Never can Tell </i>and some other plays he brings out the supremacy of the
woman as the instrument of life-force. It is true that in insisting on woman’s
parity with, if not superiority to man, Shaw has deglamourized the woman. But
that is as it should be. The modern woman cannot in all fairness want incense
to be burnt at her altar even as she presses her claim to rub shoulders with men.
For this, naturally, she has to come off her lofty pedestal. Shaw seems to be
saying, in effect, that she cannot eat the cake and have it too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the foregoing, it would appear that barring a few exceptions (and the rich
tapestry of literature is woven of various strands) sensitive and perceptive
writers have all along been preparing the way for women’s emancipation. There
is hardly any significant facet of women’s lib which has not figured in their
works. They have been urging that discrimination based on sex should go, that
different pursuits and educational and career opportunities should be thrown
open to them. They should be free to operate both within and outside home.
Their role vis-a-vis the state as well as the family has been defined without
any prejudice to their sex. The random sampling of literary evidence that I
have made available shows how the most dynamic, and energetic minds have
responded to the perennial woman question. If the progress has not been as fast
as one would desire, the reason seems to be that the masses take a lot of time
in being wakened from their sloth, apathy, superstition and obscurantism. But
for the writers, the progress that we witness today would not have been there
for the din and dust of battle raised by the activists and agitators soon die
away whereas the word alone endures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although,
as I have said above, most of the significant facets of the Liberation Movement
can be traced in literary works, implying their author’s approval, support for
the extremist tendencies of the militant feminists is, however, hard to come by
Rejection of the family, repudiation of the biological function of harbouring
the seed, sheltering the fetus and bringing forth the child or renouncement of
sexual pleasure which requires the involvement of a male are popular slogans
and shibolleths of the female chauvinists–they have seldom, if ever, found
articulation in the kind of literature that I have been drawing upon. Of course
they bulk large in propagandistic or doctrinaire writings. A character like
Media may inveigh against giving birth to children, or a wife may take pleasure
in deliberately producing a castrating effect on her husband in the nightmarish
world of Strindberg. Such attitudes are, however, shown to be pathological and
abnormal. That a large proportion among women themselves would not subscribe to
these new-fangled notions is a clear vindication of the sanity and the good
sense of the writers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

culmination point of this movement cannot but be beyond the narrow confines of
the “battle of the sexes.” “The cause of women’s liberation,” it has been
rightly observed, “is now joined in the minds of many of its protagonists with
the cause of the whole human race.” One has only to point to such characters as
Mrs. Ramsay in Virginia Woolf’s <i>To The Lighthouse </i>and to Mrs. Moore and
Mrs. Ruth Wilcox in E. M. Forster’s <i>A Passage to India </i>and <i>Hoards End
</i>to show that writers of rich sensibility see in woman not only the
potentiality and strength of fighting for her own rights but also the
intuition, delicacy and comprehension, carrying her tremendous capacity of
conservation beyond her home out into the big world. Writers like Woolf and
Forster are visualizing for the woman, need from domestic chores, petty
tyrannies and others h</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

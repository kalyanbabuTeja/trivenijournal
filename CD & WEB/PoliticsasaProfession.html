<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel&quot; said the eminent Doctor well-known for his commonsense and his victories in wordy warfare. The time has come when the words of that esteemed gentlemen might appear true. This is just the minute when a loud protest should be made against such a degeneration of politics. The disappointed schoolboy, a dismissed public servant, nobodies in various professions, runaways from home and others of a kindred nature, all take to the field of politics, and get a smattering knowledge of all subjects, from the League of Nations to the Indian village panchayat, from monarchy to socialism, from craft-guilds to trade-unionism and pose themselves as politicians. In fact their presumption is so great today that they do not possess any knowledge in any subject. The result is not far to seek; the high level of politics is on the decrease, the moral tone is vanishing, sobriety has given place to mere enthusiasm, facts have been replaced by fiction, responsibility by indifference, and equipment by superficiality. Today the views of politicians are treated with discourtesy as those of an agitator, interested partisan, and not received with the regard that is due to a student of politics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a passing phase of political life in all countries. There are upheavals everywhere, shibboleths are any number, parties multiply every second, steady politics are not available anywhere. India shares the fate with other countries. This leads to a searching of our hearts. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing any student of politics should concede as a common ground is that it is a game and a task which demands persons who really know and try to know fully what they are about. Off-hand amateurishness would not do but works considerable havoc. Secondly, specialisation in some branch of politics is necessary. A novice with no aptitude and taste for any aspect of political life but with only an appetite to enjoy the amenities and glories of the Legislatures, is a menace to society and an obstacle to progress. Again every politician worth the name should have a programme chalked out in his particular branch and should be able to evolve schemes then and there. He should be a sufficient answer to the evasions of the Treasury benches and should be able to give them hard knocks when opportunity occurs. I can never believe in the existence–though it is possible in exceptional cases, –of ‘all-round’ politicians. It may be stated in praise of individuals, but the facts are always otherwise. Persons of Sir Basil Blackett's and Gokhale's type as financiers and financial critics, India is yet to see. Gandhiji's mastery of Overseas problems and solutions is yet to be copied and imitated by any politician of modern times. More than all, politicians require considerable powers of expression, a capacity to debate and retort. Humanly impossible it is for anybody to master all aspects of politics; definite fields should be chosen and definite persons should study before they come out, and study as they continue in the political arena, current political problems. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these imply division of labour in political life and a probation of study <I>before entry </I>and constant study and active division of labour in the political arena <I>after </I>entry. This involves a question of mutual understanding, nation-wide arrangement, why, in fact, it implies training persons for a certain aspect in a political career. Political life is prefaced by a tuition, a probation and deliberate study leading to practical politics. It shall not be the chance of getting into the Legislature by the door of nomination or stumbling into it by the wide door of tipping or bidding the topmost in mass elections. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, for active political life–in the sense of being prominent in current politics–only a few are fit, but a great many are necessary to study and advise the great ones on the field with facts and figures. With great respect to our legislators, it should be said though it is not complimentary to them, very few care to study and much less educate their electorate on the threatening proposals for reforms either in the Assembly, Council of State or Local Legislatures. To take one instance, how many of our legislators understood the implications of the Reserve Bank Bill and how many cared to educate their electorate on the matter and obtain its verdict? There are certain reforms on which the electorate had not expressed itself at any time and the candidates are in duty bound to take note of the fact before they air their. individual views. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibilities of politicians are indeed great. In fact they are proportionate to the glory they enjoy and they ought to bear the burden manfully. It means considerable time, energy and study. Can all these be had honorarily? No, certainly not. The time has come when politicians ought to be able to spare all their time and energy for the country's cause and her intricate problems, and people should be glad to shoulder their expenses and maintain them out of public funds. I mean, without the least semblance of disrespect or insinuation that may attach to the expression, we should evolve a set of ‘professional politicians’ who are maintained by the public and whose only avocation is the study of politics–current and theoretical. They ought to be divided into two classes, students on study, students on field. Elder politicians and statesmen should be able to choose their own potential disciples and send them for study and train them. This involves a Public Purposes Fund, a School of Politics and its necessary concomitants. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our great men, Gokhale and Lajpat Rai, have clearly anticipated the necessity for professional politicians, and have sent out into Indian politics some at least who can boast of real study, a probation, and what may be called a political training. A Joshi on Labour problems, a Kunzru or Vaze on the ‘Indians Abroad’ question, a Kale on Economics, a Devadhar on social reform legislation, are any day far superior to the best among other politicians who begin and study politics as and after they enter. The necessity for the starting of political schools in several parts of the country and the training of the workers, is too great and time should not be lost any further. It is one of the essentials for the solid political reconstruction under any kind of government. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The party system of government has come to stay. It will last till it is erased: why it may continue under all types of government. Parties imply excellent spokesmen, trained debaters, and what is more, resourceful students of politics on all subjects. The party leader should be bulwarked with points on particular subjects by the particular student well-up in the line. He should be able to supply the powder for the shot. Else, the effectiveness of the party system is lost. Allocation of political responsibility within the party is now necessary. Whether it is on the side of the oppositionists or on the Treasury bench, division of study and work is imperative for working effectively any political institution. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these lead to a statement that a political career is as serious as the life of an individual. Nay more. It sometimes involves the life of a nation. A bad statesman, an unthinking politician, and an inexperienced and ill-read legislator are the greatest curses for a nation. They always lead it to disaster. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indian politics as it is has its particular disadvantages besides those above-stated general difficulties. My earnest appeal to all parties in Indian and Local Legislatures–even out of them, is to think of political life as a serious matter, mobilise their forces, divide their responsibilities of study and work among themselves, and be a solid phalanx with figures and facts when any question crops up. This is my appeal to the Swarajists, Independents, Justicites, Nationalists etc. Every party has its own creed. Why should it not effectively work itself out with a real political grounding and probation? Can they not avoid a meaningless display of false oratory on nothing, or a series of speeches with no substance? Cannot effective party system be worked with the man on the subject making a statement on behalf of the party, and the party like one man supporting it? Why unnecessary flamboyant repetitions to no purpose, when all are conscious they do not add to the already full statement of the expert in the subject? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is really time that all our parties think seriously of ear-marking a good portion of their party fund for the running of a Political School based upon its creed and principles; to select, maintain, and train a band of real students of politics and coach them for active political life subsequently. They should be able to have a good library of their own. If parties could agree among themselves, the training on common subjects may be done conjointly and much time and duplication of expenditure can be saved. It is sincerely hoped that institutions or ‘Ashramams’ like the Servants of India Society and the Tilak School of Politics will spring up in important centres and the above suggestions adopted. It is for the Indian National Congress, the All-India Liberal Federation, the Indian Non-Brahman Congress, the Swarajist, Independent, Nationalist, and Justice parties (and other parties) to take these suggestions and consider them seriously and try to put them .into practice as early as possible. If done, the time will have arrived when we can say: &quot;Real Politics is come; amateurish politics is dead.&quot;</P><P ALIGN="center"><A HREF="CONTENTSmay1929.htm"><IMG SRC="Image245.jpg" BORDER=0 WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=48></A></P></BODY>

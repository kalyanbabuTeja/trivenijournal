Rau had not done anything but discover Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span>
<span class=SpellE>Iyer’s</span> genius, which for ten years kept going the
most astonishing column that ever figured in a weekly newspaper, he would have
deserved well of posterity. Was it not Prof. <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span>
modest boast that the discovery of the genius of <span class=SpellE>Ramanujam</span>
was the greatest satisfaction that he derived from his pursuit of mathematics?
From the time the first issue of <span class=SpellE>Khasa</span> <span
class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rau’s <span class=SpellE><i>Swatantra</i></span><i> </i>appeared,
carrying “<span class=SpellE>Vighneswara’s</span>” column, under the unassuming
but intriguing title SOTTO VOCE, it was clear that here was something which was
an event in Indian journalism. Week after week for ten continuous years, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyer</span> wrote for the <span
class=SpellE><i>Swatantra</i></span><i> </i>scintillating pieces, replete with
the lore of ages, on a myriad themes, ranging from the most commonplace to the
most abstruse, all handled with the masterly ease of a superb craftsman and all
pregnant with perennial significance. It is this quality that has made <span

habitation and a name, the publishers have done a great service not only to the
numerous readers of “<span class=SpellE>Vighneswara</span>” who would like to
keep his writings in handy form, but also to countless others to whom he can be
a source of perpetual discovery and delight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
years from 1946 to 1952. The present volume covers a period of 45 months from
August 1952 to April 1956. As in the case of the two<i> </i>earlier volumes,
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyer</span> has contributed
a Preface to the present volume which seeks to provide, as it were, the
connecting thread and the philosophy that suffuses most of the articles written
in this period. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyer</span>
is an unrepentant liberal in the broadest sense of the term, who believes that
freedom is the highest good and that a society which has not learnt how to
conserve its traditional values is unlikely to cherish liberty as an end in
itself. It is this amalgam of conservatism and true liberalism which endows all
that he writes with a unique appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
title of the present volume, as well as the preface, might suggest that the
main pre-occupation of the articles brought together here is with Congress
Socialism as it evolved from the <span class=SpellE>Avadi</span> session of the
Congress. This would be a very misleading inference; because here we have, as
in the earlier volumes, writings on an amazing variety of subjects ranging from
the ancestry of <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>, with which the volume opens,
to an allegorical piece entitled <span class=SpellE><i>Satya</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Yagna</span> </i>with which the volume ends. In between, we have
pieces on diverse topics–education, art, music, politics and personalities–each
of which is illumined by a wisdom that <span class=SpellE>passeth</span>

Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyer’s</span> <span
class=SpellE>encyclopaedic</span> scholarship is apparent on every page, what
is really characteristic about these articles is the way in which he can lift
you from the commonplace to the sublime by a single phrase. For instance,
writing on a recital of Indian folk dances in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, he concludes: “In all folk art the
referent, proximate or remote, is God, whom our secularists would lock up in
their little cupboard. How do you hope to get at Beauty, by-passing the <i>Brahman
</i>that is <span class=SpellE><i>Satyam</i></span><i>, <span class=SpellE>Sivam</span>,

<span class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyer</span> is at his
best when he is applying a moral drawn from ancient or recent history or some
episode in the classics of the East or the West to the current situation. To
give but one example, in the brilliant piece on “Secularism’s Current <span
class=SpellE>Favourite</span>”, he writes: “<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the past has known
monarchs who were spectacular converts to a faith other than their fathers’, as
well as those who set forth as propagators of new creeds. We had <span
class=SpellE>Asoka</span> and <span class=SpellE>Vishnuvardhana</span> as well
as <span class=SpellE>Akbar</span> with his Din-<span class=SpellE>liahi</span>.
The Congress rulers of Independent India have made yet another precedent. Their
proclaimed allegiance is to Secularism. In practice, Secularism has shown
itself as intolerant and arbitrary as any other State religion of the past, but
with a significant difference. The excesses of those crusading faiths proceeded
from a generous warmth of emotion; this new religion of Secularism has ice
water in its veins…..Hinduism is being bleached and <span class=SpellE>sterilised</span>
of such unfashionable ideas as the living of life as a sacrament, the
acceptance of pious obligations and the sacredness of the marital tie. The
ambition of our mentors is to make us as unlike ourselves as possible.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

temptation to quote from a book which is replete with pregnant passages, pithy
epigrams and devastating debunking of the little tin-gods dressed in brief
authority, is well-nigh irresistible. But reasons of space forbid me from
indulging in this luxury. All that I can say is that for any one who wishes to
get the reactions of one of the wisest minds of our generation to the changing
scene in <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> during the
years since <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>,
there cannot be a better book than “<span class=SpellE>Vighneswara’s</span>”
volume. My only regret is that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> <span
class=SpellE>Iyer</span> has not given us a complete book like <span
class=SpellE>Tocqueville’s</span> “Democracy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>” which would serve as a
seminal classic on the Congress rulers’ blundering experiments in
pseudo-democratic socialism. Only a mind, as steeped as his in the wisdom of
the Indian <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span>, and a scholarship as wide-ranging
as his, can attempt that comprehensive critique of the developments of the past
15 years which the present generation so badly needs before the country goes
down the <span class=SpellE>Gadarene</span> slope.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

south of India, the bulk of which was covered by the composite province of
Madras, did at no stage lag behind the rest of the country in the national
struggle but the political enthusiasm of its people was always marked by a
sense of restraint and a balanced view of men and things. No small measure of
this informed patriotism was due to the work of organs of enlightened public
opinion like <i>The Hindu </i>of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
which has been going strong, without having to lower its standard, for the last
seven to eight decades. But, the transformation of a struggling political
news-sheet into a steady and prosperous newspaper was wrought by the almost
unaided <span class=SpellE>labours</span> of the late Mr. <span class=SpellE>Kasturi</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ranga</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> in the early

was indeed a strange conspiracy of fortuitous circumstances that drew <span
class=SpellE>Kasturi</span> <span class=SpellE>Ranga</span> <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>
into journalism, when it was considered neither a safe nor a profitable
occupation for anyone who wanted to go far in life. Almost every promising
young man of the day used to choose Government service or Law for his
profession. <span class=SpellE>Kasturi</span> <span class=SpellE>Ranga</span> <span
class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> himself did actually prefer the latter and, after
devilling in the crowded chambers of a giant of the <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>
bar, set up practice in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Coimbatore</span></st1:place></st1:City> where he did fairly
well in the profession and in public service. After winning his spurs, he
returned to the metropolis where his elder brother (<span class=SpellE>Srinivasaraghava</span>
<span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>, who later became <span class=SpellE>Dewan</span>
of Baroda) was high up in the official hierarchy. But it soon became clear that
his heart was not in the practice of law and he was not satisfied with mere
money-making, which then as now, is apt to be invested with the air of a sacred
mystique, by those who swear by personal security and prefer to take politics
as a profitable hobby, taking care not to overstep the bounds of safety. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

live dangerously when he had to do it to promote the basic ideals in which he
believed. He was a staunch nationalist, and an ardent admirer and close friend
of <span class=SpellE>Tilak</span>, whose politics were after his very heart.
Like his guru, he firmly believed that the political liberation of the country
needed not to wait for the social advancement of its people. In fact the former
might help the latter a great deal. He can be said to have been a little ahead
of many of his local contemporaries in the unequivocal <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>
of his political stand as a <span class=SpellE>wholehogger</span>. It is
interesting to note that unlike some bright young men of the succeeding,
generations whose Western culture is but skin deep, he had drunk deep at the
springs of British liberalism and English literature and was fond of quoting
Burke and Bright, Mill and Morley to reinforce his argument. In matters
religious and social, he was an enlightened conservative, who observed all the
forms of ceremony, without being opposed to intelligent reform, as, for
instance, in the measure which sought to raise the age of consent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<span class=SpellE>Gita</span> hardly needs an introduction to any one, but it
certainly needs an induction into everyone, of the wisdom enshrined in it.
Universal in its appeal, it has a special appeal to every man, according to his
own experience and enlightenment. Wisdom is eternal and, therefore, the <span
class=SpellE>Gita</span> is a book for all time. How to understand it, how to
assimilate it and then how to apply it in life in this ever changing world–that
is indeed worth the enquiry. The author has dwelt at some length in particular
on two main aspects in the <span class=SpellE>Gita</span>, viz., (1) Dharma,
(2) <span class=SpellE>Kshetra</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kshetrajna</span>.
He has specially referred to the teaching rendered by Sri <span class=SpellE>Sankaracharya</span>,
a greater genius than whom the modern world has not produced. He <span
class=SpellE>emphasises</span> that the <span class=SpellE>Gita</span> not
merely affords the bedrock of Faith: it also affords the bed of comfort and
consolation. It is necessary to understand the whole purpose of the Creator in
revealing Himself in this great creation. He dwells in every one. Therefore, <span
class=GramE>a knowledge</span> of the self necessarily leads to the knowledge
of the Dweller in the self. This is <span class=SpellE>Vidya</span> which
should replace <span class=SpellE>Avidya</span>. The author has pinpointed the
site where the conflict arose, the situation in which it arose and the station
and status in life of the one representative of man for whom it arose–<span
class=SpellE>Arjuna</span>. The author draws special attention to the turmoil
of <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span> which converted his original determination
into despair and ambition into frustration. <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span>
was helped to regain himself by the Lord who taught <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span>
how much he owed it to himself and to the world to discharge his duty unmindful
of the results, as by doing so he would be fulfilling God’s purpose. As Sri <span
class=SpellE>Sankara</span> pointed out, it is the state of confusion and
indecision that rendered <span class=SpellE>Arjuna</span> inactive and that was
because of <span class=SpellE>Avidya</span>. When once wisdom dawned on him, he
was able to see with perfect clarity what his duty was under the circumstances
and also that God fulfils Himself in man. The author points out that the <span
class=SpellE>Gita</span> does not abhor worldly activity. Man has to attain the
four <span class=SpellE>purusharthas</span>–Dharma, <span class=SpellE>Artha</span>,
<st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Kama</span></st1:place>, <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Moksha</span></span>. The path should be <span
class=SpellE>Dharmic</span>. The author dwells at some length on the <span
class=SpellE>Sthitaprajna</span>–the steadfast one. Among the three paths of
Karma, <span class=SpellE>Jnana</span> and <span class=SpellE>Bhakti</span>,
Sri <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span> <span class=SpellE>emphasises</span> <span
class=SpellE>Jnana</span>. It is <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> that all
of them lead to the same goal–<span class=SpellE>Moksha</span>. According to
Sri <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span>, both Karma and <span class=SpellE>Bhakti</span>
lead to <span class=SpellE>Jnana</span>, and knowledge of Brahman <span
class=SpellE>automically</span> imports all worthwhile knowledge. It is this
unity of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nara</st1:place></st1:City>
and <span class=SpellE>Narayana</span>, <span class=SpellE>Jivatman</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Paramatman</span>, <span class=SpellE>Aham</span> and Brahma, that
forms the essence of the <span class=SpellE>Advaita</span> Philosophy of Sri <span
class=SpellE>Sankara</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

second part of the book is devoted to <span class=SpellE>Kshetra</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Kshetrajna</span>. The author deals with culture in general and
Indian culture in particular. Culture is born of cultivation (<span
class=SpellE>Vyavasaya</span>), of the process of <span class=SpellE>realisation</span>
of the oneness of all creation, not merely in its origin but also in its goal–<span
class=SpellE>Moksha</span>. The body, the mind, and the soul, (tripod) have to
be attuned and surrendered to the Divine. The author exhorts that one should
repeatedly study and <span class=SpellE>practise</span> the principles
adumbrated in the <span class=SpellE>Gita</span> because the <span
class=SpellE>Gita</span> lays down the way of leading a <span class=SpellE>Dharmic</span>
life in this world itself and the attainment of <span class=SpellE>Moksha</span>
through this body itself. <span class=SpellE>Kshetra</span> is the body and <span
class=SpellE>Kshetrajna</span> is the self or the soul which dwells in the
body. The author enters into the inner meaning of the very first <span
class=SpellE>sloka</span> of the <span class=SpellE>Gita</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Kshetra</span> is the body: <span class=SpellE><i>Kurukshetra</i></span><i>
</i>is the battle-field of life: <span class=SpellE>Pandavas</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Kauravas</span> represent knowledge and non-knowledge. As Dharma
has to be established in this life and through this body, the conflict between
knowledge and non-knowledge must arise and end up in victory for knowledge.
Self-surrender is interpreted as the merger of the one in the All. As the
author rightly points out the whole <span class=SpellE>Gita</span> teaches <span
class=SpellE>Adhyatma</span>–knowledge of the self. It may rightly be said that
the first and last <span class=SpellE>slokas</span> of the <span class=SpellE>Gita</span>
understood in their true significance contain the quintessence of the <span
class=SpellE>Gita</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

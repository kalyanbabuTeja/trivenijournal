today. He was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>afraid of the result but he also hoped that
somehow luck would smile on him. The telephone was, however, dead at the other
end. He tried to wring them up again and again but there was no response.
Perhaps their line was out. In spite of his eagerness however, he gave a sigh of
relief. He was trying hard to keep calm. The report could be either way. He
knew that they would be sending it by post but he was not prepared to wait
another day. He was full of anxious anticipation and could think of nothing
else. He therefore decided to go to the institute and get the report himself.
Taking two hours off, he left his office in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a hurry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the usual dull and drab piece of khaki paper suggesting sawdust. But it was
the report. As he saw it his heart left a beat or two. The printed form
contained nothing more than <span class=GramE>the</span> name of the patient,
Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span> <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span>
Gokhale, and the words “Rabbit test–Positive”. He was all in a flutter. That
one word ‘positive’ told him that at long last he would be a father. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

twelve long years but had no issue. <span class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span> had
irregular periods. As she missed them now and then she hoped fondly, but
nothing happened. Both of them had now begun to lose all hope. This time,
however, Dr. Gore found reason to believe that there was something. He
therefore got the rabbit test made. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> found himself in an
exhilarating mood. It would be a great event indeed! Two months had already
passed. Seven months hence the child would be born and fill their life with
joy. My God! What a tremendous thing! Tears of thankfulness came to his eyes.
He was overwhelmed with a sense of <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>. But
soon he was also full of melting pity for his dear wife. She would have to bear
the ordeal. Yet she would be so glad and happy. <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span>
again thought of God and His greatness. And strangely enough he began to doubt.
He thought, <span class=GramE>In</span>’ this stupendous universe with the sun,
the moon and countless stars, the earth is but a little thing like a playing
marble. Can the Great God have anything to do with this little earth and the
life on it? Is He concerned in any way with mere man and his pin-head joys and
sorrows?’ <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> was shaken by these staggering
thoughts. He shut up his doubting mind and prayed ‘Oh God! Forgive me. I shall
not doubt any more.’ His fervent prayer again brought tears to his eyes. But no
one saw them. There were only a few people–mostly the staff–and they were all
busy with their routine jobs. </p>

he passed his eyes fell on a roadside tap which, having burst, sent up water in
a tiny fountain; but none noticed it. The wet road showed a pattern of
miniature rainbows where motor-oil had dropped but the people just walked on
it. On an external window-sill there were blooming roses on which dirty water
dropped from the balcony above which was being washed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was about four by the time <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> returned to his
office. A circular was lying prominently on his table in the midst of other
papers. A pensioner had expired and a condolence meeting was called at six. The
circular was full of initials in blue, black, red, green and all. Perhaps they
took any pen or pencil that came to hand and scribbled. The pensioner’s death
was nothing, and the meeting was less than that–a mere formality. <span
class=SpellE>Madhav</span> too put his initials on the paper and thought…oh! <span

Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raje</span>, the typist, approached him with a broad
smile. <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> said, “Hello! How’s it that you’re

officers’ cadre but he talked with the staff in a friendly way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Yes Sir, I’ve come to invite you all to my wedding.
It’s on Sunday next. Please do come.” He handed the invitation card to <span

to do. </p>

quietly tore them away. He then saw how Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raje</span>,
bubbling over with enthusiasm, was going round the office and giving the
wedding cards to all and sundry, and how they took them in a casual way with a
formal smile and a few words signifying nothing. <span class=GramE>“How
strange!”</span> <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> thought, “Here am I full of
joy for the coming child. There an old man is dead and gone leaving his family
in bereavement. And now this one is busy preparing for his wedding. Birth,
death, and marriage! These are all-important events in life but only to the
persons concerned. To others they are just casual happenings. People of course
do their part on such occasions, wearing an appropriate amount of concern on
their faces. But inwardly they are not concerned at all.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

condolence meeting lasted only ten minutes. The usual resolution, perhaps
copied from the old files, was passed unanimously. Nobody thought of making a
speech. They were eager to go as soon as possible. So they stood in silence for
two long minutes and then dispersed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

passed it now he had half a mind to see the doctor and show him the report. But
before he could decide he crossed over to the road leading to <span

bewilderment you simply said ‘Yes’. After all these years I can still hear the

chores. <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span>, pretending to help her, took every
opportunity of planting kisses on her unawares and holding her in his arms when
least expected. He behaved like a newly-wed doting husband. She too gave him
eager response as never before. They spent most of their spare time together.
They grew so fond of each other that they developed a calm and <span

stayed with her. But how long could the mother stay? She too had a home from

class=SpellE>Madhav</span> had very friendly relations with the doctor and his
family. Mrs. Gore enquired after <span class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span> every
other day. The doctor could be called in at any hour. He had promised to take <span
class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span> to the maternity home in his own car when the
time came. She was all the while under his treatment. The doctor and his wife
took every care to see that all went well with <span class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span>.
When he examined her he knew her physical condition all right. But how could he
know what mixed feelings filled her heart? Her fond hopes and anxious fears,
her changing moods, all these he could guess only faintly. However, he bucked
her up with his lively chatter. “Take it easy, Mrs. Gokhale. Don’t think of it
too much. After all ’tis only the natural thing, All would go well if you only
stop worrying.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

said “yes” but thought, “’<span class=SpellE>Tis</span> easy for you to say
that, doctor, but not at all easy for me. This is my first pregnancy after
twelve long years. Anything might happen, and that none can tell. How can I
help feeling the way I do?” That mood lasted for a while, and then she thought,
“Oh! I shouldn’t worry about it. Why, most of them go through it in the
ordinary course with the usual amount of <span class=SpellE>labour</span>-pains
and all. And how joyfully and easily they forget all their troubles the moment
they see the child, the great miracle of life born of their own flesh and
blood! ’<span class=SpellE>Tis</span> a great thing to be a mother. God has
blessed me. So let me leave it to Him.’ This mood also passed easily to a state
of dull despair, and that soon gave place to a feeling of quiet courage. Thus
her thoughts moved this way and that in a sort of slow latent torture giving no
idea of her inner struggle. Not even <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> could
feel with her in her unaccountable, varying moods. There she was quite alone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

could now rest assured that all would be well. All these months, in spite of

went for evening walks, went visiting their friends and relations, got up safe

suggestion of progress. A further period of two weeks passed and <span

began to think of the cause of the disturbing delay. He waited for a week and
then took <span class=SpellE>Meenakshi</span> to a renowned gynecologist. <span

were two easy chairs in the waiting room. He went there, only to find that one
of them was already occupied by his mother-in- law who was asleep. He settled
down on the other chair for a bit of rest. The doctor remained in his room

bringing a woman on the verge of delivering. She was taken to the ward and the
young couple who accompanied her was shown into the waiting room. <span

this while? How could he when his dear <span class=SpellE>Meena</span> was in <span

so he saw that the young thing sitting on the chair opposite was pretty. She
was well dressed and with a touch of lipstick she looked like a fresh flower
even at that odd hour. She talked with her <span class=SpellE>fiance</span> in
a low pleasant voice. Then she suddenly rose up and said, “Let me see what
they’ve done about my sister.” She left the room and came back quickly and
settled down on her chair saying “She’s all right.” The sister was going
through the excruciating experience and this one was just babbling playfully
looking almost unconcerned. She was rather concerned with her companion who
held her hand lovingly and said silly nothings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> left the room and
waited in the balcony. He heard a dog moaning pathetically down below. With the
help of torch-light he saw that it was a bitch heavy with her burden and in the
process of giving birth. The bitch needed neither medicine nor injection of any
kind. No doctor or nurse attended on her. No dog was there to pray for her. It
was only man who needed to pray. Why? Perhaps because man alone thought that
there was some divine element in him. Was it not his sheer ego which led him to
think so? In his silly self-esteem man had reduced God to the human plane. God
created the unfathomable universe with the sun, the moon, the countless stars
and this little earth. Was he not too great to bother about the human fate?
With that thought <span class=SpellE>Madhav</span> was thoroughly shaken. He
felt helpless and silly. He prayed to God to forgive him. What else could he

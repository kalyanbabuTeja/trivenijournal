style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
the achievement of Independence, a fresh alignment of Indian political parties
becomes inevitable. The Congress can no longer function as a multi-party
organisation, with mutually antagonistic elements pulling in different
directions. The Socialists, however, stand on a different footing from the
Mahasabhites or the Communists. Theirs is not a communal party like the former;
and, unlike the latter, they do not owe spiritual allegiance to a foreign
power. In their belief in parliamentary democracy and evolutionary Socialism,
they have much in common with a large body of Congressmen. Their non-violence
might not rise to the level of a creed, but in actual practice they are wedded
to non-violence for the attainment of their political and social ideals. A
Socialist democracy is the common objective of Socialists and of most
Congressmen. The difference between them, in ultimate analysis, is one of
emphasis and of the pace of progress. Whether this is so pronounced as to
necessitate a break with the parent organisation, is a matter which is still
open to doubt. The recent utterances of Sri Jai Prakash Narain and his
Socialist colleagues indicate a wholly unfair suspicion of the Nehru-Patel
Cabinet–both in its composition and its policies. One wonders if temperamental
differences between Sardar Patel and the Socialist Chiefs are at the bottom of
the present trouble.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
speak of Nehru as a virtual prisoner in his own Cabinet, to magnify the
different mental attitudes of Patel and Nehru into vital antagonisms, and to
seek to make political capital out of a supposed failure of the Home Minister
to safeguard Gandhiji’s life, is unworthy of an idealist like Jai Prakash. Even
as political strategy, it is pitiful. Nehru has been moved ! thereby to a
vehement condemnation of Socialist propaganda, and to an equally vehement
defence of his fellow Ministers. The effort to detach Nehru from the Rightist
Congress Chiefs has failed miserably. Nor have the Socialists strengthened
their position in the country. The impression is gaining ground that, like the old-time
Liberals, the Socialists are leaders without a following. They may whip up
public feeling for a brief period by talking at random about the corruption,
the inefficiency, and the unprogressive nature of Congress Ministries. They may
rally some discontented elements round their banner, but how can they sweep the
polls in the first general election under the new Constitution and step into
the seats of power, without a programme which is recognisably different from
that of the Congress from which they are breaking away?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is undeniable that the Socialists are, in the main, more progressive in outlook
than the office-seeking, elections-ridden section of Congressmen. But they have
no constructive activity to their credit. Even as an organised group within the
Congress, they have earned a reputation for wobbling on important occasions.
They let down Subhas Bose at Tripuri, and made it impossible for him to
consolidate the Leftist forces. In dealing with the Communists within their own
ranks, they wobbled once again. They permitted their party organisation,
notably in Andhra, to be overrun by the Communists sailing under the Socialist
flag, and then virtually handed the organisation over to them by dissolving the
Socialist party in those Provinces. People who are tired of the methods and
manners of selfish office-seekers, black-marketeers and ‘permit’ hunters among
Congressmen in certain Provinces have a soft corner for the Socialists. In some
quarters, they are tolerated as a lesser evil than the violent and fanatical
Communists. The Socialists can ‘cash in’ these doubtful assets and win a few
seats in the Legislatures. But with the exception of just two or three at the
top, their leadership is below par. Neither leaders nor men have well-defined
objectives, pursued by well-understood means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
decision to quit the Congress is a correct one, in the limited sense that it is
always more proper to stay out and co-operate when you can, rather than to stay
within and stir up perpetual quarrels between groups of men with frayed nerves
and with rival ambitions–ambitions which do not necessarily correspond to rival
ideologies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Praise
is justly due to Sardar Patel and the senior officers of the States Ministry
for the rapidity with which they are reducing a fabulous number of petty States
into ‘viable’ units of administration. With British Paramountcy out of the
picture, the democratic forces in the States are having unfettered expression,
and even the rulers are finding that it is to their advantage to strip
themselves of the trappings of power, and function as progressive leaders of a
free people. It has been computed that, by the end of June next, that is, in
less than twelve months from the dawn of Independence, the States will have
either merged in the neighbouring Provinces, or grouped themselves into Unions
based on geographical contiguity and common cultural and historical tradition.
About a dozen large States will be left over as autonomous entities. These will
be administered by Ministers responsible to the people, though owing nominal
allegiance to constitutional rulers acceding to the Indian Union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sourashtra
and Malwa, Vindhya and Himachal are names dear to students of Indian history.
This revival of the ancient landmarks in a modern setting of constitutional
government, must fill the people with hope that the India of their dreams will
maintain unity in diversity, and fulfill her destiny as a great cultural State
in which the things of the mind and the spirit will receive their due recognition.
Sourashtra is reminiscent of Dwaraka and the free union of republican
peoples–the Vrishnis, the Bhojas and the Andhakas. Malwa reminds us of Ujjain
and the literary glories of the age of Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti. Himachal was
the region round about which the Kshatriya clans of the Sakyas and the Vajjians
dwelt and gave to the world the Lord Buddha. The re-integration of India on the
basis of language and culture must ultimately lead to the great synthesis that
is Indian Civilisation. Sardar Patel has made history by bringing vast tracts
of territory and great masses of men within the administrative ambit of the
Indian Union. The confusion of jurisdictions and the unprogressive rule of
petty feudal chieftains, which marked Sourashtra and other regions, is now no
more. It is well that the Sardar began in his homeland, and then went forth
conquering fresh domains in a spirit of friendliness and goodwill. It is
Dalhousie’s task over again, but with what a difference!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hyderabad cannot continue for long to be an exception to the reign of law, as
opposed to the autocracy of a hereditary sovereign supported by a militant
minority and its fire-eating leaders. The Nizam must soon bow to the storm and
establish Responsible Government. Meanwhile, the sins of the Majlis and its
organised gangsters are mounting up. Day after day, the papers are full of
reports of murder, looting and arson; and border incidents are forming the
subject of heated controversy between the Nizam’s Government and the Indian Union.
Even so sober an administrator as the Finance Minister in the Union Cabinet
hints at a possible limit to the patience of the Government of India. The
Standstill Agreement is now perceived to be a ruse for gaining time in which
the Nizam could build up the military strength of the State, and stage a
last-ditch fight for ‘Independence’ and for utter freedom for himself and his
reactionary allies to oppress the vast majority of the citizens. Peace is
possible only on the basis of full Responsible Government. And Responsible
Government cannot be established without the power of the Majlis being broken.
Everything therefore turns on the answer to the question, “Will the Nizam give
up Razvi?” Time passes and a straight answer must be forthcoming within the next
few weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

love of power, and his weakness for medieval methods of administration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

strange poser! I might as well ask myself why I write for <i>Triveni. Republic </i>is
in the process of being born, and Sri Kalidas, much my junior in the
profession, must be worrying about articles, illustrations, and the unending
proofs. It gives one an odd feeling to contribute to a journal without having
seen even the first number. But then, if everyone excused himself, what should
happen to the poor Editor? Didn’t I write for <i>Triveni </i>without seeing the
first copy, and didn’t I run about for contributions to Sir M. Ramachandra Rao
at Ellore, K. Iswara Dutt at Bezwada–he was then literally a ‘quill-driver’ in
the Andhra University Office–and Sri C. Jinarajadasa at Adyar? How good they
were all to me, and ushered’ <i>Triveni! </i>If she were a real child instead
of a ‘dream-child’, she would now be nineteen, and I have no doubt she would be
finishing her B.A. at the Maharani’s College, Bangalore, with my friend Dr.
Nikam to teach her Plato. I can visualise her dressed in cream-coloured
Kankanhalli silks, playing on the <i>Veena, </i>and making most eloquent
speeches in English, Telugu and Kannada. As I watch bright college girls
fragrant with jasmine and rose getting into college buses, I scan their
features and wonder, “who among these is Triveni?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

else in the world. He studied for Law, but turned to journalism as a means of
self-expression. Even as a student at Vizianagaram he was a pressman, and
actually reported my presidential address at a Students’ Conference. He was
then apprenticing with Sri Venkanna Garu, a trained publicist and friend of the
great Chintamani. Kalidas, like Chintamani, comes fro Vizianagaram. This augurs
well. He married a grand-daughter of the eminent legislator and statesman, Sir
B. N. Sarma. But, alas! the gods were jealous, and snatched her away after a
few brief years. Kalidas’s one great absorption is his love for the little son
she left behind. I think of all this and of the unbounded affection Kalidas has
always showered on me. How can I repay him except by helping to usher in his <i>Republic?
</i>He ought to make it a great journal. It ought to rank with M. Chalapathi
Rau’s <i>National Herald </i>(Lucknow) and Khasa Subba Rau’s <i>Swatantra, </i>and,

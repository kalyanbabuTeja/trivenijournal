<span class=SpellE>Jaya</span> <span class=SpellE>Prakasha</span> <span
class=SpellE>Narain</span> is reported to have referred, in a recent speech, to
the tendency to deify <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>. I do not know
if people have been provoked thereby into giving deeper and further thought to
their ideas about socialism, as was apparently his intention, but some
reactions to the language he used are already available. The fear has been
expressed that such words, coming from a man like him, are liable to be
misunderstood and misinterpreted. Some people are probably feeling jubilant:
his words might appear to them to be indicative of that swing to the right
which they have been advocating all along. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
the alarm and the jubilation are unjustified. <span class=SpellE>Jaya</span> <span
class=SpellE>Prakasha</span> <span class=SpellE>Narain</span> has not <span
class=SpellE>resiled</span> from the position he has occupied so long and is, I
believe, as good a socialist as he was before. But he knows very well that <span
class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> is not an end in itself. The aim of all
socialist <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>endeavour</span></span> is the
emancipation of the individual, his freedom from exploitation of all kinds and
an opportunity for him to rise to his full height. <span class=SpellE>Nationalisation</span>
is useful in so far as <span class=GramE>it</span> serves this end. It is
conceivable that other methods of industrial management or a combination of <span
class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> and other methods could be made equally
effective. Today in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
our minds are obsessed with the virtues supposed to be inherent in
nationalization. Partly, this is due to the fact that we want rapid <span
class=SpellE>industrialisation</span>. Another factor responsible for this heavy
leaning towards <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> is the blind and
unsympathetic attitude of the average Indian trader. And then, when for one
reason or another, our policies fail to be successful, the scaling down of <span
class=SpellE>foodgrain</span> prices is an <span class=GramE>example,</span> we
find it convenient and psychologically satisfying to curse the <span
class=SpellE>unnationalised</span> sector. Be this as it may, <span
class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> is not the whole, or even the essential
core, of socialism. There are other things, at least equally important. This
was perhaps what <span class=SpellE>Jaya</span> <span class=SpellE>Prakashaji</span>
had in mind when he <span class=SpellE>criticised</span> the tendency to
apotheosize <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
referred at some length to one of these important things–Land Reforms–and
Village Self-government. They have not received the attention they deserve.
Tenure and other conditions must be created in which the cultivator can put
forth his best effort and make farming a profitable business. This is a
proposition about which it is hardly possible to have two opinions. The worker
on land is as much an object of concern to socialist thought as the worker in
the factory. There is no need to <span class=SpellE>labour</span> this point,
nor is it necessary here to go into details of Land Reform. There is one point,
however, to which reference might be made in passing. While there has been no
worthwhile advocacy of the policy of complete <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>
of agriculture, the claims of cooperative farming have been widely stressed and
powerfully <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span>. At the same time, there are
people in the country who see in cooperative farming all kinds of evil. It is
no use trying to stifle criticism by saying that cooperative farming is now a
part of our national policy and the question cannot be reopened. The best
thing, in my opinion, would be to set up a Commission, representing all
important shades of opinion and of experts in agriculture and land management.
Such a Commission should go over the whole field, keeping before itself also
the experience gained in other countries. The findings of such a Commission
would provide powerful arguments either for or against cooperative farming and
serve as a dependable guide to government in adopting a suitable land policy
for the future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it must be borne in mind that no matter how far <span class=SpellE>nationalisation</span>
and land reforms go, they do not go far enough. I am sure <span class=SpellE>Jaya</span>
<span class=SpellE>Prakasha</span> <span class=SpellE>Narain</span> is very
well aware of this, although he might not have had the time to refer to it.
Socialism is much more than any combination of practical <span class=SpellE>programmes</span>
about farm and factory. Politics and economics apart, it has important social
and cultural aspects. In fact, it embraces all regions of the life of the
individual and the community. Above everything else, socialism is an attitude
of mind, a direction of approach to social problems, a philosophy of life. And
this applies to democracy as well, the concept which, along with that of
Socialism, forms the cornerstone of our national life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every
one who is interested in the country can see for himself that while <span
class=SpellE>nationalisation</span> and land reforms are being attended to,
though perhaps not in right measure, the spiritual content of socialism and
democracy is being totally neglected. As the Vice-President observed recently,
one does not now find in the people the enthusiasm and will to sacrifice, that
animated them during our fight for freedom. This spirit was recaptured for a
short time during the early days of the Chinese invasion but no attempt is
being made to keep it alive. Our leadership speaks only in terms of schools and
houses and hospitals, roads and bridges and power houses, all very good things,
no doubt; but to expect a nation to find in them something spiritually
uplifting is to expect a man to lift himself with the help of his shoe strings.
Our deification of matter will never provide us with food for the spirit, with
ideals to live for and, if need be, to die for. If we want to make socialism
and democracy vital parts of our lives, let us provide for them a sound
philosophic basis which shall elevate us above our routine selves of every day
existence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
can only trust that this very important matter will soon receive the attention
it deserves. The Congress appointed a Committee with Sri U. N. <span
class=SpellE>Dhebar</span> as Chairman to find out how far its <span
class=SpellE>Bhuvaneshwar</span> resolution about socialism is being
implemented but no attempt has so far been made either by the Congress or any
other party to work out a spiritual basis for the concept. Without such a
basis, there is a danger of our best practical <span class=SpellE>programmes</span>
some day foundering on<i> </i>the rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

young Brahmin boy, Siddhartha<sup>1</sup>, in search for knowledge renounces
the self, this world dismissing it as illusion. But after a long arduous and
frantic search he fails to get the real knowledge until he comes to the river
and listens to its voices. The real wisdom comes to him when he looks at the
river and finds that the truth was this life from which he sought an escape and
which was dancing with all its varied forms and <span class=SpellE>colours</span>
on the surface of that thousand-voiced river. From time immemorial many
philosophers, seekers of truth and saints have tried to-discover this mystery;
have been disgusted with this transitory world and have sought for a life
beyond; but in the long run they all have come back finding that however
sorrowful, transitory and illusory this life may be, it is significant and
worth living. Irwin <span class=SpellE>Edman</span> has rightly remarked, “Whatever
life may be, it is a flow through time, <span class=GramE>a duration</span>, a
many-<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> episode in eternity.” Even in this
twentieth century, when there has been a silent decaying of soul in every
corner of the world, when man feels that he has been trapped in a nightmarish
existence, eminent thinkers and humanists still believe in this life; still
look forward to a millennium. <span class=SpellE>Camus</span> has felt this
commitment of writers, ‘The writers are always on the side of life’. And
Rabindranath sings of the glory of life, “I have had my invitation to this
world’s festival and thus my life has been blessed”.<sup>2</sup> Thus we see
life’s endless dilemmas, troubles and confusions, experiences bitter as well as
sweet have been a prominent theme in literature since ancient times to the modern.
And in great masterpieces one finds not the rejection of this illusory life,
but the willing acceptance of it. The great Roman poet Terence has said, “I am
a man, nothing human is alien to me.” Now when one comes to Indo-<span
class=SpellE>Anglian</span> literature, one too finds the rainbow <span
class=SpellE>colour</span> of life radiating its beauty in all directions. The
purpose of this paper is to study this aspect in R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
art, <span class=GramE>who</span> is said to be a prominent figure in Indo-<span
class=SpellE>Anglian</span> literature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> theme has always been the grim aspect of life and
his heroes are often the human underdogs, the innocent victims to a <span
class=SpellE>bourgeoise</span> society. Anand always remains at this side and
the reader misses a complete and wholesome picture of human life. Here one
agrees with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Verghese</span>, “<span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span>
emphasis on the didactic quality of art stands on the way of his attainment as
a novelist, for obtrusive propaganda makes his novels suffer in quality”.<sup>3</sup>
But it was in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Apology of Heroism </i>that
the artist Anand confessed, “...the theme of my work became the whole man and
whole gamut of human relationships, rather than the only one single part of it.”
Raja Rao, another major novelist in the Indo-<span class=SpellE>Anglian</span>
screen, always soars in metaphysical heights, least touching this ground of
ordinary human passions. With a rare exception of Kamala <span class=SpellE>Markandaya</span>,
who particularly in her book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nectar in a
Sieve </i>has presented the poetry of human existence blended with the pathos,
the smiles and sighs of two helpless human souls, no other novelist comes near <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Narayan</span> with that rare gift of a writer, or more of a
humanist closely clings to the philosophy of Tagore, “Deliverance is not for me
in renunciation...No, I will never shut the door of my senses”.<sup>4</sup> In
his novels one does not find the grandeur of tragedy as in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chemeen</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>or in <span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> novels; but the pathos of day
to day existence, the inside of human comedy exposed with all its bitter
curves, levity of and seriousness of life and also rare moments of eternity
concealed in a life of sweat and sense. Taking <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
novels as a whole, a single unit, we discover characters are like caravans
journeying on the quagmire of a twentieth century existence; yet each time
adding to the rich and varied experiences of life and finally realizing the
truth of life. From endless rigmaroles of life, from passion’s holocaust and
from thousands of <span class=SpellE>idiosyncracies</span> and little ironies
of life, life’s significance is to be realized. “Life is mysteriously strong”.<sup>
5</sup> Quasimodo sings and for <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> this mystery
lies in the mosaic pattern of India’s culture as well as in this human
existence in which all human <span class=SpellE>idiosyncracies</span> like <span
class=SpellE>Nataraj</span> with his original <span class=SpellE>Heideberg</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Vasu</span> with his pythons and carcasses, Mali with his
story producing machine, the cousin with his listening capacity, the
monosyllabic poet with his epic “<span class=SpellE>Radhakalyan</span>,” <span
class=SpellE>Sampath</span> with his film “Burning of <span class=SpellE>Kama</span>,”
<span class=SpellE>Ravi</span> with his vision of beauty, De Mello with his
Hollywood nostalgias and so many other things exist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With
uncompromising courage <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> heroes fight the
game of life; sometimes they lose the battle and sometimes win it. On the way
they are exhausted, tyrannized and betrayed; but are never finally defeated.
With that typical courage of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Santiago</st1:City></st1:place>
“Man can be destroyed, but not defeated”<span class=GramE>,<sup>6</sup></span>
his characters are always on the move and never static. Thus the plot gathers
the tempo, the energy. Consider <span class=SpellE>Raju</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Sampath</span>, <span class=SpellE>Margayya</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Vasu</span> and others–all in a great hurry as if subject to a
sort of frenzy for life. They move, very violently move and complete a cycle at
the end going through rapid climaxes and anti-climaxes. And speaking from a
material plane, at the end they are more or less at their beginning. But
internally they do not remain the same self of their beginning. Thus each of <span
class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> novels becomes a valuable itinerary for us, those
who have set on the journey of life. Just like Hemingway’s old man, his heroes
stick to life with renewed <span class=SpellE>vigour</span> from time to time
even in spite of frequent abysses and heights. They are capable of tremendous
energy in one way or the other. To live is a hard task and it requires guts. “All
they want to escape from the pain of being alive and mostly from love”<span
class=GramE>,<sup>7</sup></span>–this pathetic vision of our existence has been
reflected in most of the works of to-day’s writers. In Kafka’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Metamorphosis </i>the nightmarish
experiences of Gregory <span class=SpellE>Samsa</span> turned into a giant
insect has been presented. Coming back to our own field, we notice in the last
chapter of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Coolie </i>the dance of life
inside the ballroom of Sahibs contrasted with the dance of death outside in the
blood of a tender aged, dying <span class=SpellE>Munoo</span>. In <span
class=SpellE>Arun</span> Joshi’s novel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Foreigner, </i>one finds how man feels that he has been thrown into an alien
world, “my foreignness lay within me and I could not leave myself behind
wherever I went.” But in <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> novels one finds
the immense faith in life, the lilting waves of love and laughter, the
consolation of <span class=GramE>a reconciliation</span>. That is why, in all
his novels the characters at the end of the novels emerge from the crucible of suffering,
discarding the jaundiced vision of theirs, <span class=GramE>emerge</span> with
the knowledge and wisdom of<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>life. <span
class=SpellE>Raju</span> laughs through his tears and at the end of the novel
the comicality of a situation is presented when one finds <span class=SpellE>Raju</span>,
the starving Swami against a funny back-drop of film shows about Malaria,
mosquitoes, B. C. G., gambling booth and the American film producer and the Ali
Baba film. But beneath the apparent comicality of this situation, lies at its
core a man, essentially helpless and ridiculously pathetic. At the end <span
class=SpellE>Raju</span> realizes the truth. For the first time in his life he
was making an earnest effort, for the first time he was learning the thrill of
full application, outside money and love; for the first time he was doing a
thing in which he was not personally interested.” Thus after completing a full
circle, <span class=SpellE>Raju</span> achieves martyrdom and redeems his
earlier deeds. His other characters, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Margayya</span></st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Mali</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
<span class=SpellE>Jagon</span>, <span class=SpellE>Balu</span> and many others
complete the circle in their own ways and thus attain at the end a sort of
resurrection. <span class=SpellE>Margayya</span>, after a meteoric rise and
meteoric fall, is devoid of all ego and all pretensions. So many ups and downs
in life have provided him with wisdom and with that wisdom he is prepared to
carryon his financial expert’s business under that tree. This is not a realist’s
<span class=SpellE>defeatistic</span> credo; rather this is the urge to fight
on, to struggle discarding all pretensions and pseudo values of an earlier
life. And now only <span class=SpellE>Margayya</span> feels the essence, feels
the urge to nurse the finer sentiments of life: “Now get the youngster here. I’ll
play with him. Life has been too dull without him in this house.” <span
class=SpellE>Margayya’s</span> loss in this money world has gained him domestic
harmony just like <span class=SpellE>Jagon’s</span> rebirth at the age of
sixty. At sixty, one is reborn and enters a new <span class=SpellE>Janma</span>.”
<span class=SpellE>Jagon</span> has renounced his all attachment to see the
goddess emerge from stone; yet pockets the <span class=SpellE>cheque</span>
book. And we are to look for a further development of his character. Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> has brilliantly summed up this ambiguous situation
of <span class=SpellE>Jagon’s</span> renunciation and attachment, “But at last
the demon has been worsted, though the Deity hasn’t arisen yet”.<sup>8</sup> “At
the end of the journey <span class=SpellE>Sampath</span> is alone; the castle
of his dreams has fallen to the dust; but yet he is not defeated and we know
this of himself that he is going to the railway station to “manage” himself
there. Somebody is to be met at the railway station; some new enterprise is to
be started; the broken strings of life are to be harmonized once again. Anyone
of these possibilities is there for <span class=SpellE>Sampath</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Shanti</span> too has gone through the experiences and has seen
the truth, the emptiness of a gewgaw film existence. She has gone back to look after
her son. Every character in <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> novels
undergoes a kind of metamorphosis not to an insect as in Kafka’s work, but to a
better to face this world with pure guts and wisdom. Nobody is lost in this
crowded world: “Only existence asserts itself”.<sup>9</sup> <span class=GramE>And</span>
we eagerly look forward to <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Ravi</span></st1:place><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> cure at the temple at <span class=SpellE>Sailam</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> believes in life, not in transcending it; but in
living inside it, close to it, intensely and intimately. For him, man lives in
his dreams and in its denial too, in his aspiration as well as in his
frustration. Every experience, however small, sweet or bitter may be, has got
significance and contributes to the main stream of eternal life, because all
experiences culminate in the experience of Wisdom. And while there is life,
there is hope for amendment of life,” Alan <span class=SpellE>Paton</span>
preaches in his “Cry, The Beloved Country.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ibsen in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wild Duck </i>stressed. As long

in his emotional being. When one witnesses the human drama in <span

heroes ever failing to adjust. <span class=SpellE>Raju</span>, <span

the surface. “...laughter, a deafening, roaring laughter, has a knack of
swallowing everything up”.<sup>10</sup> It is the secret to <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
technique. The deafening, roaring laughter in the novels arising due to various
pranks, <span class=SpellE>idiosyncracies</span> swallow up the gloom, the
horror and tear of human existence. Hence, ordinarily viewing, his novels look
comic and the cry of the suffering soul remains concealed within. <span

life’s little pranks and peculiarities, the fun in the “exotic world of
half-headed or half-hearted dreamers, artists, financiers, speculators,
twisters, adventurers, cranks, cinema stars, Sanyasis”.<sup>11</sup> The
consciousness of time flowing on, age very silently slipping away haunts <span

This tragic vision of human life, the old man’s shocking awareness of an
approaching death is acutely reflected in his somewhat autobiographical work <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Reluctant Guru, </i>“One sees the finger of
death too often, plucking a life here and a life there. He has lost count of
all the bereavements he has suffered in life: friends, children, nephews and
elders.” <span class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Sampath</span> </i>feels it with pain, “Every
New Year’s Day he felt depressed and unhappy. All around he felt there were
signs that a vast inundation was moving onward, carrying the individual before
it, and before knowing, where one was, one would find oneself senile or in the
grave, with so little understood or realized.” All the major characters in <span
class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> novels are desirous to communicate. And when the
string of communication is snapped, only left is the gloom and horror of
lonely, derelict shores of human existence. The tenant, the predecessor of <span
class=SpellE>Srinivas</span> in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Sampath</span> </i>was shut up in this nightmarish existence, <span
class=GramE>who</span> used to enquire everyday whether there were any letters
for him. Even the rapacious rascal, the owner of the house in the same novel,
is a lonely man beneath his mask. The wife is dead and the children proved
ungrateful. Yet the father in that greedy man still lives, “For this
grand-daughter of mine, why don’t you find a bridegroom? I may die any moment,
I am very old...” Even <span class=SpellE>Vasu</span>, surprisingly enough, is
subject to common human passions. He too has a desire to build a <span
class=SpellE>cosy</span> nest with <span class=SpellE>Rangi</span>. He wants to
take <span class=SpellE>Rangi</span> with him to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>. Against this silhouette of human zoo,
this humdrum of <span class=GramE>present,</span> creeps the shadow of an
innocent past strewn with loving reminiscences of childhood into the narrative
of <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>. Life may be bitter, life may be sweet;
but life is full with innumerable experiences. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
exposes our existence with a strong nostalgia for grand-father and
grand-mother; stream of life that has been flowing down to us and to our
progeny endlessly. In all his novels, mostly in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Guide, Vendor of Sweets </i>and in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Financial
Expert </i><span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> sentimentally turns to a loving
past, an innocent childhood. On a reading of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Swami and Friends, </i>the reader is carried back to that period of
sublime intoxication. But when he pauses, reflects and looks to his miserable
present, he feels the lapse of time, the miserable scars that age has left in
his brows and wrinkles. When <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> recollects his
childhood with a burning nostalgia, themes of common human sorrow such as a
grand-father lost in the corridors of time, the sorrow of the transitory, the
charm of marriage day long since lost giving place to a widowed life-all find
their ways in his otherwise humorous description. In his autobiography <span
class=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>My</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> days </i><span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
reflects how childhood friends are lost in a vast world, have been strange and
unknown to each other. He has felt this transitory, has felt that “in the rush
of eternity nothing mattered”.<sup>12</sup> Yet he is always searching for the
knowledge “for an unknown stabilizing factor in life, for an unchanging value,
a knowledge of the self, a piece of knowledge which would support as on a rock
the faith of man and his peace, a knowledge of true identity.....<sup>13</sup>
For <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>, transitory and eternal are not opposed
to each other; transitory is a part of the great eternity. So many human dramas
have been enacted here on the stage of <span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>; but <span
class=SpellE>Malgudi</span> is still there, the river <span class=SpellE>Sarayu</span>
is still there having its rebirth and growth murmuring “men may come and men
may go, but I go on for ever.” Dr. <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> has
rightly quoted Shelley in this reference, “The One remains, the many change and
pass.” And we are to realize the One in the many, while living closely in the
line of Santayana’s thought, “There is no cure to birth and death except to
enjoy the interval.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

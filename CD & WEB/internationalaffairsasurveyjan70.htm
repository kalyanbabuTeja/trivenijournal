style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The unique feature of the decade
just past is that it defies <span class=SpellE>labelling</span>. We cannot coin
such neat names as the ‘gay nineties’ or the ‘roaring twenties.’ In one sense
we can agree with Alistair Cooke’s <span class=SpellE>characterisation</span>
of the decade as the ‘ghastly sixties.’ Political assassinations in the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
campus revolts and civil strife almost everywhere, the decline in the political
stability in our own case (whether one regards it as symptomatic of a
transition to maturity or as a descent to doom is a different matter), bloody
civil wars in Nigeria and Vietnam, crude racialism in South Africa and
Rhodesia, brutal suppression of Czechoslovak freedom by Russia–these are
illustrative of the ghastliness. The ghastliness also lies in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
contrasts the decade produced. Man landed on the moon, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thus
transforming, as it were, the interplanetary distances from an astronomical
dimension to a mere microscopic measurement, yet the gaps in the economic
levels of the communities within this planet are getting widened at
unprecedented speed. The sixties transformed the advanced industrial societies
into ‘<span class=SpellE>technotronic</span> societies’, while, in contrast, in
the less developed areas even the transition from agro-feudal state to the
industrial phase is proving difficult. The result, in the words of the noted
scholar <span class=SpellE>Zbigniew</span> <span class=SpellE>Brzezinski</span>,
is that within our planet ‘more distinct worlds’ are emerging. In a word, thus,
the sixties seem to be unique in their contrasts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

perspective of East-West relations, in particular of those between <st1:State
w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>,
one cannot but feel encouraged. It will be remembered that the decade opened with
high expectations of the Summit Talks between <span class=SpellE>Khruschev</span>
and Eisenhower in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>.
The fact that the previous meeting of these two statesmen at Camp David in 1959
generated a spirit of cordiality only reinforced the optimism about the
proposed <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Paris</st1:City></st1:place>
summit in the <span class=GramE>Spring</span> of 1960. It is comforting that
the decade closed with the Russo-American ‘detente’ assuming almost <span
class=GramE>Impregnable</span> </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>proportions. For, the strategic Arms
Talks, now being held at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Helsinki</st1:place></st1:City>,
indicate that the two super powers have settled down to working out lasting <span
class=SpellE>defences</span> for the ‘detente’. Thus, the beginning and the end
of the decade are marked by events spotlighting the genesis and consolidation
of the ‘detente’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there has been an unbroken ascent in the ‘cordiality curve’ of East-West
relations. On the Contrary, the decade had witnessed events fraught with
frightening potentialities. Let us recapitulate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>Ironically enough, the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City> summit, which the dawn of the sixties
heralded, proved abortive as a result of the U2J incident, in which an American
plane entering Soviet territory north of the Turkish </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>boundary
was shot down by the Russians. The American plane was admittedly on an espionage
mission. This had not only shattered the proposed Paris Summit, but brought
back the two Powers almost to their former state of hostility. However, the
inauguration of the Kennedy regime restored to a little degree the lost ground
and President Kennedy followed up his professions of friendship in bargaining with
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> over the
Austrian Peace Treaty in 1961. And this trend was again rudely interrupted by the
Cuban missile fiasco (1962), which brought Russo-American relations to an all
time low and the world nearest to a nuclear holocaust. Whether Kennedy’s refusal
to permit <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> installing
missiles in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> saved Latin
America from a shot-gun marriage with Castro’s <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> or it merely saved Kennedy’s image
of being a tough guy will be debated for a long time. Apparently, he called <span
class=SpellE>Khruschev’s</span> bluff and won a resounding victory in the war
of nerves. <span class=GramE>Yet ,</span> but for <span class=SpellE>Khrushev’s</span>
decision not to run the American blockade, an all out nuclear war would have
resulted. In this sense, it was the Russian leader that showed responsibility
and wisdom <span class=GramE>at the expense of his own</span> head which rolled
two years later. For, it is well known that his performance in the Cuban
missile crisis was one of the grounds seized upon by his neo-Stalinist opponents
in the Kremlin to oust him from power in the autumn of 1964. The third episode is
the American entry into the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
tangle. This occurred during Kennedy’s time though it was during Johnson’s time
that <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>’s
involvement escalated into total committal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>Yet, in spite of these events engendering tensions the
search for détente continued, and what is surprising, succeeded. Four </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>major
breakthroughs can be cited: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) the Austrian Peace Treaty
which avoided the creation of a second German problem to reckon with, (ii) The
Test-Ban Treaty of 1965, (iii) The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty of 1968,
and <span class=GramE>(iv) The</span> Strategic Arms limitation Talks,
currently in session at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Helsinki</st1:place></st1:City>.
These are only the tangible manifestations of the rapprochement. Many more
intangible indicators can also be cited. The American proposal to withdraw a
sizable part of its troops from Western Europe; the indefatigable efforts by
Washington and Moscow to jointly sponsor acceptable plan on West Asia (in spite
of their conflict of interests); West Germany’s readiness to negotiate with
Russia and Poland–all these and many more, illustrate these intangibles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another significant feature of the
decade is that the two super powers have developed a stake in the ‘detente’ to
such a degree that at times they feel their respective ideological allies to be
drags on their search for closer identity. Western Europe’s misgivings about <st1:State
w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> entering into bilateral understanding with <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> are well known.
Similarly, Eastern European capitals felt equally piqued at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>’s disposition to ignore them in dealing
with the West. More than this, there is the special common interest of <st1:City
w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> and <st1:State w:st="on">Washington</st1:State> to
contain <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Thus, in short, the fear of the destructive potential of their nuclear arsenals
and a common concern against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
seem to constitute the real reasons for the thaw in Russo-American relation
rather than the emergence of new liking towards each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And this brings us to the most
important development of the decade – the Sino-Soviet schism. The seeds of this
conflict might have been sown sometime before the start of the sixties. But it
is during the past decade, particularly after 1962, that it assumed a
recognizable dimension. Strong convictions about each other’s ideological
departures apart, parochial nationalism, territorial ambitions and personality
rivalries, pure and simple, also weighed in the situation. This ideology and
power got inextricably mixed in the affair. The Sino-Indian War of September
1962 and the Cuban Missile affair of the same period provided the occasion for
the schism to become overt. <span class=SpellE>Khruschev</span> was lukewarm
towards <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s action
against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Mao was furious as <span class=SpellE>Khruschev’s</span> pusillanimity over
the Cuban issue. The schism went unabated and not even the Soviet leader’s exit
would turn the tide. In fact, his accusers and successors, Kosygin and
Brezhnev, were so committed against <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
that they wanted </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to see the Indian sub-continent united as a bulwark
against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
<span class=SpellE>revanchist</span> potentialities. This explains the Russian mediatory
role at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tashkent</st1:place></st1:City>
after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> also contributed
to the worsening of Sino-Russian relations. As pointed o</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ut
by a student of Chinese affairs in a recent article in the journal, ‘problems of
Communism’, “the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region> bombing
of <st1:country-region w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region>, initiated in
February 1965, was a catalytic agent in relations between the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place> and China.” How to react to the American commitment was the
question faced by the Chinese leadership. The Russians proposed that the American
involvement be met by a bold confrontation. For the follow up action Moscow “requested
the use of two airfields in southwest China, the right to station 500 men on
them, an air Corridor or air transit rights, permission to send 4,000 men in a
body through China, and possibly the use of a port in </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>South
China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>The Maoist section of the Chinese leadership was averse
to interpret the American involvement as warranting a conventional confrontation
and combined to advocate guerilla warfare as the right action. The Soviet stand
is capable of two alternative interpretations. Either <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
sincerely advocated a war straight away with the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.
 S.</st1:country-region>, in which case the <span class=SpellE>untenability</span>
of regarding the Russians as being inherently more reasonable with the West becomes
patently clear: or <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> merely wanted to establish
its military presence in <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
in the name of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In any case the Russian proposal led to a rift within the Chinese leadership
from which, no doubt, the Russians wanted to profit. To quote from the article cited
above “Acceptance of this proposal would in effect have </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>signified
the ascendancy of the views of Lo, Liu, and <span class=SpellE>Teng</span> over
those of Mao, as elaborated by Lin <span class=SpellE>Piao</span>. The Soviet <span

acceptance, particularly as it was made before they knew that the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> would remain firmly committed to
the war in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> settled back to await the outcome of the

opponents and set the stage for a shift of political power in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>.” The Russian misgivings of Chinese
international </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;

in their mutual hostility seemed to have forced them to open negotiations,
which started a couple of months ago after the surprising meeting between
Kosygin and Chou En Lai in <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. Whether the
seventies will reverse the general trend of the sixties in the Sino-Soviet relations
is still to be seen. The urges for the consolidation of the Russo-American
bonhomie are infinitely stronger than those for the relaxation of the
inter-Communist tensions. In fact, it can be said that the Russians are making
up with the West because of the hostile pressures of their Eastern ideological <span
class=SpellE>neighbour</span>. And the Americans are also eager to isolate <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place> and then deal with it. <span class=GramE>Yet,
unless the Russians or the Americans are seriously contemplating war with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> (not a probable prospect), it could not be
that the two giants will continue to treat <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
as a parish.</span> That is why while the Russians are exploring ways to
de-fuse the situation in the East, the Americans, on their own, are also keen
on opening a dialogue with <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. That
Vice-President <span class=SpellE>Spirto</span> Agnew, of all people, should
praise the Nepalese for maintaining cordial relations with <st1:place w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>
is very suggestive indeed. The American Vice-President thereby conceded Peking’s
claims to regard <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as coming under its sphere of influence also. The problem now is to reconcile
the urges for a Russo-American detente with those for Sino-Soviet and Sino-American
dialogues. Perhaps, a lasting peace with <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>
would constitute a more secure foundation for a long term understanding with <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a permanent weakening of the bond uniting the Communist world. And this trend
could be regarded as independent of the Sino-Soviet quarrel. This quarrel,
however, led to the bifurcation in the Communist camp. More subtle than this is
the weakening of <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>’s hold even over those
states that ostensibly remain under <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>’s
influence. The <span class=SpellE>liberalisation</span> in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
during 1968, even if eventually crushed with brutal contempt for everything
democratic, points to the nature of forces working within the Communist systems
themselves. One wonders whether the enunciation of the Brezhnev Doctrine of ‘limited
sovereignty’ does not betray an admission that the hitherto accepted modes of
relationships between <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
and its ideological cohorts are eroding! The example of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rumania</st1:place></st1:country-region> is even
more to the point. While daring to take an independent stand in the Sino-Soviet
dispute, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bucharest</st1:place></st1:City>
has been pursuing an even more independent foreign policy–sometimes even being
pro-Western as over the Arab-Israeli dispute. And developments did not stop at
that. In addition to the appearance of cracks in the Eastern European monolith,
chinks within individual Communist state systems have also manifested. The
Russian society itself is an example. It is true that there fortunes of freedom
fluctuated from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mild permissiveness to near total repression.
The trails of some intellectuals a couple of years ago and the recent expulsion
of the eminent writer Solzhenitsyn from the Soviet Writer Union indicate </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that
the official policy is to weed out dissent. But here again, it would seem that
certain changes have come to stay. A few illustrations may be given. It is
significant that a youngster, Anatoly <span class=SpellE>Gromyko</span>, the son
of the Russian Foreign Minister, resigned from the diplomatic service and
entered the Institute for the Study of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.
 A.</st1:country-region>, in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City></st1:place>.

is regarded as the most sophisticated Soviet book on American politics, a work
on the Kennedy days entitled, “The 1036 Days of President Kennedy.” That he
could operate still in the ‘intellectual establishment’ is highly suggestive of
the changes in the society. A second instance is the petition signed by 54
members of a group, styled as the Initiative Group for the <span class=SpellE>Defence</span>
of Civil Liberties, and sent to U <span class=SpellE>Thant</span> last May. It
is true that some of these signatories have been imprisoned, and few others dismissed
from their jobs. Yet the event itself is epochal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

about a change in our perspectives. The Chinese episode made us conscious of

getting along with untried leadership, and to learn to live the future with a
less stable political system. The elections of 1967 compelled us to face a reality
totally different from the past. The complacent sentimentality about our

and the West, for in the early years of the decade the thaw in the East-West

of age, adolescent enthusiasm being replaced by a realistic awareness of having
to live with the Chinese threat. In pursuance of this, efforts, however feeble,

The Prime Minister visited a good many of the South East Asian countries during
’67-69. Though we are averse to a military pact as an answer to the Chinese menace,
it is significant that we are trying to make friends in the region and talking
about the menace. <span class=GramE>The British decision to withdraw their
naval presence from the region as also the possible curtailment of the American

Russia’s role as the peace-maker between us and Pakistan–both non-communist

play the bourgeois role of a peace-maker in a quarrel between two bourgeois powers.

Gambia, 1963). <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under De Gaulle let to French West and Equatorial Africa by 1960. Soon British

and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Belgium</st1:place></st1:country-region>
led to concede freedom at the very start of the decade. It was only left to

<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Angola</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and a few other pockets, using the most ruthless methods in suppressing nationalist

increasingly <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>. The award of the Nobel Prize

the extremely limited nature of the contribution of international aid in the
economic development of under-developed areas cannot be over-<span
class=SpellE>emphasised</span>. Ironically indeed, the U. N. sought to dedicate
the past decade to development and declared 1966, in particular, as the International
Co-operation Year. Yet the record in this regard has been uninspiring. There
has not been even a symbolic attempt in the shape of a simple concerted effort
to boost development to <span class=SpellE>commemmorate</span> the year. In
fact, such has been the toxin that the politics of aid released over the years
that Mr. McNamara, the President of the World Bank, came to perceive a crisis
of vast dimensions. To meet the situation Mr. McNamara constituted a committee,
to which the former Canadian Prime Minister, Lester Pearson, was invited, to be
the chairman. Only a few months ago the Pearson Committee submitted its Report
on International Aid. And what an exposure it made of the murky make-believe of
international economic assistance! The net achievement of the decade in this
field seems to be the Report itself. The trust of all its recommendations “is
to bring most poor countries to a point where, by the end of the century, they
will no longer need aid. Their growth will be self-sustaining. To accomplish
this, the Report insists that their growth rate be raised to an average six per
cent a year, which is a lot. This will require aid donors to give more; the
United States Government, relatively a laggard now; will have to double its
effort. Recipients will have to perform more efficiently, and to be judged on
their performance. Poor countries will have to improve conditions for private
investment. Rich countries will have to let the poor sell them more of their
goods. The multilateral sources and administrators of aid, like the World Bank
and the Aid-India Club, must be strengthened to spare rich countries like the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and the poor countries they help, the harshest of the political frictions
inherent in any face-to-face dealing of patron and client.” Will the affluent
West act on the experience of the decade? This is the big question. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

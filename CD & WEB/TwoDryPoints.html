</FONT><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Etching is widely practised in Europe at the present day, and ‘Dry Point’ is a fascinating variety of it. It is a linear method, and generally ‘sketchy’. But in the hands of an Indian Artist who is essentially a master of line, it yields a finished and lyrical charm, as may be seen from these two pictures. The feeling of colour is a special feature of the line in this method, but very little of the beauty of the original can be conveyed in a reproduction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Buddha's attainment of Liberation under the Bodhi Tree forms the theme of the first picture. "It is beautiful in the restraint and slight drawing and has a great deal of imagination" (‘The Madras Mail’) A duplicate is in the collection of the Hon. H. G. Stokes, C.S.I.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the second picture, Omar is represented as seated by his Beloved and asking her to fill the cup to the last drop, for, "Tomorrow, why–who knows?" The falling rose-petals are highly suggestive.</P>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Politics,”
wrote Seeley, “are vulgar when they are not liberalised by history, and history
fades into mere literature when it loses sight of its relation to practical
politics,” and viewed in this perspective, it is clear that the growth of
democracy in India was a direct result of the system of liberal education which
the British had introduced in our Universities. Along with the classics of
English literature, the nineteenth century Indian had studied such political
classics as Locke’s ‘Of Civil Government’ and Mill’s ‘On Liberty’. Some Indians
were also influenced by the ideals of Cavour and Mazzini who, in their turn,
had drawn most of their political ideas from English liberalism. And the desire
to have a truly national Government, based on the parliamentary system, was
strengthened by two factors–the enactment of legislative measures on the social
plane, and the steady development of a spirit of nationalism on the political
plane. Seeley had described the then Government of India as one “which is
utterly un-English, which is bureaucratic,……which rests on military force,
which raises its revenue not in the European fashion, but by taking the place
of a universal landlord, and in a hundred other ways departs from the
traditions of England.” Thus, paradoxical as it may seem, England herself was
doubly responsible for the growth of a democratic movement in India. While the
policy of the British colonial administrators in India intensified the struggle
for freedom, it was the teachings of great British intellectuals like Burke,
Acton, Seeley, Shaw and Russell that inspired in us the love of freedom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
beginnings of British liberal thought can be traced in the 17th century
struggle in England, of the Parliament against the authority of the King. But
the word ‘Liberal’ as a Party label gained currency in British politics as a
result of the sympathy felt by the Whigs for the Spanish ‘liberales.’ And the
movements of liberal thought which developed in England during the course of
one or two centuries were compressed into a few decades in India, in an Indian
setting. To cite an example, Lord Macaulay pleaded for religious liberty,
during a debate on the civil disabilities of the Jews, in a celebrated speech
in the House of Commons. In India (where religious liberty was no problem at
any time), Raja Ram Mohan Roy had to launch a campaign against such customs as
‘Suttee.’ Similarly Raja Ram Mohan Roy’s sympathy for Naples when it was
attacked by the Austrian Government and his opposition to Spanish imperialism
in South America (markedly similar to the liberal element in Indian public
opinion, which asserted itself against totalitarian tyranny in the test-cases
of Hungary and Tibet) had been inspired by the British Liberal Party’s attitude
towards the national movements in Italy, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Greece and South
America. And the Raja’s contribution to the freedom of the Press flowed from
‘Milton’s ‘Areopagetica,’ a notable source of English liberalism. Thus, the
principles of civil liberty, the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rule of law and the
freedom of the Press constituted the background of the first phase of liberal
democracy in modern India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It
was said,” observed Sir Winston Churchill in December 1946, in a memorable
debate in the House of Commons, “in the days of the great administration of
Lord Chatham, that one had to get up very early in the morning not to miss some
of the gains and accessions of territory which were then characteristic of our
fortune. The no less memorable administration of the Rt. Hon. gentleman is
distinguished for the opposite set of experiences. The British Empire seems to
be running off almost as fast as the American loan. The steady and remorseless
process of divesting ourselves of what has been gained by so many generations
of toil, administration and sacrifice, continues.” This observation of Sir
Winston was in reply to Lord Attlee’s statement that His Majesty’s Government
did not desire “to retain within the Commonwealth and Empire any unwilling
peoples.” Herein lies the triumph of the liberal tradition over the imperial
tradition, and of freedom over authority, which climaxed a process of decades,
resulting in the transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of
Nations. The philosophical foundations of such a transformation were laid by a
group of men led by Edmund Burke. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Burke’s
reverence for the cultures and civilisations of all nations, including his own,
distinguished him as the prophet of philosophical conservatism. His profound
admiration for the permanent values of Indian civilisation led him to believe
that the people of ‘Hindosthan’ must be governed “upon their principles and not
upon ours.” Burke’s argument on the French Revolution was equally based on his
great regard for the culture of France. And his attitude towards the “American
problem’ was due to his reverence for the British Constitution. He argued that,
“to prove that the Americans ought not to be free, we are obliged to deprecate
the value of freedom itself, and we never seem to gain a paltry advantage over them
in debate without attacking some of the principles and in deriding some of
those feelings for which our ancestors had shed their own blood.” Looked at
from this point of view, there is hardly any necessity to ‘reconcile’ Burke’s
attitude towards the French Revolution and his approach to the problems of
India and America, as is attempted by some students of political philosophy.
Strange as it may seem, it is his very conservatism that made Burke evolve a
philosophy of liberalism. Burke merely held that rapacity in the Empire as well
as in France was hardly compatible with democracy in England. Burke’s declared
aim was to “maintain the spirit of freedom in its full vigour.” While it is
difficult to trace Burke’s ideas to any particular influence, it is interesting
to note that Cicero’s orations afford a striking parallel to Burke’s orations,
in the history of political ideas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Although Burke made a brilliant contribution to the
discussion of the problems of the day, his gaze not only surveyed his own time,
but was projected far into the future, since his oratorical utterances were at
once practical and philosophical. And in his ‘Reflections on the Revolution in
France,’ he has a significant comment on Dr. Prince which can however stand as
a general reflection on ill-advised and hasty economic change for the sake of
novelty, “wholly unacquainted with the world in which they are so fond of
meddling, and in- experienced in all its affairs, on which they pronounce with
so much confidence, they have nothing of politics but the passions they
excite.” He has warned us of a situation, “when individual freedom is
curtailed, in the name of the people: those who are subjected to wrong under
multitudes are deprived of all external consolation: they seem deserted by mankind,
overpowered by a conspiracy of their whole species.” Burke’s ideas flowed from
the ancient fountainhead of the ‘rule of law’. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
essence, the rule of law means that the activities of the Government should be
motivated by the ideals of justice and not by caprice, and that judges should
be independent of the executive. Switching on to India, one is inclined to
agree with Sir Ivor Jennings who wrote: “Essentially the Indian Constitution is
an individualist document. Its prophets are Burke, Mill and Dicey; yet some at
least of the members of the Constituent Assembly thought in collectivist terms.
The result is a curious dichotomy. On the one hand the individualism of the
nineteenth century has sought to limit the powers of the Government in the
interests of liberty; on the other hand the collectivism of the twentieth
century has sought to expand the powers of the Government in order that the
State may regulate economic life and, incidentally, restrict liberty. This
dichotomy in thought is primarily due to the fact that our leaders fail to see
the connection between national independence and individual liberty. And since
Indian Independence, there has been a gradual but sustained effort to increase
the powers of the executive at the expense of courts. Pandit Nehru had opposed
the idea of the Supreme Court being the final arbiter on the quantum of
compensation, on the plea that the Supreme Court of India ought not to make
itself a “third House of Parliament.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is well known that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth
amendments to the American Constitution constitute a source of reserved power
for the judiciary, to act as a restraining influence on legislative and
executive bodies when they tend to limit the freedom of the individual. While
there is no Due Process Clause as such in the Indian Constitution, the Indian
Constitution empowers Parliament to regulate property rights in India. Article
19 (1) (f) and (g) says that: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the fifth clause states that “nothing in the said sub-clauses shall affect the
operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State
from making any law, imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of
the right conferred by the said sub-clauses, in the interests of the general
public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.” The
“Right to Property” was originally guaranteed by Article 31 of the Indian
Constitution. According to the original provision in Article 31 (1), “No person
shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.” And Article 31 (2)
stated: “No property, movable or immovable, including any interest in, or in
any company, owning any commercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken
possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the
taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation
for the property taken possession of or acquired, and either fixes the amount
of the compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in
which, the compensation is to be determined and given.” However, on April 27,
1955 an amendment was introduced in the wake of a bitter controversy, which
substituted for Article 31 (2) the following clauses: (2) No property shall be
compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by
authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired
or requisitioned, and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the
principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be
determined and given, and no such law shall be called in question in any court
on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate. (2A)
Where a law does not provide for the transfer of ownership or right to
possession of any property to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled
by the State, it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition
or requisitioning of property, notwithstanding that it deprives any person of
his property.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Commenting
on it, Mr. Justice Douglas has remarked, in his scholarly work, <i>We the
Judges, </i>that “India has broken with one tradition of the law of eminent
domain.” He has also pointed out that “the 1955 Amendment casts a shadow over
every private factory, plant or other individual enterprise in India. The
legislature may now appropriate it at any price it desires–substantial or
nominal. There is no review of the reasonableness of the amount of
compensation. The result can be just compensation or confiscation–dependent
wholly on the mood of Parliament...If Parliament appropriates private property
for only nominal compensation, the spectre of confiscation would have entered
India, contrary to the teachings of her outstanding jurists.” It would be
difficult to deny that this Amendment which vested this power in Parliament,
will in actual practice delegate it to the ruling party, to be finally
administered by the bureaucracy. The situation is particularly conducive to the
growth of State Capitalism, if viewed in the light of the various measures
which have followed in the wake of the “Socialistic Pattern of Society”–Wealth
Tax, the Nagpur resolution on ‘Co-operative Farming,’ nationalisation of life
insurance, State trading etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Nagpur resolution on ‘Co-operative Farming’ is an innocuous resolution at first
sight; but upon serious reflection, its implications are obvious. As pointed
out lucidly by Mr. Minoo Masani, M. P., the introduction of co-operative
farming will mean that the property of the peasant “has been taken away from
him without telling him so, and he is being fobbed off with a scrap of paper
which a future Government will have no hesitation, on ‘equitable grounds,’ in
tearing up, because his utility to society ends on the day on which the farm
ceases to be his.” Mr. Nehru’s arguments in favour of co-operative farming are
by no means convincing; indeed they fall flat. In one of his replies to the
critics of co-operative farming, the Prime Minister said that “the momentary
reaction of a peasant might be to dislike these things, because he thinks land
is being carted away. It is wrong. Land is not being carted away to some other
country or continent. Land remains there and he will remain there.” Land, in
Russia, has not been carted away, but the Soviet peasant has lost his liberty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
scheme of co-operative farming is not only a dangerous measure in itself, but
must also be viewed in the present-day setting of increasing interference of
the executive authority. The erstwhile bastions of democracy in a pluralistic
State, such as the peasant, the free enterpreneur, the middle classes, the judiciary
and the free Press are gradually being made to sink into insignificance by
giving expression to a spate of calculated ridicule. A great judge known for
his brilliant intellect and moral integrity is invited to preside over an
enquiry and is later characterised as ‘lacking in intelligence’ simply because
his findings were not to the liking of the ruling party. And more often than
not, the judiciary is given gratuitous scraps of advice regarding the line of
judgement, in the interests of social reform. If an erstwhile colleague does
not approve of some new fangled proposals of taxation, she is dubbed as
exhibiting the mentality of “a petty capitalist.” And in case an elder
statesman warns against the hasty implementation of Hindi as the language of
administration, he is accused of carrying on a cold war. These are not healthy
trends in a democracy, since it would mean that any action which is
non-conformist” (however justified by reason) from the accepted angle of what
may be termed Yesmanship, would be criticised as an essay in cold war. And now
comes the turn of the Press. In Mr. Nehru’s words: “I know editorial opinion is
also strongly in favour of the Swatantra Party. How any sensible person can be
that I cannot understand. I can only come to the conclusion that editorial
opinion is based on personal views and prejudices and, may be, financial
backing.” Here we are not concerned with the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>programmes and
policies of the Swatantra Party as such. But this </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>strange
inference or deduction by which a person is judged as ‘sensible,’ is
unfortunate, to say the least. And still worse is the implied meaning in the
phrase ‘financial backing.’ Does it mean that the same charge can be levelled
against the Press, if it sings hymns in praise of the Congress Party? This line
of approach reduces the philosophy of the Fourth Estate to a level of thinking
which is hardly consistent with the ideals of enlightened democracy. And it
makes nonsense of the tradition of the freedom of the Press in India which can
be traced to the writings of Raja Ram Mohan Roy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
a two-party system constitutes a pre-requisite for a democratic set-up, it is
well to remember that it would be difficult to work out the system of
democracy, if one party is democratic and the other is rooted in a totalitarian
ideology. In India, until very recently, there wasn’t any party which could be
called an opposition party in the real sense of the term, since both the Hindu
revivalist parties and the Communist parties had rejected the basic ideals of
democracy and liberty. Mr. Rajagopalachari had advocated the case for a healthy
opposition even two years ago, when he pleaded for a party of the Right,
“without inviting any semantic controversy.” According to him, a party of the
Right gives expression to those distresses and disturbances “which are not less
real or important than the need for change and progress.” And since the
Congress Party had swung to the Left, Sri C. Rajagopalachari had outlined the
necessity of having a strong and articulate Right, and not a number of splinter
parties such as the ultra or the outer-Left. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Nehru told a gathering of Press representatives, that it is “a ghost-like party
and raises ghosts of a past century.” This is, perhaps, a clear confirmation of
the fact that “something is rotten in the State of Denmark” which constitutes
the Congress organisation. What are those ghosts? Could it be that the Gandhian
ideal of democracy, when projected through the forum of the Swatantra Party,
assumes the shape of a ghost? The Gandhian view of Socialism is crystalised in
the following significant terms: “I do not share the socialist belief that
centralisation of the necessaries of life will conduce to the common welfare,
when the centralised industries are planned and owned by the State. The
Socialistic conception of the West was born in an environment reeking with

ago, Prime Minister Nehru said: “Private enterprise may come in the way and
does come in the way of the functioning of the democratic apparatus.” This is a
clear indication of the fact that we in India tend to imitate a trend of
thinking which was fashionable in Europe several years ago. At a time when the
latest manifesto of the British Labour Party reflected the tendency to
denationalize, it was a trifle amusing that the Congress Working Committee had
presented the new nostrum of a “democratic and socialistic society” which is
supposed to be an improvement over the old slogan of the “socialistic pattern
of society.” This basic confusion in thinking arises from a failure to view the
two sectors, private and public, in their proper setting. An atmosphere of
hostility surrounds the private sector in India. Mr. Eugene Black stated the
position, clearly and unambiguously, in his memorable letter to Mr. T. T.
Krishnamachari. He observed: “In making my own comments, I should like first to
emphasise once again my conviction that India’s interests lie in giving private
enterprise, both Indian and foreign, every encouragement to make its maximum
contribution to the development of economy, particularly in the industrial
field. While I recognise that the Government itself must play an important role
in India’s economic development I have the distinct impression that the
potentialities of private enterprise are commonly underestimated in India and
that its operations are subjected to unnecessary restrictions there.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is needed is a real sense of dedication, and not a misplaced faith in the
infallibility of the public sector. A nationalised corporation is only a
landmark on the road to State Capitalism; but it cannot justify its existence
unless it fulfils certain statutory obligations to the public. In his work on
‘Problems of Nationalized Industry,’ Mr. W. A. Robson. has lucidly commented:
“Nationalisation cannot succeed without it; nor can democratic socialism prove
to be a superior conception of social or economic life. If the vast industrial
forces which work in the public corporations merely seek to exploit their
position to the full, the future will be grim and joyless indeed.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

concept of Socialism, whether it is called the “Socialistic Pattern of Society”
or the Co-operative Commonwealth, is based on the nineteenth century Marxian
theory of class war. Just as the famous American philosopher William James
wanted a moral equivalent for war, it is necessary to evolve a liberal
equivalent to Socialism in the phraseology of William James. Since we are
living in a democratic society, it is essential to preserve the choice of
individuals in the spheres of saving and consumer trades, based on the
mechanism of the market economy. What is needed, therefore, at the moment is to
formulate a comprehensive liberal alternative to Socialism with its main accent
on individual freedom which gives democracy its distinctive profile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

belief of our New Delhi planners in Socialism (which makes them think in terms
of constitutional encroachments into the domain of the individual) is based on
the pathetic assumption that Socialism signifies materialism, a higher standard
of living. Actually, the so-called materialism, of the Socialist way of life is
an “inverted kind of materialism” (as argued by Prof. Michael Polanyi) finding
its scope by building colossal structures and voicing the usual slogan of
“production and more production” at the expense of urgent popular goods. It is
high time we cry halt to this remorseless process of steadily divesting the
people of their property rights through the legislative apparatus, if we are to
preserve the spirit of democracy as distinguished from its outer trappings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

once observed with profound insight that “a political institution is a machine;
the motive power is the national character. With that it rests whether the machine
will benefit society or destroy it.” Ranade gave us an idea of the national
character of India when he said that “change for the better by slow
absorption–not by sudden conversion or revolution–this has been the
characteristic feature of our past history” in his address to a social
conference held as early as 1893. The success of democracy depends not only on
the strength of vigilant public opinion, but on the high level of thinking in
the various debates and discussions which form a regular feature of democracy.
In his “Reflections on Government” Sir Ernest Barker observes: “It is not the
worship of quantity: it is the worship of quality, that quality of the thinking
and discoursing mind which can dare to raise and to face conflicting views of
the Good, and to seek, by the way of discussion, some agreed and accepted
compromise whereby a true (because general) national will is attained, and a
national Good is secured which is really good because it is freely willed.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

can be a vital force, only if based on liberty. And the essence of liberty has
been summed up in the immortal words of John Stuart Mill: “There is in the
world an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over
the individual, both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation.
The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in
our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or
impede their efforts to obtain it.” What we need to cultivate in India today is
this frame of mind which springs from a creative combination of a liberal
outlook, a scientific temper and a democratic approach, and not a warped state
of mind which thrives on blind fanaticism, narrow nationalism and doctrinaire
socialism. It has been well said that no piece of writing on democracy can have
the finality of a conclusion. It is not enough if we merely express our
full-throated appreciation of the ideal contained in the vibrant statement that
“eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.” Indeed, if need be, we must be
prepared to sacrifice our careers if they compromise with our ideals, so that a
state of liberal democracy might flourish for ever. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

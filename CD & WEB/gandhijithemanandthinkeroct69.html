In this galaxy of great men, <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> is like a
bright star that shines apart. He is unique among them because he voluntarily
undertook the rigorous self-discipline of a saint. Without stepping aside from
the main stream of the life of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

a political leader. He actively strived to do all that he could for humanity,

among saints. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a saint-politician, he hardly left untouched any aspect of Indian life and
touched none which he did not ennoble. The fundamental fact which he <span

highest sacrifice. He repeatedly <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span> that all
men are equal. No man can choose his birth. He has no chance to choose to be
born in a particular group, rich or poor, in a particular caste, high or low,
in a particular race, white or black, in a particular country, highly advanced
or underdeveloped. Therefore, to love or hate any man purely on the basis of
his birth, caste, <span class=SpellE>colour</span> or creed is ignorance, pure
and simple. That was the guiding force behind his movement of religious
tolerance, human brotherhood and eradication of <span class=SpellE>untouchability</span>.

a Hindu because he saw no need to change. To be more precise, <span

that had been thought and said till then. He borrowed from all thinkers, from
Buddha to Marx, from all books, from the <span class=SpellE><i>Gita</i></span><i>

this does not mean that we should be silent before the tyranny of falsehood and

his philosophy. The more we speak about it the less we speak it. But as opposed
to dialectal materialism of Marx and Lenin, <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji’s</span>
philosophy can be called the ethical <span class=SpellE>dialectism</span>. Marx
struck a vital deviation from the traditional mode of philosophical thinking

interpret the world is the first step in changing it. The world changes whether
man wants it or not. Therefore, the real point according to <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span>
is to change the world to the benefit of all, to change it as it must be, not
as it has been. Therefore, whereas Marx and Lenin did not hesitate, in fact
advocated the use of force to destroy the creeds and institutions of the old
world, <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> strongly opposed the use of brutal
force and advocated conversion rather than destruction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Marx, the happiness of society is more important than the happiness of the
individual. Accumulation of wealth by an individual is a social injustice,
because it is exploitation of the fruits of the <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
of others. So it is the duty of man to fight against capitalism. In fighting
against capitalism, man has nothing to lose but everything to gain. Hence
revolution is in a way the midwife of socialism. History is a record of the
triumph of the rights of the people. For Marx, history is God and history will
not go wrong. As such any revolution is bound to<i> </i>succeed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> believed that social happiness is possible
only through individual happiness because society is a collection of
individuals. One cannot hurt others without hurting himself and hurting all.
Though all people are equal in one respect, in things like their physical needs,
different people have different capacities and some are more capable than
others. Those who are more capable naturally acquire more. Such people need not
be counted as enemies of society but we must make them as custodians of
society. To eradicate such men from time to time, in revolution after
revolution, is to<i> </i>destroy the precious to<i> </i>preserve the common. To

and Nehru met Churchill, Churchill used all his powers of oratory for about two
hours to convince <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> that the </span><span

<span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> listened to him so quietly that Churchill
began to feel triumphant and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hearts of <span
class=SpellE>Jinnah</span> and Nehru began to sink. In the end, <span
class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> quietly asked Churchill to give independence and
call it by whatever name he liked. Churchill was speechless with rage and <span
class=SpellE>Jinnah</span> and Nehru were dumbfounded. Later, <span
class=SpellE>Jinnah</span> asked <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> how he
could listen to a speech, advocating the opposite of all they wanted with a
deceptive air of making them feel that they were getting what they wanted, so
quietly and attentively and asked so calmly what he wanted to ask. <span
class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> replied with his </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>characteristic
childlike (not childish) innocence that there was no harm in listening to
others and all that Churchill was saying </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>reminded him only what
he should ask at the end. “Mr. Gandhi,” said <span class=SpellE>Jinnah</span>,
“I call you MAHATMA for the first time.” Gandhi was not only a good speaker but
also a good listener. He believed that anger controlled, like steam <span
class=SpellE>pressurised</span>, can be converted into energy. So trifles and
things that cannot be helped never perturbed him. Once <span class=SpellE>Mahadev</span>
Desai, being late, explained to <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> that he was
delayed because his friend lost his purse and had to search for it in vain. <span
class=SpellE>Gandhiji</span> said with a smile that purses lost cannot be
recovered by losing heads. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

things of life. When </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

flowers, he said that while appreciating the efforts of the owner he would have
felt </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

and vegetables were grown with such care. Then one of the men said that flowers
delight the soul with their beauty, <span class=SpellE>colour</span> and scent,
just as fruits and vegetables give nourishment. <span class=SpellE>Gandhiji’s</span>
reply was that fruits and vegetables were as full of <span class=SpellE>colour</span>
and fragrance as flowers if only we could perceive them. Beauty lies as much in
the eyes and mind of the beholder as in the objects seen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is really sad and painful that such a man and thinker<i> </i>was brutally
killed by a Hindu. That is how humanity always rewards those that serve them
most. But the great martyrs accepted the painful reward with the gentle words:
“Father, forgive them. They know not what they do...,” and triumph even in
their death. It is easy to kill or worship a man but very difficult to understand
and follow him. However it does not matter how a man dies but what really
matters is how he lived and what he did. Great souls never ask what man has
done for them but they always ask themselves what they have done for humanity
and the world. The moment when every man asks himself the same question, surely
the kingdom of God will appear on earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

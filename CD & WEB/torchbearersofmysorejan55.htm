</span>literature</span>, as in other fields of human activity, followed the
upheaval in the general consciousness of our Nation long held in the grip of
foreign influence and domination. Naturally, during that subliminal period, the
craving for new modes and the seductive attraction of a foreign language held
sway for a time: Burke and <span class=SpellE>Macaulay</span>, Gladstone and
Morley, Chaucer and Milton, to name only a few among the foremost masters of
English, were the gods that <span class=SpellE>hypnotised</span> the students
of art and literature. But it was only a temporary phase in the travail of a
nation to find its soul and re-discover the beauties that lay enshrined in its

the dawn of the twentieth century, however, came a new awakening that gave a
fresh direction and motif to the Indian mind and opened new paths. The urge
towards self-expression, <span class=SpellE>untrammelled</span> by text-books
and dogmas, was there in the Indian heart all the while. But with the release
from intellectual and political bondage, the springs of Indian culture
overflowed the country. The dawn of the present century, and the years that
followed, <span class=GramE>witnessed</span> the gradual unfolding of a
nation’s urge towards the fulfillment of its great destiny. <st1:country-region

was confined only to a few states in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

to this impact of new thought and ideology was <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

for the assimilation of new ideas, and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>
raced to the forefront as the torch-bearer of a quick-changing epoch in outlook
and culture. Much of the literature produced in the early stages of this
incubation persist was, however, inclined towards classicism of the old order,
reflecting the epic moods of a fast fading age. In the meanwhile, a daring
synthesis of the old and the new was in the making, jettisoning old patterns
and forms, and providing an outlet for new dreams and inspired melodies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the way in which <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>
reacted to this new order was at first not very reassuring. All interest was <span

culture and patterns of <span class=GramE>living,</span> and for a time it
seemed that the anticipated glow and warmth might prove illusory. However,
those who shook their heads in despair lived to see a sudden transformation in
the minds of the very men who swore by the Western yard-stick. The temporary
hiatus, a short but disturbing period of intellectual atrophy that usually
precedes an emotional outburst, lingered for a while only to give way to a
phenomenal output of literature in the language spoken by the men of the soil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

M. <span class=SpellE>Venkatakrishniah</span>, the Grand Old Man of Mysore. He
was verily the father of every progressive movement in the State. A journalist
by profession, he gathered round him a band of talented young men who looked
upon him as the apostle of the new movement in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>. But his orbit of influence was
limited, in the sense that he could not provide the requisite inspiration and
atmosphere for the intellectual class in the making. It was not because he
lacked great qualities; but his hands were so full with political and social
problems that he could not spare time for other forms of activity. He was a
grand man in every respect, a lovable personality and a pleasant
conversationalist, and immensely popular with all classes of people. Journalism
in those days in the capital of an <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was a hard job, a
nerve-racking profession with no bright prospect on the financial side, and
with the sword of official displeasure ever hanging over the head. Even in that
strained atmosphere, ‘<span class=SpellE>Tatiah</span>’ (grandfather), as he
was fondly called by those near and dear to him, was able to make his
personality felt by his breezy optimism and strong convictions. He was the
Moses of Mysore who showed his people the way to the Promised Land. Even in his
advanced age, he fought gallantly against the ravages of time and kept his
vision undimmed to the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had the unique fortune of meeting this grand man in his home at <st1:City

was fairly advanced in age. What struck me even then was his keen intellectual
alertness and sturdy commonsense, which combined to make him a shrewd observer
of men and things. He had a phenomenal flair for conversation, always full of
anecdotes interspersed with little humorous hits. He had a soft corner for me
in his big heart, and I always felt a pang whenever I took leave of him. He was
not by any means a rich man, but he exercised a beneficent influence on all
those who came into contact with him. I consider him as the earliest man in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City> to rouse the
slumbering consciousness of his people and make them see beyond their nose and
fight for the eradication of evil social, economic and political. He was a

his wide scholarship and keen political insight. His political philosophy sometimes

today, <span class=SpellE>Gundappa</span> is a versatile writer in Kannada. His
writings are conspicuous for their clarity, depth of thought, and profundity of
learning. He has no faith in ‘cheap clap-trap that merely amuses and entertains
but does not inspire and exalt. He caters to the thoughtful and serious-minded
people with precious stuff dug out from the rich mines of our ancient lore and
literature, and presents it with the polish and glow of his facile pen. His <span

taste and lofty outlook. While others catch the public imagination by parading
little follies as the main content of their literary wares, <span class=SpellE>Gundappa</span>
will not touch such ephemeral stuff, however easily marketable it may be. He
has set before himself a high standard from which he will not deviate for a

he talks in Kannada, English or Telugu; or Tamil, in all of which he is well
versed, he will entertain and enthrall you by his spicy and sparkling wit and
piquant comments on men and things with the <span class=SpellE>ardour</span>
and relish of a child. An hour spent with him is an education and a kind of
intellectual feast by itself. With a seemingly rugged exterior, <span
class=SpellE>Gundappa</span> displays a remarkable softness of heart and a fund
of sympathy the moment you come into contact with him. He has enjoyed the
confidence of great men like the late Rt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Sir P.
S. <span class=SpellE>Sivaswamy</span> <span class=SpellE>Aiyer</span> and Sri
T. R. <span class=SpellE>Venkatrama</span> Sastri, and a host of other eminent
men. No publicist, author and critic <span class=GramE>is</span> so well-known
and respected even outside the State as D. V. <span class=SpellE>Gundappa</span>.

language, as an adequate medium for the expression of a Nation’s thoughts and
ideals, has led to a revolution in the thought of writers and set free, in a
perennial flow, the long suppressed thoughts of the best minds. As a result of
the upsurge of this new consciousness, several writers who would have otherwise
remained unknown have come into prominence and made their mark in literary
craftsmanship. Nobody has contributed more to the encouragement and uplift of
Kannada writers than the late Sri N. S. <span class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rao,
the distinguished educationist of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>.
His influence on the Kannada writers of the day was largely on the personal
side, as his hands were always full with administrative work. But he had always
a good word for a promising writer or a struggling poet, and those who came
into contact with him felt like having a refreshing dip in a fragrant stream.
He was a veritable encyclopedia which included not only economics, his special
love, but also science, poetry, art and literature. Brilliant and versatile, <span
class=SpellE>Subba</span> Rao towered over others by his incisive intellect and
peerless vision and the grandeur of his manner. I pay this humble tribute to a
great man whose friendship still remains a precious memory with me, as that of
one who never <span class=SpellE>harboured</span> any malice even against his
worst traducers and smiled away little differences in spirit of abounding
generosity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unique privilege of attending a few of the Bible classes in the New Testament
conducted by him every weak at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Central</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. It was an
extra-curricular exposition on the hidden beauties of the old English contained
in that classic; it was certainly not meant as a thesis on religion by any
count. It was a wonderful and most exalting revelation to me how a man who had
bequeathed to his people that great Kannada piece, <span class=SpellE><i>Aswathama</i></span><i>,
</i>could be also a fluent and authoritative master-interpreter of the Bible.
His <span class=GramE>contribution to Kannada literature constituted a new
epoch by itself and led others to concise their energies into unexplored paths
and seek</span> fresh avenues for their literary efforts and ambitions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

excels by the sheer force of his intellect, the tenderness and sympathy of his
imagination and the unique gift of his simple yet captivating style. I read
some of his books with the help of a Kannada author, and even that superficial
study, combined with the knowledge of the man and his mission, continues to
remain an unforgettable experience and revelation with me. The Kannada language
itself assumed the shape of a beautiful idyll under the deft touches of his
pen. A writer who can bequeath to his people a prose-poem like that immortal <span

<span class=SpellE>Masti</span> is writing or talking, his mind is always

living and his love for his friends and fellowmen. His laughter is infectious
and he enjoys a joke as much as he loves to make one. There is no trace of any
assumed airs in his manner or approach; he puts you at ease the moment you meet
him. He is incapable of rubbing you on the wrong side, as some of the
better-placed people sometimes do, and he at once disarms you by his simplicity
and sweet manner of talking. He is your friend, adviser and teacher, and loved
by all. I am still unable to shake off the spell he cast over me when I came to
have the <span class=SpellE>honour</span> of his friendship twenty years ago.
That spell is not that of a magician: it is the charm of a rare music of the
soul, one that transcends time and defies analysis and endures through

I look beside <span class=SpellE>Masti</span> and allow myself to wander over
the contribution of his contemporaries in the field, one tragic figure first
rises before my mind, and that is the late T. P. <span class=SpellE>Kailasam</span>.
Cast in a heroic mould, <span class=SpellE>Kailasam</span> was a daring
craftsman who neither knew nor pursued any law or formula, except the one he
created for himself by<i> </i>his own inventive imagination. He was a kind of
literary <span class=SpellE>pedlar</span> who delighted to lay bare his wares
to the men in the street. He was born and brought up in affluent circumstances
and saw a great deal of the world in India and elsewhere. While he was in
England for his studies, he had a great opportunity to observe and <span
class=SpellE>analyse</span> the factors and conditions that made for the
greatness and contentment of Englishmen. He studied their dramas, their
theatre, their literature and social life, and returned to India with a mind
fully equipped with experience and knowledge of the wide world. For a time, he
was in official harness from which he soon broke away, for his rebellious
spirit and volcanic temperament could not be bound and made static in an
arm-chair or an easy environment. He loved the smell of battle and was thrilled
by the puissant call for war–war against social evils, injustices and follies
that were paraded in the name of tradition and culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kailasam</span></span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was not a reckless
iconoclast, though he might seem to be one. Behind that convulsive vehemence
against injustice and the <span class=SpellE>rigour</span> of man-made laws,
lay a heart pure and pellucid, responsive to tenderness and absolutely free
from <span class=SpellE>rancour</span> or animosity of any kind. He hated false
pretences and exposed them by a scathing use of his pen. His social plays were
full of vitality and charm. While he made people laugh and clap their hands in
glee, he also pierced their conscience by what was spoken on the stage in his
plays. Through his characters picked from the market-place and the by-lane, he
opened the eyes of those who were impervious to the changing values of life. He
was a Messiah of the poor, the downtrodden and the outcast; to redeem them from
their age-long serfdom and meek submissiveness to an archaic, out-<span
class=SpellE>moded</span> system was his sole mission in life. I cannot say
whether he has succeeded in his self-imposed mission, but it cannot be denied
that he prepared the way for the dawn of a vigorous literary upheaval, which
would cater not only to the needs of the intellectual classes but also lead to
the rapid redemption of the man in the street from the atrophy of a rigid
tradition and benumbing superstition. He set a new pattern in Kannada writing
so as to touch and <span class=SpellE>galvanise</span> the heart of the common
man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and fluent a writer in English as he was undoubtedly in Kannada. It was most
unique that he should have <span class=SpellE>focussed</span> his attention on
the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, both of which provided ample inspiration for

two of his famous English plays, are masterpieces in design and execution,
imagery and dialogue. His portrayal of <span class=SpellE>Ekalavya</span>
(‘Purpose’) is a brilliant study in human</span><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

such unswerving devotion. <span class=SpellE>Karna</span> was his hero; to him,

condemned </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as one who, torn between love and justice,
perpetrated the greatest crime in epic history by choosing the former. Besides
these </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>two standard plays, <span class=SpellE>Kailasam</span>
has given to us several sonnets which, for their depth and <span class=SpellE>fervour</span>,
were unsurpassed. A superb conversationalist, he had an uncanny penchant for <span
class=SpellE>humour</span> which could make you laugh or weep. His mind was a
vast store-house of information and his Kannada musical pieces, mixed adroitly
with English words and phrases just at a pinch, bespoke the rare originality of
his approach to creative art. He was verily one of God’s good men on earth and
lived to make his vision known and felt by all ardent devotees of the Muse. He
is gone, but the <span class=SpellE>Kailasam</span> tradition, the love and
ecstasy he generated in abundance, will, live and continue to enthrall us. I
cannot forget those precious moments I had the privilege of spending with him
on lonely nights when he was usually at his best; he would simply smother you
into a state of numbness by opening the flood-gates of his mind and uplifting
you to dizzy heights, or taking you through haunting subtleties that he alone
was capable of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Sampathgiri</span> Rao, I cannot write with restraint, for
we grew together into manhood, communed with each other and loved together the
things of the mind and the spirit. He had a brilliant career all through, and
if only he had aimed at it, he could have easily reached the top-most position
in the educational field. But he is a man of quiet ambitions and unassuming by
nature, and has the unique gift of peace and contentment. Kannada was not in
his line throughout his brilliant educational career, but the wonder is how
easily he has picked up a very good knowledge of the regional language late in
his life, with the zest and <span class=SpellE>ardour</span> of an inspired
evangelist. He has a remarkable frame of mind which can re-create and inspire.
As a friend and comrade, he is incomparable. A. N. <span class=SpellE>Moorthy</span>
Rao is a brilliant product of the Mysore University and a versatile writer in
Kannada. He is a kind of meeting-place between Western and regional literatures
and a very authoritative interpreter at that. I cannot conclude this rambling
survey without reference to the volcanic S. G. Sastri, who, in his active days,
was the pioneer of new industries in the Mysore State as well as a finished
scholar in Kannada. Today he is on the sickbed, like a lion in a cage, bent
down by age and the <span class=SpellE>rigours</span> of a strenuous career.
But to me, he will always remain a dynamic figure, overflowing with <span

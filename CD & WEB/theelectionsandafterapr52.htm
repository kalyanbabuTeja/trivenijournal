esteemed Editor of <i>Triveni </i>deserves the congratulations of all
democratic-minded people for the lead he has given in his editorial
observations (October 1951 and January 1952) before and after the elections to facilitate
the formation of orderly, stable and responsible Governments in the various
States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is quite relevant and useful to discuss briefly past happenings in the country,
<i>vis-a-vis </i>the results of the elections. The elections in Madras, and
more so in Andhra, should serve as a pointer with the disastrous defeats of six
important Ministers as well as of outstanding leaders like Sjts. Prakasam and
Ranga among several others. It may be considered easy to caution wisdom after
the event, but we should always try to profit from events that have happened.
Had the Congress Working Committee and the Parliamentary Board taken a more
realistic view of the allegations against the Prakasam Ministry in 1946 and
appointed a judicial tribunal, they would have allayed misgivings in the public
mind, irrespective of the findings of such a tribunal. Either the Prakasam
Ministry would have been absolved, or another Ministry enjoying both public and
party confidence would have taken its place. Subsequent unsatisfactory developments
could thus have been avoided. Similarly, when counter-allegations were made at
a later date by Sri Prakasam on the floor of the House against the next
Ministry, the High Command shouldered the entire responsibility. Instead, they
should have allowed a judicial tribunal to go into the charges, even if such a
procedure was not constitutionally warranted. That would have had a sobering
effect in the country–and quite possibly an independent tribunal would </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>have
arrived at the same conclusions as the Congress High Command in the case of
both Ministries. Besides it would have prevented the rift in the Congress and
the formation and strength</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ening of the K. M. P. and the K. L. P.
parties, especially in Andhra. The rift has been fully exploited by rival political
parties, particularly the Communists, leaving Madras in the wilderness for the
moment, in so far as the formation of a stable Ministry is concerned. Lack of a
clear cut policy in regard to the above, and the consequent organisational
weakness of the Congress in Madras, added to the confusion in the public mind.
The Communist Party with its catchy slogans such as “land for the landless”,
and “food for all” naturally attracted the support of the middle and poorer
sections of the electorate. Further, the continuance of controls, the
unsatisfactory food situation and meagre rations proved a major factor in the
propaganda against the Congress. Lastly, the lack of a definite and clear
enunciation of policy regarding the formation of the Andhra State increased
public frustration. Added to all these, while the Congress President, Pandit
Nehru, was vehemently insisting on merit and integrity as the main criteria for
the selection of Congress candidates, the public felt that the selection in
many cases was unsatisfactory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
no party has been able to secure an absolute majority in the new Madras
Assembly, the obvious choice is either for the Congress as the largest single
party to seek the co-operation of recent seceders like the K. M. P. and the K.
L. P. and even parties like the Socialists and Independents, in fact, of all
those that believe in strengthening democratic ideals as against totalitarian
and disruptive forces, and attempt the formation of a stable democratic
government in Madras, or for the Congress to remain in opposition and await
developments, which course, however, is beset with considerable risks, both to
the Congress and the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever
might be the ultimate outcome of the present uncertain situation, unless
sufficient attention is given to the economic aspect by all, and earnest
endeavours made to give effect to the social welfare aims embodied in the
Constitution, it may become too late to stop unconstitutional developments. In
this connection it is necessary to mention the Five Year Plan which envisages,
for instance; the bringing under the plough tens of millions of acres of land
with multi-purpose projects on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Scheme. If
this could be started and accomplished early and the present pressure on land relieved
by allotting lands to the landless on the basis of co-operative ownership, we
may be making good headway towards socialisation of the means of production in
an important sector. On similar lines several other issues can be tackled to
the advantage of the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Emphasis
has, however, to be placed on the time factor. Our immediate goal should be the
socialisation of production, distribution and exchange, consistent with
democratic traditions which would serve as the main bulwark against totalitarian
ideologies and undemocratic methods leading to disorder, and blood-shed. But in
the process of bringing about socio-economic reforms care should be taken to
avoid being hustled into hasty measures, whereby some section may be hard hit,
for instance, the middle classes. It must be admitted that there is a great
amount of reasonable dissatisfaction on the part of these classes, especially
in the lower grades–teachers for instance, who are developing leftist leanings,
who in their turn may influence immature minds in none too happy a direction.
This is an aspect that deserves serious </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>consideration.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A desire on the part of certain sections of public
opinion in the newly-elected legislatures to coalesce with the Communist Party
is unfortunate. Parties that believe in socialistic democracy and base their
creed on the guarantee to the individual of liberty of speech, liberty of
thought, and liberty of action, cannot have any truck with a totalitarian
ideology, based on dictatorship leading to violence and disorder. It must be
admitted that the Communists are a force in the country due to their mass
contacts, and discipline and unity in their ranks. Moreover the Communists
everywhere believe in their loyalty to Moscow and not to their own country, in
the first instance. This attitude of their’s cannot be tolerated by right
thinking people in this country, At the same time it must be clearly remembered
that if parties believe in socialistic methods, they must stir themselves to
action and secure the fundamental rights mentioned in the Constitution for the
common man in actual practice. It is, therefore, to be hoped that people
belonging to these groups will reconsider their attitude and join forces with
the Congress Party and evolve a dynamic programme to be accomplished in the
shortest possible time.</p>

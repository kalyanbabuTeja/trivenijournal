took up the challenge and said their say without mincing words. Some were so

individual talents! It was a great pity and shame, they said, to allow this to
happen and to see creative writing dead or almost dead in the country!
Litterateurs, all said and done, were men and women who needed food, clothing
and shelter and, much as it is said that difficulties increase the
potentialities of the writers, there must be the minimum comforts or amenities
provided. But who is to listen to the woes and groans of the needy litterateurs

who have more money than brains and try to buy culture and even put price-tags
on men and women of culture. And all that we can say of them is that, like <span
class=SpellE>Soamaes</span> in <i>The Forsythe Saga, </i>when men of property
try to buy off even their wives (whom they use like chattels) there is bound to
be trouble, for no man and woman worth their salt would ever like to be bought
off. Personality is a sacred thing and an individual is almost like a temple

writers are used as means to undesirable end and writers of quality will rather
die than sell their birthright–freedom–on which <span class=GramE>depends</span>
their whole creative edifice. Coming nearer home I felt it was a shame to pay
compliments to the poet <span class=SpellE>Makhan</span> Lal <span

who have showered him with <span class=SpellE>honours</span> and money probably

impulsive by nature and showy as a race! What about <span class=SpellE>Nirala</span>

which is supposed to be the most cultured of all countries in the world has so
few writers of real, creative talent. There are many reasons for this. Number
one reason is: that we, as a nation, yet do not know what we want from life,
leave alone the world of books or art; number two reason: we have yet not got
over our conceit that we are the best people in the world and that our culture
is the best (and instead of imitating the best of other countries we are
content with tapping ourselves in mutual self-satisfaction) and when a people
suffer from conceit, their work is correspondingly poor creativity. For creativity
implies lack of prejudice or ill-will. Number three reason and, what I believe
is the most important reason: that creative writers are not given recognition
nor encouragement because they are submissive to none in power, believing as
these writers do (and rightly so) that their power or strength can only be
obtained through hard work in keeping within the laws of life or nature. And
the scull-headed men in power cannot brook those in real power and clap on them
and see to it that they are on the bread-and-water level. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

How can there be tradition and the individual talent when the freedom of
democracy is not justified by everyday-living–when people of talents have to
beg for bread-and-butter–when corruption stalks the country and money which
should have bought off the best for man is used to hoard, and thus money which
should circulate is at a standstill–and prices shoot sky-high and the poor die
like flies and the country is visited by a man-made famine! This is neither
culture nor tradition, but we see a mockery of both in our country where next
to the Governor’s House or Parliament House there are hutments and on one side
we see the rich in all their glory and adjacent to them the very poor! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reasonable and even justice-minded people, but the question is: Are we? We
quibble over sections and make mountains of mole-hills and instead of the law
being used for the service of man we maim man in the name of law! It is a
paradox that <span class=GramE>we</span> who love living creatures, including
animals, kill off men. Or would the burning of the policeman on duty over the

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Creative writing, be it in the English or in any of
the Indian languages, is something that cannot be written to a plan or for a
programme. For creative writing by its very nature is free and the writer does
what he wants. (within bounds, of course!). No creative writer ever tries to
arouse the antagonism of any one people against another–and when he does it is
often unconscious (as in <span class=SpellE>shakespeare’s</span> play <i>The
Merchant of Venice </i>where Shylock is made to look and feel a beast and in
another play <i>Twelfth Night wh</i>ere <span class=SpellE>Malvolio</span> is
baited for the Puritan that he is). <span class=SpellE>Maupassant</span> could
see more qualities of<i> </i>good in a street-woman than in an ordinary wife
and this is not to say that a street-woman was better than a woman who happened
to be a wife. In fact, as sociologists have pointed out<i> </i>in their survey
of street-women, most street-women are accommodating because they see men in
such pitiable plights! There is a story (and <span class=SpellE>Maupassant</span>-readers
will remember it) of the woman who would cry in a cemetery during a funeral,
and it was one of her ruses to get at the pity of man and to be with him and
earn! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Creative
writers in India have enough material for <span class=SpellE>humour</span> as
much as weird stories, not to mention detectives and romantic stories–but the
pity of it all is that society is daily in a violent state of change, in spite
of the obsession of the people as a whole towards convention or tradition. And
those who have travelled overseas bring with them the uninhibited <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span>-pattern, which they like so much, and often live
in a colony all their own, or jostle with people of die-hard disposition. The
fact that man rules the roost in India makes him a lively character and the
fact, again, that women are submissive to men yet makes it difficult for
women-characters in short stories, novels or dramas, to behave with a free
rein, as they would do in overseas countries. Yet there is enough
explosive-material in the relationship between Man-and-Woman and more, if they
are of different grades (socially or intellectually). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stories, and even their age, we cannot put the clock back and we have therefore
to move forward even if it means a break in our convention or tradition. The
educated beings that we are we need to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> our
oneness with man the world over and to see in men and women the same basic
characteristics, depending on their upbringing and professions. A creative
writer gives birth to a dream-child every time he writes and we are people whom
the creative writer uses in any way he likes, depending on his purpose. The
sensitive beings that creative writers are, they do not forget the people,
places and things they see. Most people would call creative writers abnormal
and they are not wrong, for creative writers are by no means the normal beings
that we take them for. They may eat with us and move with us and even talk our
language but when they are with themselves they are different and even unique
and hate anything like the herd-instinct that motivates other humans to club
together. They are a paradox to themselves and to those who know them. One
moment they are as simple as can be and the very next they can be as wily as
wolves! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

their mystery to those whom they call the reading-public. They give out their
best and uncover the lid of the unconscious where all the filth of the ages
lurks within and lo! they are filthy no more but as clean as clean can be!
Creative writers are unafraid of public opinion–and why should they be when
they are daily discovering themselves and the greatness within themselves?
Milton brought out his best in his <i>magnum opus </i>as Goethe brought out his
best in <i>Faust </i>and creative writers reach people on all levels of
intelligence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

age is ripe for the epic, and epics we can write if only we as creative writers
<span class=SpellE>realise</span> our expansiveness of head and heart and soul.
Of course, we may not be a very poetic people, seeing that poetry is not that
good as prose is but we cannot gainsay the uses of poetry. Our poetry will
naturally be of a different brand from what we were accustomed to. It will be
in the line of <i>The Waste Land, </i>for we cannot help seeing our age as
topsy-turvy, the age of <span class=SpellE>Kaliyug</span>. We feel the forces

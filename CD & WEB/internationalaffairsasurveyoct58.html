recent international developments there are three which deserve notice in this
survey. The first is the series of political revolutions resulting in the
establishment of the rule of army commanders in some of the countries of <st1:place
w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>. The second is the extension into the offshore
islands of <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and the <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Formosa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Straits</st1:PlaceType>

and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The third is the endless and fruitless debate in the United Nations on
Disarmament and the suspension of nuclear tests–a debate which makes it quite
clear that the World Organisation is at present only a forum for propaganda and
mutual recrimination by the Soviet and the American blocs, and that unless and
until it is completely transformed it cannot become an organ for the
maintenance of peace and security–the most important of the purposes for which
it was brought into existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that the first of the political revolutions broke out. A few army generals
inspired to a great extent by the example of President Nasser of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> plotted
secretly against the old government, murdered the King and his Prime Minister
and made themselves the rulers of the country. They established a military
regime in place of the old feudal one. There was no democratic urge in the
country and not only did the people not make any protest against military rule
but they also welcomed it, as they expected that it would change those policies
of previous government which ran counter to the spirit of </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
was expected it established closer contact with President Nasser who today is regarded
as the best embodiment of Arab nationalism. It also established closer
relations with Soviet Russia and other Communist countries, thus reversing the
policy of the earlier government which <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> the
West and which was a party to the Baghdad Pact. It also called on the British
to evacuate the few air bases which they still had in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is
this anti-<span class=SpellE>westernism</span> that is the most spectacular
result of the military <i>coup </i>in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Baghdad</st1:place></st1:City>.
Whether it will be able to solve the social and economic problems which are of
a more fundamental character, <span class=SpellE>modernise</span> the outlook
of the people and raise their standard of living, is a question which it is not
possible to answer now. The main fact to be noted is the setting up of a
military regime of a dictatorial character. There was no attempt at
establishing democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

next country in which political power was seized by the military is <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It
closely followed the Middle Eastern model–the model of Nasser–in this
connection, though in every other respect it is poles apart from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The army
<i>coup </i>here is certain to produce more serious consequences than that in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> or
elsewhere. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a big country; it has a large population and a well-trained and homogeneous
army. It is an active member of both the <st1:City w:st="on">Baghdad</st1:City>
and S. E. A. T. Organisations and as such is closely allied with the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
receiving from that country substantial military and economic aid. A military
regime in a country like this will be a more disturbing factor to the <span
class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> States, speaking the language of war in the
settlement of any disputes she may have with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
military revolution here is significant from another point of view also. The
Constitution which was framed for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <span class=SpellE>finalised</span>
in 1956 was a democratic one. It was expected that under it free institutions
would come to stay here. But all such hope is now lost. One of the reasons put
forward by those who established the military regime in justification of their
action is that in a country like <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, with only eighteen per
cent of the population being literate, democracy could not work. In their
opinion a long period of tutelage would be necessary before conditions become
ripe for introducing democratic institutions. One of the speeches of General <span
class=SpellE>Ayub</span> Khan, the dictator, made it clear that several years
earlier such an opinion was entertained by <span class=SpellE>Gulam</span>
Mohammed who invited him on that ground to take over power. Those who love free
government will naturally regret the happenings in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Under
pressure from the army the President of Pakistan, <span class=SpellE>Iskandar</span>
Mirza, who swore two years ago to preserve the Constitution abrogated it. He
dismissed the Central and Provincial governments, dissolved the National
Parliament and Provincial Assemblies, abolished all political parties and set
up a regime of total martial law. The reasons assigned for taking these drastic
steps would justify the establishment of military regimes in all the countries
of <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> and perhaps in many countries in other
parts of the world. It was said that in the course of the last few years
self-seekers in the garb of political leaders ravaged the country, bartered it
away for personal gain, with self-aggrandisement and thirst for power as their
main objectives. By their conduct they created chaotic conditions throughout
the land. They accentuated provincial feelings, religious animosities and
racial bitterness. The country came to be filled with smugglers, black-<span
class=SpellE>marketeers</span> and other “social vermin, sharks and leeches.”
These became responsible for scarcity of food, for high prices and for other
widespread evils. Instead of moving forward the country began to move
backwards. In the midst of this unhealthy and corrupt atmosphere there was only
one institution that was pure. It was the army. “It was free from politics, a
model of devotion to duty and integrity and imbued with the spirit of service
to the people and capable of effectively defending the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>country.”
The conclusion was drawn that the country could be saved from the rapacity of
politicians and other unsocial elements by the Army leaders. There was no other
way of salvation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is how throughout history military dictators justified their rule. In a
democracy, when things are mismanaged by the party in power, it can be replaced
by another party without any recourse to force. This is its great virtue. A
military dictator may, of course, cleanse the evil atmosphere to some extent
through a reign of terror. But what guarantee is there that he will have the
wisdom and the ability to carry out all the social and economic reforms that
the country needs or that administrators under him would be less corrupt? What
if some other aspirants for power in the army conspire to overthrow him?
Military dictatorship is no answer to the defects in Asian societies which in
many cases are a legacy of either feudal rule or colonial rule. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
proclamation of martial law was naturally followed by strict censorship of the
press, the arrest of political enemies and rivals and the so-called black-<span
class=SpellE>marketeers</span>, the prohibition of strikes and peaceful
demonstrations, house searches etc. Whipping has been made the punishment for
very many crimes. It remains to be seen to what extent this strong regime will
be able to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms. This is the big
question mark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is another country where power over the State was taken over by the
Commander-in-chief of the army. Of course this is not a new phenomenon in that
country. There was there at all times a struggle for power among rival leaders
and it was last year that the present Commander really established himself in
control of the State. But till about a few weeks ago he kept up the appearance
of having the country ruled by Ministers, with a National Assembly, with
political parties and a free press functioning more or less normally. He now
chose to abrogate all these and proclaim himself the sole dictator. He must
have been very much influenced in this by what happened in <st1:country-region

is one thing which is noteworthy in regard to what happened in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
reason put forward in justification of the new military regime is the growing
menace of Communism. The Communists, it is said, have become more active in
recent months and they have been able to win over several organs of the press
and several sections of the people. The military revolution in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> is

surprise when at the end of September the Prime Minister announced his decision

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Why
did U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span> decide on such a transfer of power? All the
facts are not known but one or two points are clear. There was split in the
Anti-Fascist Freedom League which was the party that brought freedom to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Burma</st1:place></st1:country-region> and which
was in power all these years. There was a dissident group in it which wanted to

no-confidence in him and his ministry. But U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span>

defeated. Serious <span class=GramE>trouble been</span> from that fateful day.
Since then U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span> was suspected by several sections of
the public of moving in the direction of Communism and paving the way for the
establishment of a Communist government. This suspicion gained strength when he
granted certain concessions to the Communists on the understanding that they
would surrender their arms and work as a constitutional party. There was
nothing illegitimate in adopting a policy like this but the public
misunderstood him because of the <span class=SpellE>rumours</span> that the
Communists were not really prepared to surrender arms, that it was all their
tactics to take part in the elections which were originally proposed to be held
in November, and that they would resume their rebellious activities if in the
elections they failed to get a substantial success. This suspicion was
strongest in the army circles. For ten years the army had been engaged in
fighting the Communists who were carrying on a war against constituted
authority. The army felt that U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span> was now betraying
it. There were also <span class=SpellE>rumours</span> of a plot–by
Communists–to assassinate the army commanders, disband the army and take over
power. All this contributed to unrest in several regiments which began to defy
civil authorities and resort to all sorts of crime in several localities. There
were also <span class=SpellE>rumours</span> of an army <i>coup. </i>Law and
order were undermined. It was then that U <span class=SpellE>Nu</span> came to
the conclusion that so long as he was suspected by the army as being in league
with the Communists there was no possibility of his government carrying on its
work in a normal manner. He could have resigned and advised the President to
dissolve the Parliament and hold general elections. But he felt that owing to
the breakdown of law and order and the growth of brigandage free and fair
elections could not be held.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was then
that he decided that the only course was to invite the Commander-in-chief of
the army to become the Prime Minister, form his own non-party Cabinet and carry
on the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is, however, an essential point of difference between what happened in Burma

peace and order and create all other conditions necessary to have free and fair

in temporary eclipse. Subsequent developments will show whether there will be
any need to revise our views about the future of democracy in that country. For
the time being, however, power in Burma is held by the Commander-in-chief of
the army (though it is said that he holds it in his individual capacity and not
in his official capacity) as is the case in Iraq, Pakistan and Thailand. This

associated with them. The suspension of democracy and the postponement of
general elections to 1960 were the outcome of disturbances caused by
discontented groups in different parts of the republic. It was also due to too<i>
</i>much criticism of governmental policies indulged in by opposition parties
and the resort to strikes rather too frequently, not with a view to better the
economic condition of workers but to achieve political objectives. Whatever it
be the conclusion follows that in most of the countries of Asia political power
is passing into the hands of either military commanders or self-chosen leaders.

is not much to be said about the situation in the offshore islands of China and
in the Formosa Straits which at one stage threatened to develop into a major
war between the United States on one side and the Soviet-China bloc on the
other. The difficulty here has arisen owing to the unrealistic policies adopted
by the United States. There is a belief still entertained by a section of the
American public that the Communist regime in China can be overthrown and that
Chiang can be brought back from<i> </i>Formosa and made the supreme ruler of
the Chinese mainland. It is because of this that a strong American fleet is
stationed in the straits of Formosa and large amounts of American military aid

mainland wants to complete its task by occupying <span class=SpellE>Quemoy</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Matsu</span>–the offshore islands–and the island of
Formosa. These have been a part of China and whoever ruled over China also
ruled over them in recent centuries. By the use of force the Communists drove
away Chiang from the mainland and they would have succeeded in driving him away
from the offshore islands and Formosa, had it not been for<i> </i>the Americans
who are standing in their way. There is nothing illegitimate in their using

tension in this area cannot be eased until China and the United States come to
a reasonable understanding on the issue of these islands. The best course is
for the United States to recognize that it is mainly a domestic issue to be
settled by negotiations between the Communists and Chiang. The former are quite
ready to enter into such negotiations. The latter refuses to have anything to
do with them because of the American help that has been promised to him. Large
numbers of Americans feel that the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of Formosa
has nothing to do with the possession of <span class=SpellE>Quemoy</span> and <span

of the United States government accepting this view. If it shows courage and
imagination in accepting it, there is a prospect of the tension being eased
temporarily at least and negotiations may be started on the future of Formosa.
It is quite possible that China may not embark on a war with the United States
on the issue of Formosa, though she may be unwilling to agree to Formosa being
made a separate State–a proposal which has often been put forward by the
Western allies of the United States who speak of two Chinas. Or the future of
Formosa may be left to be decided by a plebiscite. International opinion is
very much in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the United States permitting
Communist China to occupy the offshore island and it is best for her to yield
on this limited issue. If this is done there will be a more <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>

view of health and the <span class=SpellE>utilisation</span> of resources now
spent on armaments for improving the economic condition of the masses of people
in the under-developed areas of the world. They will not, however, solve the
problem of peace and security. There were wars in the pre-nuclear age. There
were wars when the armaments in the bands of States were far less in quantity

have a monopoly in regard to the use of force and every State should be legally
prohibited from using it. It is only in this way that domestic peace and

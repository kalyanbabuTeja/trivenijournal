<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>CHIDANANDA DASGUPTA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>[<i>The author who has produced a film on Dr <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>
Coomaraswamy has many interesting disclosures to make about this great
authority on Indian Art. </i></span>–EDITOR]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the course of an interview <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>the
film, Dr Sherman E. Lee, Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, said: “If
Coomara­swamy had been alive today, he would have become a culture hero <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>the younger generation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Indeed,
I made my rediscovery of Coomaraswamy not through his writings on art, but
through some of his essays on the state of the modern industrial civilization.
Years ago, I had read his <i>History of Indian and Indonesian Art </i>and the
essays in <i>The Dance of Shiva. </i>I had known vaguely that he had been
associated with the cultural reawakening in this region, but over the years my
image of him had narrowed down to that of a scholar whose work had become
somewhat mildewed milestones in the study of Indian art.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was when I came across a paperback reprint of his <i>Christian and Oriental
Philosophy of Art </i>that, turning its pages, some fragments caught my eye: “One
of the most obvious characteristics of our culture is a class division of
artists <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>from<i> </i></span>workmen. We
have come to think of art and work as incompatible...and have <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for<i> </i></span>the first time in history
created an industry without art.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
went on to speak, in this address at Harvard University in 1937, of today’s “exaggerated
standards of living and depreciated standards of life. It is one of the
greatest counts against our civilization that the <i>pleasures </i>[italics
mine] afforded by art, whether in the making or of subsequent appreciation, are
not enjoyed or even supposed to be enjoyed by the workmen at work. It is taken <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for<i> </i></span>granted that while at work
we are doing what we like least, and while at play what we should wish to be
doing all the time. The craftsman likes talking of his handicraft, but the
factory worker likes talking of the ball game. An industry without art provides
a necessary apparatus of existence–an apparatus lacking the essential characteristics
of things made by art, the characteristics, viz., of beauty and significance.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
began to read more of Coomaraswamy and discovered that his Harvard address “Is
Art a superstition or a way of life?” elaborated on a theme that had begun in his
early writings in Ceylon around 1904. I also found that I had not been alone in
my ignor­ance of the larger social significance of his work and in regarding
him merely as a great art scholar and pundit. More than a genera­tion had lost
touch with his social philosophy and its relevance to our times. At the time
that he frequented India in the 1910s and ’20s, he had been regarded as a vital
part of the cultural resurgence of that era, and not just as an art scholar. But
in later years, he became increasingly to most people a scholar of Indian art
living in the United States. His work became more and more confined to the
world of scholarship, more particularly scholarship in Indian art. And that
cloistered world, while acknowledging him as a master in the interpretation of
art, paid scant attention to his idea of society which arose from his idea of
art. It is only recently that his work has begun reaching a wider public
through paperbacks; as a social philosopher, he is coming into his own. A
rediscovery of Coomaraswamy has become imminent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was therefore not surprised at Dr Lee’s comment about Coomaraswamy and the
younger generation. I had rediscovered him from that angle anyway, and had
already resolved someday to make a film on the man. The true significance of
his work had been forgotten, and had to be held up to the world and especially
to India once again. Perhaps, a film could contribute something to this task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>No
wonder then that the question my colleague B. D. <span class=SpellE>Garga</span>
and I had to answer most frequently wherever we went was; <span class=GramE>Who</span>
is this <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span> K. Coomaraswamy?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Through
frequent repetition, our answer reached a tele­graphic leanness of form: “He
was a Ceylonese of Indian origin born of an English mother, brought up in
England and trained in geology. But he wrote more than 500 publications on
Indian and Asian art, most of them in his 30 years at the Boston Museum, and
became its greatest single interpreter and also a social philosopher of
significance.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was in Boston in 1968, and went to see Donna Luisa Coomaraswamy, <span
class=SpellE>Ananda’s</span> fourth, and last, wife. She was then working on a
definitive edition of his works sponsored by the <span class=SpellE>Bollingen</span>
Foundation. A common friend, Robert Steele, Professor of Film at Boston <span
class=SpellE>Universtity</span>, took me <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to
</span>see her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
I announced my plans for making a film on her husband, she fell silent. I
waited anxiously to know if she was going <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>to </span>co-operate. All <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span>
photographs, manuscripts, records and other memorabilia were with her and
without her help it would be virtually impossible <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>to </span>make the film. She had herself taken numerous photographs <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>him, having been a well-known
photographer. In fact, it was as a photographer that she had first made <span
class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> acquaintance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
a while she looked up and asked me: “Have <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>you </span>had any education, young man?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
have been numerous occasions in my life when I have been at a loss <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for </span>words. This was certainly one of
them. But Donna Luisa was not going <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to
</span>give up. She looked on, and waited. Suddenly intelligence dawned on me.
I managed <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>remember and
recite a verse in Sanskrit from the <i>Mahabharata. </i>My rusty Sanskrit saved
the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She
said: “All right, I will help you. What do <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>you </span>want?” I said money, because I had not yet found a sponsor.
She did not have any, nor did she have any ideas on where I could find some.
But we became friends. It was a sad moment <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>for </span>me when a year later <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Robert
</span>Steele <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>wrote </span>to say that
she had died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Talking
about sponsors reminds me of my poor effort <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>to </span>convince someone in authority of the worthiness of my
project. This person was knowledgeable on art, so I had high hopes of him. But
after hearing <span class=GramE>me</span> out he said something that shattered
me and once again left me speechless: “<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>How
</span>can you make a film on him? He was so dull.” My intelligence did not
make even a late start; <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>too </span>dumbfounded
to reply, I lost a potential sponsor. Years later, the reply occurred <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>me. No man who had four wives and numerous
admirers among beautiful women could be called dull. He was more than six feet
tall, handsome and distinguished. Mrs. Margaret Marcus, herself an art expert
who lives in Cleveland, remembered him vividly. “He had the lanky grace of a <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>cowboy,” s</span>he said. “He loved fishing
and was a very good cook. <span class=GramE>Also a good photographer.</span> He
once cooked me a curry that was so hot that the top of my head hit the ceiling.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“All
his wives had to do something,” Mrs. Marcus continued, “Ethel translated Ceylonese
classics. Alice, whom he renamed <span class=SpellE>Ratan</span> <span
class=SpellE>Devi</span>, sang Indian classical music–to the satisfaction of
Rabindranath Tagore. Stella danced Indonesian dances. <span class=SpellE>Zlada</span>,
who called herself Donna Luisa or something, was a professional photographer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mrs.
Marcus showed us exquisite drawings of Stella made by Coomaraswamy – and also
some photographs taken by him. The drawings were nudes, 28 of which were
published, and had nothing to do with Indian tradition. They were nearer,
rather, to sketches made by <span class=SpellE>Rodin</span> or <span
class=SpellE>Mailol</span> before sculpting a figure. All of them in the book
were not equally successful. But the ones collected by Mrs. Marcus, with <span
class=GramE>her own</span> unerring judgement, were exquisite. The photographs
my cameraman <span class=SpellE>Purnendu</span> Bose enthusiastically approved
of were wintry landscapes. Mountains dimly discernible in the mist seemed to
exercise a fascination for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To
the suggestion that Coomaraswamy was a dull man, Mrs. Marcus shook her wiry old
head violently, and for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
class=SpellE>Ananda’s</span> son (by Donna Luisa) Rama, Heart Surgeon at a
hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut, revealed to me Coomara­swamy the
film-maker. I cursed myself as I carried the heavy projector across the <span
class=SpellE>overbridge</span> at the Greenwich railway station. It was so
heavy that I could hardly walk. Rama was busy throughout the day and yet so
anxious to help that he had given me an appointment for the night. After dinner
at the beautifully sited local club, his wife Bernadette took leave of us and
Rama and I settled down to an all-night session of talking, identifying and
dating innumerable photographs and seeing <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span> K. <span
class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> films. The first one was on a bull-fight in
Spain, shot sometime in the late twenties. I sat up. There was nothing
amateurish about the tones; or about the way the camera was moved. Everything
had been shot from one point of view – the spectator’s fixed seat – but the
excitement of the event had been captured so well that one did not feel the
same­ness. Another was on the geishas of Japan. This one had detailed subtitles
describing the function of the geisha and explaining the meaning of her
actions. There was another which Coomaraswamy had shot in South India, in which
aged <span class=SpellE><i>devadasis</i></span><i> </i>demonstrated <span
class=SpellE><i>mudras</i></span><i> </i>from <span class=SpellE>Bharata</span>
<span class=SpellE>Natyam</span>. And then there were many of <span
class=SpellE>Ananda</span> himself vacationing in Maine, where he went every
year. Some of these showed a fine feeling for landscape. I particularly
remember a long-lasting beautiful shot of a <span class=SpellE>horse­swimming</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After
the films we walked till five in the morning. Rama and his wife are ardent
Catholics, but he did not see any real difference between his father’s beliefs
and his own. We agreed on many things, disagreed on others. Finally I went to
bed. “At ten, Francis will wake you, and Bernadette will drive you to the
station at quarter to eleven when she takes the children to school.” Francis,
who looks like an angel, shyly woke me in time. As Bernadette waited in the
car, I was hauling the projector down the stairs, fell and sprained my ankle. I
limped to the car and decided not to say anything about it. At Grand Central
Station in New York, I took the risk of leaving the projector on the platform
and went to find a porter. When we came back, the projector was still there. I
limped throughout the rest of my stay in the United States. But the discovery
of the films had been beyond my wildest dreams. No, <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>
Coomaraswamy was not a dull man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
of <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> oldest and most consistent admirers
is <span class=SpellE>Dorai</span> Raja <span class=SpellE>Singam</span>, a
school teacher who lived in Ceylon for a long time but later set up home in
Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. In fact, “KL” was my first port of call and the
object was solely to meet him. Some years ago, <span class=SpellE>Dorai</span>
Raja <span class=SpellE>Singam</span> had published two volumes of homage to
his <i>guru, </i>containing tributes from scholars all over the world. All
through his life he had collected each scrap of paper he could get on
Coomaraswamy, corresponded with him and practically everyone who had known him.
At present, he is getting ready for publication of a volume of <span
class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> letters. We pored over his collection in his
peaceful home miles away from the hubbub of Kuala Lumpur, photographed letters
and sketches, and listened to his account of the man whose commemoration has
become the mission of <span class=SpellE>Dorai</span> Raja’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was he who first introduced me to the manuscript of Roger <span class=SpellE>Lipsey’s</span>
voluminous book on Coomaraswamy, to be published soon by Princeton University.
It is not only a biography but a detailed assessment of his work, written after
a great deal of research. <span class=SpellE>Lipsey</span> had sent his
manuscript over to <span class=SpellE>Dorai</span> Raja <span class=SpellE>Singam</span>
for him to check the facts and in turn checked the facts I was to narrate in
the film. I pored over his manuscript before finalizing the narration. <span
class=GramE>But more than that I was glad to find at last an authoritative
biography written of a man who hated biographies as far as he himself was
concerned and always refused to give details of his personal life, extolling
invariably the anonymity of the Indian traditional artist as his ideal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
suppose making a film about a man is a little like writing his biography.
Although the film is more of a documentary on his work than on his life, in
finding out about him, in trying to understand him, I had to take the attitude
of a biogra­pher. You begin to understand your man only when you begin to see
the contradictions he tried all his life to resolve or perhaps to ignore. Many
writers and great men emerge to us all of a piece, adding up to a consistent “image”.
When you know all or most of his aspects, including the hidden ones, you begin
to feel a special relationship with him. Your knowledge of his weaknesses not
only does not diminish, but actually enhances the warmth of your feeling for
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One
of the contradictions of <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> life arose, I
feel, from the distance between him and the home of the art he loved. In his
salad days he was an ardent social reformer, a man committed to the cause of
his country’s regeneration. “I thought how different it might be if we
Ceylonese were...not ashamed of our own nationalities,” he had said. India was
his spiritual home. Writing in his <i>Essays on National Idealism, </i>he had
said: “I do not believe in any generation of the Indian people which cannot
find expression in art; any reawakening worth the name must so express itself.”
He was studying the traditions of a culture with whose present reality he was
deeply concerned and closely connected. Over the years, however, India and
Ceylon became more than memories; they became idealized in his mind and
unrelated to the struggles, agonies, and the compulsions of these countries. He
did not live to see the growth of Independent India. He would have disapproved
of much of what we are doing today. He would probably have said, as he had said
in 1910, that it will matter much whether the great ideals of Indian culture
have been carried forward or allowed to die. It is with these that Indian
nationalism is essentially concerned, and upon these that India’s fate as a nation
depends. He would no doubt have hated the advent of the plastic bucket. Yet he
would have been a part of the struggle, trying to make his voice heard with a
sense of urgency and immediacy which distance eventually removed. He lived in America’s
present and India’s past. That is why towards his later life, his statements on
the future of uncontrolled industrial materialism rang true, being close to the
living reality. His spirit remained universal whether he spoke of the dangers
of the proliferation of human wants instead of the refinement of their quality
or of the dangers of imitative materialism overwhelming India’s special message
to the world. But his understanding of present-day India became too dim for his
statements to retain much relevance. Similarly, his glorification of India’s
past became increasingly uncritical and unrelated to historical fact. Not only
India’s present but India’s past grew more and more mythical–more of a state of
mind than a statement of history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
this transition there must have been a secret agony which some of the
photographs of him in the late thirties betray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
contradiction lay in his opposition to industrialism and his enthusiasm for
mediaeval craft society. Coming years after William Morris, the scientist in
him must have known the impossibility of actually reviving the mediaeval
structure of society. As early as 1904, he had sought a way of life for our
land which would remember the old wisdom and yet not despise the new. Even in
urging India to remain true to her heritage, he had never specifically asked
her to shun industry. But he never faced up to the basic contradiction in his
mediaevalist posture, and if he did attempt to resolve it, he never spoke of it
in his work. He showed no way to a new synthesis between science and tradition.
In his early years in Ceylon and in India, there is some suggestion of his
acceptance of the <span class=SpellE>Tagorean</span> ideals of synthesis; but
in his later years, probably because he was so far removed from the realities
of these newly independent countries, his accent is solely on <span
class=SpellE>mediaevalism</span> on the one hand and condemnation of industrial
society on the other. Where he did say something valid for the younger
generation in America was in his criticism of the state of society rather than
in prescriptions for a way out of its impasse. In this he is no different from
other critics of a society in danger of being swept off its feet by an
accelerating rate of change in science and technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
value of his social philosophy lies more in the acuteness of his analysis of
what industrial society does to the individual–an analysis made in the early ‘thirties.
In regard to the future, he had no particular vision of what was likely to come
about, but held up the values which higher social organization must provide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Reading
his poems, looking at his drawings of nudes, his photographs, his motion
picture photography of bull-fighting in Spain or of himself fishing in the
Maine woods, the photographs of his wives–German, English, American and <span
class=SpellE>Argentinian</span>–one can conjure up an image of Coomaraswamy
totally opposed to the well-known image of him as a sort of bearded Oriental
savant. It is as if these images were two sides of a coin with East printed on
one and West on the other. It was always the Eastern side that was more visible
to the world. The metaphor should not be pushed too far, because his writings
show indeed a fusion of an Oriental intuition with the scientific discipline of
the West; but behind the surface unity of his life and work it is impossible
not to detect a core of unresolved contradictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If
Coomaraswamy did not project these contradictions in his writings, it was not merely
in order to present a unified image. It was due more to his dislike of the
glorification of the individual. He never wanted to analyze the artist as a
special kind of man. His ideal was man, anonymous, yet always “a special kind
of artist.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
am no expert on art, but I had to try to understand what made Coomaraswamy
unique among art scholars. It was, I <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>think,
</span>the totality of his vision. He was able, unlike many scholars, to relate
to art to language, literature, history, philosophy and religion. Not only to
so relate it consciously, but simply to see it as an integral part of human <span
class=SpellE>endeavour</span> at the given time and in the given society. He
did not believe in art for art’s sake; his theory of art was utilitarian. An
image of God is an aid to contemplation just as a water pot is an aid to the
job of carrying water. To all who believed in this, it was impossible to
separate the beauty of art from the inner harmony of the society that produced
it. It was thus essential to explore the relationship of art to the other
functions of society. In this lay his great advantage over many Western
scholars of Indian and Eastern art who, basically unable to penetrate the other
disciplines, have to confine themselves largely to a discussion of art in
isolation from the totality of the culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Where
he scored over Indian scholars was in his knowledge of the West and in his
scientific training. The reports he wrote as the Director of Mineralogy in
Ceylon have the same precision in the marshalling of facts and the logic of
conclusion that his work on art shows. An example of this is his classic <i>History
of Indian and Indonesian Art. </i>In less than 300 pages, he wrote the most
effective survey of all phases and aspects of Indian and South-east-Asian art
ever brought into a single work. The wide range of his knowledge across East
and West enabled him, in his own words, to “use one tradition in order to
illuminate another.” He began as a nationalist seeking to re-establish the
glory of the Indian tradition. His means were as scientific as his expres­sions
were controlled; yet in proving to the conference of 400 <span class=SpellE>Orientalists</span>
assembled in Copenhagen in 1908 that the Buddha image had originated in India
and had not been imported from Hellenistic sources, there must have been a
quiet sense of national pride. But when he spoke at the celebration of India’s
Indepen­dence in Boston in August 1947, he said: “Indian culture is of value to
us not so much because it is Indian as because it is culture.” He had <span
class=GramE>risen</span> above all national chauvinism. The student of art must
cease to be a provincial; he must universalize himself. Human individuality is
not an end in itself, but only the means.­</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
good part of <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> work was obsessed with
the differentiation of Indian art from art in the West, and much of what he
said seems self-evident today. In his early years, the individuality of Indian
art could be brought out only by that differentiation. Scholars of Indian art
were at that time invariably European and mostly British; they saw it peopled
by many armed and hydra-headed monsters with the little that was good in it
such as the Buddha image, derived from second-rate Hellenistic model. Coomaraswamy
had to strive to show not only the worth of Indian art but its individual
identity as an expression of a distinct civilization. To the marked change that
came about in the world’s knowledge and understanding of Indian culture over
the years, no single man had contributed more than <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>
K. Coomaraswamy. Yet, having made this monumental achievement, he saw all
cultures as “dialects of the same language.” This is unlike so many later
scholars who built on foundations laid by him but never got rid of their
regional chauvinism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
the rediscovery of Coomaraswamy is no longer as important to India in the area
of art as it is in the understanding of art as an index of social organization.
It is as a social philosopher that his work can provide a cultural leadership
to an India that is in danger of losing the important values of Indian
tradition and may be hurtling, by a combination of choice and necessity,
towards the ills that beset industrialized societies. <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>
Coomaraswamy should thus become a culture hero for the younger generation in
India as much as in America or anywhere else.</p>

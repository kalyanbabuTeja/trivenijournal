mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Among us biography is serious, almost solemn. The
hero’s opinions, quarrels, triumphs, go on the record. Nothing about his food,
mannerisms, amusements. The lighter side is kept out. Yet no account of a man
can be complete without it. We cannot form a mental picture of the man unless
we know how he dressed, walked and ate. Gokhale’s figure is familiar–his
handsome face, his fair colour, his long coat of gray, his red puggree, his scarf
of white with thin lace border. Still when I tell you he wore a cap sometimes,
and often tied a long narrow strip of coloured cloth round his head as a loose
turban, and that for many years, like any domesticated Deccani, he changed into
holy time-honoured silk at meals, and that till he made his first voyage he
grew a long tuft at the back of his head and tied it into a knot–don’t you feel
he comes nearer to you and, if you met him, you could address him familiarly
and ask, “Well, Gopal Rao, how are you today?” When I first knew him he had
become heavy and disinclined to exercise. At one time he used to play tennis
with the vigour and zest characteristic of youth. Middle age overtook him
prematurely, and caused him to fall back on walking. Even in that easy region,
don’t we know of virtuous resolutions to be regular, the conspiracy of envious
circumstances that overpowers us on the third or fourth day, and our dutiful
submission to the decree of inexorable fate? It was one of these fateful
mornings when he paused to watch Principal Paranjpye and me pitted against each
other on a tennis court. The game was strenuous but didn’t declare itself
easily. He didn’t like his pet pupil extended by an obscure stranger and cried
out: “It is a misery to me to see you dragged about by Sastri.” Always keen on
the proprieties, I thought the word ‘misery’ erred on the side of excess. But
when I went back, I reflected that, if I had a scholar like Paranjpye and seen
him seize the Senior Wranglership and made him Principal straightaway of a
great college and served under him with pride as professor, I should have
thought he was invincible at tennis, or, at any rate, that he should be
invincible by rights. “So anyhow Gokhale has flesh and blood,” I concluded.
Talking of flesh and blood, I am reminded of a humorous remark of Mr. H. W.
Nevinson, the journalist who came to India in 1907-08 and wrote <i>The New
Spirit in India</i>. Gokhale told him he hated the word ‘moderate’ as applied
to his school of politics; Nevinson put it down in his book adding “as all
beings of flesh and blood must”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Would you know something of his food? Being
diabetic, he was placed under strict diet but didn’t always observe it. He must
have his brinjals daily, seasoned with chilies in as angry a style as would have
pleased any Andhra of the Krishna District. When he ate by himself, he gulped
the meal in mouthfuls as though he had been famished and bolted it in three or
four minutes. Ghee, prized above everything else by the true Brahmana, he
avoided like poison; he could not endure it even on his neighbour’s plate.
Someone told to me this was because, for a long time, he had had to swallow
quantities of it along with medicines. Curds were a favourite dish, and he grew
lyrical when he expatiated on the unequalled merits of a preparation of curds
called <i>srikhand</i>. In all India there was no sweet to compare with it, and
he found it in his heart to forgive the Peshwa who lost an empire eating it. So
he told Lord Kitchner at a banquet. I would like to believe his admiration was
only academic, for he was not blest with the marvelous eupepsia of the ordinary
Maharashtrian, who could account at one sitting for as much of it as an
unhusked coconut, while the most I could boast of was two finger tips applied
gingerly to the tongue. To those among you or who may still lie frog like in
sequestered wells, let me give the latest dictionary definition of <i>srikhand</i>:
a viscous cloying viand, much valued in the Deccan, of which the main
ingredient is curds thoroughly dehydrated, heavily saccharified and besaffroned
to saturation point.” To take pride in the delicacies of one’s province, is, I
suppose, an amiable variety of patriotism. All over India the native of Madras
is most willing to despise himself and exalt others. Even he, I am sure, feels
bucked up when he hears his unpretentious <i>iddili </i>praised beyond Raichur
or Vizianagaram.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Though polite and tender-hearted to a degree,
Gokhale was deficient by Indian standards in the virtue of accessibility. He
preferred to see people by previous appointment. He was annoyed when anybody
dropped in casually just for a chat, with no plan to discus or suggestion to
make. I fancy he would have collapsed if admirers crowded round him for mere <i>darsan</i>.
Careful not to offend in any way, he was observant of forms. Usually he sat in
the front verandah of his modest residence with just a shirt on, and screened
from public view by the thick curtain of plants. Here his familiar associates
and friends had open access and enjoyed his talks,–instructive, varied,
anecdotal an enlivened by loud laughter and childlike clapping of hands.
Occasionally, however, he would espy a stranger, and it was then amusing to see
how he would part the leaves in front of him and look through the hole for a
reconnaissance. If the visitor was only slightly known or wholly unknown, he
would hasten to don a coat and repair to the receiving room for the interview.
Sir Raghunath Paranjpye says he inspired awe in the casual visitor. I would not
put it so sharply. But it must be admitted he did not thaw easily, and men have
complained of a certain brusqueness or impatience of manner which did not
encourage a free flow of talk. Students had to be on their guard how they
approached him. He had no patience with the breezy, free and easy style that
the modern student sometimes showed towards seniors. His own behaviour to
Dadabhai, Ranade, Mehta, Bhandarkar, Joshi and others of their age was strongly
marked by old world ceremonial reverence, and he naturally feared that, when a
young man dropped the outward signs of respect, he dropped the homage of the
heart as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>At this point I shall do well to narrate Gokhale’s
own account of his first interview with Mrs. Besant During one of her early
visits to Poona he attended a meeting at which she answered questions from
candidates for admission to the Theosophical Society. When his turn came he
plied her hard and his manner perhaps appeared controversial. In her impatience
she burst out: “Young man, when you come to be my age, these things will appear
in a clearer light.” That decided Gokhale against the Society. But ‘thereby
hangs a tail’, as a wag has said. Long afterwards Mrs. Besant and leading
Theosophists continued to claim him as a member. Questioned by me once, he
became vehement and said, “When next anybody calls me a Theosophist, deny it in
my name; I authorise you.” The time soon came when I had to convey this
unpleasing news to Mrs. Besant. For a fraction of a moment she appeared nettled
but she at once recovered composure and changed the topic. Inquiry showed that
an intimate friend of Gokhale had paid the prescribed fee of admission and
maintained his name on the register for two or three years. I guess Gokhale was
aware of this fact, but he was not a consenting party, and the dubious status
came to an end soon. In Theosophical circles one may occasionally find the
belief still in his continued membership, but the emphatic disclaimer that I
have recorded should give a quietus to the story. But I must guard against a
possible misapprehension. Gokhale to the last minute of his life gave testimony
without stint to her unparalleled services to the country of her adoption, and,
in personal behaviour, showed every mark of respect for her eminence in the
world. She, for her part, never missed an opportunity of praising the pure gold
of his patriotism, declared more than once that the columns of <i>New India </i>were
always at his disposal and that he might treat the paper as if it were his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>How earnest natures are drawn irresistibly to each
other comes out vividly from an incident mentioned by Justice Sadasiva Iyer,
when he took part in the 1926 celebration of this anniversary. In 1908, the
year of the first Convention Congress at Madras, Gokhale made one of his
stirring speeches on the platform of the Social Conference on the elevation of
the Depressed Classes, as they were still called then. As he went back to his
seat, Sadasiva Iyer caught the hem of his garment and kissed it in an ecstasy
of reverence. Strange that the native fire of enthusiasm should have survived
many years of refrigerative judicial work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gokhale had a whim once and yielded to it. He
filled a shaving soap tube with sovereigns and kept it by his side. I was
stolen. He took a similar tube at once and refilled it with the glittering
metal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gokhale loved his daughters but never demonstrated
it as other fathers usually do. They lived apart from him under his sister’s
care, and visited him at stated intervals. Sir Lallubhai Samaldas once told how
his daughter remonstrated with Gokhale against an exacting time-table of work
that he framed for his elder daughter, now Mrs. Dhavle, who had fallen back a
little in her studies. Miss Samaldas used some expression like this: “You must
be not only a strict schoolmaster but a loving father as well.” To this let me
add another observation that he made to me when he was my guest in Sydogy Lane,
Triplicane. News came from Poona that his second daughter was taken ill
suddenly and his presence was necessary. For a few brief moments he seemed to
hesitate about his movements. Was he to cancel his Elementary Education Bill
tour and return home? I pressed for this decision and while yielding he used
words, words which after 34 years I cannot recall without emotion. He seemed,
he said, to hear her ask half reproachfully, “What have I known of a father’s
love and care?” Poor thing, she did not survive that illness long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

belief that he nominated me as his successor in the headship of the Servants of
India Society. Even when asked about it in his last moments, he would say
nothing. This account remains substantially true. But a passage in the
autobiography of Sir P. C. Ray, published in 1932, seems to call for a slight
qualification. Gokhale and I visited him once in 1911 in connection with the
Elementary Education Bill. Of this interview he records in this book:</span><sup><span

Srinivasa Sastri to me and introduced him to me as a poor schoolmaster like
himself and whispered into my ear that he looked upon him as his future
successor. His penetration and insight, I need scarcely add, have been more
than justified. It is curious to note that the two great statesmen of India,
who have commanded not only the applause but also the admiration and respect
for listening senates at home and abroad have been, like my humble self,
schoolmasters.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

occasions and sundry.<sup> 1</sup> “Come, let’s put five rupees on it.” That
sum was his unit. Once he challenged me. I protested. Imagining I shrank from
so large a figure he cried impatiently, “Come, bet one rupee”. I said I was a
conscientious objector to all betting and got off. Else there was risk of a
court martial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Of his religious views I have spoken previously. In
a fit of excessive candour he called himself an agnostic, and the name stuck to
him. Not, it would appear, quite justifiably. As early as 1898, we find him,
under the sting of the apology episode, invoking the grace of Guru Dattatreya
and making large resolutions among which were one to practice Yoga and one to
learn the best philosophical religion and teach it to the whole world. There
was no room in his tenuous belief for high-pitched asceticism, taboos or
ceremonies. I distinctly recall the eve of my admission in Calcutta when he
prescribed a purificatory bath and apprised me of a slight ritual to be gone
through, not, he explained half apologetically, for any spiritual merit but to
invest the occasion with solemnity. I was never to publish it or discuss it
with outsiders. The prohibition is enjoined, I presume, on every new entrant,
for it is not generally known to the public. He once inquired whether I had
faith in astrology and, when I answered in the negative, said some predictions
came astoundingly true and wondered how I would explain them. I rejoined that
science had many puzzles to solve but that fact need not compel us to put any
credence in the calculations or revelations of astrologers. He did not
thereafter resume the topic with me; but I discovered that he paid a horoscope
and obtained reports of what was going to happen to him every fortnight. After
his death I received periodical forecasts of my fortune, but I took no notice
and they ceased in time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Let me at this point recount an interesting
experience. In the early part of 1915, when Gokhale was in the grip of his
fatal malady, we had a good friend staying with us and sharing our anxiety. He
had the biographer’s curiosity bump developed to abnormal size. Members had to
answer searching interrogatories. Did he say his prayers regularly? Visit
shrines? Observe the customary fasts and feasts? Perform his parents’ <i>sraddha</i>?
Study the Gita or other scriptural books? We did what we could to slake his
thirst for information. But one item floored us: Did he wear his <i>yajnopavita</i>?
None of us knew. He thought the answer vital. Why not hazard a direct question?
Why not set a trusted menial on the scent? We neither assisted diligently in
this research nor encouraged intrigues with the establishment for the purpose.
The gentleman had, therefore, to return home with this mystery vexing his soul.
Poor man, he is gone where I cannot communicate with him; or I could now supply
the gap in Gokhale record. From an unexpected quarter trustworthy information
has come that, during the last dozen years or so of his life, he wore no sacred
thread athwart the chest or round the neck halterwise, as I have seen some
educated men do as a sort of half-way house between conformity and open
rebellion. In Calcutta, where he was a regular visitor for meetings of the old
Imperial Legislative Council, he had a highly cultured Brahmo lady-friend. Mrs.
Ray entertained in style, and at her table the conversation was both
high-souled and animated. She admired Gokhale’s character and public spirit and
took special interest in his work. People called her his Egeria. I shall now
let her tell the story herself. The occasion is this very day in 1943, and she
is talking to the girls of a high school which he has founded in his name and
to the promotion of which she has dedicated herself:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

relate to you, and it will prove to you Gokhale’s intrinsic love of truth and
his great virtue of owning his own errors. One evening after dinner we were
both trying to convince each other of our respective theories (he gave
precedence to political reform, she to social reform) when I got rather angry
and said, “Now, Mr. Gokhale, with all your ideals of unity of India and
political freedom, tell me which of your men are sincere and truthful. You
can’t even give up your caste system; you don’t believe in idolatry, and still
your biggest political leaders go to Benares and do their <i>Pinda </i>etc.
according to the old rites; none of you political men can live up to your own
convictions; yet, you want to unite India and govern. I am sure with all your
liberal views, you have a sacred thread under your shirt to denote that you are
a Brahmin born. Even you have not got the strength of your convictions.” I saw
him grow rather grave, and I thought probably I had overstepped my familiarity
by personal attack, so I turned the conversation to other higher matters. Would
you believe the next morning comes to me a sealed envelope enclosing his sacred
thread, cut into two pieces with the following words in a slip of paper.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“One essential condition of success in the work is
that a sufficient number of our countrymen must now come forward to devote
themselves to the cause in the spirit in which religious work is undertaken. <i>Public
life </i>must be spiritualised. Love of country must so fill the heart that all
else shall appear as of little moment by its side. A fervent patriotism which
rejoices at every opportunity of sacrifice for the: Motherland, a dauntless
heart which refuses to be turned back from its object by difficulty or danger,
a deep faith in the purpose of Providence which nothing can shake,–equipped
with these the worker must start on his mission and reverently seek the joy of
spending oneself in the service of the country.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>That passage was no doubt composed in one of
Gokhale’s inspired moments. The ideal is pure, of the other region, unattainable
except by persons of saintly elevation and self-conquest. It is meant to be the
pole-star by which members have to steer, their crazy barks to the port of
duty. The words may, in actual practice, mean much or little. The canon of
interpretation in such cases is to study the vows undertaken and the rules laid
down for the daily guidance of members. These vows and rules determine the
limits within which, roughly speaking, their actions must lie,–an upper limit
above which they need not go, a lower limit below which they must not fall. As
lawyers will say, the sections of an Act are the law, not the preamble or
statement of objects and reasons. Another test, not so final or authoritative,
but yet valuable as a rough guide or measure, is the practice and example of
the man who framed the rules and himself followed them. Gokhale lived for ten
years as First Member. Though few could attain his stature or emulate his
achievement, his range and line of work were there for the whole world to see.
The vows and rules go to the very root of character and the inner life. ‘I have
37 years’ experience and not even for a brief season have I been free from
chagrin that I have not lived up to them. When our Congress friends of Madras
became the Government and announced the remuneration and allowances of their
office and the regulations for their conduct, I recognised their high quality
readily and declared my appreciation by saying in the Legislative Council that,
while we of the Servants of India Society had stopped at the matriculation
stage in the University of sacrifice, Mr. Rajagopalachari and his compatriots
were proceeding to the doctorate. I shall now mention an enterprise of even
greater pith and moment, not so generally known. Dr. D. K. Karve, founder of
the famous Widows’ Home near Poona and later of the Women’s University,
enlisted for the actual work of the home a band of qualified persons whom he
organised as an <i>Asrama</i>, the rules and conditions of which were more
stringent than those of our Society. After a few years his self-effacing soul
did not find full rest and satisfaction in the <i>Asrama</i>. Gokhale’s
expression, “Public life must be spiritualised”, gripped his inmost being and
demanded far more self-denial and rigour of conduct. So he organised a fresh
band of workers, who should reach higher peak of selflessness, and gave them
the name and style of <i>Nishkama karma Matha </i>adopting the Gita ideal of
work without attachment. These <i>karma yogins </i>and <i>karma-yoginis </i>had
to take eight vows before initiation. They are much akin in language and scope
to our own, and perhaps you will like to know them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

some significance, for it illustrates the truth that, even of an undoubtedly
good thing, there may be too much. The disparity between the <i>Asrama </i>and
the <i>Matha </i>was noticeable and engendered jealousy and hostility. The
misunderstanding became acute, and Dr. Karve, with the consent of both parties,
came to Gokhale for arbitration. On him rested the responsibility in a way, for
it was his spiritualisation <i>mantra </i>that had worked on the ascetic spirit
of the organizer of the rival orders. Gokhale’s finding was that the asramites
had a genuine grievance and were entitled to some relief. He evolved a formula
for this purpose. But he told me, for I happened to be there, that Karve had
not given full consideration to the human aspects of the problem. The
compromise did not work, and in Karve’s own words, the <i>Matha </i>was
ultimately merged in the Widows’ Home, the <i>Sevakas </i>and <i>Sevikas </i>of
the <i>Matha </i>becoming life members of the Widows’ Home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

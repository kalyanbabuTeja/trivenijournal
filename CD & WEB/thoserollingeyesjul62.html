was in my friend Kutumba Rao’s house at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>
that I first saw her. She was at the time eleven or twelve years old. My friend
went out that morning on some work. I sat by the window looking into the
newspaper. She took out a handful of flowers–Jasmines and Roses–from a ragged
bag of red cloth, clumsily wrapped inside a large betel leaf and, having placed
them on the table, began to smile. She had a thin oval face with sharp
clean-cut features. Her complexion was somewhat dark like the glow of red earth
in twilight. She had a small mouth and an even row of white teeth that shed a
lustre vaguely calling to mind an image of flames. The spark of growing life in
this girl shone like a precious gem embedded inside a fluid mass of clay. There
was dust on her hair, her clothes–tell-tale marks–; she was not used to keeping
her person well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

what attracted me most <span class=GramE>was</span> her eyes. There was in them
a dark and penetrating brilliance–a haunting quality. They were not dark
lustrous eyes which poets love to describe. Beauty is not the word for them.
They had in them an arresting lustre–both attracting and repelling at the same
time–<span class=GramE>that</span> one associates with the light of a precious
stone on the head of a fabulous creature that dwells in caves. You are
startled, intrigued. Now, large round eyes are not necessarily beautiful. Her
eyes were not really <span class=GramE>so</span> large as all that, but because
the dark pupils were so round and large, and incessantly moving in circles, you
got the impression of largeness. Steady, settled vision–it was not. The pupils
went round and round in circles and you felt she did not look at you but around
you. There she stood in front of me, smiling and looking ‘around’ me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

after all. I let the fan go. She was looking at it rapt in amazement, her eyes
going round and round in unison with the fan. Presently she switched it off.
Letting it on and off was great fun to her. After <span class=GramE>all the</span>
fan belonged to my friend, and I was worried whether I should let her play with
it. There was a Radio receiver in the other room, kept high on a rack attached
to the wall, beyond the reach of the children, who, my friend told me, were
experts at demolishing mechanical contrivances. This fan did not have the
protective mesh. A frame was fitted on to it which was only ornamental.
Suddenly I heard a sharp cry and I turned to see the girl Hashima Bi, sucking
at her forefinger which had evidently received a cut from the revolving blades
as she attempted to touch them. She probably wanted to stop it by hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

exaamination. There was no cut; the skin was slightly shrivelled and red. The
boy Marenna shouted at what he considered a monkeyish prank and told her to
‘get out.’ “If you touch it again, I shall cut your finger,” he ended. I liked
to see him shouting at the poor girl. Poor fellow, he seldom had an opportunity
of showing his temper. The girl looked at me piteously, and I looked helpless.
I was not Marenna’s master, nor did the fan belong to me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

delight in stopping a moving thing, and then letting it go; it gives them a
strange sense of power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

noticed another characteristic. The boys are fond of moving objects, while the

next day I saw another odd event. I was sitting by the window which opened out
into the street below. There were a few meat shops in front of which people
stood like clouds that surround the sinking sun. Somebody stood a bicycle on
its stand on the left of the road beneath a tree. There I saw Hashima Bi
standing in front of the bicycle and staring at it. She pulled at the pedal,
and the wheel at the back started moving. She turned the pedal with increased
force, and the wheel was moving faster. Suddenly she thrust her palm between
the spokes of the revolving wheel, gave a cry, withdrew the hand, and stood
sucking at her fingers. She looked round, vainly concealing the pain of her
hand, only to see if anybody was looking at her. Her gaze rested on the window
where I sat. I could see she was smiling at me. Quickly withdrawing her gaze,
she went running and disappeared at the bend of the road. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
smiled to myself. I hardly knew her. Yet I felt there was between us some
strange bond–a closeness of being which defies rational analysis. Heated by the
blazing noonday Sun, the foam on the wave in the sea melts as vapour and rises
as a cloud and at last breaks into rain, thereby binding the sky above and the
Earth below. The bond between us was as substantial as the melting foam on the
wave. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This strange impulse to put the finger in a
revolving <span class=GramE>wheel,</span> manifests itself in grown-ups too.
Many a time I wanted to do so myself. Only Psychologists can explain the
impulse. Curiosity is a feature of man’s intellect. What will it be like if I
put my finger in the switch and receive an electric shock! How will it be if I
stop the revolving fan with my hand! Yes, there will be pain–pain calling for
self-pity. The pity focussed on one’s own self compensates for the neglect or
antagonism sustained in the objecting world. Some such dark motive must be at
the back of these vague, destructive impulses. When I go up on the roof of a
tall building and look below from the edge, I feel like jumping headlong into
the street below. I step with bated breath to the very edge of the roof, close
my eyes preparatory to the fatal plunge, but, of course, I shall step back
having gone through the experience only in imagination. Self-molestation is
fraught with a sinister pleasure–this delight in self-inflicted pain. But in
most people this impulse dwells only in the realm of thought and never descends
to the plane of action. </p>

Bi it has escaped into the realm of action. She has done what I longed to do
but could not do for lack of the final courage. Only thus can I explain the
strange attraction I felt for her. “Look, you can’t do it yourself, can you?”
She says in the language of nods and revolving eyes. “I will do it in a Jiffy,”
and, having said it, she put her hand in the spokes and stopped the bicycle
wheel. Having done it, she smiled at me and disappeared in a cloud of dust–of
dust and triumph. This was the basis of the bond between us. Her life is
hers–and mine is mine. Our paths are different. Even so, there was some inner
agony, some mental pain–the agony in me of awareness that I could not remove
the pain, her agony arising from an inability to penetrate and remove the pain
in me–all this I can only see in her strange, <span class=GramE>circling</span>
eyes. Once a while there was a sudden flash in her smile–as though its settled
beauty strove to stop and fix the circling eyes in a steady vision reflecting
the inner peace. A momentary experience that dwelt in the past–yet I could see
it as though it were protected and hung in the future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

flowers, the heavy perfume, the gay rich costumes of the men and maidens slowly
moving behind to the <i>Shahna</i> accompaniment. In the brilliance of lights

everybody. If they were marching, she would probably cry ‘halt’. Mahboob had a
motor cycle and on it they, on off duty, took fast and furious rides over the

Moreover, progress and speed–youth has always desired them. Bi loved to take
long and fast drives seated on the pillion behind her husband. The motor cycle

shoulders. It must have been a tight grip–her fingers pulsating with primitive </span><span

it. What did she do? She might have tapped, with outstretched leg, the back
wheel close to her; or, at any rate, she may have indulged in some act designed
to stop the moving motor cycle. Mahaboob loses balance, negotiating some bend
of the road, and off goes the cycle with a bang, his head caught beneath. Bi’s
heart must have beat as fast as the moving motor cycle and her attempt to still
both, to possess them, must have resulted in the tragedy. Some such explanation

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHEN
it was announced in the beginning of the year 1944 that the late Rt. Hon’ble V.
S. Srinivasa Sastri would deliver a series of weekly lectures on the Ramayana
under the auspices of the Samskrit Academy many people who knew him well were
not a little surprised. For though Mr. Sastri was all admiration for Valmiki
and considered the Ramayana as the greatest epic in the world, yet he kept his
admiration to himself and was hardly inclined to give utterance to it in
public. There were also a few who feared that his irreverent attitude towards
the poem will make him unnecessarily critical, dwelling on the many seeming
inconsistencies of the epic. Indeed, he was known to have stated on one
occasion when he was asked to preside over the yearly celebration of the Poet’s
Day at the Academy that he was hardly fitted to address an audience consisting
mostly of people who were liable to break down with emotion at the mere mention
of the name Sri Rama. He could not but entertain some contempt for those who
treated the Ramayana with unbounded reverence from sheer convention rather than
from any conviction born of their own personal study of the great character of
Sri Rama.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>None
who attended the lectures could ever forget what an intellectual treat it was
to hear him every week for a period of eight months without a break and how one
could hardly help a feeling of regret that the beautiful lectures came to a
close. People came to hear him in large numbers from all parts of the city. The
audience grew larger and larger until the number swelled to thousands. Men and
women sat for more than an hour and a half every week in silent rapture as if
they listened to the soft strains of some heavenly music. Scarcely a murmur
could be heard in the vast crowd as one and all fell under the charm of the
magnetic personality of the distinguished lecturer. So, as the weeks rolled on
even those “who came to scoff remained to pray.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is certain Mr. Sastri must have prepared carefully before every lecture. But he
came scarcely provided with any notes. He took his seat and just went on in his
clear ringing voice never pausing for a word or an idea. He placed before the
audience his remarkable analysis of the leading characters and the many incidents
in the Ramayana, not omitting the most trivial detail, seeking to divine the
hidden meaning of the poet and yet taking care to preserve the spirit of the
text.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is an exceedingly happy thing that the people did
not rest contented with merely listening to those brilliant discourses. The
special arrangements made by the Academy for taking shorthand reports rendered
it possible to publish them eventually in book-form. The present volume
contains the thirty lectures which the Rt. Hon’ble Sastri delivered in a frame
of mind full of piety and deep reverence for our immortal epic as those who
heard him could well testify. With that disarming humility he begins the series
of lectures, stating in the first place his sense of utter diffidence for the
talk he has undertaken, in the second, the nature of the audience that he has,
which frightens him out of his wits, and lastly the exalted nature of the
subject-matter upon which it is difficult even for the most original minds to
say anything like what may be new. “He confessed at the outset that he was
going to deal with Sri Rama as purely human and not as a God. The emotional
breakdowns which were witnessed, however, on occasions when he dwelt on the
loftiness of Sri Rama’s character, plainly showed that he certainly did not
lack “the reverence that is of the substance of religion.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It
appears to me,” he says “that there is a way of studying the Ramayana with
reverence, with adoration of the great qualities of the hero and heroine and
with full appreciation of the unparalleled influence that it has exerted in
ages past and will exert for ages to come on the lives and characters of our
people.” By holding the view that Valmiki presented his hero as essentially
human, that he was not so perfect and that though he possessed the greatest and
the noblest qualities in the world, yet he was not quite free from the failings
and limitations of ordinary human beings, the lecturer must have offended those
who like to believe that Sri Rama was an Avatar and accordingly everything he
did must be viewed in the light of his Godhead. How are we then to account for
those passages in the epic which go to show unmistakably that Sri Rama in spite
of his divine nature was at times swayed by feelings common to all mortals? It
will be of no avail to ignore the fact that Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Bharata
behaved most humanly sometimes; that they betrayed a touch of earth in their
natures on rare occasions, and that though their heads dwelt in the high
heavens their feet trod the common earth like other men and women. Nevertheless
if we</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'> accept that fact, does it mean to say, we wonder, that
these contended in them constantly the dual personality of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>as in the case of all of us? True, they rose infinitely
above the conflict of the higher and the lower impulses of the ordinary man.
But having been born as human beings, is it so incompatible that they should
occasionally wear their human aspect? It is clear that the distinguished author
of these lectures had no thought of questioning the divinity of </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Rama. He believed it was not essential to the understanding of the story or to
profiting by the story. Sri Rama was for him an embodiment </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
the great virtues of human character and whatever he spoke and did had
unmistakably in it the touch of divinity. The fact, however, that Sri Rama
thought and did, and had his moments of anguish as well as anger in the same
way as any other man, although he moved on a level immeasurably higher than
that of others cannot but fill us now and then with pride as Mr. Sastri
observes in his lectures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
much in vindication of the learned lecturer’s attitude to the general belief
that Sri Rama was an incarnation of God. Now let us deal with the lectures
themselves. It is marvellous how closely he has studied the main characters of
the story including the various commentaries. He has been able to expound them
so beautifully and so lucidly as none else could. He has noted the most trivial
details which would have escaped the eyes of the keenest scholar, and converted
them into exceedingly interesting bits of information for the reader. Thus, he
has discovered from the text a number of little things, how Sita could not help
feeling a little shy when she was handed into the boat on the Ganges by Sri Rama,
how she walked between the brothers at one time, the order changing at another,
and how she seemed to be in the habit of taking her food in the company of her
husband and not after him as has been considered proper for a dutiful wife. We
find the lecturer straight, clear and convincing in his analysis of the
characters, his construction on the meaning of the texts never twisted or
far-fetched as that of most of the commentators, “who have struggled with the
texts which pulled them one way, and their own conception of what would be
appropriate in an omniscient Divinity which pulled them another way, the
conception of Godhead every time prevailing over the obvious meaning of the
texts.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lecturer discloses the interesting fact that Hanuman is affected with sudden
lapses of memory at critical moments and the instances he has selected bear
testimony to the extraordinary thoroughness of his scrutiny of that great
character. The episode of Surpanaka is an instance which shows that Sri Rama
had a keen of sense of humour and he indulged in a practical joke at the
expense of Surpanaka just as any other man would be tempted to indulge in. The
author depicts an engaging picture of Ravana, how after the curses which his
forcible subjection of women to his desire brought on him, he changed his ways
and became a gentle lover. These and similar observations prove how completely
the lecturer has entered into the spirit of each character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
character of Sri Rama naturally engages him most. He devotes no less than eight
lectures to him. While enumerating the instances which show Sri Rama as
representing the man of perfection described by Narada to the Poet at the
outset, he has lingered with the utmost love and reverence upon those
particular incidents where the divine hero speaks and behaves in an essentially
human way. He has tried to explain the Vali episode which according to Valmiki
represents Sri Rama as falling a bit short of the perfect man. The Poet gives
some explanation which hardly justifies the conduct of Sri Rama with regard to
Vali. The commentators have fared no better. Mr. Sastri however finds a
solution for the middle. He points out how Sri Rama promised Sugriva that he
would kill Vali “that very instant” and having promised that how could he wait?
Evidently, he could not hope to finish Vali at once in open combat as Vali was
a man of extraordinary prowess. Though the Poet himself states in a<i> </i>number
of places his belief in the divinity of Sri Rama, yet he makes him act in a way
not quite appropriate to the divinity in him, and makes no attempt either to
vindicate him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
in the <i>Yuddha Kanda</i>, the battle being over Sita is brought before her
husband for the first time after her internment at the Asokavana. On seeing her
Rama suddenly gets angry and uses words which are simply shocking to the ears.
Now why does he speak so? To say that he did not mean those words would be to
brand him a hypocrite, while it would render him “vulgar and ill-bred” with
some, if we say that he actually meant what he said. Valmiki has made his hero
speak with regard to Sita, a language which is unthinkable, and yet he has
passed him over without any explanation whatever for his behaviour. Mr. Sastri
takes this as a telling instance of Sri Rama being swayed by emotions common to
all men. He would like to believe that Rama was seized with a sudden fit of
jealousy which unbalanced him for the moment. The lecturer has taken great
pains to explain himself before introducing this idea in order it should not
shock the hearers. Though it looks in a way as a very good explanation, yet it
is likely to prove offensive to the sense of deep veneration with which almost
all people regard Sri Rama.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The study of the characters of Lakshmana and
Bharatha and the comparison between them afford us an exceedingly interesting
reading. The lecturer ably defends the conduct of Vibhishana who is accused by
some as a traitor abandoning his own country and taking refuge with the enemy.
He considers Hanuman as an unique creation of Valmiki and speaks of him in the
highest possible terms next to Sri Rama. He is full of admiration for Ravana
though his greatness, he says, is unmixed with goodness.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
present volume, it may be said, is unique of its kind. The lecturer has dealt
with all the leading characters in the Ramayana with the deepest love and
reverence. The high literary sense which he is endowed with, renders him
eminently qualified for the task. Passages of great beauty expressing the most
sublime thoughts and sentiments are gathered and explained by the author in his
own inimitable style. Nothing can be so beautiful as the way in which he closes
his lectures. Speaking of Sri Rama’s coronation at the end, “But the real
coronation is in our hearts,” he says with fervour: “Rama and Sita should be
crowned in our hearts, enthroned in our hearts. Let them govern your thoughts
and regulate your lives. At all important occasions, remember them and then you
cannot go wrong.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

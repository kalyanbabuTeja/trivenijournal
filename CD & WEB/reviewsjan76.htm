Ashram but the spiritual direction of the Sadhaks as well. But with
irrepressible disciples like Amal, Dilip and presently Nirod, the Master soon
found that the retirement was a more arduous involvement than ever. It was the
Golden Age of Yoga instruction through letters redolent of sovereign wisdom and
tender solicitude and painstaking particularity, and of divine love and divine

were no dictaphones, no stenotypists; all was written down, often on the margin
of the disciple’s letters, and as often on bits of paper. On a single day in
August 1936, Sri Aurobindo wrote “one letter of 36 pages vernacular, 2 others
each of 8 pages of foolscap, others less in size (4, 2, 1, etc.) but ample in
number–and this is no correspondence period!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with his formal writings in the <i>Arya </i>Sri Aurobindo reached a far-flung
audience, his “evening talks” with his disciples before 24 November 1926 and
his correspondence after were rather more intimate, admirably tuned to the
occasion and the immediate audience, yet with wide-ranging creepers of meaning
that invest them with universality. But the published “talks”, having been
recorded from memory (by Purani, Chidanandam or, after 1938, by Nirod), do not
always carry the Aurobindonian elan. It is here that the Correspondence scores,
for here the style is the man, and the man-god is Sri Aurobindo. Master and
disciple are exchanging letters, but so frequently and with so few inhibitions,
that for the reader of the book it is as though an endlessly fascinating
conversation is in progress, and he is the privileged eavesdropper. There is
doubtless some clever editorial piecing together in Sri Aurobindo’s humour, but
in the Aurobindonian ambience, Nirod and his doldrums (whether real or partly
dramatised), the Ashram and its problems (“Commonsense is exceedingly uncommon
in this Ashram”...”What a mad Ashram”) the Yoga and its vicissitudes, Nirod’s
medicare and the incidental fall-out, the escalations of wit and the eruptions
of doggerel (“perfectly private”), and above all the personality of the Master
and the Mother spring to life in the pages of the book, and the cackle and the
laughter notwithstanding, there is a continuous spray of revelation as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the recurring characters in this theatre of verbal exchanges are the Man of
Sorrows who pops in unpredictably, the Subconscient (“my King Charles’s head”)
and of course the Supermind. This last with its dangling Tail is quite a
popular visitant on these pages, and as for Supermind’s progeny, their name is
legion: Super-Tom, Super-Dick, Super-Harry, Supramental meal, even a “sublimated
supramental shout.” It is a wonder that with all this barrage of attention,
Mistah Supermind didn’t completely fold up and withdraw altogether, unable to
stand Nirod’s taunts and Sri Aurobindo’s felicitous levities. But the Master
assures Nirod in one place that his verbal shafts, his indignations and
objurgations, are merely jocular and are “not meant to bum or bite.” He is “a
true Ahimsuk” really, and although he strews his letters with “damned,” “deuce”
and “devils,” they are only expletive; no offence at all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

critics (“Easiest thing in the world is to be a critic. Just look wise and
slang the subject in grave well-timed sentences. It does not matter what you
say”) have often complained about Sri Aurobindo’s difficult and involved style.
Once a Union Minister asked me with some petulance, “Why doesn’t your Aurobindo
write like Vivekananda? How simple he is!” But there is no damned single style
in the Canon, as Sri Aurobindo himself. On the other hand, the sublimest truths
are presented in the language of a child’s smiles and laughter. Certainly, “within
there is a soul and above there is Grace.” What follows? Sri Aurobindo writes
with a view to clearing up all possible misunderstanding: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the soul and the Grace are the two ends, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>but
that does not mean that there is nothing between. You seem to have
misinterpreted the sentence, “There is a dawdling </span>soul within and a
sleeping Grace above. When the Grace awakes, the soul will no more dawdle,
because it will be abducted’. Of course, it can happen like that, but as I put
it, there is no reason why it should. Generally the soul wakes up, rubs its
eyes and says, “Hallo, where is that Grace?” and begins fumbling around it and
pulling at things in the hope that Grace is at the other end of the said
things. Finally it pulls at something by accident and the Grace comes <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>toppling down full tilt from God knows where.
That’s the usual style–but there are others.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

child might understand this–the whole mechanics and logistics of Grace–though
grown-ups might still whimper and grouse. And the Correspondence is full of
such illuminations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

every page almost drips with madhu, madhu, divine honey, it is not easy to do
random sampling. Here levity is the natural cloak of wisdom, and laughter is
crammed with light. Thus of Nirod’s portrait: “Good heavens, what a gigantic
forehead they have given you! The Himalaya and the <st1:place w:st="on">Atlantic</st1:place>
in one mighty brow! also, with the weird supramental light upon it!” The
surname ‘Talukdar’ “sounds as if you (Nirod) were a Roman Emperor.” In Yoga,
the ‘vital’ is always a disturbing influence. “A disciple of Gandhi as far as
passive resistance goes–a master of non-co-operation.” By August 1935, Sri
Aurobindo had “got the hang of the whole hanged thing (the supramental)–like a
very Einstein I have got the mathematical formula of the whole affair (‘unintelligible
as in his own case to anybody but myself.’) As for ‘<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

philosophy.” Sri Aurobindo’s mission is not to do “miracles to order, but to
try to get in a new consciousness somewhere in the world–which is itself
however to attempt a miracle.” How to read <i>The Life Divine? </i>Well, here’s
a useful tip: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

an unintelligible para from the L. D., then sit in vacant meditation and see
what comes from the intuitive gods. They will probably play jokes with you, but
what does it matter? One learns by one’s errors and marches to success through

the paths of Jnana and Bhakti have been reconciled in their summum bonum being
the same. He further says: “....if one appraises Gita with a tranquil and

described the excellence of one thread after another only to weave them
together ultimately into a love patch-work quilt of harmony in an utterly

he went to <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> for

a point to meet many of the poets of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> and thereby widen his
mental horizon. Having been married to a daughter of Seth Jamanlal Bajaj,

for winning Swaraj. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

six parts the author has taken us through the steady progress of his imbibing
ideas and enthusiasm for the renascent urge which stimulated people in the national
awakening to seriously think of the fresh orientation to be introduced in both
methods of education and employment of our youth. Having learnt of the
principles of Basic Education from the Mahatma, Shriman Narayan began to
experiment his own ideas too in the execution of this favourite work of his. He
received the appreciation of leaders like Vinobaji and Nehru, which soon proved
the source for the rapid shouldering of further responsibilities by him as the
General Secretary of the A. I. C. C., and later as a member of the Planning
Commission. His work everywhere was to the satisfaction of everyone concerned
with the improvement of the activities taken on hand. Therefore his becoming soon
to be known to almost all of the elder leaders of the Congress seemed to be
only a foregone natural event in his life. Having been chosen for
Ambassadorship at <st1:country-region w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region> by
the then Prime Minister, his attempts to strengthen the ties between <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and her
neighbour State gave immense satisfaction to the Government. Further honours
were waiting for him and whether he was prepared for them or not, they were
showered on him. Thus he was chosen the Governor of Gujarat, without being even
previously consulted upon his willingness to accept it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of a very prolonged and deep study of the novels of Aldous Huxley. In six
chapters of his book he attempts to analyse and sum up the achievements of this
great <i>tour de force </i>of the twentieth century. He has made an admirable
attempt at analyzing the novels individually and also thematically, but he has
unfortunately not been able to moderate his desire for quotations from the
originals, which are sometimes of unusual length. At times it becomes difficult
to say where one quotation ends and the other begins. In the Course of the book
there are a few interesting observations he makes. He tries to draw a
relationship between the date of publication and the age of the main character.
By means of a chart he tries to come to the conclusion that the time between
the publication of one novel and another is approximately the same as the
difference in age between one main character and another. Huxley’s characters
are representatives of his own personality. Special mention must be made about
the comparative study of Lawrence and Huxley. It is interesting to note the way
in which the author has compared two such dissimilar characters and highlighted
the various points of similarity. The last chapter of the book more or less
reiterates what has already been said in the first chapter. Nothing new or
original has been said about Huxley. The book is however a commendable piece of
work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

describes and discusses this “Genesis of How We Know.” The argument in the book
is punctuated into four parts. In Part I, he starts with an analysis of man’s
biological structure and instincts, and narrates how he depends on senses and
how through ‘qualitative perceiving’ and ‘quantitative conceiving’ he derives
concepts. In Part II, he takes up ‘Language’ and ‘Language thinking,’ and
analyzes the six levels of abstraction from ‘visible entity’ to the
hallucinary-miraculous non-formable level. Part III is an exposition of the
process of ‘Thinking.’ Through symbolization and language man thinks and
abstracts from the concepts. The author amply illustrates man’s unique method
of abstracting through relative terms – ‘relativity’ and ‘universals’, ‘classification’
and ‘analogizing’, ‘feedback’ and ‘metaphor.’ In Part IV, he projects the
process of ‘Knowing’, and describes man’s qualitative development through knowing,
heritage, and advancement. Through thinking, man ‘rationalizes from cause to
effect that controls his actions.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

carefully ubiquitous and sesquipedalian terminology and quotations, the author
purposely renders the expression simple and direct, and makes it easily
intelligible which is the chief merit of the book. The book affords an

to Yaska the famous Nirukta writer, Vedas admit of three kinds of
interpretation. Sayana in his Bhashya gave us the ritualistic meaning only. The
esoteric meaning known to the sages was transmitted orally to the initiated
only. It was Sri Aurobindo who revealed this symbolic meaning in his writings
and shed new light on the Vedic studies. Sri M. P. Pandit compiled from the
writings of Sri Aurobindo the symbolic inner meanings of different words in
Vedas, arranged them in order and got the compilation published for the first

illuminating revelatory knowledge; Soma outwardly the moon and the Soma wine or
nectarious moon planet, inwardly the God of the spiritual ecstacy–Ananda.” None
but a Maharshi can unveil the hidden symbolic meaning. Sri Aurobindo did it.
Sri Pandit has brought that knowledge to the door of every seeker. Symbolic
meanings of more than 225 words are explained herein. Meanings of Adiiti,

things that are to be known by an entrant into the Upanishadic lore, the
meanings and exact concepts conveyed by some words like Cit Sakti, Karma and
Chaitya Purusha, some topics like God Realisation, intuitive poetry and
character of the Upanishads, immortality, and imagery of the Upanishads, etc.,
are all discussed here in a concise and clear manner. The main teachings of
some Upanishads like Isha, Kena and Chandogya are also presented. Translations
of some important Upanishadic passages are given. What are the Seven Steps? (P.
116) The answer is not found here. Regarding rebirth the author has the
following observation. “There are numerous important passages in almost all the
Upanishads positively affirming rebirth, and, in any case, the Upanishads admit
the survival of the personality after death and its passage into other worlds.
If there is survival in other worlds and also a final destiny of liberation
into Brahman for souls embodied here, rebirth imposes itself.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

substantial scholarly volume under review is a thorough examination of the
philosophies of naturalism as explained in Dewey’s Reconstruction in Philosophy
and Nagel’s Logic without Metaphysics. The criticism leads the author to the
Existentialist’s positions of Marcel and Jaspers. The central theme of the book
is the clear analysis of the deep metaphysics and world view of the great
paleantologist Teilhard de Chardin. The evolutionary philosophy of Chardin has
attracted the Western World and influenced the contemporary thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author of the book institutes a profound and insightful comparison and contrast
between the different existentialists’ concepts in the philosophies of Sartre,
Puber and Jaspers. There is the notable omission of the other two great
existentialists: Heidegger and Tilich. The existentialist’s outlook stands for
decision and commitment and action, in which man truly expresses himself.
Essence comes before existence in man’s life. Man’s will is more ultimate. Man
must assert his authentic existence and free himself from all types of
psychological conditioning. The theistic variety of existentialism is more akin
to Vedanta and is helpful to us all in the art of living. The book is a
substantial contribution to the study and in the exposition of the
Existentialist Philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

methods have been developed for the study of religion. The oldest and the most
popular one has been the historical approach which endeavours to trace the
origin and growth of religious ideas and institutions. In the psychological
approach, attempt is made to probe the deeper layers of religious attitude and
experience and to determine the role of religion in personality development and
human fulfilment. In the phenomenological approach, religious rites, actions
and observances are studied and compared. The anthropologist studies religion
as it expresses itself socially in rites, sacrifices, worship and observances.
The social scientist takes social and economic factors as determinants of
religious manifestations.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a few major figures of the nineteenth century like Blake, Byron and Dickens
were not included in this collection, it is refreshing to find that relatively
unknown writers like Thomas Hood and neglected topics like Wordsworth’s view of
history and Hardy’s theory of fiction are discussed by different scholars.
Ramesh Chandra Sharma’s account of Shelley’s passion for freedom for all men is
fascinating; K. N. Bakaya’s discussion of the development of the dramatic
monologue before Browning is sound. All these essays testify to the range of
interests of the Indian scholars in the nineteenth century British literature
and to the sophistication of their approach to literary problems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is an <i>avant garde </i>of its kind in the dramatic literature in Telugu, the
celebrated author of which, Gurazada Venkata Appa Rao, did yeoman service to
the Telugu muse by portraying on a broad canvas of thematic setting a
cross-section of the society contemporaneous to him with a reformist outlook
there-by offering a message with humanist touch. The play has already become
popular on account of study and presentation and much has been said about it in
praise and curiously enough otherwise also, but a regular critique in book form
on the work was very much wanting and long awaited until Sri Ramana Reddy’s ‘Mahodayam’
appeared on the scene. The present critique by Sri Tirumala Rao is quite
welcome for the simple reason that it is more systematic in its approaches to
the core and surroundings of the subject and accomplished with better critical
care and research acumen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

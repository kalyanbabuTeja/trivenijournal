scarcely wonderful, for Sri Devi herself had taken birth as that babe. Janaka
was overwhelmed with joy, gathered up the beautiful babe to his bosom and took
it to his queen, saying “Look! This is the gift of Mother Earth”. The babe grew
in beauty of body and mind as the days passed. She was Sita.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

without placing it on theground or decanting its contents into other vessels,
he sought to distribute the gift of the gods among his queens, bearing in his
mind their claims and seniority. The Payasam was a Divine gift, and it would be
sacrilege to pour it into baser receptacles even for apportionment. So he first
went to Kausalya.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

She was the youngest of the queens and entitled to the smallest share. That was
why he adopted this method of distribution. Kaikeyi took her share and returned
the vessel to the King. He again went back to Sumitra and gave her the eighth
part that remained after Kakeyi had drunk out of the vessel. The King was
greatly gratified at the realisation of this long-felt wish and was looking
forward eagerly to the blessed event, the birth of children in his household.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lakshmana was brought up with Rama and grew deeply devoted to him. He was the
fruit of the first portion drunk by Sumitra. The fruit of the eighth portion

taught it her out of books. She learnt her lessons amidst life’s hard
realities, and herself passed through the fire. If one learns of suffering
through a mere study of words and books, can one ever realise its full
significance? But going through the bitter experience of exile, fear, and

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The status of kingship which was almost in Rama’s
grasp was snatched away, and faded like a dream. Not willing to be separated
from her husband she accompanied Him to the forest. And there she was assailed
by delusive temptations to which she had before been a stranger. “Get me the
golden deer,” she importuned like a willful child. To Lakshmana, the very embodiment
of selfless devotion, she spoke cruel words charged with unworthy suspicion and
drove him away in bitter tears on what he knew to be a fool’s errand. She was
carried away by Ravana, wailing in helpless anguish–indeed, she who was Lakshmi
herself wailed and sobbed like any mortal. She had the great grief of seeing
the chivalrous Jatayu slain in unequal combat in an attempt to rescue her. Then
she was confined, a prisoner in Lanka. A year passed <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt'>and seeing no hope of deliverance, she was about to put an end to her
life when Hanuman appeared before her. “I have deliverance, at last,” she felt,
and rejoiced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she had expected, her husband came, and killed Ravana and destroyed the
Rakshasa hordes. Her deliverance was come but no joy came with it. A messenger
was sent to fetch her from the Asoka grove where she was imprisoned. She went
with a vague and inexpressible dread. And what did she see? Not the joyful face
of her welcoming Lord But<i> </i>a hard, stern countenance; instead of words of
love instinct with emotions, she heard a cold hard voice which said: “Let me
have proof that you have not swerved from the path of virtue.” When she who was
Sri Devi incarnated as Sita heard this, she thought within herself: “Alas! Now
I realise indeed the full import of grief.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been a prisoner of a lustful Rakshasa. She who had passed through the fiery
ordeal was not beyond the reach of their poison-tongues; and she burned with
shame. (It is difficult for me even to proceed with the story at<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>this point.) “Why do falsehood and illusion
trouble the people of the world?” had been her old question. Here was an answer
to it in her own bitter experience. Sita was exiled to the forest, when she was
about to become a mother. In this state women subject to various fancies and
longings, and it seems she expressed a yearning to go to the forest and
recapture the young happy days of her life with Rama. Advantage was taken of
this to send her on a second and crueller exile. Recognition of her unsullied
purity came only when, weary with trials, she was received back into the
soothing arms of the Mother who had given her </span><span style='font-size:

Incarnation was over. All illusions were past. We come back again to the Ocean
of Milk where reposes Mahavishnu. “Lord, I have now, realised what sorrow is,”
said Sri Devi. “I have realised, as never before, the power of Maya. Henceforth
it shall be my task to attend, to mortals in pain and sorrow, and wipe their
tears and plead for them. Yours must be to save them,” she said. Bhagavati,
Iswari; Sri Devi, Lakshmi, Gowri, Parvati are different names for the
compassionate Mother of the Universe who dwells in the presence of the Lord and
is the Dispenser of His mercy. Hers is the Mother’s heart–compassionate, for as
Sita she had known pain, and sweet with an infinite love of which the purest
earthly mother-love is a particle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

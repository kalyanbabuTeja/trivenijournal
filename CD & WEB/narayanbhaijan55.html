came out of jail after six months. His father and mother treated him with love
as before; they did not turn their faces away as from a thief or dacoit. That
day it was quite a sensation in the tea garden. Narayan’s father bought a
chicken on credit. His mother had kept a pitcher of rice-beer ready. During his
six months’ stay in jail he regularly got letters from his father, once a week.
His parents loved him so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

months before, they had man-handled ‘<span class=SpellE>Burra</span> Sahib’,
that is, the garden manager. There was a clash between the ‘<span class=SpellE>Burra</span>
Sahib’ and the <span class=SpellE>Labour</span> Union over the hoeing rate. The
Sahib spoke of law and the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place> did not want
to obey law. The Sahib, burning with anger, called the workers names and
threatened that he would “dismiss the tall-talking coolies”. But the <span
class=SpellE>Labour</span> Union was adamant–they were prepared to fight for
the good of the coolies. Narayan, on behalf of the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>,
called at the manager’s office to lay before him the Union <span class=GramE>resolutions</span>.
The manager dismissed him from his factory job, then and there. That very day
the <span class=SpellE>labourers</span> assaulted the Sahib when he was out on
field work. The police came and arrested six <span class=SpellE>labourers</span>,
Narayan among them: he was the Secretary of the <span class=SpellE>Labour</span>
Union. Each of them was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

after six months Narayan sat down for lunch in his own home with his father.
They were having chicken fry and drink. The curious children of the
‘coolie-line’ collected round him to see what the jailed one looked like. He
told them he did not go to jail like an ordinary thief, but like Gandhi <span
class=SpellE>Maharaj</span>, fighting for a good cause; even in <span
class=SpellE>Vilayat</span> (<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
there were people jailed like that. The children looked at Narayan, so well
known to them, smiling all along and they were amazed. Well, he was not sad or
depressed as a thief would be. Was Gandhi <span class=SpellE>Maharaj</span>
like that too? Who could tell?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

took all the tidings of the garden as he sipped his drink. The ‘<span

Union was there with <span class=SpellE>Riday</span> <span class=SpellE>Chowkidar</span>
still as its President and Mohan the <span class=SpellE>Dakwalla</span> as the
new Secretary. <span class=SpellE>Barbarua</span> came from the Circle Office
as before to decide this case or that. And Narayan had lost his factory Job for
good. That naughty girl of their Line, <span class=SpellE>Anjana</span>, had a
little son now. The <span class=SpellE>rumour</span> was that the boy was from
the <span class=SpellE>Godown</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Anjana</span> was now living in Line Number Seven with <span
class=SpellE>Bibhishan</span>, that madcap of a man for a harmonium. <span
class=SpellE>Ramlal</span> the drunkard one day beat his wife to death and was
now in jail. Saraswati had been given in marriage; <span class=SpellE>Lal</span>
Sing was one day discovered dying while abed, poor dear old man. <span
class=SpellE>Bhagawan</span> and Vishnu did not come back to garden work. They
learned mechanic’s work during war-time: <span class=SpellE>Bhagawan</span> now
drove a contractor’s lorry and Vishnu worked in a motorcar repairing shop.
There was no fish in the river this time; Narayan’s father could catch only a
small ‘<span class=SpellE>Boal</span>’ in a whole night; <span class=SpellE>Lal</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sing’s</span> little son caught rather a big tortoise with
his rod.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

father observed, “What trash they are giving with the ration! Mustard oil you
can’t take. Rice is just rotten. We hear money will be paid instead of rice.
That will be very <span class=GramE>hard,</span> you can’t find rice in the <span

was yet another piece of information for Narayan: his mother whispered to him
that <span class=SpellE>Anjana’s</span> sister <span class=SpellE>Ranjana</span>
was still in the Line, unmarried. The Sahib’s bearer, <span class=SpellE>Dubraj</span>,
was trying to marry her and negotiating with her parents. Of course Narayan’s
parents had all along, been trying to dissuade the girl’s parents, because it
was Narayan with whom <span class=SpellE>Ranjana’s</span> wedding had been
settled. It would have been all over had he not been jailed. Now that he was <span

next morning found Narayan in quite a new world. He would no longer stay in a
narrow jail room, no more of sleeping on a dirty blanket. The sun had just <span
class=GramE>risen</span>, its long rays touching the earth. Men and women were
coming out of the Line with baskets on their heads. The <span class=SpellE>Sardars</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Chowkidars</span> were shouting at the top of their
voices to rouse those who were still lying asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

brushed his teeth with a tea-stem and looked on the women, walking in a long

huge basket on her head, and the smaller one inside it, and, perhaps, a pair of
motor-<span class=SpellE>tyre</span> sandals inside the smaller basket. Her
right hand was on the basket and the left swinging on the side. She wrapped
herself with red and white cloths up to her knees, with another piece of cloth
over her blouse of Japanese silk. A little bag of areca-nut tied to her fine
waist was dancing as she walked. With a mouthful of <span class=SpellE>unchewn</span>

Secretary <span class=SpellE>Barbarua</span> was right to say that the <span

supposed to have enjoyed. The National Government was trying their utmost to
better the condition of the <span class=SpellE>labourers</span>. That was very
good. Narayan had roamed from garden to garden to help <span class=SpellE>Barbarua</span>
<span class=SpellE>organise</span> meetings and form Unions. He had read up to
the Third Class and so was made the Secretary of their Garden Union. He wanted
to fight for his brethren’s uplift. That was why he was not sorry to go to
jail, even though he was not in league with others in assaulting the Sahib.
Today <span class=SpellE>Ranjana</span> kindled the fire of hope in him doubly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

him what they were after. The new ‘<span class=SpellE>Burra</span> Sahib’,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, it was a magnificent city!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And how beautiful did it appear when the Lord of the Sky slowly ascended the horizon! Birds sang in melodious tunes and golden rays of the sun kissed the flowers that were embellished with dew-drops. Golden towers seemed to emulate the skies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And above all, rich people in their rich carriages enhanced the glory of the city.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But alas! In a corner stood a beggar with his trembling hand stretched forward. Weak and starved, he stood at the door of death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seemed that the darkness, which was now fast vanishing, entered into his unhappy heart. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Take pity upon me, Lords,&quot; he cried. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rich were going in their rich carriages. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They looked at him and passed on. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A labourer, on his way to the mill, passed by the beggar.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I wonder who is the more unfortunate of us two,&quot; muttered the labourer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sir, mercy upon me,&quot; cried the beggar.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My friend,&quot; the labourer stopped and said, &quot;I have only two coins and I must have them to keep myself well till this evening. I am very sorry.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The labourer started for his mill, but his heart was with the beggar.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Mercy upon me, Sir,&quot; cried the beggar.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The labourer turned back.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Well, take all this! Never mind if I have nothing till the evening! And now good-bye.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Giving all his money to the beggar, he hastened to his mill.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The eyes of the beggar beamed with sweet delight…..And the rich people were passing by in their rich carriages!</P>

Livingstone in one of his well-known essays points out that the universities
are nerve <span class=SpellE>centres</span> of modern civilization. Abolish the
universities, abolish the mind. A recent article by an American Professor Lowe
questions the relevance of higher education. Oscar Wilde’s witticism that what
we need is lower education is not irrelevant to a permissive society. Higher
education is aloof: it is abstract; it does not come home to the bosoms and
business of men. This island of contemplation should be connected by the
isthmus of relevance to the vast continent of life. <span class=GramE>If the
gown and the town do not meet, the worse for the gown.</span> The idea of a
university ranges between these two extremes. But what is a university as it
arose in the medieval times in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>? A
university is not an institution, as many suppose, where “all” subjects are
taught. “Universities” from which the word is derived means a corporation.
Scholars from various parts of the country formed themselves into guilds for
protection and security. So the word university means a meeting place of
scholars. That is why Newman writes in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Idea of a University</i> that the metropolis of a country is a university.
Perhaps this is the implication of the remark of Sam Weller in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Pickwick Papers</i>. “I have given my
son the best education. I have allowed him to loaf about the streets of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>. Loafing about the
streets of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>
is as good as university education.” As a matter of fact books do not teach, in
the opinion of Bacon, their own use. Books are a bloodless substitute, says
Stevenson, for life. Book-learning has to be supplemented and supplied by life.
“Deep read in books but shallow in mind” is a familiar statement about bookish idiots
like the four brothers who poured life into a dead lion only to lose their own,
or the scholar trying to find out if the ghee was dependent on the vessel or
the vessel was dependent on the ghee turned the vessel upside down and lost the
ghee. One can talk, as <span class=SpellE>Hazlitt</span> does, about the
ignorance of the learned: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Do these contribute to maintaining the university as a seat of learning and

hours, research-biased education, the semester system, study of English as a
tool of communication, subject-oriented English, job-biased courses,
universities remaining affiliating or residential, the role of student unions,
student participation in the university bodies, Criteria for selecting and
promoting teachers or admitting students for higher courses, starting
post-graduate classes in the degree colleges, etc. These may be categorized

than the knowledge of Entropy. To imagine that poetry would do the miracle of
remaking man is, of course, as foolish as to moor a vessel with threads of silk
or cut blocks of ice with a razor. If any discipline can make man better, it is
literature. Literature places in our palm experience we can never hope to
obtain. Art is long but life is brief. And one who has greater experience is
wiser than one who has less. The physical sciences “murder to dissect”: the
biological sciences induce a false hope of limitless evolution into better
beings and technology, has led merely to elaborate barbarism. Dr <span
class=SpellE>Conant</span>, a distinguished chemist, said that in terms of
general education poetry and philosophy are of vastly more important than science.
In the light of the above abolition or the reduction of the study of literature
is a short-sighted measure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the university devoted to the diffusion of knowledge or research, that is, addition

today. Literary archaeologists dig up a fifth-rate author from oblivion into

intellectual <span class=SpellE>calibre</span>. Newman is of the view that if
research is the aim of the university, why should students be there at all? Of course,
his idea is unacceptable today. But his idea that all knowledge is one is
acceptable; we call it cross-disciplinary fertilization. This interaction cures
each discipline of any elephantiasis; otherwise a truck driver may imagine that
God also is a truck driver. <span class=SpellE>Specialism</span> is a menace to

teachers committed to learning and very few students committed to scholarship.
According to Newman, university is a guild of scholars, some more advanced than
others; no distinction is made between teachers and students. But how can

bodies as if university is a power to be shared by all and not some ideal of
scholarship to be pursued jointly. Students are not the citizens of the future

For instance, the publication of a work of scholarship should be one of the
finest moments in the life of a university; but it does not raise the slip test

temples of tension. They should remain seats of learning and knowledge because <span
class=SpellE>unbiassed</span> contemplation of problems helps us to solve them
aright; praxis follows, or ought to, gnosis. Otherwise it is the blind leading
the blind. Universities should be not only seats of learning but laboratories
of character training. If they are to be the nerve <span class=SpellE>centres</span>
of the play of the mind they should have a vision of the first rate: the tenth <span

gives a list of the first-rate: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ramah <span
class=SpellE>Sastrabhrutamaham</span></i>. The vision at present seems to be
the vision of examinations. Universities are factories of degree-production. It
is the exaggerated importance of the degree that has vitiated even the
examinations; mass scale copying is part of the examination today and a degree
makes you think that you know when you do not really know. Universal education may
turn out to be universal illiteracy: a little knowledge is a dangerous thing: <span

recently that our degrees should be revalidated every five or ten years. It is pleasant
to mention that I made the same suggestion eight years ago in my paper on <span
class=SpellE>Psittacism</span>. He also says that we should have humanistic
technology. The Harvard Professor Chomsky in the recent Nehru Memorial Lecture
drew a lurid picture of technology minus humanism. When Barker tells us that
technological institutes should not remain technological, we pride ourselves on
technological institutes. The weakness with us Indians is adopting an idea discarded
by the West and implementing it with fatal enthusiasm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

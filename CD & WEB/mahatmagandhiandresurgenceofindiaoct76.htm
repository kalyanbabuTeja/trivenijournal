AND RESURGENCE OF INDIA</span><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>DR G. SRIRAMA MURTY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru has aptly compared the coming of Gandhi to that of ‘a
whirl-wind that upset many things, but most of all the working of people’s
minds.’<sup>1</sup> He was indeed a force to reckon with. There is no
department of national life which does not bear his impress and <span
class=SpellE>signeur</span>. For nearly half a century, the entire country has
been under the spell of Gandhi. During the elections his name has been a magic
shibboleth for opening the heart-gates of the voting populace. Nehru and <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> spoke the language of Gandhi and tried to tread
close to his footprints. But gradually, there came a change in the temper of the
times. Though lip sympathy has been shown to him, still, though still his birth
anniversary has been observed with ritualistic <span class=SpellE>fervour</span>,
every one knows today Gandhi is but an empty name that had lost its charm. The
age of scientific socialism that came after him has no use for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
decline in the interest of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ideology was followed
by an all round decline in national life. The disruptive forces of <span
class=SpellE>casteism</span> and communalism, of corruption and nepotism that
were held on leash by <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> leadership of <span
class=SpellE>ascetism</span> and self-denial lifted up their ugly heads again
and made the country a bear garden. Violence had become the order of the day
and the authority of the Government was flouted with impunity by all and
sundry. Schools and colleges were closed; and nation’s youth were on roads,
veritable sons of <span class=SpellE>Baliol</span>, Naturally amidst this <span
class=SpellE>clamour</span> and confusion, men’s minds turned to Gandhi once
again in the hope of finding a <span class=SpellE>penacea</span> there. Some of
the recent critical appraisals of India wondered whether Gandhi is really the
Father of the Nation, whether he had contributed substantially to the
resurgence of India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
a challenging book on contemporary Indian situation, <i>Hindu Ethos and the
Challenge of Change, </i>its author, <span class=SpellE>Subhayu</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dasgupta</span>, had written a few words regarding the role of Gandhi
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in<i> </i></span>shaping new India
which we may take as fairly representative of the contem­porary attitude to
Gandhi. He writes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I
refrained from including Gandhi into the same category with Tagore, Nehru or <span
class=SpellE>Jayaprakash</span> <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> because
Gandhi in many ways was to me, much more a man of tradition than of
renaissance, much more a man of the past than of the future”.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
laughs at Gandhi’s trusteeship idea and wonders why the Government has been
spending colossal amounts on <span class=SpellE>Khadi</span> and village
industries. The sooner India sets over this fond sentiment­alism the better for
its future. We can understand his virulent attack on <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
economics but we fail to understand when he says that Gandhi does not even <span
class=SpellE>favourably</span> compare with Viveka­nanda whose mantle we know
had fallen on him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Gandhi
has been mostly misunderstood because many of his critics believe that he is no
more than a bringer of freedom to India, who had enjoyed unprecedented
popularity with masses because of his simple living and absolute sincerity of
word and deed. What they miss to note is that to the Mahatma national
liberation is but a step forward in the direction of greater liberation or <span
class=SpellE><i>Moksha</i></span><i> </i>of Man. His ideal is a nation of
liberated souls, though it sounds utopian. He himself said that he was
essentially a man of religion strayed into politics. It follows from this that
his religious outlook defined his position as a politician, economist and
social thinker. Since religion and culture go together and any particular
culture is but an expression of its faith, it emerges that if we want to
understand Gandhi’s contribution to modern India, it must be sought in the
field of cultural renaissance of India. All other aspects of Indian life
subsume in the cultural stream of India.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
cultural foundations of India are to be found in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the
<i>Ramayana, </i>the <i>Mahabharata </i>and the <span class=SpellE><i>Bhagavad</i></span><i>
Gita. </i>Gandhi’s basic thought is <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> by these
books and the influential saints like <span class=SpellE>Tulsidas</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Kabirdas</span> and <span class=SpellE>Mirabai</span> who mirrored
the living religious thought of Hindu scriptures in their lives. Gandhi seems to
rely more on the living tradition of Hindu saints than on the abstract,
difficult to understand philosophies of the learned <span class=SpellE>Acharyas</span>
like <span class=SpellE>Sankara</span>, <span class=SpellE>Ramanuja</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Madhva</span>. An exponent of the <span class=SpellE>prestine</span>
Hindu thought, free from the later day accretions of rigid <span class=SpellE>casteism</span>,
vulgar superstitions, cant and hypocrisy, he established Truth as living God
and <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> nothing else beside it. When a
correspondent accused him of having confused truth and non-violence with the
Hindu creed, he rebutted the charge by saying,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“The
crime is deliberate. It is the good fortune or misfortune of Hinduism that it
has no official creed. If I were asked to define the Hindu creed, I should
simply say: search after truth through non-violent means. A man may not believe
even in God and still call himself a Hindu. Hinduism is a relentless pursuit
after Truth”.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is the master light of all his seeing. All his social, economic and political
thought, his relentless opposition to the oppression of the downtrodden, his
ceaseless fight against com­munalism, colonialism and exploitation of every
description spring from this focal point. He arrived at this point not merely
by following the Hindu thought and tradition but by sifting it with the
rational approach he imbibed from the West. He was deeply influenced by writers
like Ruskin, Thoreau and Tolstoy. Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Christianity too
<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> his life, thought and outlook on life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>His
Hinduism, then, is not a legacy of the middle ages which petrified the soul of
India, necessitated a renaissance and precipi­tated reformation in the
nineteenth century. The tradition to which he clung ardently is no
soul-freezing caste-ridden religious­ tradition perpetrated by the purblind
pontiffs of hallowed religious institutions. On the other hand, it is a revived
spiritual tradition re-interpreted in the light of the needs of the changing
society. His place in the cultural renaissance of India is similar to that of
Vivekananda. <span class=GramE>As Dr Kai Nicholson observes “the thought of the
Swamy found expression through the deeds of Gandhi”.</span><sup> 4</sup> Gandhi
like Vivekananda believed that it is through spirituality alone that we can
become a nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
brings us to another important contribution of Gandhi to the movement of
national renaissance. By his re-discovery of the ancient Hindu tradition and by
re-interpreting some of the fundamental tenets of Hindu thought such as Karma,
Dharma, Avatar and caste he blazed a new trail of thought that might be called
a new philosophy of history. His interpretation of Gita is a classic by itself.
In Gita he found a sanction for the disinterested action. By preaching and <span
class=SpellE>practising</span> the gospel of <span class=SpellE><i>anasakti</i></span><i>
yoga, </i>he not only prepared the nation to rock the foundations of the
British Empire in India but also tried to rebuild the Hindu society on the firm
foundations of duty, charity and control. By accepting a teleological view of
history and by advocating purposive living as human ideal, he had been able to
give a spiritual meaning and content to the historical process and human
destiny. An inveterate believer in the inevitable progress of man and <span
class=SpellE>perfectabilhy</span> of human nature, he redeemed the traditional
Hindu view of life of its latent pessimism and created a new outlook on life.
By placing a heavy accent on the role of the individual in society and at the
same time highlighting the responsibility of the community in giving
opportunities to the individual to live his destiny, he paved the way of <span
class=SpellE>conflictless</span> society. His untiring advocacy of communal
harmony in the place of class conflict and his posing “<span class=SpellE>Sarvodaya</span>”
as an alternative to scientific socialism opened a new vision of history. He
recognized the importance of economic forces in shaping the history of mankind
but refused to accept Marxist philosophy as valid. “While he appeared to agree
with the Marxian analysis that man’s commerce with matter, his economic life,
his modes of production and distribution of economic goods influence, politics
and ethics and generally the social life of community, he refused to believe
that there was a necessary co-rela­tion between the construction of a new
social order and the distinc­tion of the old one or that the ‘economic’ was the
only factor which mattered”.<sup>5</sup> The new view of history is best
summarized by B. G. Gokhale as “a two-dimensional unfolding of the inter­action
between man and the supreme spirit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Inspired
by the Hindu concept of circular time, Gandhi rejects the idea of linear and
continuous progress advocated by the western historians. It is unfair to call
him a reactionary who wants to set the clock back on that score. Once we
understand his spiritual interpretation of history based on Hindu religious
thought, the criticism seems to be wide of mark. A man of tradi­tion he is also
a man of renaissance because in his hands tradition itself acquired a new
significance and donned the dress of modern­ity. Perhaps he is more a man of
renaissance than a man of tradition since his definite contribution is towards
renaissance. We close this section with an observation made by A. M. <span
class=SpellE>Mundadan</span> in his paper <i>Hindu and Christian view of life </i>regarding
the contribu­tion of Gandhi and others to the renaissance of India. He writes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“As
Samantha states, there are indications that a more positive view of history is
being emerged in modern India. To substantiate this observation he calls
attention to three major themes in modern Hindu thought represented by such <span
class=SpellE>religio</span>-philosophical thinkers of modern Hinduism as
Tagore, Gandhi, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan, who are not merely the products of
modern Hindu renaissance but also men who, in some measure, made a lasting
contribution to its character and movements”.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
<span class=SpellE>gravamen</span> of Gandhi criticism, however, is directed
against his political economy. This determined opposition to industry and
excessive stress on self-sufficient village community and the idea of
trusteeship, though all apiece with his central doctrine of truth and
non-violence, appear to be all moonshine, especially in the context of
ever-growing technocracy of the ever-shrinking world of the supersonic age. It <span
class=GramE>is,</span> however, well to remember two things in this connection.
One, his economics of <span class=SpellE>Swadeshi</span> and opposition to
machinery are but logical corollaries of his first principles–­truth and
non-violence; two, he is grossly misrepresented regarding his views on the use
of machinery. Gandhi often makes contra­dictory and untenable statements on the
spur of the moment. But these statements do not trouble us the moment we link
them with his first principles. We should give some credit to his pragmatic
approach in evaluating his theories. His basic approach to machines is clearly
defined by the following passage and all other statements must be interpreted
in the light of this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Pure
<span class=SpellE>Swadeshi</span> is not at all opposed to machinery...Opposition
to mills or machinery is not the point. What suits our country most is the
point. I am not opposed to the movement of manufac­turing machines in the
country, <span class=GramE>nor</span> to making improvements in machinery. I am
only concerned with what the machines are meant for. I may ask, in the words of
Ruskin, whether these machines will be such as would blow off a million men in
a minute or they will be such as would turn waste lands into arable and fertile
land”.<sup> 7</sup><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Gandhi’s
sagacity comes home to us when we consider strikes like the one organized by
employees of the Life Insurance Corporation of India as a protest against the
introduction of computers. The developments all over the world since his death,
especially those in Japan, seem to justify his attitude to small-scale
industries. Gunner <span class=SpellE>Myrdal’s</span> appraisal of Gandhi as a
Radical Liberal is more to the point in this context than any other estimate of
his economic programme:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“His
hostility to modern industrial technology and to machines and, more generally,
his pro-rural and <span class=SpellE>anticity</span> bias were sometimes
expressed in terms which are hardly compatible with enlightened liberalism. But
the recognition in recent years of the very predominant importance of
agriculture in economic development and also of the under-utilized <span
class=SpellE>labour</span> resources have, to an extent, proved these ideas of
his to be less irrational than they seemed to be at a time when develop­ment
was narrowly defined as industrialization and when it was believed that
industrialization would rapidly create new employment that would make possible
the ‘skimming off’ the ‘<span class=SpellE>labour</span> surplus’ in
agriculture. Even at the culmination of that era-approximately in the years
when the Second Five ­Year Plan was prepared–the planners found a compromise
with <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ideology, to reserve a large area of
production of consumption goods for traditional <span class=SpellE>labour</span>-intensive
technology. In regard to central state planning generally, when Indian policy
has seemed to deviate most conspicuously from Gandhi’s teaching, there may now
be forebodings of an evolution of thinking that comes close to Gandhi’s own.
The plans produced in predominantly financial terms have turned out to be
fictitious and misleading. Consequently India is beginning to realize the
necessity to perceive development as a process encompassing the entire social
system. This was Gandhi’s view, though he never elaborates it”.<sup> 8</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus
we see even in the sphere of political economy Gandhi’s ideas are of certain
relevance and use in new India. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Gandhi
belongs to the future as well. In future, he will be followed even in the
societies when Hinduism is of no consequence. Already we have seen how Martin
Luther King has used <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> techniques in North
America to checkmate the ruthless exploita­tion of the Negro race by the
power-drunk whites of America. Many African and Asian nations owe their
independence to the beneficial posthumous influence of the Mahatma. So long as
freedom and equality remain the cherished goals of humanity, so long as fear,
greed and jealousy curb the free expression of man’s spirit, so long as man
plays wolf to man, Gandhi will survive. A <span class=SpellE>saviour</span> of
mankind, he will live for ages and earn the gratitude of the dumb millions of
untold generations to come.</p>

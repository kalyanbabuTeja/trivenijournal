mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>(Translated from the original ORIYA by V. V.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Before the moon of the Chathurthi had set, a bit of
black cloud appeared on the horizon, and slowly covered the four directions
with darkness. Sujono das has not yet returned home for the day. His wife,
Gunjoro, has cooked a little <i>sago </i>(leafy vegetable) brought from the
backyard, some dried fish, two brinjals fried in oil, and a handful of rice,
and is waiting for him. His old mother is sitting by the kitchen-fire and is
nodding. The lamp which is burning is spreading four times as much smoke as
light. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sujono at last came home. Gunjoro showed domestic
anger in her face and asked, “Who will sit so late waiting for you every day?
Why don’t you finish your <i>tamashas </i>before the end of day? Your old
mother waited and waited, and has gone to sleep without eating or drinking.”
Sujono was engaged in no <i>tamashas</i>. He was troubled. Yet he smiled at his
wife and said, “You should have taken your food and gone to sleep. I would have
served myself food and eaten it.” Gunjoro replied with her chin on her knee,
“Yes, you may say anything in jest.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>While Sujono ate, his wife looked on him. These
humble, illiterate farmers do not understand the meaning of the word “love”. Of
“friendship” and “devotion” they have not heard. Yet they experience them in
their souls. It could not be said that these two people with all their poverty
were less happy than those who had riches. But today Gunjoro noticed a troubled
expression in her <i>swami’s </i>face. She was also troubled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>They were from farmers’ homes, and so they were
married when children. During the past six years, this poor family had many
calamities. Sujono’s father died and their lands have been mortgaged to
zemindars and merchants. What remains is the house in which they live. Several
of Sujono’s ancestors had fought with famines, big and small, and come out
triumphant by sheer physical strength. They never had to go to someone else for
a seer of rice. But today Sujono is a wage earner bringing five seers!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Between man and wife there have been quarrels,
surely. But they always made them up. Sometimes they gave up talking to each
other for a few days. And then, if the old mother went to visit the neighbours,
Sujono was put in an awkward position. If he wanted a little oil, he would call
his mother for it. Gunjoro would act as the mother’s representative and bring
him what he wanted. Sometimes she would not respond to his call of “Mother!”
And the quarrel would be made up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gunjoro had noticed that something was troubling
Sujono, but did not know what it was. While he was taking his food, Sujono
asked, “What? Should we forever lead a life of sorrow?” She thought he did not
like the food, and she was sorry. She replied, “Tell us what else we could do.
Whatever grows in the backyard, we cook.” Sujono was irritated and told her:
“No, I am not thinking of the cooking. For two years there has not even been a
weed in the fields. How are we to get on, the three of us?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gunjoro could not know the seriousness of the
position and replied in jest, “We will get on as we did before.” Sujono said in
a pained tone. “This is why I don’t tell you anything. You take everything
lightly. Last time I had brought a little paddy from Hori Santhora, and you
should have heard what he said to me today. No man in blood and flesh could
endure those words. It is impossible for me to get a seer anywhere. And as long
as I am strong, I won’t let you and my old mother go to pound rice. The fields
are a desert and there is no work I can do there. Tell me what I can do.” What
could she tell? She was also troubled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gunjoro could not relish her food because of the
uneasiness of her husband. She touched the feet of her old mother-in-law and
went to their bed-room. Sujono was turning some documents and papers by a lamp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mortgaged to Dodhi Samolo, and we have not yet been able to release it. At this
rate I wonder whether we will be able to live until next year.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His wife would point out that they were neither six
nor nine people to worry about. But how could even three people hold on?
Gunjoro was reminded of something and wanted to give evidence of her wisdom: “I
hear someone is giving away rice. Why not we go and get some?” Sujono smiled
sadly; “What? Are we to bring that rice? Then you might as well go to the fair
at Banapur and beg for rice.” Gunjoro understood her foolishness, but asked in
playfulness: “If you give the word, would I not go?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Gunjoro was worried. She asked, “Who is this
distributing so much rice?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Those grains are being given by big people from
all countries. Are not those who take that rice the same as beggars? Some go
begging from door to door. And someone comes from door to door to give alms.”
Gunjoro was astonished to hear this. Have these people no work that they go
about giving alms? Sujono told her: “Are you still thinking about those alms?
only the other day a <i>babu </i>was saying, ‘Try to feed your bellies by your
own labours as much as you can. If you cannot, this rice is your last resort.
We are not giving you this help so that the world may be full of beggars’.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this and asked him, “Hullo, what has happened to us that you are worrying so
much?” Sujono sighed and said, “No, nothing has happened. Only the water is
drowning our house and has come up to the knee. What else can happen? I have
been telling you so much, but you could not understand anything.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

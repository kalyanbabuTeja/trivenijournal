mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The fight in Kashmir is not only a struggle between
the invaders–or ‘raiders’ as they are otherwise called–on the one hand, and the
Indian Union troops on the other, to gain free access to the beautiful and
fertile valley of Kashmir, but a struggle between two ideologies as well. It is
a choice between subjugation by brute force and self-determination by the
people, between the unity of the citizens of Kashmir and continuance of their
social and cultural ties with India, or surrender to rank communalism and
virtual suicide. In Gandhiji’s words “It is on the soil of Kashmir that Islam
and Hinduism are being weighed. If both pull their weight correctly and in the
same direction, the chief actors will cover themselves with glory and nothing
can move them from their joint credit.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This was perhaps the main consideration which
induced the present writer to avail himself of the facility provided by the
Government of India to fly to Kashmir and see things at first hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was an early morning on the last day of November
that we, a party of writers and journalists, left New Delhi by a supply plane
and landed at the Srinagar aerodrome by noon the same day. Though the sky was
cloudless and the day pleasantly sunny, a cold wind blowing through the wide
open fields had filled the atmosphere with a chill. It was almost freezing.
Bleak mountains, dense only at their bases with foliage, were being capped
increasingly with snow by the incoming winter. Leafless coniferrous trees stood
erect like silent sentries at the foot of the hoary Himalayan range.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>On landing, the first to catch our eye were the
unfortunate victims of tribal vandalism, men, women, children, who commonly
pass under the category of ‘refugees’. We were told they were only a few of a
long and unceasing stream of such unfortunates trekking towards the aerodrome
on camels, horseback, carts, tongas, lorries, and cars. With a blank look in
their eyes and morose faces, they looked around with a mixed feeling of hope
and desperation. Armed though most of them were with the technical
refugee-permits (these were hardly worth the scrap of paper on which they were
written), they were constantly shunted from this officer to that for proper
information and instructions. Thus they had to spend many days and nights in
the open airfield not knowing what to do. In the wake of sunrise they prayed
solemnly for a clear day so that planes might come and take them away. The
drone of every incoming plane appeared to them to be a new message of hope, an
angel of liberation; but when, one by one, all the planes left Srinagar without
them, or at least without most of them, their anguish was sickening. Yet they
were not very loud in their complaints against the attitude of the authorities
concerned, who appeared to be rather over conscious of their authority and not
sufficiently mindful of the heavy burden of their responsibility. They were
reported to have said that they were not in a position to cope with such a
heavy burden, in spite of their requisitioning the maximum number of planes
from all the Indian chartered air-services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with an air of conscientious disregard, which made us a bit more inquisitive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“That is what I am actually come to. Well, I tried
to argue with them for hours and hours together, but to no avail. I asked them
plainly, ‘where would you go? East Punjab is no place for you. Delhi has no
room for so many of you either. The houses and refugee-camps over there are too
full, and food is very scarce and costly.’ But their obvious excuse was: ‘Who
would protect us here. Having lost all sense of security of life and property,
what shall we do here?’ The point is, these people are overawed, panicky. But
if that be so, if flight is the only remedy for aggression, well, then why
worry about the fate of Kashmir or the outcome of the so-called referendum?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Undoubtedly, it made lots of sense. It made us
think: Should this uprooted humanity go away like that? Could they afford to?
And whereto? Who will look after their hearths and homes? Besides, the trail of
suffering and misery they carry from place to place is bound to excite passions
and thus make a solution of the problem doubly difficult. But we were rather in
a hurry to get away with it, and with our luggage, to the town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Public conveyances were scarce around the aerodrome
for want of petrol. The only cars, lorries and trucks seen about were either of
the officials or that of the contractors. So we had to fall back upon a few
tongas which were there incidentally. It is a strip of seven miles’ unmetalled
road which connects the aerodrome with the town. After negotiating a few winds
and descents, as we proceeded in the direction of the town, we saw houses on
both sides of the road abandoned by their panicky inhabitants. These belong
mainly to the Sikhs and the Hindus. Where could they stop if they simply flew
away at the approach of raiders, we murmured.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But these were not the only people to do so. On
reaching Srinagar we were told that just three days after the raiders’ attack
on Kashmir, and when they were rumoured to be about three or four miles away
from the Srinagar aerodrome, the Maharaja fled, lock, stock and barrel, for the
safety of his person, throwing to the winds all sense of duty and
responsibility towards his people, and especially the minority community. He
was coolly and loyally followed not only by his retinue but also the Prime
Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Home Minister, thus leaving the
poor, helpless people and the Capital to their fate and probably to the mercy
of the raiders. This conduct of the absolute and undemocratic monarch, not
commensurate with the lofty tradition of his ancestors, hardly deserves any
comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This flight of the Maharaja and his Ministers
worked as a lever to demoralise a section of the State forces and resulted in a
virtual breakdown of the administrative machinery at Srinagar. Had the National
Conference not stepped in to fill up the political vacuum thus created by the
sudden collapse of the administration in time, and helped to maintain law and
order by allaying popular misgivings and panic and enlisted people’s active
co-operation and support in doing so, what would have been the fate of Srinagar
and especially the minority community living there? For three days and nights
the people of Srinagar heard with bated breath the roar of the enemy’s guns,
the patter of his machine-guns and the explosions of hand grenades. People,
especially of the minority community, spent sleepless nights and many stood
guard for the signal of any approaching danger. The rich and privileged were
more shaky than the rest. Some of them had a shrewd suspicion that the attitude
of a section of the majority community beyond the Fourth Bridge was rather
threatening. But nothing untoward came off. Many good and sensible Muslims
assured the minority community of their protection and they faithfully stood by
their word. People could thus carry on their normal avocations without much
ado.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In an hour’s time we arrived at Srinagar. Once the
boom town of the lucky visitor and the rich trader, the back-garden of paradise
with its Nishat, Shalimar and the Dal, Srinagar lay today in the shadow of
gloom. The stories of the raiders’ depradations appeared to have cast their
shadow on it too. Its placid, unhurried and remote life continued without
glamour or glee. With a few stream-lined cars, cosy house-boats, furnished
bungalows, banks, hotels, cinemas and business houses, the grinding poverty and
backwardness of the people is writ large on the town. Since the division of India
into Pakistan and India, and with Rawalpindi, the western-end of Kashmir’s
life-line coming under Pakistan, all trade through this principal route has
come to a standstill. Thus Srinagar’s trade and importance have both speedily
deteriorated. The prices of Kashmir’s fruits, silks, woolens and other
exportable commodities have considerably come down and thus added to the
privations of the people in these days of soaring cost of living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Having fixed up our rooms at the hotel, we set out
for our fact-finding mission, so to say. Though we were there out of season, we
were fortunate enough to be welcomed and received warmly by officials as well
as non-officials. Kashmiris have a noble tradition of hospitality. They were
more hospitable, polite and noble when they knew that we had not gone there on
a pleasure trip or to report the day-to day encounters with the raiders, but to
study the background of their resistance movement. We had the audacity to tell
them that we had brought with us India’s message of hope, goodwill and
admiration for their united stand against the tribal marauders, and that we had
the fullest and most unshakable confidence in the ultimate outcome of their
grim struggle. The victorious conclusion of their struggle, we asserted, would
not only go a long way to forge real Hindu-Muslim unity in the whole of India
but would also serve as a clarion call for the long overdue liberation of the
States’ peoples. Their eyes glistened with hope and they greeted us with a
smile we shall never forget.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The more we met, saw and talked to the Kashmiris,
the more we were depressed to know their miseries and hardship. That the
ravishingly beautiful valley with its loamy, fertile soil and considerable
forest wealth should only be inhabited by a starving peasantry and a privileged
labouring class (craftsmen and factory-workers), that the whole population,
fine, simple and docile, should be denied the most elementary rights of civil
liberty, that grinding poverty and chronic slavery should retain its worst features
under a total blackout of civic rights, is but a sad commentary on a
century-and-a half old Dogra regime. The poor peasant and the starving artisan
is compelled, for economic reasons, to man a plough or drag a cart during the
day and sleep in a shabby water-home, built on stilts, during the freezing
night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is no wonder, therefore, that the Dogra regime’s
misrule has been ingeniously turned into an anti-Hindu agitation by the stooges
of the Muslim reactionaries masquerading as the Muslim Conference, which has
now assumed the self-styled authority of a ‘Free Kashmir Government’ after the
attack by non-Kashmiri tribesmen from north and west! Added to the ugly
character of the undemocratic Dogra regime, the role played by the Kashmiri
Pandits, the main supporters and runners of a most corrupt, inefficient and
inept administration, has also given rise to some misgiving in the minds of the
Muslims. To add to all this, the Punjabi Hindu trader has not only been
rapacious and cunning but a bully also. It is under the weight of oppression
and exploitation of this three-fold evil that the poor Kashmiris, a majority of
whom happen to be Muslims, have been groaning if since the last century and a
half. But the remedy does not lie replacing ill an undemocratic and outmoded
Hindu regime by a more reactionary and undemocratic Muslim one. And we were
gratified to see that many sensible Muslims with foresight and imagination
concurred with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>But many among the Hindus do think differently. The
Kashmiri Pandits cannot get away from the idea that their ancestors once ruled
over Kashmir and they see nothing wrong in identifying themselves fully and
faithfully with the Dogra regime. The Punjab Hindu traders, on the other hand,
cover everything they have been doing under the garb of ‘free and fair trade’.
While strolling through the canal-intersected slums of Srinagar and its dingy
and narrow alleys, we encountered quite a number of Hindus who were perturbed
with regard to the safety of their person and property. One of them, a
gray-haired sober-looking man, told us in confident undertones that, had the
Srinagar aerodrome fallen to the raiders and Indian troops not turned up in
time, the Hindus and Sikhs in Srinagar might have been done to death and their
property looted by their Muslim neighbours. That their fears were mostly
unfounded and their suspicions highly exaggerated was proved by the statements
to the contrary by unattached Muslims. Further, if things could have been as
bad as that, how is it that during the three days when no administration worth
the name existed in Srinagar, not a single case of loot, theft, murder, arson
or even a fracas was reported? It is a pity that Hindus and Sikhs, in spite of
their being in a microscopic minority, never cared to earn and deserve the
confidence, goodwill and co-operation of their Muslim neighbours. They took
shelter under the protective wings of the Dogra regime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The State authorities are no less responsible for
this lamentable state of affairs. Like their imperialist bosses, they also
believed in the theory of ‘Divide and Rule’ and played one community against
the other. It was only when they saw that the National Conference could rally
Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims together against the autocratic regime, that they
clapped its leaders behind prison bars and backed the Muslim Conference in
their vain attempt to take the wind out of the sails of the National
Conference. But this proved to be a costly folly and put their administrative
machinery out of gear in Kashmir. The raiders have appeared on the scene like a
horde of wild bears, when the Maharaja was only playing a game of hide and
seek. This has exposed the rottenness and stupidity of the administration
beyond any shadow of doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The wholesale destruction and vandalism wrought by
the raiders presents a ghastly spectacle. We could not know much about
Muzaffarabad, the first to fall victim to the depredations of the raiders, as
it was still in the hands of the tribesmen; but villages and towns recaptured
by the Indian troops (like Garhi, Chinari, Uri, Baramulla, Biawa, Chak
Charatram and Bargaon etc) are simply heaps of destruction, with houses burnt
down and almost deserted. There is hardly any house that was not ransacked,
hardly any family of which at least one member was not killed or maimed, and
hardly any young woman who has not been molested or ravished. The tale of those
ill-fated girls and women who have been forcibly carried away by the raiders
can only be imagined with shudder. A good number of mosques and other places of
religious worship, we were told, were turned into veritable brothels,
butcher-houses, and store-rooms for the looted property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It was deposed by more than one eye-witness that in
the first stage of the attack by the raiders, they did not loot and kill people
indiscriminately. Their slogan was “Head of the Sikh and wealth of the Hindu,”
and they were actively helped in their nefarious activity by a fifth column of
local Muslims, including some highly placed Police and Revenue officials of the
State and a few tradesmen, some of whom are safe behind prison bars, now
awaiting their trial. Forcible conversions have also been many. At some places
we came across complaints that it was not the raiders but a section of the
local people, belonging mainly to the majority community, who had looted and
converted the inhabitants belonging to the minority community. There were also
instances where the looted property of some was found with members of the
majority community of the same place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>These things obviously created a lot of
difficulties in the way of rehabilitation. The National Conference was keen
that all looted property should be recovered and returned to its original
owners, and some local Muslims found in possession of such property were
successfully persuaded to part with the same. But in many cases the authorities
were reported to be rather reluctant to use force, lest it should give an easy
handle to their protagonists. Every step they took in this direction was
undoubtedly fraught with risk of being misrepresented, the more so because the
question of referendum loomed large before them. However necessary and
advisable this may have been, it has failed to create the requisite amount of
confidence in the hearts of Hindus and Sikhs to go and settle down once again
in their former homes, mostly burnt or demolished. Those who were forcibly
converted or who embraced Islam out of fear for their lives or property, had
not the courage to return to their places for fear of untoward repercussions.
With folded hands and tearful eyes they begged of the authorities to send more
troops and close the three passes on the side of Handwara for their future
safety. The Zamindars belonging to the majority community had also not behaved
themselves. They had grabbed the peasant’s share of the produce (shali, rice)
as well, and the authorities were rather slow to bring them to book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We, however, could not escape the feeling that, if
the authorities were serious about rehabilitation, they must maintain law and
order with a more firm hand, and, without fear or favour, suppress the lawless
elements. This only can inspire some confidence in the hearts of the minority
community. Mere expressions of helplessness, or faltering steps, cannot serve
any purpose. The mischievous part played by a section of local Muslims, and
their complicity with the invaders in some places, has already alarmed the
people of the minority community. The invaders have also tried to create
confusion and misunderstanding among the ranks of the Kashmiris by distributing
a portion of the property looted from Hindus and Sikhs to the Muslims, in order
to convince them that their real job is to liberate the Muslims from the
oppressive hold of the Hindu Bania and the Kashmiri Pandit and ameliorate their
lot. Some have been duped into believing that the Hindus and the Sikhs had
exterminated all the Muslims in Delhi, East Punjab and elsewhere. That this
poisonous propaganda went a long way to confuse issues and create distrust and
bitterness between the two communities is clear from the havoc wrought by the
raiders. The National Conference has happily lost no time to give the lie
direct to this false propaganda and to bring the doubtful elements to book. But
something more needs to be done to inspire greater confidence in the hearts of
Hindus and Sikhs. The present interim administration is perhaps not up to the
mark, and competent enough to cope with the emergency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The rot in the administration is mainly due to the
fact that the Maharaja is reluctant to part with real power. The loyalty of
some of his henchmen to the provisional administration set up by the National
Conference seems halting, if not doubtful. Lack of real strength and the
divided loyalty of quite a big number of the personnel of the present
administration has robbed it of speed, efficiency and influence. It is more of
an administration with a very heavy responsibility, but practically no power.
And it does not go to the credit of the States Ministry of the Central
Government at New Delhi to allow things to drift, in the face of the gravest
danger not only to the territory of Kashmir and Jammu but to the Indian Union
as well. The only consistent positive force in Kashmir today is the National
Conference. Its leader Sheikh Abdullah, <i>Sher-i.Kashmir</i>, as he is lovingly
called, has incredible hold on the masses. Though the fight in Kashmir has not
yet developed into a full-fledged and openly acknowledged armed struggle
between Pakistan and the Indian Union,–and it may never be so,–it is no mere <i>raid
</i>by a few tribesmen. It has been an open secret that about 200,000 to
500,000 men from Pakistan areas, armed with the most modern weapons of warfare,
are in Kashmir and they have not only unstinted support, backing and material
help from Pakistan, but it is actually Pakistan that is running the whole show.
So, an extended Military action is not enough. Sheikh Abdullah, who symbolises
the surging tide of the people’s resistant movement, and who is the only person
capable of rallying the people around him under the banner of the National
Conference, should be backed and the people armed. Nothing short of this can
possibly save Kashmir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

our way to the National Conference Headquarters, we saw kids, between six to
twelve years of age, parading in the Red Square near the Palladium. They were
armed with toy-guns, wooden swords, pick-axes, daggers, iron-rods and ordinary
sticks. They were Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims from the barber, boatman,
carpenter, tradesman and similar classes. We asked them laughingly, “Whom would
you strike with your weapons?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the National Conference, they made their way through the crowded lanes. We
could not fail to notice the seriousness, determination and enthusiasm which
glistened in their eyes, and the innocent smile which gleamed on their face and
reddened their apple-coloured cheeks. Here was a new hope for the future of
Kashmir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Headquarters, which art located in the spacious Exhibition Buildings on the
Baramulla Road, we saw columns of Kashmiris from all walks of life and from all
communities, armed with modern rifles, marching proudly in the Maidan facing
the Secretariat. These were units of the National Home Guard trained by
military officers and ex-service men, in order to form a second line of defence
and to fight the enemy in the rear. They were in all about 850. Here was another
face of the New Kashmir-sturdy, patriotic and enthusiastic people yearning for
a fight to safeguard their home and hearth and their right to live their own
lives. It was something of a People’s Army in making. It was really something
to see the simple and docile people, with no military tradition for the last
four centuries, march proudly with rifles on their shoulders. It appeared to us
as if a New Kashmir was marching ahead through a cloudy way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Park of Srinagar. But no ladies come for a stroll here these days. It has
become a parade ground and shooting practice-centre for the Women’s Brigade,
the female wing of the National Home Guard, known as the Zoni Brigade after the
name of a brave Kashmiri woman. Here was the beauty of Kashmir challenging
death and preparing for a fight with brutal bestiality encroaching upon their
domain. A brave new womanhood is rising in Kashmir to encounter the widespread
and wholesale killing, raping and abduction of the weak, helpless and innocent
daughters of Kashmir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looking to the political education of the National Home Guards in particular
and the masses in general, the Front is responsible for publicity and
propaganda to educate and mobilise public opinion by means of paintings,
photographs, dramas, poems and articles. To mention a few, the writings of
Mahajoor, Asi, Aziz, Arif, Azad, Hashmi, Pardesi, Prankishore, Pushp, Kaiser
Kalander, Sagar, Premnath Dar, Salauddin and Talib have not only moved the
people of Kashmir but have also toned up their moral strength and determination
to fight the raiders. An oil-painting by Kashmir’s famous artist, Sjt. Somnath
Khosa, deserves special mention. In this a Kashmiri maiden has been shown tied
to the trunk of a tree by the raiders. Her torn clothes shining watery eyes,
and the expression of shock writ on her face, faithfully portray the pangs of
Kashmir’s agony at the hands of the raiders. A village in flames provides the
appropriate background to this realistic painting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that a true unity and lasting friendship and understanding between free Hindus,
Sikhs and Muslims will be forged, and the monster of communalism buried deep
for all time to come. From the sufferings and ruins of Kashmir will arise not
only a new and free Kashmir, but a new and really free India as well. Long live
Kashmir!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

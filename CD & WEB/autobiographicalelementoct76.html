and Raja Rao, Professor K. R. Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span>
regards them as “a remarkable triad”, while William Walsh labels them as the “Big
Three.” Of the “Supreme Trio” <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> perhaps is the
most widely-read-and-appreciated novelist.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>In
presenting a realistic picture of the traditional Hindu middle class life, in a
comic mould, <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> is unique. Hailing from a
South-Indian middle-class family, he interprets life in a subjective manner.
And some of the details related in his autobiography, <i>My Days, </i>bear
testimony to this fact. Yet “the personal and the particular” becomes “the
general and the universal” in his art. To achieve this effect <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> locates the action of his novels in an imaginary
Tamil town, <span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>, which is replete with the
classical atmosphere of typical South-Indian community. <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span>
<span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span> is like <span class=SpellE>Hardy’s</span> <span
class=SpellE>Wessex</span> or Faulkner’s <span class=SpellE>Yoknaphatwapha</span>.
His novels can be called <span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>-Novels in as much as
<span class=SpellE>Richmal</span> Compton’s can be categorized as William-<span

humanity; he portrays with sympathy life in all its flaws and frivolities from
a comic point of view, laughs and makes his readers laugh at the silly human
follies, and foibles, for indeed man is a toy in the hands of fate. His view of
life is one of practical wisdom; and he treats human sentiment­alism,
selfishness, manners and meanness with sympathy and compassion. Springing from
the experience of his early life, his early <i>novels–Swami and Friends, <span
class=GramE>The</span> Bachelor of Arts </i>and <i>The English Teacher–</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>are<i> </i></span>truly autobiographical.
Yet, they are subjectively-objective, like the autobiographical novels of Mulk
Raj Anand <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<i>Seven Summers, Morning
Face, </i></span>and <i>Confession of a Lover</i>). ‘Childhood’ is the theme of
<i>Swami and Friends; </i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>‘</span>youth’
is the theme of <i>The Bachelor of Arts; </i>and ‘manhood’ is that of <i>The
English Teacher. </i>Though Swami and <span class=SpellE>Chandran</span> and
Krishnan are the chief characters, Child and Youth and Householder are respectively
the real heroes of the three novels. They are an objective portrayal of the
first three phases of life which is <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> own. As
Professor Srinivasa <span class=SpellE>Iyengar</span> says, the characters
appear to have taken a sort of transmigration from body to body, from novel to
novel. </p>

activities of <span class=SpellE>Swaminathan</span> and his friends in <span
class=SpellE>Malgudi</span> appear to be a dramatization of the activities of <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> and his friends during his early life in Madras
described in his <i>My Days. </i>Swami is a little boy of an orthodox
middle-class family who has already changed two schools. He is shown not only
through the dimension of child psychology but in his full range of being even
at the beginning of the novel:</p>

or less the uncle of the class, <span class=SpellE>Mani</span> the mighty
good-for-nothing, <span class=SpellE>Sankar</span> the most brilliant boy of
the class and Samuel the Pea on account of his size. To others his attitude is
one of haughty indifference. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> gives a comic
account of the friends and their preparation for examination, their <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span> in the classroom and at home and at a mass
meeting, their concern with the driving away of the British, and their cricket.
It is like a novel treatise about all schoolboys in India. Portraying <span
class=SpellE>dextrously</span> the friendship of Swamis <span class=SpellE>Somu</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Mani</span>, Rajan, <span class=SpellE>Sankar</span> and
Samuel, <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> gives an inkling of the
family-background of each one of the boys reflected in his conduct, words and
deeds. Rajan, a Police Superintendent’s son, has dashing nature. He can be
considered a representative of upper middle class family where old people <span
class=SpellE>overpamper</span> children. <span class=SpellE>Mani</span> belongs
to an unsophisticated family: his mind always works on evil plans and he tries
to achieve his goal by either force or bribing. Though the novel deals with
their quarrels and friendship, Swami is made the central character with a comic
touch. <span class=GramE>Any child–a Swami, a <span class=SpellE>Mani</span>, a
Rajan, or a Samuel–experiences that early part of its life with innocent
enthusiasm ignorant of the after-effects of its childish deeds.</span> Thus the
novel is about everybody’s childhood. Graham Greene says: ‘It is a classical
schoolboy story of a child, written with the same understanding sense of beauty
and sadness.’ The novel thus deals with the inevitable sad music of growth from
dreary childhood into a contemplative adolescence. </p>

1'>        </span>From the schoolboy Swami to the college-youth <span
class=SpellE>Chandran</span> in <i>The Bachelor of Arts </i>is a natural
transition. In this novel <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> appears reminiscing
his own youth and adolescence experience. The novel deals with the critical phase
of life, adolescence, which every­body has to pass through in his last year at
the college and in his first year in the world. <span class=SpellE>Chandran</span>
is a student of history like <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> himself. In his
essay “Green Sari,” <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> relates how he fell in
love with a girl and how he was disappointed when the horoscopes failed to
match. In his <i>My Days, </i><span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> describes again
that, after graduation in 1934, ‘he passed through a phase of impossible
love-sickness, falling in love at first sight with all and sundry, all
one-sided,’ that specially in <span class=SpellE>Coimbatore</span> he espied ‘a
girl drawing water from the street-tap near his sister’s house,’ and that ‘after
a number of hitches, particularly astrological’ the marriage took place. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> dramatizes this experience. Like Swami, <span
class=SpellE>Chandran</span> also hails from an orthodox middle-class family.
We find some of Rajan’s character in <span class=SpellE>Chandran</span> in the
beginning. But <span class=SpellE>Chandran’s</span> <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>
during his disillusionment is like Swami’s. The first part of the novel deals
with <span class=SpellE>Chandran’s</span> ambition, snobbery and vanity. He
lacks in gamesmanship which is necessary for success in life. The second part
presents the turning point in <span class=SpellE>Chandran’s</span> life. He
faces the problem of finding a job and a better-half for himself. <span
class=SpellE>Chandran</span> falls in love with <span class=SpellE>Malathi</span>
whom he has seen from a distance and wishes to marry her. But his orthodox
parents disapprove of it as their horoscopes fail to match. Even today so many
marriages do not take place because: of the orthodox belief of the elders in
the agreement of horoscopes. The third part describes the love-sick odyssey of
the hero, <span class=SpellE>Chandran’s</span> ascetic wanderings over South
India in search of solace. Disillusioned he returns to his parents in <span
class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>. In the fourth part he marries Susila, the girl
chosen by his parents, and finally finds a job for himself. Even Swami’s
friends seem to have undergone transmigration as <span class=SpellE>Veeraswami</span>
and Mohan. <span class=SpellE>Mani’s</span> aggressive nature is seen in <span
class=SpellE>Veeraswami</span>, and Mohan is an apostle of pragmatism and
callous realism. <i>The Bachelor of Arts </i>depicts in general terms how youth
continue their lives taking their strides and shocks and tremors of the past,
and how the care-free graduates through rough experiences change and fit
themselves in stable professions in life, like <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
himself.</p>

earlier novels but perhaps it is <span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> greatest
novel marking the turning point in his art. The novel portrays the third stage
of life-the householder. Krishnan the English Teacher is a continu­ation of <span
class=SpellE>Chandran</span>, the Bachelor of Arts. In his <i>My Days, </i><span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> reveals that his wife <span class=SpellE>Rajam</span>
had gone on a holiday to her parents’ home in <span class=SpellE>Coimbatore</span>.
He was full of misgivings during her absence. But some weeks after her return,
she died of typhoid. He felt he had lost his anchorage and dismal emptiness
stretched before him. One day he was introduced by his cousin to his friend <span
class=SpellE>Raghunatha</span> Rao, who invited him to ‘some psychic
experiments’. ‘At one of the sittings, <span class=SpellE>Rajam</span>
communicated to him through Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rao’s</span> automatic
writing.’ She assured him that she was always at his side. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>
<span class=SpellE>practised</span> psychic contacts and learnt to have total
view of one personality. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> himself admits that <i>The
English Teacher </i>is an adaptation of his own experience: </p>

class=SpellE>Rajam’s</span>) sickness and death in <i>The English Teacher </i>so
fully that I do not perhaps go over it again. More than any other book, <i>The
English Teacher </i>is autobiographical in content, very little part of it
being fiction. The English Teacher of the novel, Krishnan, is a fictional
character in the fictional city <span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>, but he goes
through the same experience I had gone through and he calls his wife Susila and
the child <span class=SpellE>Leela</span> instead of <span class=SpellE>Hema</span>.
The toll that typhoid took and all the desolation that followed, with a child
to look after and the psychic adjustments, are based on my own experiences.
This book falls in two parts­–one is domestic life and the other is spiritual.
Many readers have gone through the first half with interest and the second half
with bewilderment...</p>

is because in the first half <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> has painted a
picture of the typical contemplative manhood of a householder of middle­class
society, experiencing the first shocks of life. The second part gives a picture
of a distressed young widower who becomes ‘both father and mother’ to his
innocent three-year-old daughter and brings her up. </p>

<span class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> three early novels portray the atmosphere

is a world of children, boys, householders, wives, husbands, mothers, grand-mothers,
students, teachers, parents, sons and daughters–all true to life. They are all

relationships are saturated, which <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span> paints
vividly and humorously. </p>

Rao also deals with childhood and youth and manhood, but in a diffused and
disjointed way which is natural and necessary to the narrative technique and <span
class=SpellE>religio</span>-comic tone of his novels. But they do not form the
main themes of his novels. It is Mulk Raj Anand who first had dealt with
childhood and youth and manhood enchantingly in a subjectively-objective
manner. His range is vast, and he dramatizes the three stages of life at all
levels in general in a <span class=SpellE>tragi</span>-comic manner. <span
class=SpellE>Narayan</span> has chosen only one slice of humanity, the
middle-class society, confined to a single town <span class=SpellE>Malgudi</span>:
his range is narrow thus and of ‘resolved limitations, just a few inches wide’,
like Jane Austin’s. <span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> picture of the three
phases of life is typically North-Indian in <span class=SpellE>colour</span>: <span
class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> portrayal is supremely South-Indian in nature.
While <span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> range is epically vast, <span
class=SpellE>Narayan’s</span> (though limited) is supremely intensive and
profound, <span class=SpellE>serio</span>-comic and sympathetic, perfect and grand.</p>

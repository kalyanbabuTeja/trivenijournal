Prof. M. VENKATARANGAIYA, M.A.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
is now aware that the serious flaw in the philosophy of Marxism lay in
interpreting all historical movements and phenomena in terms of economics, and
of economics only, and ignoring the significance of politics and religion.
Man’s history on earth has been observed to consist of a series of struggles.
It was interpreted in ancient times as a struggle between the <i>Devas </i>and <i>Asuras,
</i>the forces of light and of darkness, between truth and falsehood, between
wisdom and folly, and between knowledge and ignorance. The Marxists borrowed
this idea of perpetual struggle from the preceding philosophies but gave to it
a new twist, referring to it as a struggle between those who had property and those
who had no property, between the capitalist and the worker etc. Their idea that
the struggle would come to an end and that the millennium would be achieved
when economic classes cease to exist and a classless society emerges, was also
borrowed from the idea of the golden age–the <i>Krita Yuga </i>of the Indian
tradition–again with a twist due to their over-emphasis on the materialistic
aspects of man’s life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
there is any single principle in terms of which all struggles may be
interpreted, it is the principle of power. Power is the capacity which one
individual possesses over another to compel the latter to behave in the way in
which he wants him to behave. There is always a struggle for power in this
sense, a struggle for the acquisition and retention of power. This love of
power is much more universal than even the love of wealth. People want wealth
because it is a means for acquiring power. Men in power know that they can get
any thing they want through its exercise. When once people come into power and taste
its fruits, they are most unwilling to part with it. It is much easier to
persuade men of wealth to part with it than to persuade men in power to
transfer it into the hands of others. The Marxists speak of the evils of the
concentration of wealth, but the evils arising out of the concentration of
power–which is the dominant characteristic of all one-party totalitarian
States–are far more serious and more demoralising. If there is a case for
diffusion of wealth there is stronger case for the diffusion of power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Claims for power have been based on all sorts of
factors and not merely on possession of wealth and property. Sex has been one
such factor. There were matriarchal and patriarchal societies. The colour of
the skin has been another such factor. Race has been a third factor. Superior
intellect which enables men to probe into the mysteries of nature has been
another such factor. The power exercised by the priests as well as that
exercised by scientists belong to this category. The real struggle on earth is
thus the struggle between those who have power and those who have not. When
power based on one set of factors is destroyed, it is a mistake to think that
power itself is destroyed. It only assumes another form. This is the experience
of history. It is in this sense that revolutions are never finished. One kind
of revolution gives place to another.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The world today illustrates this process of struggle
between the coloured races and the whites who have been in power for the last
three centuries, the struggle between Asia and Africa on one side and Europe on
the other. There is the struggle between one Western nation and another to
monopolise power over the world. This is the case with the struggle that has
been going on between Soviet Russia and the United States for the last five
years,–the ‘cold war’ as it is usually termed, but a cold war which, with the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea, has become a really hot war. There is the
struggle for power between political parties,–a struggle assuming a violent
form in countries where the Communist Party is anxious to capture power, and a
less violent form in countries where the struggle is between parties having
faith in democracy. There is also the struggle for power in Countries like
Soviet Russia, China, and the countries of Eastern Europe in which Communism
has been established. It is the struggle between the victorious Communist Party
on one side and the so-called counter-revolutionary parties and groups on the
other, or it is a struggle inside the Communist Party itself between rival
individuals or groups leading to all sorts of purges and even mass executions
occasionally. No one should be under the delusion that, with the establishment
of Communism, the instinctive struggle for power comes to an end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the centres where this struggle for power is being carried on, Korea has been
regarded as the most important. For there the two great giants of the world
today are facing each other. On one side are South Korea, the United States,
and the countries allied with the United States; on the other side are North
Korea, China, and Soviet Russia. If it had been merely a war between North and
South Korea, it would have come to an end within a few weeks of the outbreak of
hostilities in June 1950. It is the open participation of the United States
forces on the side of South Korea, and the open participation of Chinese forces
on the side of North Korea and the concealed support given by Soviet Russia to
them, that have kept the war going on till today. The so-called armistice
negotiations which began in July 1951 are still going on; but at the same time
the military operations, the massed air-attacks, are also going on side by
side. There is no cease-fire as yet. No one knows when there will be a real
armistice. One latest forecast–and that by a Canadian General–is that the world
may have to wait for six months more for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tragedy of the situation consists in the fact that the issue which divides the
two parties, and which is responsible for the delay in the conclusion of the
armistice, is relatively of an insignificant character, relatively though not
absolutely. It relates to the repatriation of the prisoners of war. Among the
North Koreans and the Chinese that were captured by the United Nations forces
are several thousands who refuse to go back to their homes in North Korea or
China. They are afraid of being put to death by the Communist governments. They
do not have faith in Communism. It is true that they served in the Communist
armies and fought against South Korea and the United Nations. They confess that
they did so as conscripts under compulsion. They have now repudiated their
faith in Communism and they do not want to get </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>back with the
certainty that they would be tortured to death. </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The U.N.
delegates on the Armistice Commission have been naturally asking themselves
whether it would be humane for them to bring about the forcible repatriation of
these prisoners who are unwilling to be repatriated. They recently suggested
three alter</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>natives regarding the way in which these
prisoners are to be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>treated. But the Chinese and the North
Korean representatives have not agreed to any of them. They have not also
suggested any other alternative.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
the sake of these fifteen or twenty thousand prisoners the United States is
prepared to continue the war, with all the horrors and destruction associated
with it. Thousands of civilians–men, women and children–are losing their lives.
Villages and factory-towns are being destroyed; and the whole country is
becoming one vast desert. If the Chinese and the North Koreans are really
sincere in their negotiations for an armistice, and if the United States is
convinced of this sincerity, is it not wisdom to sacrifice the lives of a few
thousand prisoners of war for saving the lives of millions of Koreans and
restoring peace and prosperity to the country? It is to be hoped that the
United Nations General Assembly which is shortly meeting at Lake Success will
take up this question and settle it speedily. Otherwise the Korean war will
take a more serious turn. It is bound to spread into China proper. To defeat
China is not an easy task. Japan found it difficult in the past,–when the
central government was weak and when there were several internal dissensions.
The United States will find it much more difficult today. China is now united
under a strong central government. It has now the help of Soviet Russia. The
bonds of friendship between the two countries have become strengthened as a
result of a new treaty concluded between them in this September.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is true that this treaty has not been as
favourable to China as it was expected to be, that it perpetuates Soviet
control over Port Arthur and Darien, and that what China has gained is a sort
of control over the Manchurian railway. The treaty has also been an occasion
for Soviet Russia getting a firmer hold over Outer Mongolia and Sinkiang. But
such a result is inevitable so long as China is suspicious of the United
States. It is this suspicion that drives her more and more into the arms of
Soviet Russia and enables the latter to maintain her hold over the former. But
it doesn’t look as if the United States is doing anything to remove or lessen
this Suspicion. Responsible statesmen in the United States are now speaking not
merely of a policy of ‘containment’ of Communism but also of bringing about
internal disruption and disintegration in the territories subject to Communist
governments,–in countries like China and even Soviet Russia. The President<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>ial elections will be over in November and
there is bound to be a larger amount of definiteness in the U.S. policy towards
Korea and the Communistic Powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is from this point of view that one has to observe the developments in Japan.
The General Elections held there recently </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>brought back the Liberals
in great numbers into Parliament. Not even a single Communist got in. (There
were twenty-two Communist members in the previous Parliament). The cabinet is
bound to be a cabinet of Liberals, and it was they that were responsible for
the Peace Treaty and the hold which the treaty gave to the Americans over
Japan. This means that, opposed to a Sino-Soviet combination, there would be an
America-Japanese alliance. The policy of rearming Japan would receive a
practical shape and the tension in the Far East would continue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
the struggle between Communist Soviet Russia and the anti-Communist United
States is shaping the fortunes of most of the world is shown by the
developments in Indo-China. The Viet-Namese under Ho Chi Min have been fighting
a war of national liberation against the French for the last six years. There
was a time–in 1946, 1947–when the matter could have been amicably settled, as
it was done in India by the British and by the Dutch later on in Indonesia. But
the French were not disposed to do so. They were determined on continuing their
imperial hold over the country. To conceal their real intentions they set up a
puppet government under Bao Dai. The ultimate outcome of all this was to drive
Ho Chi Min into the Communist camp, so that the struggle became an aspect of
the wider struggle between Communism and anti-Communism. After the Korean war
broke out the Americans extended their aid–military in the main and economic to
some extent–to the government of Bao Dai. The French also changed their policy
to a slight extent by raising a national army of Viet-Namese officered by local
leaders; and by introducing a larger number Viet-Namese into the civil
services. They also made several promises to confer increased powers on the
government of Bao Dai. The result is that today there seems to be a small
amount of improvement in their military position. Ho Chi Min has not been able
to drive out the French. But whether the French would be able to maintain their
hold is problematic. The drain on their military and economic resources caused
by the Indo-China campaign is telling increasingly upon them. Even some of the
parties on the Right in the French National Assembly have begun to feel that it
would be best for their country to withdraw from Indo-China. Everything
therefore depends now on the attitude of the United States. She claims to
believe in the principle of national self-determination. She says she has faith
in political freedom. The time therefore has come for her to bring pressure on
France to withdraw from Indo-China and strengthen the government of Bao Dai. If
this is done all the nationalist forces can be rallied together and a strong
government, able withstand the Communistic groups led by Ho Chi Min, may be
formed. In Indo-China the immediate issue is not Communism <i>Versus </i>Democracy.
It is Nationalism <i>Versus </i>French Imperialism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
in Indo-China so also in Malaya, Communist terrorism has been put down in
recent months to some extent. But the real problem there also is the transfer
of power to the people of the country. The difficulty in this transfer lies in
the people not being homogeneous and in their being divided into three
groups,–Malayans, Chinese, and Indians. In recent months attempts have been
successfully made to bring these groups together. There is a suspicion that
most of the Chinese are either Communists or are in sympathy with Communism and
that they serve as the agents of the Communist government of China. Recently
some of the leading Chinese of Malaya have been active in co-operating with the
British authorities in suppressing the terrorists and also in leading a
movement for the integration of the three racial groups. If this activity makes
substantial progress, the time will come for the withdrawal of the British from
Malaya and the establishment of a strong national government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Next to Korea it is the Middle East that is in the
most disturbed condition today. Here there are two sets of problems to be
faced. One is external and the other is internal. Externally several of the
countries here feel that they are still subject to the economic, military or
political control of the West, especially the British. Internally the problem
is partly political and partly economic, though it is difficult to completely
separate the two aspects. Politically these countries are governed by
oligarchies for all practical purposes, although in several of them the forms
of <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>democracy are seen. Apart from this
there is a large amount of corruption and administrative inefficiency.
Economically the </span>masses of people are poor. Their standard of life is
low. Landownership is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people.
There are very few industries. The burden of taxation is heavy. Movements
therefore found in these countries have their origin in the desire of the
people to get rid of the external control of the British, to create honest and
efficient administrations and improve the economic resources and raise the
standard of living of the common man. These movements are common to all the
countries of the Middle East.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
other cause of tension in this area is the establishment three years ago of the
State of Israel by the Jews in part of Palestine. This is resented by all the
other States–which are Muslim. They have not yet recognised the State of
Israel. And there are influential sections in them who are determined to wipe
out this State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is against this background that recent developments especially in Iran and
Egypt have to be examined. In Iran the issue centres round the nationalisation
of the oil industry. This means deriving the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of its
rights of ownership which it has been enjoying for nearly fifty years. On the
question of compensation, on the working of the oil refineries, on the supply
of British technical personnel, on the marketing of the nationalised oil, and
on provision for tankers for carrying the oil disputes have arisen. All
negotiations have so far failed. The Prime Minister of Iran–Dr. Mossadiq–even
threatened recently to break off all diplomatic relations with Britain on this
issue. The situation now is that he is willing to reopen negotiations on the
subject of compensation and on other questions, provided his government is paid
forty-nine million pounds immediately by the British. He does not seem to be so
obstinate now as he was in recent months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The British no longer object to nationalisation.
What they want is adequate compensation. The Americans have their own rivalries
with the British on the exploitation of oil in the Middle East, but they are at
one with the British in the view that there should be no nationalisation
without compensation. It is natural for them to take such a view, because they
have their own oil companies in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere and they are afraid
that, if the principle of compensation is given up in Iran, it will have to be
given up in the other countries also. They are not prepared to face huge losses
resulting therefrom. It remains to be seen whether the British would agree to
pay the amount demanded by Mossadiq and begin negotiations. The best thing is
for them to do so, as otherwise they will have to face a worse situation. The
royalties on which the solvency of the government of Iran depends have not been
forthcoming. The government is unable to balance its budget. If this continues
the unrest in the country will grow. There will be an internal revolution and a
Communist government led by the Tudeh party may come into office. Iran may
become another Korea and this will upset the power equilibrium in the whole of the
Middle East and even in South Asia. The British have made enormous profits in
the past and they should not grudge paying a small percentage of those profits
to restore normalcy in the Middle East.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
restoration of normalcy is needed not only in Iran but also in Egypt. Egypt has
passed through a miltary coup. King Farouk was forced to abdicate by Genral
Naguib; and it is a military government that is now ruling over that country.
The basis of General Naguib’s authority is the army of which he is the commander.
His is an example of the army intervening in the affairs of the government and
taking possession of it. Similar military coups have taken place in Syria and
Lebanon–two other States in the Middle East. Naturally these bring to the
forefront one great political problem, the problem of the kind of government
most appropriate to the countries of this area. It is generally taken for
granted that democracy is the only right form of government for any State, and
democracy ordinarily means that those who are in power in a State should be
elected by the people in a fair and free election. General Naguib does not owe
his power to any democratic election. His power is not democratic in character.
Is it therefore to be condemned as illegitimate?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

advocates of democracy–thinkers like Mill–have stated that there are situations
and countries in which democracy does not Work and that it is therefore not
desirable to introduce that form of government in such situations and such
countries. Perhaps the countries of the Middle East are among them. With a
population economically backward and therefore not caring very much for
political rights, and a population illiterate and incapable of discriminating
between what is politically desirable and undesirable, it may not be possible
to work democracy. Whatever it be the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

from the right and wrong of the coup itself, General Naguib has succeeded
within a short space of time in putting an end to corruption and inaugurating a
series of land reforms. He found that the political parties in the
country–including the Wafd Party–were also notorious for their corruption. He
enacted a new Law on the subject of political parties with a view to purge them
of all the corrupt and undesirable elements in them. All this smells
totalitarianism but serious situations need seriously drastic remedies. There
is a certain amount of drive and quickness of pace in the work of General
Naguib and it is these that attract the admiration of many people, even though
they may say that his methods are undemocratic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are two issues relating to the British which he has still to solve. One refers
to the British evacuation of the Canal Zone and the other to their recognising
the ruler of Egypt as the ruler of Sudan also. General Naguib has no idea of
entering into any compromise on these issues. He is however for peacefully
settling them and the British should take advantage of his willingness to enter
into negotiations and settle the issues once for all.</span><span

the facilities of transport between the Mediterranean on one side the Far East

years they have been trying<i> </i>to organise a separate Middle East Defence.
They cannot however do this unless they have the co-operation of the
governments and the peoples of the area. They must have strong bases for
stationing their forces. Iraq, the Canal Zone and Sudan are among such bases at
the present day. British evacuation of the Canal Zone and of Sudan is possible
only when a joint Middle East Defence Organisation, in which Egypt and other
countries of the Middle East participate, is set up and all the necessary
military bases are secured. This is a complicated problem. The nationalism of
Iran and, Egypt has to be fully recognised by Britain and the United States,
whatever be the cost of such recognition. At the same </span><span

complicated because of its connection with the cold war. The Middle East is one
of the most important areas in which the Soviet and the United States are
carrying on their struggle for power. It is this that gives added significance
to the struggle which the nationalists of Tunisia are carrying on against
France. The problem of Tunisia is more or less of the same character as that of
Indo-China.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

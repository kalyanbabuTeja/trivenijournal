first part starting with a personal note of the poet promising the reader that
he will<i> </i>dig<i> </i>and pile up before him the “stories”<sup>2</sup> of
ancient fore-fathers despite the denigrating antics of intellectual novices

walloping and receding”, “swinging great trees </span><span style='font-size:

eyes into the forest as well as the sea” “the strolls of the young breezes on
the beach in the evenings”, “the ‘rafting’ of the sea-snakes in the swirls of
the mid-seas” and “the golden fields of corn and flowers on the coastal land.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second part again starts with the poet exclaiming that the antiquity of the
happenings of the “stories” was such that it could not be gauged and simply
saying that the country was wild with shrubs and forests, hills and dales.
There was a village on the sea-coast with a king who was Telugu, the Telugus
having been kings as early as that. He shone like the rising full-moon with his
necklaces of pearls from (native) bamboos and home-spun clothes; he was a great
king, the country had not taken to shallow civilisation; no one ever did any
coarse thing; tillers ploughed just enough and no more land for their
sustenance; the remaining forest lands competing with the hills and clouds,
gave in-season rains; every one had enough and none had a quarrel on any score.
The king had two daughters with lips of crimson of the blooming <span
class=SpellE><i>Kimsuka</i></span><i> (<span class=SpellE>Butea</span> <span
class=SpellE>Frondosa</span>) </i>and their names were <span class=SpellE>Chilakamma</span>
<span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span>. <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> was,
of course, black and <span class=SpellE>Chilakamma</span> green and they were
always cross with each other. <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> started
prattling prettily very young to the <span class=SpellE>ecstacy</span> of the
father. Years rolled by and her eyes became wider, the pity, <span
class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> could not speak. The father would get <span
class=SpellE>colourful</span> <span class=SpellE>sarees</span> for <span
class=SpellE>Chilakamma</span> but would be grumpy with <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span>.
When <span class=SpellE>Chilakamma</span> laughed at her <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span>,
<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>empaling</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span>
looked at the mother. When <span class=SpellE>Chilakamma</span> made faces at
her, agitated, she hid behind the mother. Helpless, if the mother too was
impatient, she <span class=SpellE>smouldered</span> within herself. For days
she would weep with the <span class=SpellE>wallopy</span> waves looking emptily
into the foam, sit under some tree sinking inwardly. She could not unburden
herself even to a tree or ant-hill for, God–no one knew what kind of person he
was–had not given her speech. She would sit on the sand-beds of hill-streams
building sand-nests for sparrows all day; saunter along the hill-streams
looking at the wild flowers, not returning home till late in the night. At
times when she stayed in the woods all night, the mother got upset. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The third part describes
the corning of age of the two girls. Rainy nights came and went by; wintry days
came and passed by; <span class=GramE>Autumn</span> falls stopped. Spring carne
with sprouting Red leaves. <span class=GramE>Foliage and efflorescence all
over.</span> Like the mid-vein in a leaf, like honey in the nectar of a flower <span
class=SpellE>Chilaka</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> came of age,
respectively. Even the young breezes were smitten and agitated by the learning
and grace of <span class=SpellE>Chilaka</span>. Her beauty spilled, as it were,
all over and even those who have not seen her talked of it. The Queen-tree sang
of it in the skies, excited. Young breezes spilled it all over during their
twilight strolls. Every one wanted to marry her. But the parents protected the
young under their eyes; would not allow her to cross the threshold lest the
kings of the sea and forest should annex her. They <span class=GramE>took</span>
care, like an eyelid of the pupil, that she never went out nor did any domestic
chores. <span class=SpellE>Chilaka’s</span> graces spread into streamlets, into
beautiful young sprouting leaves, shedding sweetness of honey drops. Pre-occupied
by <span class=SpellE>Chilaka’s</span> beauty and the affairs of her marriage,
the parents would not think of <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> at all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The fourth part describes the arrival of a Brahmin,
a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>vedic</span></span> scholar, and <span
class=SpellE>Chilaka’s</span> falling in love with him. On one mid-noon, a
Brahmin with the dazzle of his ear-rings on his cheeks came there. The parents
received the guest, gave him presents and treated him. Reciting Veda and
provocatively ready for an argument, he stayed as the guest of the Telugu King.
Hearing the cadences of his <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>vedic</span></span>
recitation and seeing the brightness of his face, <span class=SpellE>Chilaka</span>
kept in her thoughts. Having come to know of all this, the Telugu King might
have felt excited but the mother could not like <span class=SpellE>Chilaka</span>
for that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fifth part describes the change of attitude of the mother and her search for <span
class=SpellE>Kokila</span> who had skulked away into the wilderness. The mother
thought: <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> had been wandering in the hills and
dales; how the dear thing must be crying herself out, for she would not come
home; <span class=SpellE>Chilaka</span> has bestowed her love on a visiting
stranger of a distant land; <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> wandering, even
without coming home, in the forests had estranged herself from my
mother’s-heart. Thinking thus she, with faltering steps, went in search of her,
along the hills, dales, and streams of the wilderness. She searched for the
daughter in the shady noon-dens of the growling tigers, peeped into </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
sneaky paths of the thirsty tigers and leopards into the streams, traced the
valleys filled with the footprints of wandering wild </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>beasts,
saw the wandering spots of the wild dogs that would kill even tigers, explored
even the dense forest-areas where pythons would doze off after swallowing deer.
Search wherever she might <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> was not found and
the mother’s heart broke. She </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sat grief-stricken under a <span
class=SpellE>Mushini</span> tree <i>(<span class=SpellE>Strychnos</span> <span
class=SpellE>nux</span> <span class=SpellE>vomica</span>) </i>sprawling into a
stream. All the while, <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> has been following the
mother. She saw her grief and cried aloud. She thundered, like a thunder,
dazzled like lightning and in a jump was in her mother’s lap. Mother and
daughter, locked in mutual embrace with closed eyes and insensible, sank at the
foot of a tree-trunk. And that was the last. Neither of them ever got up and
opened their eyes. The filial affections touched everything and in
appreciation, the stream crooned it, the creepers swayed, breezes fluted it in
bamboos, and Nature itself sang about it. Without the rattling and ubiquitous
presence of <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> the woods looked desolate; spring
waters <span class=SpellE>unbathed</span> and <span class=SpellE>ungurgled</span>
by her, trees with their tender leaves and flowers <span class=SpellE>unplucked</span>,
had no beauty; the dales <span class=SpellE>unwalked</span> by her deficient in
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:2.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>their
spring bloom. <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> with such abundance of filial
affection is immortal, the mango tender foliage sang; the spring crooned; </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>she
will come back alive, the woods sang; love is immortal, the moonlight sang
softly. After rains and fall, the forest bloomed again like a newly-married
girl with <span class=SpellE><i>kumkum</i></span><i> </i>on her forehead. The
stream with its waters sweet as cocoanut milk was beautiful like a brownish
cobra. A thin sweet song broke out somewhere at the outskirts of the forest.
The forest was startled as if the missing relation has returned. The spring
rambled along impatiently with gurgling noise, and overflowed with joy at the
cooing and return of <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span>. The mango bud reddened
into sprouting leaves. Within no time the woods became beautiful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sixth part describes the reception given to the Spring-God <span class=SpellE>Vasanta</span>
and the marriage of <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> with him. Shortly
afterwards the King of flowers, of exotic beauties came on his yearly round
with smiles all over his cheeks. The forest sang: “O, King, you have come; we
present you with the same flowers you have brought; we will prepare <span
class=SpellE>Kokila</span> as your young bride and you as the bride-groom and
join you together. By grace and song, your handsomeness and <span class=SpellE>Kokila’s</span>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>each
other.” The spring leaves became festoons for their marriage. Tigers kept vigil
on boulders. The thin white spring waters sang like <span class=SpellE><i>Shahanai</i></span><i>.
</i>Nature with its moonlight of flowers opened her eyes. Honey flowed from flowers.
Sweet songs broke out. Paths of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

puts him into a serious, if not an exalted, frame of mind and makes him
anticipate or search for some intellectual element, whereas the poem itself
deals with the simple pathetic story of a mute girl ridiculed by her own sister
and neglected by the parents. He may find that even this story is short and the
poem unduly long; may even be tempted to say that parts of the poem like the
first and sixth are perfunctory and that the later portions of the parts three
and five are just the verbal extravagance of a Romantic poet. And finally he
may find himself in a bewildering situation for, much as he is aware of the
fact that the poem is addressed not to children as befitting the story but to
adults like himself, he has to find the meaning, rather understand the theme,
of which he is only vaguely aware from the final key statement that <span
class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> stored up Telugu idiom. The problems pertain
respectively to the mood of the poet and the poem, to its structural coherence,
and the theme underlying it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we find the answers to these problems it may be noted that the poem is a lyric.
It has no formal treatment either in our <span class=SpellE><i>alamkaara</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>saastra</span> </i>or in Aristotelian poetics. At best we
may loosely describe it as an <span class=SpellE><i>Anibaddha</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Kaavya</span> </i>but cannot strictly <span class=SpellE>categorise</span>
it under that head. Now, in as much as a lyric is highly imaginative, as we all
know, we may note the psychological nature of its mood and composition, and try
to find some <span class=SpellE>symbolistic</span> interpretation just as it is
done in the case of dreams by a psychologist or in the case of <span
class=SpellE>colours</span> by an occult <span class=SpellE>colourologist</span>
as also the esoteric significance of the characters mentioned. We may take them
in so far as they can illuminate our understanding of the poem without
introducing any arbitrariness on our part and without affecting the objective
collocation of the terms and the theme. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

story and find, at the end almost startled by the statement that Sanskrit words
come to stay in the line of <span class=SpellE>Chilakamma</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> stored up the Telugu idiom. This time we are
virtually ordered back to re-read the poem. The personal note of the poet
conjointly with the final statement regarding Telugu idiom makes us suspect the
poem as a personal statement also. Thus we may have to read the poem not merely
on the story level but as a personal statement of the poet as well as saga of
Telugu idiom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
we try to<i> </i>explore these three levels one point has to be noticed. A poem
is as much <span class=SpellE>incritical</span> as it is <span class=SpellE>insouled</span>.
It is said that a lyric is generally ordered by a problem; it starts with the
beginning of the problem and ends immediately after finding a permanent
solution for it. If so, what is the problem in this lyric? The problem is
competition with handicaps. A permanent solution is found only at the end of
the poem and not before. It is not difficult to see that <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span>
connected with the storing up of Telugu idiom represents Telugu and the
narration–<span class=GramE>poet<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>identifies</span> himself with <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span>. On
the story level <span class=SpellE>Kokilamma’s</span> problem is the
competition she had to face with her sister with the twin handicaps as it were,
her blackness and dumbness. When she came of age, it became a sexual problem.
Though mute, she had many ideas and plans for future as <span class=SpellE>symbolised</span>
by her action of building sand-nests for sparrows. Ridiculed and neglected, she
suffered the agony but with the engagement of her sister to the <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>vedic</span></span> scholar, it culminated in
her leaving the home. It could not be solved in any other way except through
death. The emotional reunion of mother and daughter did bring it. And <span
class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> was born as a bird of song and married to the
king <o:p></o:p></span></p>

God of Spring.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> The problem is solved permanently and on
a much better footing. The mood of the poem is atavistic; the atmosphere
totemic; the execution shamanistic. Now we may ask ‘how is the first part of
the poem connected with the problem?’ It is. The first and second parts
constitute one unit; it is like a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>dicot</span></span><span
class=GramE> ;</span> they represent the ‘situation’. Description of the coastal
country is the inverse of it; the second part is the obverse of it. The
personal notes regarding the period at the beginning of both the parts give the
clue. The third and fourth parts dwelling on the beauty and engagement of her
rival constitute ‘the problem’. Her own <span class=SpellE>colour</span> and
dumbness, the natural handicaps aggravated by the ridicule of her sister and
indifference of her father with the mother’s passive helplessness and
occasional impatience turned it into an insoluble personal problem. The
parents’ constant preoccupation with plans for <span class=SpellE>Chilaka’s</span>
marriage and <span class=SpellE>Chilaka’s</span> finding of her man was perhaps
the last straw. The fifth and sixth parts, the ‘resolution’ <span class=SpellE>dicot</span>,
find the permanent solution through the death and rebirth of <span
class=SpellE>Kokilamma</span> and her marriage to <span class=SpellE>Vasanta</span>.
The essential nature of competition here is in essence parallelism. This is
perfectly maintained in the problem <span class=SpellE>dicot</span> and the
solution <span class=SpellE>dicot</span>, the former describing the beauty and
engagement of <span class=SpellE>Chilaka</span> to the<b> </b>scholar and the
latter describing the beauty and marriage of <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span>
with <span class=SpellE>Vasanta</span>. Whereas Nature is made to sing <span
class=SpellE>Chilaka’s</span> beauty only–she is made to sing the beauty and
celebrate the marriage of <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span>. The mother’s
earlier predisposition weighted the forces heavily against her. Her change of
attitude restored the essential balance of forces into parallelism putting the
father with <span class=SpellE>Chilaka</span> and the mother with <span
class=SpellE>Kokila</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

inherent difficulty and complexity of the poem referred to in the beginning is
felt, when we try to read the poem on the other two levels if only because the
poet is trying to express an emotional abstraction in terms of concrete
intellection. At the level of language the competition is between Telugu and
Sanskrit. The former suffered ridicule and neglect not merely at the hands of
the rulers but even by the country-just as <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> was
denied of her mother’s affection and support. This was the case until the
eleventh century, historically speaking. The period of neglect was long and
dark and no concrete instances could be presented to depict it. But only
concrete or at least tangible <span class=SpellE>stimulii</span> can evoke
emotions. Thus it is an emotional abstraction. Presenting it through concrete
intellection constitutes the difficulty, because we are yet to know as to what
could be the dumbness of a language and how Telugu, in this case, overcame it
and burst into a song The mother’s search for <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span>
refers to four places, possibly <span class=SpellE>Kokila’s</span> frequented
haunts. These four, the dens of the python, the hunting dogs, the leopard and
the tiger refer to the <st1:place w:st="on"><i>Para</i></st1:place><i>, <span
class=SpellE>pasyanti</span>, <span class=SpellE>Madhyama</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Vaikhari</span> </i>stages of the Telugu word. The dumbness of
Telugu was its unfitness for the higher use of language as a medium of art and
science. It was as good as dead. But it transformed itself into a different
shape and emerged successful. What could be the transformation? Telugu as a
Dravidian language was perhaps <span class=SpellE><i>halanta</i></span><i> </i>(consonan</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>t-ending)

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Sanskrit is both <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>ajanta</i></span></span><i>
</i>and <span class=SpellE><i>halanta</i></span><i> </i>(vowel-ending and
consonant-ending). It is with the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>ajanta</i></span></span><i>
</i>characteristic that Telugu has acquired its sonorousness and music which
has brought her the compliment of being called the ‘Italian of the East’. The
idiom is from the nature of the soil into which it died and whence it rose
again. However, the competition between <span class=GramE>neither <span
class=SpellE>Chilaka</span> and</span> <span class=SpellE>Kokila</span> nor

Telugu and <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Kokila</span></span><span

identification was so complete that the poet chose to narrate it all by himself

distressed mother. Of course, neither Time, nor the country, nor a mute, nor
even a language could be made to speak in the poem. It was only for the purpose
of the problem and its argument–a problem that he himself encountered and
transposed on the ancient problem of Telugu–that the characters are invented.

stands on a pedestal all her own. She is unapproachable. There she will stand,
as she has always stood, through the ages. She will shine indeed for all time
as the one glowing ideal of womanhood. Nevertheless, the passing of time and
our contact with western <span class=SpellE>civilisation</span> have tended,
perhaps, to a slight change, just now in our attitude to that ideal. Great and
glorious as she is, she is not all that she should be. She may be said to lack
some essential qualities according to present-day notions. Does she not need on
occasions a little more individuality, a little more self-assertion which is
the birthright of every human being? Surely Sita is too gentle, too submissive.
A wife may be loyal and devoted to her husband, yet she need not on that
account wholly surrender herself to him. No woman, however low, should be
deprived of her individuality if it can be helped. Man should respect her. He
should give her what is her due,”–is the contention. A lady nurtured on western
ideas and culture can understand the wife standing by her husband in sorrow and
in happiness, and serving him faithfully in his hour of need. She can certainly
appreciate the wife working in unison with him undergoing the severest hardships,
if need be, for a great cause. But she can see nothing <span class=GramE>to</span>
admire in her completely losing her personality in that of her husband without
a will of her own. “That a woman should have no independence, no separate
existence at all from her husband’s, is a slight offered to the entire
womanhood’–is probably the feeling held by the more advanced today. They think
that the ideal which robs a woman of her right to act for herself is an ideal
not worth much. Indeed, in their opinion, the injunction of Manu, “The father
protects woman in childhood, the husband in youth, and the son in old age. A
free life does not befit a woman;” is one with little sense in it and therefore
fit to be discarded. But is the text to mean simply that women are not to be
allowed freedom at any stage of their life? I wonder! Why should it not be that
Manu just thought that women were best under the protection of men, as they may
be involved in danger if left to <span class=GramE>themselves</span>? The
tendency of the modern woman to regard this unquestioning faith of the wife in
the husband as rather extreme, is perhaps responsible for her being left
somewhat cold on reading the sublime story of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sita. She
probably feels that even the great Rama can hardly have a right to do with Sita
as he pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is in the most glowing words that Swami
Vivekananda speaks of her: “This glorious Sire, purer than purity itself, all
patience and all suffering<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>–</span>she
who suffered that life of suffering without a murmur; she, the ever chaste, the
ever pure wife; she, the ideal of the people, the ideal of the Gods, the great
Sita. Our national God she must always remain. All our mythology may vanish,
even our Vedas may depart and our Sanskrit language may vanish for ever, but so
long as there will be five Hindus living here, there will be the story of Sita
present, mark my words. Sire has gone into the very vitals of our race. She is
there in the blood of every Hindu man and woman. We are all children of Sita.”
Do not the words send a thrill in our hearts every time we read them? Sita is
enshrined in our hearts, not for the establishment of her rights or the
assertion of her independence, but for her suffering and sacrifice in the
pursuit of her ideal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us now turn to the Ramayana and see how the Poet <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span>
has presented Sita. We first meet her in the Ayodhya </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Kanda
when Sri Rama comes to her to tell the news of his having to dwell in the
forest as an exile for fourteen years. Greatly dismayed on seeing him looking
low and downcast, she asks him the reason for the change in his appearance and
Rama gently breaks to her the terrible news that his father has banished him to
the forest. He then proceeds to give her a bit of advice that in his absence
she must do this and that and how she must be careful not to speak of him
before Bharata. “Those enjoying success and prosperity will not tolerate the
praise of others in their hearing. So do not commit the folly of praising me
before Bharata” he warns her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
does Sire react when she hears the news? Does she grow curious to know the
details, as any other woman might, and ply him; with a number of questions as
to the validity of the two boons granted by <span class=SpellE>Dasaratha</span>
to <span class=SpellE>Kaikeyi</span>, whether there were any witnesses at the
time of his granting them, and whether <span class=SpellE>Kaikeyi</span> could
legitimately claim them after the lapse of so many years etc? No; no such
thoughts ever enter her mind. Slightly hurt because Rama has spoken of going
away without her, she only reproaches him with these words: “Why, <span
class=GramE>Rama,</span> how is it you speak so lightly of so serious a
matter!” But Rama, thinking of the hardships to be endured in the forest,
hesitates to take her along with him. He describes to her at length, of the
wild beasts and other horrors of the forest. Sita meets them all with <span
class=GramE>great spirit</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mother, brother, son and daughter-in-law too–all these experiencing the fruit
of their own Karma perform their several deeds: but the wife alone, O best of
men, shares the fortunes of her husband. For that very reason, I too have been
ordered to live in the forest. My Rama, if you are bound for the impenetrable
forest this very day, I shall go indeed in front of you crushing the thorny
grass and mettles under my feet so that the path may be smooth for you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
we find no abject submission to the husband. It is the wife who is definitely
having her own way and only the husband giving in. Rama is reluctant to take
her with him in spite of all that she says. He still tries to dissuade her and
then, driven to despair; she drops her entreaties and begins to taunt him: “Oh!
<span class=GramE>what</span> will my father, King of <span class=SpellE>Mithila</span>,
think after having got as his son-in-law you, O Rama! <span class=GramE>the</span>
embodiment of manliness, when you behave like a woman?” Usually these words are
brought up against Sita as a tremendous transgression of duty. Surely a wife
enjoying the unbounded love of her husband can say in private what she pleases,
with impunity!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tears
and entreaties at last gain her object for her and Rama consents to take her
with him. We should take note of the fact, too, that Rama scarcely exercises a
husband’s authority over her, but fully respects her and allows her to act for
herself with her own free will. He does not want her to accompany him without
knowing her mind first, though he cannot but be happy at her firm resolve to go
with him. <span class=GramE>“My dearest!</span> I do not desire even Heaven at
the cost of your distress,” he says. Indeed, his consideration for her is so
great that he is <span class=SpellE>loth</span> to bring misery upon her for
his sake. But Sita bestows the least thought upon her own misery. Her ideal is
to follow Rama wherever he goes, even if it be to the ends of the Earth, and
stand by him in sorrow and in happiness. Hence she does not take much credit
for herself for doing what gains the admiration of the whole world. Her hostess
<span class=SpellE>Anasuya</span> congratulates her on having accompanied Rama
with these words: “O Sita, I am very pleased on seeing you following Dharma.
Leaving lour kith and kin, forsaking a life of importance and comfort, you have
chosen to follow Rama into the forest. Women like you, endowed with virtue,
knowing of this world and the other, live and move in heavenly bliss and always
follow, the path of “Dharma.” <span class=GramE>To this Sita replies softly but
firmly.</span> “No, there is nothing wonderful in what I have done,” she says.
“Madam, I am not surprised to hear such words from a good person like you who
knows the duties and virtue of a dutiful wife. Even if my husband were devoid
of merit and an unworthy person, it would not have mattered, and he would have
enjoyed certainly my unswerving devotion. But when he is so famous for his
virtues like my husband, full of compassion, self-controlled, <span
class=GramE>devoted,</span> an embodiment of Dharma, affectionate, like father
and mother! He cherishes the same affection for all the queens of <span
class=SpellE>Dasaratha</span> as he does for the blessed <span class=SpellE>Kausalya</span>,
his mother. He shows affection for those cherished by his father. He is so
heroic as to treat them all with the regard due to a mother.” Sita means
literally all that she says to <span class=SpellE>Anasuya</span>. For has she
not for her husband a prince among men and one who is all the more precious to
her for his vow of ‘<span class=SpellE>ekapatnivrata</span>” (faithfulness to
one wife) unlike <span class=SpellE>Dasaratha</span>, his father, and other
kings of the earth?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
we find Sita giving a bit of her mind when she thought that Rama did not quite
observe the rules of propriety. Of course, such passages do not often occur in
the Ramayana as in the Mahabharata where <span class=SpellE>Draupadi</span>
figures most prominently in the councils of the Pandavas. <span class=SpellE>Draupadi</span>
frequently suggests the course they should take and induces them to action
whenever they are found despondent. But here we should remember that Sri Rama
is the embodiment of Dharma and is too clear about what he must do to need much
the counsel of others. The <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span> dwelling in the
forest request Sri Rama to protect them from the <span class=SpellE>Rakshasas</span>
who menaced them and Sri Rama gives them his promise to do so. Sita, however,
considers this is not quite proper since it would be causing injury to others
without provocation, <i>i.e., </i>without a genuine cause, which is one of the
three great evils, namely, uttering falsehood, impropriety with another man’s
wife, and molesting another person without provocation. Rama would be
committing the last mentioned of the evils in protecting the <span
class=SpellE>Rishis</span>, and Sita tells him a story in support of her view,
how a poor <span class=SpellE>Rishi</span> being left with a sharp sword in his
care, got gradually drawn to it and by constant association with it and by its
mere proximity he got into the habit of using it, and how from being the most
gentle and peace-loving <span class=SpellE>Rishi</span> he came, by degrees, to
take great pleasure in killing, and ended finally by becoming the cruelest of
men. Sita having thought it her duty to warn her husband against doing an
improper <span class=GramE>thing,</span> concludes beautifully with these
words:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Because
of my love for you and your regard for me, I remind you, but do not teach you.
Under no circumstances should a resolution be made by yon to wield the bow.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
does Sri Rama receive it? Does he at all resent it as any other ordinary
husband might do? No; we find him accepting her advice, indeed, with the
greatest respect in the world. “My dearest, you have spoken what is in your
mind out of your deep love and interest in my welfare and I am not offended. On
the other hand, I am very much pleased with you for it. I take everything from
you in good faith. What you have said is quite worthy of your family and mine.
You are my partner in life and have the liberty to admonish me, to put me
right. But I value my promise to the <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span> so highly
that there is no sacrifice that I will not make to keep it. I will sacrifice
Lakshmana. I will sacrifice you, even myself, but not my promise especially to
the <span class=SpellE>Brahmanas</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
we can certainly conclude from this that there is no room for any question of
superiority or inferiority when perfect love and understanding exist between
husband and wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the days pass, and the brothers, with Sita, spend a good part of their exile in
the forest happily and peacefully, when on an evil day <span class=SpellE>Surpanakha</span>,
the sister of Ravana, comes upon Sri Rama by chance, and at once falls in love
with him. She conceives such a great passion for him that she cannot control
herself even for a moment. But her advances meet with little response. Being,
repulsed and suffering humiliation at the hands of Lakshmana, she<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
to Ravana in a terrible mood of revenge and gives him an account of the two
handsome brothers, of the great prowess of Rama in destroying, single-handed, <span
class=SpellE>Khara</span> and <span class=SpellE>Dushana</span> with their
fourteen thousand men. She then proceeds to describe Sita in such a way as
would stimulate his desire. ‘I have not seen on earth, at any time before, a
woman of so much beauty, nor among the Gods or <span class=SpellE>Gandharvas</span>
or <span class=SpellE>Kinnaras</span>.” She utters a lie that as she attempted
to carry her away for his sake; she was disfigured by Lakshmana. His passion
being aroused by her description of Sita, Ravana at once goes to <span
class=SpellE>Maricha</span> and asks for his help. After an earnest attempt to
dissuade him from his evil project, <span class=SpellE>Maricha</span> complies
at last with his request and, disguised as a beautiful golden deer, roams about
near the <span class=SpellE>Ashrama</span> of Sri Rama. At once captivated by
its beauty Sita begs of Rama to catch it for her. In spite of <span
class=SpellE>Lakshmana’s</span> repeated warnings that it is no ordinary deer
but just the cunning-disguise of <span class=SpellE>Maricha</span>, Rama, not
having the heart to disappoint his beloved Sita, goes after the deer which
lures him some distance into the forest and then, slain by him, utters an
anguished cry of “Ha Sita! Ha Lakshmana!” simulating the voice of Rama. Now, we
come upon the scene in which Sita comes to grief. We find her no longer the
sweetest and the gentlest of creatures hitherto pictured by the Poet. She turns
wild all at once, saying the <span class=GramE>most wicked</span> things in the
world. She behaves, indeed, very much like <span class=SpellE>Kaikeyi</span>,
blind, obstinate, and unheeding of consequences, which makes Lakshmana deplore in
the <span class=SpellE>Champu</span> Ramayana, “Alas, what shall I do? You have
turned a <span class=SpellE>Kaikeyi</span> in the wilderness.” Well, it is just
here we perceive the master hand of the Poet, his thorough understanding of
human nature. A woman who fears her husband’s life is in danger cannot be
expected to preserve her self-control. Deceived by the cry of <span
class=SpellE>Maricha</span>, Sita bids Lakshmana in great agitation to go and
see if anything has happened to his brother. When Lakshmana refuses to leave
her alone, she grows furious and accuses him in a torrent of words that he is
pleased to have Rama in danger, and that if he desires her for himself and if
that desire is what prevents him from doing just as he is told, then she will
see that it will not be gratified, by taking away her life before his eyes. How
like a sharp knife the words must have pierced the heart of Lakshmana! If Sita
only threatened that she would drown herself in the <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Godavari</span></st1:place> or take poison and die, Lakshmana
could perhaps have resisted her and so all might have been well. But Sita is simply
wild with fear. She is beside herself and does not know what she is saying. And
Lakshmana is too manly, too impulsive to stand the insults heaped upon him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Poet holding the mirror up to nature has no other choice than presenting the
characters as they are. He is a mere spectator. Hence we find <span
class=SpellE>Valmiki</span> feeling no qualms at all in making even the angelic
Sita behave very much unlike an angel. We cannot but observe in passing how
profound is the narrative skill of this <span class=SpellE>Adi</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kavi</span>, first of poets, and how <span class=SpellE>marvellous</span>
his power in rendering the tense situations! With what throbbing hearts we
await the arrival of Ravana immediately after <span class=SpellE>Lakshmana’s</span>
departure and the great harm he is about to do to poor Sita, every time we read
the story! It is another proof of the Poet’s remarkable sense of art that he
makes Sita, though writhing in agony in the hands of Ravana, <span class=GramE>keep</span>
yet the presence of mind to throw down her jewels tied in a scarf in the midst
of Hanuman and others on the <span class=SpellE>Rishyamuka</span> <span
class=SpellE>Parvata</span>. Indeed there can be no purpose in relating this
incident unless it <span class=GramE>be</span> to heighten the interest of the
story. If <span class=SpellE>Valmiki</span> had omitted it we should certainly
have been deprived of a rare emotional experience <i>(<span class=SpellE>Rasanubhava</span>)</i>.
For what can be more beautiful in literature than the reply of Lakshmana, when
Rama, overcome with grief at seeing <span class=SpellE>Sita’s</span> jewels,
appeals to him “Ha! Lakshmana! Don’t you <span class=SpellE>recognise</span>
these jewels of poor </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the ornaments worn by her on her arms or ears; but I know those worn on her
ankles because of my bowing down to her feet every day.” Do not these words go
straight to our hearts, making us dwell fondly on the noble qualities of
Lakshmana, and wonder how Sita can bring herself to use such language to him,
the purest of pure men, who has sacrificed every thought of his personal
comfort and happiness for the sake of his brother? We are touched beyond words
every time we read those lines. Surely, it is for such great souls as Lakshmana
that the sun <span class=GramE>rises</span> in the east every morning in
obedience to the law of nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ravana who, consumed by his passion for her, comes during the night to coax her

Sri Rama, again in the words of Hanuman, “You shall see Rama with his face
beaming like the full moon, his eyes dark and beautiful and his lips lovely and
ears wearing charming pendants,” scarcely tempts her. Does not this incident
show of what stuff she is made? Far from being a meek, helpless creature, does
she not rise to the height of a heroine defying the terrible Ravana himself? I
do not think any amount of freedom and independence will give a woman the
necessary moral courage to support herself in difficulties. Hanuman can do
nothing but express his admiration that such sentiments are only worthy of her.

are inevitably reminded at this juncture of another great work in literature,
the tragedy of Othello and Desdemona. Othello, of course, is cast in a noble
mould. He is untainted by any mean or wicked thoughts. But he is too much a
prey to the ordinary human passions. He can hardly stand comparison with Sri
Rama who is definitely on a higher plane (assuming for the moment he is a human
being like the rest of us). Desdemona perhaps comes near to Sita for her
absolute purity and utterly selfless devotion to her husband. She does not even
try to defend herself when Othello accuses her of infidelity to him. Indeed she
is so innocent that she scarcely understands the word. “I know not what sins I
have committed unless they are the loves I bear to you,” she says. “I am not
what you think,’ is how Sita speaks of the grievous wrong done to her. It is
clear from this that great poets are the same the world over. They think alike.

how shall we explain the final abandoning of Sita in the <span class=SpellE>Uttarakanda</span>?
Rama resolves to discard her on account of an idle scandal that reaches his
ears. For, the ideal he has cherished all along is such that he would feel no
remorse in giving up his friendship, his comfort, his compassion and even Sita
if it would please the people. Can he then go against this ideal? Here, again,
Sita accepts her fate, not in any spirit of blind obedience to the husband. She
knows that Rama values Dharma even above herself and she considers it part of
her duty as a wife to see that he fulfils it to perfection. Has he not thought
it his particular Dharma to make his father “one wedded to truth,” and accept
the banishment for fourteen years, and does not the same apply to her also?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

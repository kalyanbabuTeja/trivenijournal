<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Founded on Dec. 25, 1927, at Madras, "TRIVENI" has been the organ of cultural renaissance in India for Eighty years. Devoted to Literature, History Art and to the propagation of idealism in every sphere of public life, the journal has fairly realized its aspirations of drawing together the varied and dispersed lovers of art and culture in the different parts of Bharat and its interpreting the Indian Renaissance in its manifold aspects to the world outside.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coinciding with the celebrations of its Platinum Jubilee Year, the TRIVENI Foundation has decided to take the journal to readers all over the world. With this objective the TRIVENI Foundation has taken up the Project of Digitizing its Eighty years of publications. This digital data will be available on a CD(s) &amp; will also be available for reading on the internet. This massive project involves digitizing and retrieving the text of nearly 30,000 to 40,000 pages of printed text. We are exploring the ways of propagating beautiful paintings and photographs printed in TRIVENI.</P>

<P>In the choicest of valleys</P>
<P>There is moaning and lamentation,</P>
<P>In the great thoroughfares of men</P>
<P>There is the laughter of changing sadness,</P>
<P>In the melodious song</P>
<P>There is the emptiness of fulfilled desire,</P>
<P>Upon the lofty mountain</P>
<P>There awaits the stillness of death.</P>
<P>Wave upon wave</P>
<P>Comes the action of men </P>
<P>To break lonely upon the shores of vain glory. </P>
<P>The whirlwind of young love</P>
<P>Grows sad within the fold of a single day.</P>
<P>Thought conquers the great regions of time,</P>
<P>Only to return to the bondage</P>
<P>Of a deceiving mind.</P>
<P>All, desire is as young as the first ray of dawn</P>
<P>And sad as the procession of death to the grave:</P>
<P>Struggle, the pursuit of fleeting pleasure,</P>
<P>Toil, the dull pain of easy ambition,</P>
<P>Gain, the gathering of the peculiar treasures of the rich,</P>
<P>Domination, the cry of perverted judgment that holds the heart of the oppressor,</P>
<P>Greed, the cruelty of privation that corrupts the growth of life,</P>
<P>Fear, the eager search after shelters of comfort,</P>
<P>Worship, the deep forgetfulness from the confusion of many desires.</P>
<P>To the music of the distant flute</P>
<P>Flows the wide, ancient river,</P>
<P>Fresh with young-waters.</P>
<P>Many chants are sung in praise of happiness, </P>
<P>Many gods are invoked as guides to happiness,</P>
<P>Many heavens are glorified as enticements to happiness,</P>
<P>Many altars are built to happiness,</P>
<P>Many rites are performed as offerings to happiness, </P>
<P>Many benedictions are asked as protection for happiness,</P>
<P>Many truths are extolled in anguish for happiness,</P>
<P>Many virtues are sought in fear for happiness,</P>
<P>Many possessions are gathered in hope of happiness,</P>
<P>Many desires are gratified in expectation of happiness,</P>
<P>Many sacrifices are made in quest of happiness, </P>
<P>Many austerities are imposed in longing for happiness.</P>
<P>Deep in the mire the seed of the lotus is in travail,</P>
<P>The soft fragrance lies hid in the heart of the flower. </P>

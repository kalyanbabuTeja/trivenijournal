down South in Balepet, if one were to go about ten steps in the second lane on
the left, just after Annayyappa’s Coffee Club, one comes by a small discoloured
door on the right-hand side. The number on the door is obliterated by sun, rain
and wind. It is the door of a very small room, six feet wide and eight feet
deep. There is also a small opening, by the side of the door, in the six feet
wall on the lane side,–with a tin shutter, doing the function of a window. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we to say that he is some insignificant, nameless struggler who, very
ambitiously, set out to carve for himself a huge big name in the world of Fine
Art, it would be sufficient foreword to his life history. Yet, for our and your
convenience, it would be better to know his name and proceed further. His full
name is Chandrasekhara; but the whole of it was not in daily use. He was
calling himself just ‘Chandu’ for routine use. Honestly, ‘Murad’ would have
been a far more appropriate name than </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

were we to say that Chandu was a five-feet six inches tall figure of hunger,
despair and sorrow, the more predominant and characteristic feature of our hero
will be reckoned. In colour of skin, he was neither too<i> </i>dark nor too
fair, but what one could call middling. The greying hair on his head, cropped
long and never dressed, appeared bushy and wild. A high, wide forehead,
overhanging a pair of sunken sad eyes, a prominent nose and a pointed chin,
thin bloodless lips pressed grimly together, made up his face. Though he
appeared to be on the wrong side of forty,–actually he was just thirty years
old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Chandu saw the light of day in an utterly poor
household. He became a half-orphan at his very birth, by the death of his
mother, and at the age of ten he was a full-blown orphan! And so, from that day
began his battle royal with hunger. For fourteen long and wearisome years he
fought grimly and relentlessly without retreating a single step. He married; at
the age of twenty-four, a sweet charming girl from a well-to-do family, and the
future appeared rosy for him. “Ah! at last the fight is over!” said Chandu to
himself soon after his marriage. He figured that the rest of his life might
turn out to be like a sweet unbroken dream. While such were his calculations,
the decision of Fate was different altogether. Chandu had hardly walked a
couple of steps in his happy dream state, when Kamala’s eyes were closed–never
to open again. His colourful dream bubble was pricked abruptly. He opened his
eyes to the bitterest reality; Just two years after marriage, Chandu became a
man of the streets again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chandu
was an artist and he had adopted his art as a profession; for, even from his
early youth he had a crazy notion that art as a profession would pay and that
he could earn quite a lot of money by painting pictures and selling them. The
reason for this optimism was an item of news in some English newspaper, to the
effect that a painting of a great European artist was sold for some thousands
of pounds, in an auction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chandu
had taken to art like fish to water. Probably the artistic strain in some
remote ancestor of his was trying to assert itself and blossom in Chandu.
Anyway, he indulged in the art of painting with all the fervour of a ‘yogi’ and
mastered it in much shorter time than others could have. He could say in a
picture more completely and lucidly than what a hundred pages of description
could do, even then perhaps not so adequately. But what was the earthly use? He
had learnt an art, neither wanted nor valued by the people amongst whom he was
born and so the golden dream of his early youth soon began to melt and
evaporate. His lot became worse than that of a street dog during the three
years after his wife’s death. Finally, after a good deal of cringing and
begging, he was able to obtain the temporary post of a drawing master in a city
school. This job brought him fifteen rupees a month as salary. “At least one
meal a day is assured,” said Chandu to himself. Till now he was living with
some distant relatives on his mother’s side,–who were themselves not in
affluent circumstances. So, soon after he obtained the job in the city school,
he took a room–the one with which this story opens–on </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
rent of three rupees a month. The remaining twelve rupees had to provide him
with food, clothing and artist’s materials such as colours, paper etc.,
required for his profession. So in this economic distress, two meals in every
twenty-four hours seemed an unnecessary extravagance to him. Therefore, he
firmly resolved that he must be satisfied with just one meal a day until better
days dawned, and brought it into force with immediate effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few months passed in this state of affairs. Barring school hours, Chandu used
to utilise all his leisure hours of the day to paint pictures. His room was
full of pictures painted by him. Some were completed and some were finished
half and three-fourths. In one way or other, hunger, despair, sorrow and
poverty, depicted in a variety of compositions, were the dominant note in all
the pictures. What else could he paint, except his own experiences, thoughts
and feelings; of which he was a rich source to himself?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

months rolled by in quick succession and summer </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>arrived. The
vacation deprived Chandrasekhar of even the ‘half morsel’. According to rules,
the school authorities could not continue to have a temporary hand on their
rolls during the long recess and so they terminated Chandu’s services on the
last working day before the holidays. Chandu had not thought of this calamity.
He was bewildered. What to do for the meal? And the room rent? These cruel
questions loomed–one bigger than the other–before the mind. At worst, one can
beg and fill the belly. But what about shelter? He never wanted to be a parasite
again on his distant relatives. So? “Under a tree!–or on the pial of Poorniah’s
choultry!</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;

deep within him seemed to answer emphatically. Well, one was as good as the
other! Chandu shuddered at the agonising thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was acquainted with a picture dealer in Chickpet whose name was Gangappa. He
took a number of his finished paintings to Gangappa’s shop to be displayed
there for sale. This shop was very well known for the sale of original
paintings, sketches, colour prints, lithographs etc. The sale of at least one

was nearing a month since Chandu had lost his job. The vacation never seemed to
end. And then, what guarantee was there that he would get<i> </i>the job again
soon after the classes began? The previous month’s salary had been used up to
meet the expenses of the month previous to that. From the first day of the
current month, Chandu had vetoed even the single meal per day; for, in his
present desperate situation, that also was an extravagant luxury! By appealing
to the mercy of the landlord, he had managed to postpone the payment of the
rent that had fallen due that month. This was indeed a great relief<i>, </i>though
temporary. But the silent, howling demand of the belly was more oppressive and
more inexorable than the loudest<i> </i>demands of the cruellest landlord in
Lord Almighty’s creation. The amount of rent he had withheld was already
exhausted. He had nothing but an old </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

first Marwari pawn-broker’s shop<i> </i>he came across, and sold it outright
for five rupees. He looked upon the amount, not as just five rupees but as
eighty annas! To complete the illusion he changed all the rupees to nickel
anna-coins. Their weight was reassuring to him. As he was returning to the room
he had a strong temptation to go into a coffee club and have a small repast of
delicacies. But he curbed it and pro</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

to go without food this day and was fasting since morning. More to divert his
mind from the ravings of his belly than to any thing else, he took out a
half-finished water colour painting and began to finish it….It was the picture
of a young and beautiful lying on a soft bedded cot in the full light of a wide
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>window.
So was depicted as though in deep sleep. The face was, calm and serene, and was
lit up with a gentle, sweet and yet sad smile. Maybe, she was having a sweet
dream or finding sleep sweet…..Chandu had been painting this particular picture
during the last four years, bit by bit. This was a ‘not for sale’ picture and
so he was not in a hurry to finish it. And he did not want to finish it either;
for that would have meant, not having anything more to do with it, while he
wanted to have as much to do with it as possible and for as long as possible.
The reason for this was not far to seek. The heroine of the picture was the
heroine of Chandu’s life, who had passed away through a fatal illness four
years back, leaving him to life-long sorrow. The heart-rending scene, on the,
soft bedded cot, in the full light of the wide-opened window, in that room on

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>this
vivid scene, was deeply rooted in his mind: During the four years since that fatal
day, Chandu had been pulling out this tragic scene which had dived into his
very soul, and transferring it slowly–bit by bit, on to the paper. Every time
he sat before the picture with brush in hand, he drove his mind to four years
back</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:

was so on this wretched afternoon also. Sorrow welled up from the depths of his
memory, drowning all the trials and tribulations he had become heir to. As he
was sitting before the propped up picture with brush in hand, he paused,
reclined against the wall, and half-closed his eyes. His consciousness seemed
to recede. His right hand; holding the brush, slided down the side. The brush

seven in the evening. Chandu, who had stretched himself with the rolled up bed
for a pillow, got up now and lit the tiny oil lamp. There was, still, a little
over, three hours left for the arrival of the landlord. Chandu opened an old
discoloured trunk and brought out the tiny, carved ivory box from its depths.
And then, he took out his wife’s picture that he had bee n painting and placed
it against the wall near the bed. With the ivory box near him, he sat down
again, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>reclining against the bed and facing the
picture. He gazed at it </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>intently,
for a quarter of an hour without stirring or beating his eyelids once. Next, he
took up the ivory box, stroked it tenderly and opening its lid took out the
silver eight-anna coin. Even as he was diving his fingers into it to take out
the relic, tears welled up in his eyes and streamed down his unhappy face.
Affectionately he bathed the sacred piece with his hot tears. Again and again
he pressed both the coin and the ivory box to his trembling lips. His cup of
sorrow was full to the brim. Even mentally he could not utter a word. Again, he
rolled his watery eyes to Kamala’s portrait for another quarter of an hour and
then wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. Letting out one long sigh, he
got up briskly, and uttered sharply just four words: “Kamala! it has hardened!”
Then, with lightning speed he took up the picture, and kissing it once and for
the last time, he pressed it to his face and heart. Then closing his eyes, he
tore up the picture to tiny bits, heaped them together</span><span

a match and set fire to the heap. Four years’ labour of love was reduced to
ashes in a minute. Chandu gathered, slowly, all the ashes into: the ivory box.
Then he scribbled something on a piece of paper and nailed it to the wall
opposite the door. He was not in need of light any more. He blew it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

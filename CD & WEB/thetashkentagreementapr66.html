style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no need to grow hysterical over the Tashkent Agreement concluded between the
late Lal Bahadur Shastri, our Prime Minister, and President Ayubkhan of
Pakistan, on January 10, 1966,</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> in the presence of the Soviet Premier,
Kosygin. There is no </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>room either for too much optimism or too
much pessimism over it. What is needed is to take a balanced view of the
situation created by it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
items on which the two leaders came to an agreement may be broadly grouped
under two heads. It is a normal feature for every war to be followed by the
conclusion of a peace treaty. By the resolutions which the Security Council
passed on September 20, 1965 it tried to bring about such a treaty as a fitting
sequel to the Indo-Pakistan war of August-September<i>, </i>1965<i>. </i>Though
the resolutions regarding cease-fire and withdrawal of armed personnel to the
positions held prior to August 5, were accepted by both India and Pakistan and
although there was a formal declaration of cease-fire on September 22, there
were repeated violations of cease-fire and there was a danger of the
recrudescence of warfare on a large scale. This danger was put end to by the
“Treaty” items in the Tashkent Agreement under which both parties agreed to
withdraw not later than February 25, 1966, all their armed personnel to the
positions held prior to August 5, 1965, to restore the normal functioning of
diplomatic relations, to repatriate, the prisoners of war and to discuss the
return of the property and assets taken over by either side during the
conflict. There was an element of sincerity in agreeing to these items which
was absent when both the parties accepted the resolutions of the Security<i> </i>Council.
The result is the putting into effect of this part of the agreement according
to plan. Armies have been withdrawn to the agreed positions; prisoners of war
have been repatriated; normal diplomatic relations have been restored; and
postal and telegraphic communications between the two States and air-flights
across each other’s air-space have been resumed. Perfect p</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>eace
now prevails between India and Pakistan. This is the outcome of the Tashkent
Agreement and everyone ought to feel happy about it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there are a few who do not feel quite happy. Their point is that in agreeing to
withdraw our forces to positions held prior to August 5, we had to give up our
hold over the Hajipir, Tithwal and Kargil passes which we reoccupied during the
war and whose possession is absolutely necessary from the point of view of the
defence of Kashmir and Ladakh and the internal security of the State. The other
point raised by them is that Pakistan was not called upon in the Agreement to
withdraw from Kashmir the infil</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>trators whom she had sent in several
thousands and to own her responsibility for their presence in the State. It is
also their point </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that on both these issues Lal Bahadur Shastri
gave definite pledges to the Indian Parliament and the people and that, owing
to the irresistible pressure exercised upon him by the Soviet Premier, he had
to break these pledges and to make an abject surrender to Pakistan. It was both
a moral and material defeat for India–so great a defeat that it was really
responsible for the death of our Prime Minister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is no doubt a great deal of force in this criticism. The only reply that can be
given is that it was the price we had to pay if peace and normal conditions had
to be restored. The alternative would have been the breakdown of the Tashkent
conference and the return to ceasefire violations and the threat of a renewal
of war. From this point of view the price paid should not be considered as too
high. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
may now turn our attention to the other items in agreement falling under the
second head-items whose objective to bring about a permanent easing of the
eighteen-year tension between India and Pakistan. Among these items is the
basic declaration that “both sides will exert all efforts to create good </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>neighbourly
relations between India and Pakistan in accordance with the United Nations
Charter” and the re-affirmation of “their obligation under the Charter not to
have recourse to force and to settle their disputes by peaceful means.” This
has been considered </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by the admirers of the agreement as
guaranteeing permanent peace </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>between the two States and as marking a
revolution in the relations between them. We will have to consider below
whether so much </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>meaning can be read into either the above
declaration or the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>re-affirmation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other items falling under the second head are the agreement of both parties not
to interfere in the internal affairs of each other, not to encourage any
propaganda directed by one country against the other but to encourage
propaganda which promotes the development of friendly relations between them,
agreement to consider measures for bringing about cultural exchanges, the
restoration of economic and trade relations, to discuss questions relating to
the problem of refugees and eviction of illegal immigration and the return of
property and assets taken over by either side during the conflict and to
continue meetings at the highest and other levels on matters of direct concern
to both countries and also set up joint bodies for the same purpose. We have
here a list of the major problems requiring discussion and settlement and also
the creation of a suitable machinery–meetings and joint boards–for the purpose.
Kashmir is not specifically mentioned among these problems. The machinery
proposed is not an outside one like the Security Council where decisions are
taken not on the merits of the issues coming up for consideration but on the
effects they produce on the balance of power in international affairs. This
agreed machinery is more in keeping with the dignity and self-respect of both
India and Pakistan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
items falling under the second head are of a highly valuable character and if
they are accepted and put into effect without any mental reservations they are
sure to inaugurate a new era of friendly and good neighbourly relations between
the two States–relations like those which have existed between the United
States </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and Canada, for a century. Both governments will
then be in a position </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to spend less on defence and concentrate
all their efforts on modernising their economy and social life and raising the
living standards of their people. This might even result in the two countries
uniting together in defence against common enemies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
alas, the situation is really different. The agreement is<i> </i>based not on
any real change of heart on the part of those who are at the helm of affairs in
Pakistan. It is becoming clear that they signed the agreement more to avoid
incurring the displeasure of the Soviet Premier, their host at Tashkent, than
because of their real faith in the principles underlying the agreement. Their
subsequent statements go to show that they signed it with a number of mental </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>reservations
and the result is that the relations between the two States continue today to
be the same as they have been ever since the birth of Pakistan. Tension has not
eased and there are no indications of its easing in the near future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
the Indian leaders all these years wanted was a real no-war pact between the
two countries but what the Tashkent Agreement provided for is only a
re-affirmation of the obligation under the U. N. Charter not to use force.
There is really a snag in this re- affirmation as was made clear by Bhutto when
he said shortly after the Agreement was concluded that the U. N. Charter does
not prevent a State from using force in self-defence. The very fact that he found
it necessary to make such a statement indicates that those in authority in
Pakistan do not sincerely subscribe to the Agreement. Let us in this connection
remind ourselves that even the worst aggressors in history claimed that all the
wars they waged were wars in self-defence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
the Agreement speaks of is a re-affirmation of the obligation. If affirmation
has not prevented Pakistan from using force to grab Kashmir first in 1947-48
and next in August-September 1965 and to grab Kutch in 1964-65 (in spite of a
provision for arbitration) what guarantee is there that a re-affirmation of the
obligation will produce practical results? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
find similar mental reservations in regard to the agreement not to interfere in
the internal affairs of India. It is Bhutto’s view that Kashmir is not a part
of India and that interference in the affairs of Kashmir–carrying on
anti-Indian propaganda there, encouraging rebellion and even sending
infiltrators–is, no interference in India’s internal affairs. Even President Ayub
has stated that the Tashkent Agreement has not in any way altered Pakistan’s
attitude towards the problem of Kashmir or her determination to see that
Kashmir’s future is settled in accordance with the principle of
self-determination. How can there be a real easing of tension so long as views
like these are held by Pakistan’s rulers? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is necessary here to note the difference between criticism directed against
Tashkent Agreement in India and in Pakistan. In India the criticism is mainly
from the parties in opposition. The ruling party and all the members of the
council of ministers </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>have unreservedly accepted the Agreement
and are determined to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>put it into effect. They are all for the
maintenance of the <i>status quo </i>in regard to the political and constitutional
set-up of the coun</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>try. In Pakistan, however, the criticism is not
only by the opposition parties but also by those in power–Bhutto, the
responsible minister for external affairs, leading them all with President Ayub
Khan joining them. This is rather ominous for the future of the Agreement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the problems listed in the Agreement for specific discussion at conferences
between the representatives of the two there is no mention of Kashmir. All the
same, President Ayub Khan, Minister Bhutto, and all other members of Pakistan’s
Government regard Kashmir as the primary problem to be discussed, knowing all
along that India has repeatedly and categorically been that Kashmir is purely
an internal matter and that there is nothing for India to discuss with Pakistan
about it. There is thus no meeting ground on the issue of Kashmir between the
two countries and the Tashkent Agreement has had no effect on either country so
far as this issue is concerned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was hoped at the time, when the Agreement was concluded that though there might
be an impasse on Kashmir, other problems would be discussed and settled and
that this would gradually pave the way for a better atmosphere when it might be
easier to go into the Problem of Kashmir. But the proceedings of the first
ministerial conference under the agreement held on March 1, and 2, have belied
completely all such prospects. The conference ended practically in a deadlock.
Even the question of the normalization of shipping lines, the exchange of
cargoes seized during the September conflict, and the movement of persons and
of trade between the two countries interrupted by the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>conflict
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>could
not be discussed with any seriousness, in spite of their urgency as Pakistan
insisted on giving priority to Kashmir. Though it was agreed at this meeting,
that more meetings should be held, the prospect of such meetings yielding
fruitful results is rather dim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
appears to be the purpose of the leaders of Pakistan to demonstrate to the
world that the machinery for the discussion and settlement of problems provided
for in the Agreement is of value and that settlement is possible only through
the Security council or some other third party–a course to which India is not
likely to agree. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fact of the matter is that the barrier separating India and Pakistan is
something deeper than the issue of Kashmir, of </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Muslim
infiltrators into Assam, or of the mass exodus of Hindus from East Pakistan.
These are merely symptoms of a basic and fundamental difference of an
ideological character between the two States. During the discussions which led
to the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 President Ayub Khan stated that the essential
first step in promoting good neighbourly relations between the two countries
was the settlement of the river water question. India agreed with him and
concluded the Indus Water Treaty even though it meant a heavy financial payment
from year to year for ten years and also depriving herself of a large share of
water to which she had a legitimate claim. But the treaty was not followed by
the promotion of any goodwill. It only led to Pakistan’s greater intransigence
on the question of Kashmir and her collusion with China. President Ayub Khan
and Bhutto now say that if the issue Kashmir is settled to their satisfaction a
reign of peace will dawn. This, is however, a mere dream. The ideological
differences which </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>are at the root of the tension between the two
States are bound </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

agreements like the Tashkent Agreement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

neighbourliness. No regime in Pakistan can last unless it is based on hatred of
India and the multiplication of issues with India. It is from the idol-breakers
like Mahmud of Ghazni, and plunderers like Timur, that the leaders of Pakistan
draw their inspiration. They prefer the policy of Aurangazeb to that of Akbar.
It is wonder that at Tashkent one of them thought it quite appropriate to
describe his countrymen as the descendants of Babar, the Muslim conqueror of
India. They feel that they even have a right to rule over the people of India,
a rule which was unfortunately interrupted, according to them, by the conquest
of the country by the British in the 18th </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

in a theocratic state in which non-Muslims </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>can claim no place.
This aim has already been achieved in West Pakistan and it is in the process of
being achieved in East Pakistan creating for India the vast problem of
refugees. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have come to rule Pakistan hold the same view and it is their ambition to give
reality to the original dream. This is at the basis of their claim to Kashmir
and of the flow of Muslim infiltrators into Assam. To convert Assam into a
Muslim majority State through this process and lay claim to it on the basis of
the two-nation theory which led to the partition of India is their objective.
Nothing is more humiliating to them than to see the fifty million Muslims in
India accepting citizenship in a secular State. This was what Rahmat Ali, the
originator and the inspirer of the idea of Pakistan said, in the manifesto he
issued in 1933. Every state must have a myth to inspire its citizens and the
myth on which the people of Pakistan are fed is the two-nation theory with all
its implications and consequences. Any number of agreements like the Tashkent
Agreement cannot persuade Pakistan to abandon this theory. And so long as it
constitutes the basis of Pakistan’s policies there is no prospect of the
tension between the two countries being eased. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Such a conclusion is rather depressing. But it is
the only conclusion which has a rational basis. It alone is in conformity with
the realities of the situation. India has therefore to reconcile herself to
this situation where she has to live for generations perhaps with an unfriendly
neighbour, and should take all precautions necessary to defend her national
interests against the neighbour using open force, as was the case in September
1965. There is nothing strange or unprecedented in this. For more than a
thousand years France and Germany have been hostile neighbours. There are many
problems in history for which man has not been able to discover an effective
solution. He has therefore been compelled to reconcile himself to live with
such problems. It looks as if the problem of India’s relationship with Pakistan
is one of this kind, in spite of the Tashkent Agreement. Political leaders in
India who have been attaching exaggerated importance to this agreement will do
well to revise their ideas, give up their complacency and realise that it will
take a long long time for friendly relations to be established between the two
countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
the Agreement holds no near prospect of better relations between India and
Pakistan it has produced one effect which has to be kept in mind. Whether this
will prove beneficial or harmful in furtherance of India’s interests only time
can answer. The Agreement has given to Soviet Russia a crucial place in the
settlement of issues between India and Pakistan. At Tashkent Soviet Russia
played the part of a mediator, for all practical purposes though India always
abhorred the idea of a third party mediation in the settlement of her issue
with Pakistan. It is to Soviet Russia that India will in future be looking for
help in case Pakistan violates any of the clauses in the Tashkent Agreement.
This is sure to give to Soviet Russia numerous opportunities to exercise
pressure on India. What Soviet Russia is interested in is peace in the
sub-continent and not in India maintaining her hold over Kashmir. She is also
interested in drawing Pakistan away from China. If in furtherance of these
interests she feels that India should come to some kind of settlement with
Pakistan over Kashmir she will not hesitate to bring pressure for the purpose
on the Indian Government. Will India be able to resist it? Perhaps not. In the
past the United States and the other Western powers were interested in
appeasing Pakistan at the cost of India. India was then in a position to
manouvre and secure the help of Soviet Russia against the West. It was in this
way that she induced Soviet Russia to exercise her veto in the Security Council
whenever the question of Kashmir came up there for consideration. But today the
position is different. Both Soviet Russia and the West are interested in
appeasing Pakistan. The scope left for India to manouvre does no long exist.
The Tashkent Agreement registers this growing influence of Soviet Russia in
Indo-Pakistan affairs and there is a possibility of the two great powers of the
world acting in concert in influencing India’s politics. It may therefore be
not incorrect to conclude that the Agreement is responsible for limiting the
freedom of action of India in her dealings with Pakistan and in shaping her
international policies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

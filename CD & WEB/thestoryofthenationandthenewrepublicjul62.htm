the field of journalism, the general weekly and monthly press has tremendous
effect in shaping public opinion. This press is of two kinds–one which caters
to the “intellectuals”, and the other which seeks to attract a large reading
public so that it may become a part of a big business enterprise. Those
weeklies and monthlies which are edited for a limited audience, the
“Intellectuals”, may be called the “idea” magazines. These magazines devote
most of their space to commentary on current problems rather than mere
reporting of them. The idea magazines, in so far as they seek to influence
public opinion, tend often to be committed to certain causes and ideologies,
approaches and attitudes, and may sometimes be affiliated to a political party
or a religious sect. The better known ones in the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region> are the <i>Nation, </i>the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><i>New</i></st1:PlaceName><i>

<i>Progressive, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
</i>the <i>Freeman, Reedy’s Mirror, </i>and the <i>New Masses. </i>Of these,
some flickered for a few years and died. Some are affiliated to religious
organizations <i>(Commonweal), </i>and some are associated with political
parties <i>(New Masses). </i>I have chosen the <i>Nation </i>and the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><i>New</i></st1:PlaceName><i> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType></i></st1:place><i> </i>for my discussion
because they are the survivors of long and distinguished experiments and reveal
many of the factors that shape the idea magazines, and they are not associated
with anyone political party or faith. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

constantly rising costs of publication have brought tremendous pressure on the
mass circulation press to conform to the majority opinion. And the minority
opinion is gradually cut off from public expression. Hutchin’s Commission on
Freedom of the Press reported that the freedom of the press is in danger
because of the concentration of the press industry in the hands of a few, and
the consequent decrease in the number of people who can express their opinions
and ideas through the press. The commission recommended among other things that
non-profit organizations help supply the variety, quantity, and quality of
press service required by the people. That the <i>Nation </i>and the <i>New
Republic </i>were established with the express purpose of serving this precise
function should make their story interesting to us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>Nation </i>calls itself “<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
Leading Liberal Weekly”. It was founded in 1865, a few months after the end of
the Civil War, by Edwin Lawrence Godkin. Godkin had received a thorough
education in <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> and
served as a correspondent to the <i>Daily News </i>of <st1:City w:st="on">London</st1:City>
before coming to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1856. He was fired with a zeal to
start a weekly which would “appeal to the thinking classes rather than to the
unthinking masses “. In 1865 he raised money from literary men and teachers
from <st1:City w:st="on">Cambridge</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New Haven</st1:place></st1:City> and the big cities of the East.
Aided by a wealthy <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City>
abolitionist, James Miller Mekim, Godkin succeeded in materializing his idea to
found and edit a liberal weekly. Wendell Phillips Garrison, a graduate from
Harvard and the son-in-law of Mekim, joined as the literary editor. This team
carried on the editorial business of the <i>Nation </i>till the end of the
century. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
great prestige the <i>Nation </i>enjoys in the history of American journalism
and thought, is in no small part due to Godkin. His idea was to see his weekly
“instinctively dreaded by every charlatan and scoundrel in the country”. He
announced that the <i>Nation </i>would not be the organ of any party of any
party or sect and would work for the discussion of public affairs and the
diffusion of democratic ideals. One early editorial declared: “Our
criticisms…..may be ill-founded or ill-judged, but are always honest, and they
shall certainly never be withheld; they shall go before our readers, like
testimony before the courts, for what they are worth.” <sup>1</sup> Under
Godkin, the <i>Nation </i>fought for social improvement and worked for the
betterment of labour conditions and of the lot of Negroes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
prestige of the <i>Nation, </i>and the influence of Godkin on the elite, were
immense. Richard Dana, Jr., wrote in 1875 to his son who was preparing for a
trip abroad that he would send the <i>Nation </i>to him regularly. James
Russell Lowell told at a dinner that the <i>Nation’s </i>“discussions of
politics had done more good and influenced public opinion more than any other
agency, or all others combined, in the country”.<sup> 2</sup> Godkin’s
biographer Rollo Ogden quoted William James as saying about Godkin: “To my
generation, his was certainly the towering influence in all thought concerning
public affairs, and indirectly his influence has certainly been more pervasive
than that of any other writer of the generation, for he influenced other
writers who never quoted him, and determined the whole current of discussion.”<sup>
3</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
was his influence. But the <i>Nation </i>was not without its troubles. It
started with 5,000 contributors and Godkin felt very hopeful of its success. In
the beginning, the stockholders of the <i>Nation </i>gave complete indpendence
to Godkin in the conducting of the paper. But soon dissenting opinion arose
among them, and some did not approve of the policies. In less than a year,
Godkin had to take over complete control, and the <i>Nation </i>association
became E. L. Godkin and Co. During the first year of its publication numerous
experiments, such as changing the title and frequency, were tried to make the <i>Nation
</i>financially self-sufficient, but with no success. By the end of the year,
most of its capital was drawn. Ever since, the financial embarrassments of the
‘Nation’ have been no secret. As Tassin puts it, “It was generally believed
that the end was a foregone conclusion. No matter how ‘uncommon its gift to
make serious inquiry attractive’…….an independent periodical, criticizing life
and literature from only the highest standards of morality and taste and with
no other popular appeal than this, could not long survive.”<sup> 4</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
financial troubles were due, at least to some extent, to the lack of proper
management. As Garrison, the <i>Nation’s </i>literary editor under Godkin, said
of Godkin: “He had, strictly speaking, no business instinct, no faculty for
details…..” <sup>5</sup> It would seem that most of the organizations, begun
with no profit motive, fail to practise sound principles of economy and
administrative organization and in the final analysis defeat their own purpose.

June, 1811, the <i>Nation </i>merged with the ‘Evening Post’ with Godkin as one
of the editors. Writing to a friend about this </span><span style='font-size:

Garrison Villard the new owner of the <i>Nation </i>said that “just as into no
journalistic enterprise commercial considerations entered less than into the
first launching of the <i>Nation, </i>so they faded away when the <i>Nation </i>passed
into the hands of the present owners”.</span><sup><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Garrison, its literary editor, assumed complete editorial control. As Pollak
points out, “Mr. Garrison’s life-long familiarity with the special
qualification of every leading scholar in the country enabled him to assign, without

the <i>Nation’s </i>book reviews are among the best should not, therefore,
surprise anybody. The <i>Nation </i>insisted on impartial and informed judgment
of books. Henry Holt pointed out that it was something new at this time to send
a book for review to a man who had special knowledge of the subject. Under
Garrison, the <i>Nation </i>became more scholarly and less polemical. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Garrison (1906), Hammond Lamont, Paul Elmer More, and Harold de Wolf Fuller
were successively short term editors of the <i>Nation. </i>Under their
editorship, it lost much of its “verve and flavour” and it expressed the
scholarly zeal of these academicians rather than zest for contemporary
political life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1918 Oswald Garrison Villard assumed personal responsibility for the <i>Nation </i>and
became its editor. Villard graduated from Harvard and for a couple of years he
taught history there. He was a liberal and an uncompromising pacifist. He owned
the <i>Evening Post </i>which sacrificed revenue to principle until he had to
sell it when <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
joined the First World War and the pacifist <i>Post </i>became unpopular. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Under
Villard the <i>Nation </i>gained much of what it lost after Godkin. And it
began to pay more attention to foreign affairs than before. This was made
possible “with the financial aid of some devoted friends, notably by Mrs. Henry
Goddard Leach and Mr. and Mrs. Francis Neilson”. Frank P. Walsh called the <i>Nation
</i>at this time the greatest mystery in American journalism. He </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pointed
out that his articles that appeared in the syndicated news columns of papers
with millions of circulation got no appreciable reaction from the readers. But
when his article appeared in the <i>Nation </i>with a circulation of only
27,000, his telephone began ringing and echoing for people who counted most
then. It may be truthfully said that Villard’s personality did pervade the
columns of the <i>Nation. </i>As Lewis Gannett pointed out, “Villard’s
character is inextricably a part of the <i>Nation…</i>Its lonely courage and
its quick indignations are invariably described as Villardian.”</span><sup><span

<i>Nation </i>did not make a cent either. Villard did not collect any salary.
During the first year of his editorship, he ran a deficit of about $150,000. He
tried to drastically cut the costs. But it did not help too much. And the <i>Nation’s

Villard retired in 1932, a board of editors directed the paper until 1937 when
Freda Kirchwey took over as editor. She continued through September 1955. She
joined the <i>Nation </i>in 1918 and served as managing editor from 1922 to
1928. She continued its crusade against racial discrimination, criticized the
free enterprise system, and remained pro-labour. The new publisher, George
G.Kirstein, reiterated the <i>Nation’s </i>policy thus: “This magazine has been
and will continue to be frankly partisan. Our hearts and our columns are on the

action aroused deep reaction from those who agreed with Blanshard’s articles as
well as those who did not agree. It was felt that this was a threat to the
freedom of the press. In a message to William Jansen, Superintendent of New
York schools, Archibald MacLeish, former Librarian of Congress, said: “The ban
on the <i>Nation </i>is not only the most arrogant and contemptuous of the
recent challenges to the American principle of freedom of mind and freedom of
expression, but also the most dangerous. It threatens not only the liberal
press but the whole press, and not only the whole press but the educational
system of the country and even its library system...The pretext that
Blanshard’s articles were an attack on religion is palpable nonsense...”<sup>

Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt joined the committee as a member. One hundred and seven
prominent names signed “an appeal to reason and conscience” in which they
opined that “If the suppression of the <i>Nation</i>...is allowed to
stand...the consequences to the schools, to the press, and to the vitality of
American freedom may well be very serious indeed”.<sup>12</sup> An art auction
was conducted to raise money for lifting the <i>Nation </i>ban. Contributions
from all parts of the country were sent for the same purpose. It is interesting
to note what a contributor from West Virginia wrote in response to an appeal
for funds. “I read the <i>Nation</i>”<i> </i>he said, “faithfully each week,
and rarely agree with anything you say. But I thoroughly enjoy it just the
same...I enclose my cheque to be used in any way you see fit, to make it
possible to continue publishing articles that I cannot agree with.”<sup> 13</sup>

Kirchwey justified the <i>Nation’s</i> action thus: “Every journal with a sense
of editorial responsibility exercises discretion in accepting and rejecting
letters for publication. Custom and common sense dictate certain criteria which
are used in passing on letters as well as articles, and among these none is
more universally recognized than the condition that such material must not be
libellous or defamatory.”<sup>14</sup> She went on to say that the accusation
that the <i>Nation</i> is committed to the service of the Soviet government
(which in essence is the comment of the critic) is the most damaging “in a time
like the present”. This argument was not convincing even to those who were
closely associated with the <i>Nation</i>. Reinhold Niebuhr and Robert Bendiner
resigned from the <i>Nation</i> expressing their disapproval of this policy.
Commenting on their resignation, <i>Time </i>observed that “it was apparent
that most liberals seemed to think a liberal publication should be a forum
where differences of political opinion could be aired and debated, and that a
court of law was only for people who have no other way to talk back”.<sup> 15</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

highly allergic to special pleading, propaganda, and double-talk. The <i>Nation</i>

‘idea’ magazines require public support for their survival, they seem to be in
the same plight as the other magazines which are constantly appealing for
public patronage and enlarged audiences. The survival of an idea magazine
depends also on the existence of a group of persons sufficiently large and
capable of providing the necessary financial help. Therefore, not all groups
can have the means of publishing their ideologies. But, in so far as the ‘idea’
magazines constantly appeal to the intelligentia and contain the correspondence
of the egg-heads, it is to be hoped that, whatever may be the ideological base
of such a magazine, it will still serve the greatly needed function of free and
public discussion of contemporary political and literary problems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
characteristic of the ‘idea’ magazine is the supreme importance of the editor for
its success. It is Godkin, Villard and Kirchwey who made the <i>Nation </i>what
it was. And it is Croly who shaped the <i>New Republic. </i>In the periods when
no such outstanding persons were there to edit, both the <i>Nation </i>and the <i>New
Republic </i>suffered. It is true of ‘idea’ magazines alone, it would seem,
that the personality of the editor is reflected in their pages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from the frequent financial embarrassments to which they are subject and the
extremely modest number of persons to whom they have direct appeal, ‘idea’
magazines seem to suffer from one more limitation. Since they always have an
axe to grind and a philosophy to uphold, their treatment of problems may be
coloured, and their readers be misled rather than informed. This, however, does
not seem to be a serious problem, since those who read these magazines are
‘intellectuals’ who are presumably competent to take the content on its merits.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
distinct feature of the ‘idea’ magazine is the contributors’ attitude to it.
They tend to identify themselves with the magazine, and remain faithful to it
sometimes all their lives. The reason for this is simple. The main attraction
for one who writes in an ‘idea’ magazine is his faith in the cause, and this is
more potent and effective than any other inducement. The best and most
controversial minds have found expression in the columns of the <i>Nation </i>and
the <i>New Republic. </i>The distinguished galaxy of men who were associated
with these magazines during their long lives, joined them, invited and
uninvited, because they believed in the principles for which the </span><span

stood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
seem to be some significant differences between what has been said of the <i>Nation
</i>and the <i>New Republic </i>and those that are edited for mass circulation.
The ‘idea’ magazines tend to <i>challenge </i>the reader, while the mass
circulation magazines seek to <i>conform. </i>The former are <i>idea-centered </i>while
the latter are <i>reader-centered. </i>The ‘idea’ magazines seek to <i>influence
</i>public opinion; the mass magazines try to <i>reflect </i>public opinion.
Because of these differences in approach, the personality factor (of the
editors and contributors) and the prevailing conditions of life and literature
become more and more important as the physical attractiveness, form, and style
become less and less useful for the ‘idea’ magazines. Ont he contrary, physical
attractiveness, readability, and handiness become more and more important while
the role of the editors and the contributors becomes less and less significant
for the mass magazines. Moreover, the ‘idea’ magazines are more in danger of
all kinds of censorship since they challenge the prevailing notions than those
whose objective is to conform to them and to reflect the majority opinion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
influence of such magazines as the <i>Nation </i>and the <i>New Republic </i>through
the years seems fortunately to be far out of proportion to their limited
circulation. Their influence was felt even by those who never heard their
names. As a matter of fact, our culture and civilization have grown up from the
ideas thrown out by a few and understood and appreciated only by a few, but
through them reflected and diffused in all directions to become now an integral
part of our way of life. There can be little doubt that, where ‘idea’ magazines
exist, the climate of political and literary opinion is enormously influenced
by them. The significant ideas advocated by these magazines would be spread,
acknowledged or unacknowledged, by editors of other magazines, by clergymen, by
teachers, and by leaders, and from a hundred points of diffusion and refraction.
That there are no more than a few of such magazines is, indeed, the tragedy of
our times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

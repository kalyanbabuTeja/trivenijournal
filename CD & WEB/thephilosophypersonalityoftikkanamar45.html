mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Tikkana is the, apostle of the Hari-Haranatha cult
and philosophy in the Telugu country. The opening and closing verses of every
canto in the <i>Mahabharata</i>, his masterpiece in Telugu literature,
enunciate the philosophy of the Hari-Haranatha cult. Tikkana was born at a time
when ceremonial religion had taken the place of a real search after the
Absolute Truth, and religious fervour had petrified into fanatical dogmatism.
The contending religions of the time postulated either Siva or Vishnu, or some
other Deity, as the theological head of a divine hierarchy. Tikkana’s
philosophy is in part a reaction against the tendency to an exclusively
anthropomorphic devotion which results from an individual cult of divine
personality, and in part a protest against the excessive emotionalism and
sentimental extravagance of the sectarian Bhakti cults of his days. Tikkana not
only strikes the golden mean and postulates the devotion to Hari-Haranatha but
also evolves a synthesis between the contending philosophies of religious
worship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The theology of the Hari-Hara cult combines the
divine personalities of Vishnu and Siva and speaks of them as one indivisible
entity. In the opening verse of his <i>Mahabharata</i>, Tikkana says: “My
obeisance to the ‘Paratatva’ (Absolute Reality) of Hari-Hara who is Lord Siva
in the form of Lord Vishnu.” The use of the abstract, ‘Para-tatva’ here is
significant. The metaphysics of the Hari-Hara cult describe Him to be the
creator, the supporter, the annihilator of the entire creation, and the bliss
and beatitude that illumines the darkness of” life. He can be worshipped only
through a mind that is completely devoid of ego: He is beyond the compass of
human comprehension. But, in elaborating the theory of devotion, Tikkana freely
borrows all the symbols of ancient Hindu theology. Hari-Hara is represented as
having ‘Vanamala’ (garland) as well as the ‘Bhujangas’ (snakes), the
‘Kaustubha’ (jewel) and the crescent-moon alike. The uninitiated cannot, of
course, apprehend these symbols. But in such a symbolism is common to all
mystics. It is the special vocation of the mystical consciousness, not only to
go on search of the Ultimate Reality, but also to communicate the secrets of
divine experience to other men. Therefore the mystic communion with the
‘incomprehensible and the infinite, must, of necessity, borrow the known
symbolism for its artistic self-expression It is an effort to translate the higher
language of the soul into the homely vernacular of the senses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the introduction to his <i>Mahabharata</i>,
Tikkana narrates his mystic vision of Hari- Haranatha. On the eve of
undertaking the great work, Tikkana tells us he was in a contemplative mood,
meditating over the problem of the dedication. Lord Hari-Hara Himself comes to
Tikkana along with the spirit of Kommana, the father of Tlkkana. Kommana
introduces Lord Hari-Hara and tells him that He himself has come to seek the
dedication of Tikkana’s work. In that moment of self-donation, the voice of
duty come to him from beyond; he obeys the fugitive intimation of the Beyond as
a divine call and becomes conscious of his contact with the Ultimate Reality.
He resolves to dedicate his <i>magnum opus </i>to Lord Hari-Hara as a “means of
emancipation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.” The introduction to his <i>Mahabharata
</i>is an assimilation of divine experience,–a flash of transcendent symbolic
intuition. As a matter of fact, Lord Hari-Hara was already pleased with the
prayer addressed to Him in a Sanskrit <i>sloka</i>, as Kommana tells Tikkana.
This shows that Tikkana was a devotee of Lord Hari-Hara even before he
undertook the translation of the Mahabharata, which he later dedicated to Him.
But in the introduction to <i>Nirvachanottara Ramayana</i>, he tells us that he
was the worshipper of the lotus feet of Lord Siva. Evidently, this spiritual
evolution belongs to the period between the <i>Nirvachanottara Ramayana</i>,
and the <i>Mahabharata </i>where he narrates his spiritual vision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To those who develop psycho-sensorial automatism in
these parallels between sense and spirit may present themselves to
consciousness in the theopathetic state. Psychologists tell us that genuine
visionary experiences are not ‘abnormal’ in the pathological sense. They are
indeed entirely normal to the subject who experiences them. The alarm at the
very thought of such experiences arises from our confounding the normal with
the average. No genuine spiritual height can ever be reached on the path of the
average. But the psychologist goes a bit farther and tries to explain that
mystical experiences are, after all, only the objectivisation of ideas already
in the mind. He takes the admission of Tikkana as meditating over the problem
of dedication just before his dream, as a point in his favour; so also the <i>sloka
</i>in praise of Hari-Hara. So the vision represents thoughts and memories
presented in concrete and pictorial form, rather than his soul’s effort to
grasp a message from beyond itself. Mystical experience did not add anything
new and ‘from beyond’ to the poet. Mystics, like other human beings, receive
their knowledge from ordinary rational channels. When it seemed to Tikkana that
an entirely new truth had been revealed through the vision, one of two things
must have happened. Either a forgotten truth was so vividly and forcibly
recalled to the memory as to impress the sense of a new discovery upon the
mind; or, thoughts which had long been shaping through hours of brooding
meditation, but which failed to come to actual birth, were made explicit and
articulate to his mind, which could not rcognise them in that finished form.
But this is a point over which the psychologist has no jurisdiction. In the
words of Ribot, the religious feeling is a fact. Psychology simply analyses and
follows its transformations but it is incompetent in the matter of its
objective value”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the philosophy of Hari-Hara, Tikkana brings out
the ‘Advaita Tatya’. This Advaitism should not be confused with the monism of
the Vedantist or the <i>mayavada </i>of Sankara. The Advaitism here mainly
addresses itself to the enunciation of identity (or the non-difference) of Hari
and Hara, and, consequently, it postulates that the religious Absolute of all
religions is essentially one and the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The philosophy of the <i>Mahabharata</i>, in the
opinion of Tikkana, also seeks to establish the <i>Advaita Dharma</i>, an
Advaita of course different from the monism of the Vedantist. The <i>Mahabharata
</i>philosophy is a reconciliation of the apparent contradictions between the
Vedas and the Puranas. Tikkana says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

must be obeyed implicitly, or whether they are relative truths with a reference
to place, person and time. Such controversies are naturally raised in the
Puranas. The Mahabharata’s solution is that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The idealistic commandments in the Vedas and thus
Upanishads are harmonized with the practical philosophy of the everyday world
in its relation to life. The <i>Mahabharata </i>solves the eternal riddles by
bringing out the harmony between the apparent contradictions of ethical
teaching and practical conduct. Tikkana calls this ‘Dharma Advaita’. He claims
that Krishna Dvaipayana composed the <i>Mahabharata </i>in Sanskrit to
vindicate this truth. We can appreciate Tikkana’s claim when we remember that
the same Krishna Dvaipayana was the first person, according to Indian
tradition, who codified the four Vedas and the Vedic literature by evolving the
shall they are assuming to this day. That is why the <i>Mahabharata </i>is
called the ‘Fifth Veda’. The undertaking of the rendering of the <i>Mahabharata
</i>by Tikkana nearly two hundred years after Nannaya first began the
translation in to Telugu is no mere accident. The philosophy of the <i>Mahabharata
</i>synchronised with his own philosophy. It is not because there were no poets
in Telugu in the long span of two hundred years, who could finish the <i>Mahabharata
</i>that it lay unfinished. Many poets like Panditharadhya, Nannechoda, Palkuriki
Somanaradhya flourished during this period. But all of them were Saivites and
belonged to an entirely different religious persuasion, and a different school
of thought in literature. The Saiva religion and philosophy revolutionized all
the provinces of human thought and action during the eleventh and twelfth
centuries of the Christian era in the Andhra country. Saiva literature was the
first romantic movement in Telugu literature. The Saiva poets started a popular
literary movement, as distinct from the classical movement of the Nannaya age. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Here too Tikkana not only struck the golden mean
between the two schools of literary thought but also headed a new literary
renaissance. <i>Dasakumara Charitra </i>was dedicated to him. Marana, the
author of <i>Markandeya purana</i>, was his own disciple. In the introduction
to <i>Nirvachanottara Ramayana</i>, he says of himself:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We know that he was at this time the minister to
King Manuma Siddhi, to whom he dedicated his Ramayana. The introduction to <i>Dasakumara
Charitra </i>throws real light over the personality of Tikkana, as it is a
contemporary account by a poet, which knows him intimately. The Minister-poet
enunciates the principles of universal literature, and does not hesitate to
criticise the lapses and the anachronisms in the works of other poets. But the
personality of Tikkana has undergone a sublime change in the <i>Mahabharata</i>.
The ‘Somayaji’ perhaps was no more the imperious minister: He says: “I shall
translate the <i>Mahabharata </i>according to my lights, with the fervent hope
of emancipation from the cycle of births and rebirths.” We have already seen
how the <i>Mahabharata </i>is a self-surrender at the lotus feet of Lord Hari-Hara.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Literature has always a social reference. The works
of Tikkana and other poets of his times exhort the Andhra race to be
well-versed in the arts of both war and peace. <i>Dasakumara Charitra </i>is
the story of the adventures of ten princes. <i>Markandeya Purana </i>is full of
speculative discourses on the nature of the soul and life after death. <i>Charu-charya
</i>is a poetic exhortation to make life healthy and beautiful. The <i>Nitisara
Muktavali </i>is a code of moral conduct expressed in Vigorous aphorisms. <i>Vijnaneswariya
</i>is treatise on Hindu Law By Ketana, perhaps compiled at the encouragement
of his minister-friend Tikkana. We find the impress of Tikkana’s personality
and genius in all the literary productions of his time, as we find all these
provinces of human thought covered by the cyclopsedic range of the <i>Mahabharata</i>.
Thus art, philosophy and religion, ethics, sociology and science, were
developed in harmonious co-operation with one another. Tikkana, as the author
of the <i>Mahabharata</i>, represents the spirit of his times. Tikkana and his
contemporaries laid the cultural foundations of the future empire of
Vijayanagara. “Tikkana is the forerunner of Vidyaranya by a century.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

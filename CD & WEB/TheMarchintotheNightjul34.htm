</B></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">BY NOLINI KANTA GUPTA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Endless, endless labours the way:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its meanderings seem always to come back near to the same old familiar spot.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have traveled through long ages and countless lives,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through immemorial vistas of Time, as though through all the length of Eternity– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And yet see we not the same old sun jogging up and down</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between its same old prison bars?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lone luminaries afar that appear so close to the very heart of the Great Mystery,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twinkle and blink as inconsciently as ever;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cold and barren face of the moon stares as bland and stupid as its wont;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same old shadow still lingers at our feet and entangles them inexorably;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And the eternal viper remains coiled fast into the darkness of our entrails….. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The march of aeons has brought us none the nearer to Light or Deliverance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ah, Soul, we have indeed progressed into obscurity,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Into a deeper and deeper gloom have we entered– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet who is this intrepid voyager that has dared the other Unknown, the nether profundities?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is thou, O my Soul, it is the Light itself, the beacon from above!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For whither else could progress lie?– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Towards Light and more Light?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the Soul is All-Light and needs no illumination;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is Darkness that yearns for the Light</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so the Soul has descended in answer</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Into the gloom– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gloom stretches interminable,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The abyss seems fathomless,– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only to the spirit that ventures with its own lantern;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But my Soul is never alone–the Mother of Light upbears it– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A cataract of limitless blaze swirls behind</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And presses it forward in and through the gloom</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will rollout and melt,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sooner perhaps than one may believe,– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Soul and gloom and all– </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Right on the other side</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Into the free and infinite and sheer translucence.</P>

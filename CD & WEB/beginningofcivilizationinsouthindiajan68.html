style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
‘civilization’ one normally understands a refined culture, state, society or
individual. Originally this word was applied by Greeks to foreigners who were
rude, uncultured and above all illiterate, not knowing the art of writing. From
this <span class=SpellE><i>stricto</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>sensu</span>,
</i>or original meaning, archaeologists, anthropologists and culture-historians
have slightly deviated. These scholars use the word ‘civilization’ primarily to
define a stage in the material and cultural development of man, when man had
emerged from the stage of food-collection (by hunting, fishing and gathering
wild fruits and edible plants and roots) and had settled down at one place and
acquired the art of agriculture, domestication of animals, making of pottery,
houses–some of them monumental like temples, fortifications (even palaces)–and
above all learned the art of writing. The last–knowledge of writing or
literacy–is regarded (was regarded until recently) as one of the fundamental
requirements which helped a culture-<span class=GramE>historian</span> to
distinguish between various kinds of cultures discovered by archaeologists or
described in ancient literatures of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the Vedic and the earliest Greek ways of life or society for all their
richness–heroic deeds and descriptions of gods and goddesses–were regarded as
barbarous and not civilized. Even now the UNESCO <i>History of Civilization </i>following
the anthropological definition of civilization describes the Vedic period in
our history as barbarous or semi-barbarous. As opposed to this, the Indus or
the <span class=SpellE>Harappan</span> Culture is called the <st1:place w:st="on">Indus</st1:place>
civilization, because here for the first time we see not only a well-organized
society, but monumental buildings and the first traces of writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one should realize that there are intermediate stages between pre-literate and

material and cultural development of man. It is these that we have to take into
consideration for understanding the beginning of civilization in <st1:place

India is not confined to the extreme south, at present included in the district
of <span class=SpellE>Tirunelveli</span> or the country included in <span

I would include all that country in South India which is geologically the
oldest part in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and in the world. This is the area which extends from <span class=SpellE>Raichur</span>
in the north and terminates somewhere at <span class=SpellE>Rameswaram</span>;
on the east and the west the coastal tracts are comparatively recent
(geologically). This vast region is of Course divisible geologically into two
or three further sub-zones. But this is not materially important to us. What
concerns us most are the various stages which we can discern in this vast area
beginning from the very earliest stage when man was a hunter and then advanced
progressively to the stage when he began to live in permanent houses,
domesticated animals, had pots and pans and had taken the first conscious step
in agriculture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

earliest stage is seen not only in and around <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>
in the district of <span class=SpellE>Chingleput</span>, where the first tools
of man were found, but in almost all the districts of Andhra and the eastern
districts of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>
and the northern districts of <span class=SpellE>Tamilnad</span>, excluding the
far south. In all these areas, we have got large, crude stone tools, called <span
class=SpellE>handaxes</span> and cleavers by archeologists. Whatever be the
name of these tools, there is no doubt that with these heavy tools man could
perform some of the most elementary functions and eke out a living. He could
cut trees, dig out <span class=GramE>roots,</span> and skin and chop the
animals he hunted. Unfortunately, we have no evidence so far of the animals he <span
class=GramE>hunted at</span> this time nor of the trees he felled and the
forests in which he lived. So this earliest stage of man remains comparatively
very, very dim for us. At the most we can say that the climate in South India
at that time was far more humid than it is today, so that all the rivers
carried huge boulders in the river bed and these were deposited all along their
bed when their carrying power was reduced. In <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>
or around <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>,
the climate </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was far more humid earlier, because here we have
got deposits called <span class=SpellE>laterite</span>. These normally form
when the rainfall is over 100 inches, and is followed by a long, dry period. If
we are allowed to extrapolate the evidence from Maharashtra, parts of Andhra,
U. P., West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, we may say that at this time large
tusked elephant, wild ox and three-toed horse and other animals should have
been living in South India, and these must have provided food to man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in many districts of Andhra and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>,
one might also say that the population of early man at this time was fairly
thick and well distributed. Man was spread out along the banks of smaller and
larger rivers and was found in large numbers near foothills where raw material
was easily available. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

at <span class=SpellE>Giddalur</span>, District <span class=SpellE>Kurnool</span>,
at <span class=SpellE>Angawadi</span>, District <span class=SpellE>Bijapur</span>,
for instance, we find tools which are comparatively light and beautifully
finished showing that this man, though a hunter-fisher, had developed an
artistic sense. And possibly the tools which are sharp all round must have been
used in different ways in hunting. At least all over <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place> as well as in the north we see a definite development in the
man’s tools which must be the result of his mental development. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
happened to this man is unknown. So far no physical remains of this early man
have been found anywhere in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
But we do know that all over <st1:place w:st="on">South India</st1:place>
beginning with <span class=SpellE>Attirampakkam</span> in the south and
extending up to <span class=SpellE>Bijapur</span> in the north, these heavy but
finely made tools were given up by man. In <span class=SpellE>Bijapur</span>
and in many parts of Andhra, the man had also given up the use of quartzite. He
now preferred still better, fine-grained rocks. His tools and weapons are much
smaller and may have provided him with spear-heads, lance-heads, and the
variety of scrapers used for smoothing the wooden and bone shafts of several
other tools and the weapons. It must be <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span>
that even this second Stone Age man was still a hunter. But the methods by
which he hunted must have changed a great deal. Since his tools were small, he
could carry these tools into the interior where raw material was not easily
available. Thus a much larger area than before was penetrated by man. We may
call this stage as advanced hunting and food collecting stage. No remains of
contemporary animals have been found. The earlier species continued to live. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>Third Stage </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man who followed is documented from excavations at <span class=SpellE>Attirampakkam</span>,
from the <span class=SpellE>Rallakalava</span> near <span class=SpellE>Renigunta</span>,
District <span class=SpellE>Chittoor</span> and from several sites in <span
class=SpellE>Kurnool</span> District. Instead of large number of points and
several kinds of scrapers we get thin, long flakes called blades by
archaeologists. Among these blades we notice tools which could have been used
for no other purpose than for engraving on wood and bone. Even those who are
not archaeologists when they see these delicate tools will be reminded of our
present steel chisels and other tools used by carpenters and other craftsmen.
So this stage is a definite advance on the two previous stages of man. Still we
have to call this man a food-<span class=GramE>collector,</span> however
advanced he may be in the production of stone tools. Unfortunately not much is
known of this man, <span class=GramE>But</span> further information can be had
if more systematic work is carried out. The most important sites from my point
of view are the caves around Madras and in <span class=SpellE>Kurnool</span>
District where some 60 years ago, Robert Bruce Foote had found not only such
fine tools, but even artistic work in bone which he then compared with similar
work discovered at that time in the caves of France and called Upper <span
class=SpellE>Palaeolithic</span> by archaeologists. Unfortunately all the
collections made by Foote have been lost, but I am quite sure that if we make a
genuine attempt with all the knowledge we have got of excavations today then
the caves in <st1:City w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Kurnool</span></st1:City>
and possibly in <span class=SpellE>Chittoor</span> and in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

this advanced hunting stage of man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
this advanced stage, we find that man had changed again. His tools have become
still smaller. These no doubt had developed from the very fine blades which we
witness on the <span class=SpellE>Rallakalava</span> and at <span class=SpellE>Attirampakkam</span>
and at many sites in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Kurnool</span></st1:place></st1:City>. The tools and weapons are
so small that we call them <span class=SpellE>microliths</span> (small stone
implements). Though small, still these are the precursors of our modern tools
and weapons in copper, bronze and iron because for the first time that man has
discovered the principle of compound tool, He hafted the tools in a bone or a
wood as teeth (though unfortunately we have not yet secured from any site in
India these evidences, though these <span class=SpellE>denticulated</span>
tools have been found in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Europe). Hence in
some Indian languages these iron sickles are called “toothed tools”, though
they have no teeth now. But these local “vulgar” names undoubtedly show the
ancestry of these iron sickles. Until very recently these small tools, called <span
class=SpellE>microliths</span>, were found on the surface. But now at <span
class=SpellE>Sangankal</span> near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Bellary</span></st1:place></st1:City> these have been found
sandwiched between the layers containing tools of the late Early Stone Age or
Middle Stone Age and tools of the New Stone Age when man had definitely taken
to agriculture and domestication of animals. So this transitional stage called
“Mesolithic” is extremely important and comparatively very well dated now. The
evidence for this is also found in the fossil sand-dunes in the far south at <span
class=SpellE>Tirunelveli</span>. We can date it provisionally to 4,000 B. C. or
earlier. The small tools were used for various purposes: for hunting the
animals with a bow and an arrow; as harpoons for fishing, and also used as
sickle-teeth for very primitive harvesting, cutting the stalks naturally
growing tall grasses. Thus these small tools do indicate a very great step
taken by man towards what is called economic self-sufficiency. He was not
completely dependent on animal food or wild plants, edible fruits and things
like that. He could collect wild grass by reaping and thus the first foundation
of agriculture was laid. These tools have been found everywhere in South India
in the red soil as my travel from Hyderabad in the north to south has shown and
also one can use the reports of other field workers. Thus this is a very
widespread state of man very well documented from all over <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place>. Unfortunately so little work has been done by way of
excavation that we are not able to get the conditions or environment in which
man lived. In some places like <span class=SpellE>Sangankal</span>, it appears
that the climate was comparatively more humid than it is today or before this
man lived, whereas the same thing is indicated by the fossil sand-dunes at <span
class=SpellE>Tirunelveli</span>. But these are speculations which need to be
put on a much more <span class=GramE>firmer</span> foundation by a combined
team of archaeologists and workers from other disciplines, just as we have done
at the <span class=SpellE>Deccan</span> <span class=SpellE>Collegc</span> with

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far I have been merely describing to you the four stages by which man had
arrived at the beginning of agriculture, but had not yet taken the first steps
in agriculture. When I say this I mean conscious attempt at <span class=SpellE>ploughing</span>
the land or preparing the land for sowing the seeds and for harvesting and also
water the land with some kind of irrigation. This we witness very well in the
eastern districts of <st1:City w:st="on">Mysore</st1:City> and the western
districts of Andhra and the northern districts of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. The first steps–conscious steps
towards civilization were taken on the granite hills in <st1:place w:st="on">South
 India</st1:place>. These hills look picturesque and foreboding. They look like
castles from a distance; huge boulders on their periphery and as one goes
nearer one sees huge boulders perched on one another as if placed by man and
some about to fall at any moment. But these are there for the last 5,000 years
and more and if one takes the trouble of climbing these hills which are 300 to
600 ft. high (as I have done in the districts of <span class=SpellE>Raichur</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Bellary</span> and North <span class=SpellE>Arcot</span> and
<span class=SpellE>Chitaldurg</span>), then one finds after climbing up a
beautifully enclosed area, yet fairly flat. These flat areas were inhabited by
man around 2,000 B. C. These are the earliest settlements of man. Until now man
moved from place to place. He was a hunter and so went after the animals he hunted.
But now he had chosen to remain at one place. As soon as man took this first
step of settling down he was in need of houses and of pots and pans in which he
could store his food as well as the water he collected either from some streams
at a distance or from the place nearby. We have also Some evidence from our
excavations at <span class=SpellE>Tekkalkota</span>, District <span
class=SpellE>Bellary</span> and at <span class=SpellE>Hallur</span>, District
Dharwar and at <span class=SpellE>Palavoy</span>, District <span class=SpellE>Anantapur</span>,
that this man cultivated <span class=SpellE>Hurali</span> (Kan.), <span
class=SpellE>Ulavalu</span> (Tel.), <span class=SpellE>Kollu</span> (Tam.) or <span
class=SpellE>Kulthi</span> (Hindi) and <span class=SpellE>ragi</span> (<span
class=SpellE>horsegram</span> and finger millet respectively): two of the most
staple items of food of the agriculturists in South India. Both <span
class=SpellE><i>ragi</i></span><i> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>kollu</i></span><i>
</i>flourish on sandy, <span class=SpellE>lateritic</span>, even hilly areas.
And it is perhaps not a coincidence that the areas of the maximum concentration
of the <span class=SpellE>neolithic</span> and megalithic sites overlap with
that of <span class=SpellE><i>ragi</i></span><i> </i>and <span class=SpellE><i>kollu</i></span><i>.
</i>It is interesting to note that both these grains as well as <span
class=SpellE>greengram</span> later occur at <span class=SpellE>Paiyampali</span>,
North <span class=SpellE>Arcot</span> District <i>(I. A. R., </i>1964, p. 38). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
people besides making use of natural rock-shelters on these hills built houses,
indeed small huts, which were usually round, supported by round wooden posts
(about 2 to 3 ft. in diameter). These huts were covered with split bamboo
screen, and occasionally the walls were partly or wholly plastered with clay
mixed with cow-dung. The roofs were presumably conical and invariably thatched.
Some of these huts have 15 ft. (about 5 <span class=SpellE>metres</span>) in
width. The floors were <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> by placing
flat-topped stones and then bonded with clay and finally plastered with lime.
The minimum furniture inside these huts consisted of a fire place made of three
stones or as at <span class=SpellE>Hallur</span> of a small pit sunk into the
floor, and a storage jar which stood on three terracotta legs. Within the empty
space (i.e., the base of the storage jar and the floor) were kept polished
stone axes, and sling stones. At a rough estimate at least 5 to 6 people could
live in these small round huts (as <span class=SpellE>Boyas</span> do today)
and we find that in a terrace at <span class=SpellE>Sangankal</span> or at <span
class=SpellE>Tekkalkota</span> there would be at least 10 to 15 such round
huts. From this we can say that a small community of 80 to 100 people lived on
each terrace and on a hill like <span class=SpellE>Tekkalkota</span>, where
there are no less than 20 such terraces, could accommodate a population of
about 20 X 100 (2,000) people at the minimum. There are numerous such hills

I say that these people lived on these hills, it means that there was a
society. Groups of people came together to build such houses and at <span
class=SpellE>Tekkalkota</span> we have got definite evidence that they moved
large stones and enclosed the periphery of the hills where there were no
natural stones affording such privacy, and these stones were so heavy that they
could be moved by not less than 5 to 10 people, on the principle of inclined
plane. One may also see, paths abound with stone avenues and artificial
irrigation systems for leading rain water from one terrace to another. That
means there was planning and organization. The first stage of man towards
civilization was reached. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

things are also suggestive. For instance, you have to look at their pottery. It
is not primitive, but on the contrary highly sophisticated. There are vessels
which resemble our tea pots. Other vessels looked like ice-cream cups and
wine-cups because they have got a permanent pedestal or foot and then there are
vessels with 4 to 5 pinched openings. Huge storage jars were also found. Thus we
find that these early settlers on the hills and foot-hills had developed a way
of life which leads us to<i> </i>the next stage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that man had to live at one place so that these beautiful tools could be made.
It takes at least a week or a fortnight to grind these tools and for grinding
they had to have huge concave or boat-shaped grinding Stones. These are found

sense of organisation as well as community life and their thought for the next
life is again indicated by the way they disposed off the dead. We find that
these people buried the dead where they lived in pits in an extended posture.
Slightly later the body was kept in pots either horizontally or vertically and
very often several pots were placed inside these pots. These are the precursors
of coffins of the later period. From the evidence at <span class=SpellE>Tekkalkota</span>,
and <span class=SpellE>Brahmagiri</span> and <span class=SpellE>Piklihal</span>,
one might infer that bodies were possibly exposed and when they were

slabs. The very conception of burying the dead in such structures and the

the excavations at <span class=SpellE>Brahmagiri</span>, it was supposed that
this great megalithic, culture which has spread all over South India,
practically in all the districts of Andhra, Mysore and Madras, except perhaps
the coastal districts on the east and the west, was not older than 250 B.C. Sir
Mortimer Wheeler thought that this megalithic people who possessed iron
weapons–swords and spears–and other iron tools must have ousted the <span

wrong. In fact evidence is accumulating that these megalithic cultures are at

at <span class=SpellE>Terdal</span> in the <span class=SpellE>Bijapur</span>

one question remains. Did this people know writing? If they did, then they <span
class=SpellE>fulfil</span> all the requirements of civilization as defined by
archaeologists and anthropologists. Here unfortunately the evidence is very <span
class=SpellE>very</span> meagre or almost nil. It has been supposed by <span
class=SpellE>Furer-Haimendorf</span> that since the area of the megalithic
culture overlapped with that of the distribution of the present Dravidian
languages. Dravidian was introduced by the megalithic people. And independently
of Professor <span class=SpellE>Haimendorf</span> I came to the conclusion when
I saw the <span class=SpellE>Asokan</span> edicts at <span class=SpellE>Maski</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Brahmagiri</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kapbal</span> that
these edicts could be addressed only to people who could read and write–that is
the megalith builders–and not to their predecessors, <i>viz., </i>the <span
class=SpellE>Meolithic</span> pastoralists. Further the evidence from <span
class=SpellE>Arikamedu</span>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pondicherry</st1:place></st1:City>
shows that the early <span class=SpellE>Dravidi</span> script was allied to <span
class=SpellE>Brahmi</span>, and more than 2,000 years ago the <span
class=SpellE>Tamilians</span> could read what was written by the northerners,
and the northerners could read what their brethren wrote in the south. This is
quite probable, though as pointed out by the late Prof. Gordon Childe, we have
not got that proof for the migration of the Dravidian from Finno-Ugrian to <st1:place
w:st="on">South India</st1:place> as we have got for the Aryan languages.
Consequently, according to the present data, the South Indian megaliths though
in one essential feature identical with the Western European, <i>viz., </i>both
possess the porthole <span class=GramE>cist,</span> still they have been
separated spatially as well as in time. The European megaliths are at least
2,000 B. C. whereas even according to our new dating, we cannot place the South
Indian megaliths before 700 or 900 B. C. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

however, I would place before you the new evidence that has been found by the
discovery of stone cists by <span class=SpellE>Fairservis</span> in Eastern Las
<span class=SpellE>Bela</span> in <span class=SpellE>Baluchistan</span>, <st1:place
w:st="on">West Pakistan</st1:place>. These cists are generally oriented
east-west and they are made of upright slabs standing up to 3 ft in height.
There is a tendency for these cists to be clustered in groups on tops of
ridges. Occasionally the cists have a capstone and in one case Dr. Sherman
Minton found a porthole in one of the upright slabs. Unfortunately, none of
these <span class=SpellE>Sind-Baluchistan</span> megaliths have been excavated.
But we have evidence now, according to <span class=SpellE>Fairservis</span>, to
reaffirm a rather extensive megalithic complex in the eastern portion of the
Indo-Iranian border lands. So it is possible that the great megalithic builders
of South India were partly indigenous and partly western-oriented, because a
study of the skulls showed a mixture of the <st1:place w:st="on">Mediterranean</st1:place>
and Proto-<span class=SpellE>Austroloid</span> traits, like the <span
class=SpellE>Veddid</span> types. This is said to be a feature of the
present-day Dravidian-speakers. Thus the distant ancestors of these people
seemed to have introduced iron into South India quite separately from the
people who introduced iron in northern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

survey of the existing evidence shows that until about 4,000 years ago the
cultural development in South India did not materially differ from that of the
rest of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Then just as a unique civilization grew up in the Indus Valley, taking
advantage of the natural factors, in the same way South India chalked out its
own lines of development, according to<i> </i>its peculiar environment, <i>viz.,
</i>castellated hills, looking down red, rocky plains, occasionally
interspersed with stretches of rich fertile soil. Nature and man thus
effectively combined to give the earliest South Indian cultures their
individuality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

picture is vague and very much incomplete. But it can be amplified only when a
well-organized and “a bit civilized” attempt is made to find out the habitation
sites of the megalithic people as well as the habitation sites of their

to several of these burial monuments. But the way they are referred to, one may
infer that these practices had become old, even remote, and were considerably
affected or modified by contact with the North. Though it is conceivable that
the old burial-grounds continued to remain in use, and the earliest <span
class=SpellE>Chola</span> kings probably buried in pots, while the <span
class=SpellE>Cheras</span> preferred cremation, and the women <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> <i>Sati. </i><span class=GramE>(K. R. Srinivasan,

and <span class=SpellE>Pandyas</span> were established kingdoms in the 3rd
century B. C. is proved beyond doubt by <span class=SpellE>Asokan</span>
edicts. Thus there is little doubt now that <span class=SpellE>megalithism</span>–the
practice of burying in such tombs–arose some centuries before this date. Hence,
archaeology alone might throw more light on this problem. For the moment, we
may present the picture of the beginning of <st1:place w:st="on">South India</st1:place>
in six or seven stages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

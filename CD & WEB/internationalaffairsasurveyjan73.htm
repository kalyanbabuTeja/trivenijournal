<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Following
the Second World War, <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>’s
futile bid to re-occupy its Indo-China possessions was worsted by the
communist-led nationalists of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region>
and the curtain on French colonial rule in this part of the world was wrung
down with the French defeat at <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Dien</span>
 <span class=SpellE>Bien</span> <span class=SpellE>Phu</span></st1:place>. At
the Geneva Conference that followed, it was decided to temporarily partition <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> with
the communists keeping the northern part where their writ had been in force
even by then. The Southern region was to remain separate. As the French began
evacuating, the Americans stepped in. As if yesterday’s French follies became
today’s American novelties, the Americans decided to defend the state of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>
against communism. The American involvement began in June 1953 as Ngo Din <span
class=SpellE>Dien</span> became the first President of South Vietnam. A team of
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>U. </span>S.</st1:country-region>
agents, to engage in “paramilitary operations” and “political psychological
warfare” against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North
  Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>, was sent into the South, even
before the Geneva Agreement was formally signed in June 1953. As international
opposition to the <span class=SpellE>Dien</span> regime got built up and he, with
American blessings, refused to co-operate in the holding of elections
throughout the country as was stipulated by the Geneva Agreement, President
Eisenhower had sent 350 more military personnel as ‘advisers’. By early 1962
the number of these ‘advisers’ rose to 3200 and by the end of that year it
stood at 11,300. The euphemism of advisers was by now dropped. By this time <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
support to the Vietcong in the South had also mounted up. The question whether
the problem was one of a civil war between the American propped regime and the
communists or one of aggression from North Vietnam, was never clear from the
start, and eventually got even more mixed up. The Johnson Administration took a
headlong plunge into a major escalation of its involvement by persuading the
Congress to pass the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which pledged full support for
American forces in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
After this the American President exercised virtually uncontrolled power over
the war in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Shortly thereafter the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
bombing of the North began and American forces in the South increased to
27,000. The following two years witnessed the Greek tragedy of increasing
American commitment with the ostensible purpose of quickly ending communist
aggression and getting themselves out. The process of ‘saving’ <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from communism resulted in savage bombings of the very land and its people with
the result that the entire country now lies desolate. The period was
interspersed with feelers for peace from either side which only ended in mutual
recriminations and bloodier hostilities. By the end of 1966 there were nearly
40,000 <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region> soldiers in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Finally
in 1968 the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region> agreed to open talks in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Paris</st1:City></st1:place> in which the
Government of <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:country-region>
and the Vietcong’s political wing, the Provisional Revolutionary Government,
also took part. In fairness to late President Johnson it must be noted that it
was during the last days of his term that these talks opened in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>, which were later
continued by President Nixon. As the talks took to their tortuous course, the
slaughter in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region>
continued unabated though under what came to be called the Nixon Doctrine,
substantial amounts of American troops started leaving <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
American President’s avowed desire to withdraw from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region>
coupled with his pursuit of detente with <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
prompted fresh negotiations between the Americans and the North Vietnamese
also, at a level higher than the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>
talks. Hanoi came out with a nine-point peace proposal calling for total
American withdrawal, the ouster of <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> regime and
the installation of a coalition government in Saigon and a cease-fire immediately,
thereafter. Even though the Americans did not accept some of these conditions,
this proposal formed the basis for a series of talks between Dr. Kissinger and
Lee <span class=SpellE>Duc</span> <span class=SpellE>Tho</span> of North
Vietnam which ultimately bore fruit in January 1973 in the shape of the Paris
Cease-fire Agreement signed by the U. S. North Vietnam, the South Vietnamese
Government and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a little of the credit for this peace should go to the quiet diplomacy of Henry
Kissinger and Lee <span class=SpellE>Duc</span> <span class=SpellE>Tho</span>.
Their patience in the face of delays, provocations and insults that punctuated
their talks has provided the world with a rare example of civility under
stress. To President Nixon too should go a word of thanks, though not more than
a single cheer is <span class=GramE>due.</span> While he did achieve what his
critics regarded as impossible–that of ending the war without sacrificing the
tenure of the <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> regime in Saigon–he secured this
with a singular lack of grace as was evident from the resumption of savage
bombing in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in December 1972, when the Agreement was almost <span class=SpellE>finalised</span>.
The ostensible purpose of this bombing was to force <st1:City w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City>
to yield more concessions at the conference table but as the final accord does
not reveal any substantial concessions from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:place></st1:City>, the bombing spree of December was
nothing short of a vindictive and punitive venture on President Nixon’s part. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The question of the release of the communist prisoners in South Vietnamese has,
however, is slightly complicated. First, since there is no mention of North Vietnamese
troops in the South, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>North </span>Vietnamese

put in <span class=SpellE>gaol</span> most of the communist neutralists. While
these are not given prisoner-of-war status, the Agreement provides that they
are to be released by arrangement between the two South Vietnamese parties, within
ninety days of the cease-fire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

One of the most intricate balancing tricks the Agreement accomplished is with regard
to the future of the state of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">South
  Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place> itself. In reiterating in its very
first article that the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Vietnam as <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> by the 1954 <span class=SpellE>Gene.va</span>
Agreements on Vietnam would be respected by all, the present Agreement clearly
envisages the unification of the two Vietnams. But, pending this, the accord
guarantees the integrity and independence of the two <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnams</st1:place></st1:country-region> by providing that the
military demarcation line between the two entities at the 17th Parallel (though
<span class=SpellE>recognised</span> as provisional) be respected by all. There
is thus a delicate compromise between the short term and long term objectives
of ensuring <st1:country-region w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:country-region>’s
continuation and the eventual unification of the two <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnams</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The Americans claim that <st1:City
w:st="on">Hanoi</st1:City>’s willingness to respect the independence of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>
constitutes a major political victory to <span class=GramE>themselves</span>.

there are the two joint military commissions–the four-power joint military
commission and the two-power joint military commission. The former comprises
representatives of all signatories and its task is to implement the provisions
of the agreement covering troop withdrawals and the dismantling of bases, the
observance of cease-fire and the exchange of prisoners. This body is to be
wound up after the troop withdrawals are completed in sixty days from January
27. The latter is formed by the representatives of the South Vietnamese
Government and the Provisional Revolutionary Government. Its responsibility is
to maintain the cease-fire after the four-party commission gets disbanded. Its
functions also include: the fixing of the positions of the Vietnamese armed
forces in the South at the time of the cease-fire, the determining of areas
controlled by each side, and arranging the exchange of civilian prisoners in
the South. Decisions of the two commissions are to be made on the unanimity
principle and cases of disagreement are to be referred to the International
Commission of Control and Supervision comprising the representatives of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Poland</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hungary</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
implementation of the cease-fire throughout <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region>,
the withdrawal of <st1:country-region w:st="on">U. S.</st1:country-region>
troops, the return of war prisoners and civilian internees and the arranging of
general elections in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> are the important functions that the
Commission is to perform. The Commission is <span class=SpellE>modelled</span>
on the lines of the International Commission that worked under the Geneva
Agreements of 1953 with <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Poland</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> as its
members. The present Commission excludes <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
adding <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hungary</st1:place></st1:country-region>
instead. Learning from the experience of the previous Commission, the Agreement
provides that the Commission should have a sizable force of its own drawn from
various States. It is also empowered to work through control teams to be
located wherever the Commission feels it necessary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Conference should meet within a month of the signing of the agreement to “acknowledge
the signing of the agreements, to guarantee the ending of war, the maintenance
of peace in Vietnam, the respect of the Vietnamese people’s fundamental and
national rights and the South Vietnamese people’s right to self-determination
and to contribute and guarantee peace in Indo-china.” The idea is to endow the agreement
with greater legitimacy and to involve the great Powers and the U. N. in the
task of maintaining peace in the area. This Conference was duly held in
February in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>
and it passed a Declaration endorsing the Paris Agreement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fighting has been going on between communist insurgents and non-communist

Vietnamese have admitted the presence of their troops and that they agree to
withdraw these. The old International Control Commission of <st1:country-region

The significant fact is that there is no corresponding undertaking on <st1:City

the very legality of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
intervention. It should be remembered that since 1953 the American intervention
was based on the premise of protecting the territorial integrity of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
not merely from internal rebellion but from aggression from the North. <i>The

stated that a part of this force is likely to remain for a long time when he
said that the North Vietnamese forces in South “should over a period of time be

except that President <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> is not displaced, the
American victory on the issue of the <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> regime is
only a little more than technical. The cease-fire pact specifically envisages
the formation of a broad-based political regime–a National Council of
Reconciliation and Concord–consisting of all the three segments: the present
regime, the PRG and the neutral sections of the South Vietnamese public. This
Council is nothing short of a coalition government which <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Concord</st1:place></st1:City> as a
coalition. In fact one of the so-called concessions that America extracted from
Hanoi relates to the fact that whereas the Draft Agreement of October 1972
referred to a three-party administrative structure to be set up in the South
after the cease-fire, the phrase <i>administrative structure </i>is omitted
from the final accord of January 1973 since in Vietnamese translation the
phrase suggested a disguised coalition government. This is perhaps no more than

very remote prospect.</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>”</span>
Thus, given nearly a quarter century of bitterness and hostility between the
Vietnamese, words like reconciliation and concord seem mere rhetoric. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

implementation of the cease-fire itself remained a thorny problem. The South
Vietnamese and Americans are already alleging that thousands of troops and
hundreds of tanks are still infiltrating from the North to the Vietcong hands.
The Vietcong on its part accuses that Americans are still operating in the
guise of civilian advisers. The scale of fighting between the <span
class=SpellE>Thieu</span> forces and the communists has not abated at all.
Since the ceasefire in January more than 18,000 deaths and more than 40,000
rounds of artillery firings a day are reported. Paradoxically enough, the
long-term goal of democratic elections in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> itself puts a premium
on a desperate scramble for control over as much of South Vietnamese territory
as possible. The point is that nothing effective exists to compel the two South
Vietnamese parties to seriously try for reconciliation and eschew the
temptation to settle scores now that foreign troops have withdrawn. The
four-power joint military commission has not been wound up and the task of
facilitating the observance of cease-fire between the two parties in the South,
the delimitation of areas in effective control of the parties and the starting
of talks on the future political set up are to be discharged by bilateral
negotiations between the two sides. If the cease-fire implementation is itself
so precarious, the prospect for an agreement over the proposed National
Committee of Reconciliation which is to be <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
by the end of April seems remote indeed. Yet the consolation is that
representatives of the <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> regime and of the
Provisional Revolutionary Govt. have started negotiations in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

International Commission of Control and Supervision can only supervise and
identify the defaulters but has not much of power to enforce things. Under these
conditions a quick political settlement is out of the question. Yet too much of
pessimism is also unwarranted. While cease-fire violations may increase,
neither side can afford to ignore international opinion for ever. It is in this
context that the work of the ICCS becomes crucial. Its supervisory and
reporting roles constitute the levers that influence, even if only marginally,
the <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> of the two parties. There is any amount
of speculation as to what the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">U.
  S.</st1:country-region></st1:place> would do if the Vietcong do not behave by
keeping to the Agreement. A return of American troops is ruled out. But large
scale bombing of communist strong-holds and of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> might in all
probability be resumed. If this happens the situation will be back where it
was, if not worse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

advice for restraint. The fact that both <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> stood aside as
dumb spectators when <st1:country-region w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region>
was pounded by the Americans in December (and that at a time when a cease-fire

volumes of the impatience of these communist powers to get the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> problem
out of their ways. It is also on record that <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City>

The <span class=SpellE>Thieu</span> regime on its part knows it cannot gain a
straight military victory over the communists. Hence, even if the war continues
for sometime in utter disregard of the ninety-day deadline within which
bilateral agreement on the shape of the future governmental set up is required
to be <span class=SpellE>finalised</span>, an eventual agreement is not
unlikely. Subdued optimism on this score is not out of place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Americans have now discarded their dominos theory and no longer believe that <st1:place

nations to her South. This is not because <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> has recently discovered the nicer
qualities of cousin-<span class=SpellE>peking</span>. It has more to do with
the realisation that the latter’s preoccupation with the <st1:place w:st="on">Soviet
 Union</st1:place> rules out aggressive designs elsewhere. This American
reading of the Chinese mind, however, has not convinced some of the South-East
Asian States who feel jittery about American withdrawal from the region. Some
like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Thailand</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region> are seeking assurances that existing
American commitments would be <span class=SpellE>honoured</span>, and the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
anxious to give these guarantees. In addition they say that the Seventh Fleet
will continue to sail in Asian waters as a “ready power for peace.” Others like
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are seeking a more lasting type of security in plans for the <span
class=SpellE>neutralisation</span> of the whole region. Strangely enough, the
level of Sino-American bonhomie has reached such heights that while the former
on its part does no longer regard <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
to be aggressive, the latter in their turn do not seem to mind the presence of
American troops in <st1:place w:st="on">South-East Asia</st1:place>! Recent
reports say that <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> wants
“American armed forces including the Seventh Fleet to stay in the Pacific and
the U. S. Air Force to remain in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The point was made in
vague terms by two Congressional leaders after seeing Mr. Chou last summer, but
it has reportedly been repeated by Chinese diplomats recently.” <span

The result of <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>this </span>mutual trust
might well be that the smaller nations of the region may not have any cause to
fear <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
On balance this subtle Chinese gesture of reassurance would upset Russian
efforts at co-opting some of the South-East Asian nations into its proposed
security system. <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> has
pulled the rug under the Russians’ feet in settling with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region> and now it may make <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
concern for the security fears of South-East Asian nations appear to be one of
Supreme irrelevance. This is not to say that South-East Asia would come to
trust <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
overnight. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:country-region> and

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>With the commencement of the year 1954 it may be
said that a new stage has arrived in the cold war between the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the U.S.S.R., a war which has been the most disturbing factor in the
international world for the last seven years. This stage is marked by a clearer
<span class=SpellE>crystallisation</span> of the policy of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and a definite change in the moves of the U.S.S.R. in consequence of it. This
does not mean that the cold war has come to an end. There is however a clear
sign that the Soviet is revising its tactics in carrying it on and there is
also a prospect of greater recourse to negotiation in <span class=SpellE>realising</span>
the objectives with which the cold war was undertaken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The policy of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> has been undergoing a
gradual evolution during these years. Its objective was primarily the
containment of the U.S.S.R. and Communism within the limits which they attained
by 1947. To <span class=SpellE>realise</span> this objective the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
began to create what its governing circles called “situations of strength”
round the periphery of Soviet Russia. In accomplishing this task it was able to
rally round itself the States in Western Europe bordering the Atlantic Ocean,
States like <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> in Southern Europe and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Turkey</st1:country-region> in <st1:place w:st="on">Western Asia</st1:place>,
which all became members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The
Organisation was primarily a military alliance. Such an organisation was
possible because the States which became its members felt that all of them had
to face a common danger–the danger of Soviet aggression and the forcible
establishment of a Soviet-controlled Communist regime within their borders.
They were therefore willing to accept the economic aid granted to them under
the Marshall Plan, with all the conditions and all the limitations on their
sovereignty which the acceptance of the aid brought along with it. In a sense
they agreed to become the satellites of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, as they found this
the lesser of the two evils. This was in a way a diplomatic triumph for the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Organisation enabled the Americans to secure military bases in all the
countries which were members of the Organisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This was only one of the instruments devised by the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United <span class=GramE>states</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
to gain her objective of containment of the U.S.S.R. At the same time she
forged other instruments also. One of them was to enter into similar alliances
with even non-democratic and totalitarian States like Franco’s <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region> and Tito’s <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Yugoslavia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Another was to re-arm <st1:place
w:st="on">Western Germany</st1:place>, even though the Second World War was
fought to disarm that country. It was the same policy that led her to <span
class=SpellE>organise</span> the Pacific Pact with <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">New Zealand</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This was also at the back of her Peace Treaty with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> which resulted in a move for
Japanese re-armament and re-industrialisation. The move therefore to create
situations of strength meant for all practical purposes the re-armament of as
many countries as possible in the non-Communist world with American aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was this policy that was also responsible for the aid which the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> gave to colonial powers like <st1:country-region
w:st="on">France</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> in their fruitless efforts
to retain their colonial possessions. There was a time when <st1:country-region
w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> herself was a colony of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and
Americans look back with a natural pride to the way in which they fought their
war of independence and won freedom from the British yoke. Americans also are
anxious to be regarded by the world at large as a nation enthusiastic in the
cause of other nations struggling to free themselves from foreign rule. But in
their determination to fight Communism and the U.S.S.R. they have been
instrumental in perpetuating the colonial rule, especially of the French in
Indo-China and in Africa, in spite of the fact that the people in these areas
have been waging an unceasing war in some form or other against their foreign
rulers. The upholding of the French colonial rule has thus become as much a
part of American foreign policy as the organisation of military alliances like
the NATO and the Pacific Pact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only area where the Americans have not succeeded in this part of their task is
the Middle East and South-East Asia. Here </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the new States that
have come into existence in the post-war period–States like Indonesia, Burma,
Ceylon, India etc.–are so very much afraid of losing their hard-won freedom
that they are not prepared to enter into any alliance with the United States or
any other foreign Western power, however economically attractive the terms
offered may be. They have preferred all along to stand on their own legs in
military and political matters, and their acceptance of economic aid is subject
to the condition that no political strings are attached to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is against this background that the real significance of the proposed military
aid by the United States to Pakistan has to be estimated. Like other States in
South Asia and the Middle East. Pakistan has all along been following a policy
of non-alignment with either of the two power blocs. But she has now changed
her attitude and is becoming as much a part of the United States <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> organisation as the countries of the NATO and the
Pacific Pact. This has caused Teal alarm among all the nations of the Middle
East and South-East Asia, and the alarm is natural because of the fact that
such alliance brings the cold war into an area which was so long keeping aloof
from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is here that the <span class=SpellE>crystallisation</span> of American foreign
policy finds its most concrete expression. In spite of the protests of States
like India, America is determined to bring within its sphere of influence as
many South and West Asian States as possible. She is not prepared to abandon
her policy of creating the so-called situations of strength, however disturbing
the process may be to the peace and order of particular regions. She is not
prepared to weigh the long-term consequences of such a policy. In her hurry to
fight the U.S.S.R. and Communism, she is determined to make use of any and
every kind of weapon of a military character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
all these years the <span class=SpellE>defence</span> expenditure of the United
States has been increasing by leaps and bounds. Her stock-pile of Atomic
weapons has enormously mounted up. It is to this massive building up of her
armed strength that President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles referred
in recent weeks as making their country so irresistible that the U.S.S.R. would
have to think twice before resorting to any act of aggression. They and their
military advisers have come forward with the threat that, in case the Chinese
and the North Koreans renew the war in Korea, they would not hesitate to use
the Atomic weapons even though it might result in the killing of eight or ten
millions of people. Thus the danger from the Atom Bomb has come much nearer in
1954 than at any other time during these seven years of the cold war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is in this atmosphere that the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, France,
Soviet Russia and the United States are meeting in Berlin. And people are
asking themselves whether there is any prospect of the relations between the
East and the West becoming less hostile and more friendly as a consequence of
this conference. Before this question is answered it may be necessary and
desirable to know why Soviet Russia has agreed to such a conference. The last
conference of Foreign Ministers of these powers was held in 1949, and though
one or two attempts were subsequently made to convene such a conference they
did not succeed. Even in the present case it appeared till a few days ago that
it may not after all be held, as the parties could not agree on the exact site
in Berlin where it should be held. To the neutral world it looks ridiculous
that there should be so much wrangling about the selection of a site for the
purpose, and it is nothing strange if the neutral nations feel that there is a
real lack of sincerity among the parties who waste so much of their time and
energy on a trifling matter like the selection of the conference site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The main problem that will have to be discussed and
settled at the Berlin Conference is that of Germany. There is the problem of
unifying West and East Germany into a single State and there is even the more
important question of re-arming Germany–whether united or divided. Other
questions that will be brought up for discussion are the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation and the European <span class=SpellE>Defence</span> Community
Organisation which are now integral parts of the American policy of creating
situations of strength. And all these complicated problems are expected to be
solved within three weeks or so–the time fixed for the purpose by Dulles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Western Powers will agree to German unity if it is preceded by free elections.
Free elections imply complete freedom for all parties–Communist and
non-Communist–to <span class=SpellE>organise</span> themselves, to put up
candidates and carry on their election campaign. All this is possible in
Western Germany but not in Eastern Germany where the Communist Party is the
only <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> party. There is no prospect of Soviet
Russia agreeing to any change in this respect. A similar difficulty arises
regarding the re-armament of Germany. Without German re-armament the Americans
feel that it is hopeless to get the man-power needed to defend Western Europe
against Soviet aggression. They know that it is not merely Soviet Russia but
also France that is against the policy of German re-armament, and this has been
the main reason why France has not yet ratified the European <span
class=SpellE>Defence</span> Community Organisation. But in all their recent
speeches American rulers have made it clear that, even if the French do not co-operate
with them in this matter, they are determined on having a re-armed Germany. So
great is the significance they attach to this. There is again the sentiment of
the Germans themselves to be considered. The Parliament of Western Germany is
already discussing measures for the re-arming of the country. Under these
circumstances there can be no agreed basis for a compromise between the East
and the West on this issue. And the West will not be prepared to scrap the NATO
and the EDCO just to please </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soviet Russia. The only thing that the
Western Powers are prepared to offer is a non-aggression pact, but everyone
knows from the history of such pacts in the years following the First World War
that very little value can be attached to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If,
therefore, in spite of dim prospects of success the Soviet has agreed to a
conference at all, it is because the further use of the weapons hitherto used
in the cold war may not yield any results in Western Europe, and they wish to
test the utility of discussions in a conference. Such discussions will at least
have some </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>propaganda value. The neutral public may be made
to feel that the Soviet is anxious to settle problems through negotiation.
Neither party, however, feels confident of any problem being solved as a result
of the conference. The division between West and </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>East Germany is
regarded by all observers as a settled fact for some time to come. If any
change is to happen in this regard or in the position of Soviet satellite
States, it must be consequent on the internal weakness of Soviet Russia and the
strengthening of domestic opposition to the Communist regime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is this psychology that is behind the stalemate in Korea. Both parties are
tired of war. It was considerations of prestige </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that
unnecessarily prolonged the discussions on the terms of the armistice. Each
party was conscious that no great change would result from its terms regarding
the prisoners of War. The Americans were against forcible repatriation from the
beginning and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>they did little to prevent <span class=SpellE>Syngman</span>
<span class=SpellE>Rhee</span> from liberating a large number of them. Even
after the remaining prisoners were placed in the custody of the Neutral
Repatriation Commission over which India presided, no real effort was made to
offer explanations to them as agreed upon in the armistice, with the result
that the Indian Custodian Force decided on restoring them back to the
respective commands. At the time of writing, the Chinese and North Korean
Commands were reported to have refused to take back the few hundred of their
old prisoners but the U.N. Command had no such hesitation. They took back the
twenty-three thousand prisoners of theirs and have decided on restoring them to
civilian status on the 23rd of January–the ninetieth day after the armistice.
Such a restoration is declared to be illegal by the Indian Head of the Neutral
Commission. It is his contention that their fate should be decided by the
Political Conference which is to be convened under the armistice terms. But so
far the two parties to the Korean War have not come to any agreement on the
composition of the Political Conference. There is a complete stalemate on this
subject and the stalemate is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>due to the conviction on either side that
the Political Conference, even if it meets, cannot find a solution to the
Korean question. There is no prospect whatever of Korean unity being brought
about through peaceful negotiation. Both parties have reconciled themselves in
a way to the present division of Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may therefore be concluded that for some years to come the <i>status quo </i>will

Dr. <span class=SpellE>Syngman</span> <span class=SpellE>Rhee</span> that he
would use force to conquer North Korea and bring about Korean unification. It
is, however, doubtful whether the United States would permit him to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is true of Korea is also true of Formosa. The United States is determined on
continuing the giving of aid to Chiang-<span class=SpellE>kai-Shek</span> in
that island and preventing the People’s Government of China from conquering it.
It is equally determined on not <span class=SpellE>recognising</span> that
Government and admitting its nominee to the organs of the U.N.O. This in spite
of the fact that the British are keen on admitting China to U.N.O. In a lecture
which her permanent delegate to the Security Council delivered recently in the
United States, he pleaded for American recognition of the People’s Government
and the admission of its nominee to the U.N.O. He went to the extent of saying
and in this he was echoing the view repeated so often by Pandit Nehru during
the last three years–that such admission would have prevented the Korean War,
and that in the absence of China the U.N.O. cannot claim to be a universal
institution–the one claim on which its whole functioning is based.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his State of the Union message to the Congress, President Eisenhower called for
support for major strategic changes based on a “new military programme
unanimously recommended by the joint Chiefs of Staff”. In it he stressed the
need for increased, inter-allied Atomic co-operation, for man-power economy,
for <span class=SpellE>centralised</span> strategic reserves, for improved
living conditions, for trained military man-power, for an improved <span
class=SpellE>mobilisation</span> base and for improved continental <span
class=SpellE>defence</span>. He also said, “the U. S. military power continues
to grow. This power is for our own <span class=SpellE>defence</span> and to
deter aggression”. This reliance on military power has now become a part and
parcel of American foreign policy and it is this that is responsible for the
move to extend military aid to Pakistan and proposals for similar aid to
individual countries in the Middle </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

has created a strong reaction not only in India but also in several other
countries of Asia. Statesmen at the helm of affairs in them do not like this
growing emphasis on military power, the extension of military aid to Asian
countries, and the possibility of their being threatened by a cold war which
might become a hot war as in Korea. This dislike has given a momentum to an old
idea of Pandit Nehru–the idea of creating what may be called a “neutral no-war
area”. What South Asian countries are in need of is increased economic
production. The enemy they have to face is not the U.S.S.R. or Communism. It is
on the other hand hunger, nakedness, <span class=SpellE>shelterlessness</span>,
ignorance and ill-health. They have to concentrate all their attention on attacking
this enemy and getting rid of him as quickly as possible. This has to receive
priority of attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is therefore a matter of gratification to find this idea of no-war area having
effectively appealed to the Government of Egypt and much more to Sir John <span
class=SpellE>Kotelawala</span>, the Prime Minister of Ceylon. The latter has
invited the Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, Burma and Indonesia to a
South-East Asian Conference to be held in Colombo in<i> </i>April or May, and
there is every prospect of such a conference being held. He made it clear
during his recent visit to Delhi that “with the world divided into<i> </i>two
camps, the emergence of an Asian bloc which both sides may respect and heed,
may well be the only means of averting a third World War”. He also declared
that “the future of Asia cannot be built upon free-give-<span class=SpellE>aways</span>,
foreign gunboat visits, and by the mass concentration of armed strength”. It is
to be hoped that all the nations of South-East Asia and the Middle East will
come together and create a real and strong no-war area, which is necessary not
only for the maintenance of their political freedom and the development of
their economic strength but also for the preservation of world peace. Unity
among the six hundred millions of people in this area </span><span

an asset to international goodwill. Forces are moving in that </span><span

and it ought to be the <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> of all
public-spirited citizens<i> </i>of these countries to strengthen those forces
and make them effective. This is the lesson which they have to draw from the
present International Affairs as they are being shaped by the rivalries between
the United States and Soviet Russia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

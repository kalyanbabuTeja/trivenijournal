style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The outstanding event in the
external sphere of the Indian Scene during the period under review was the
recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan. It took more than two years after the
emergence of Bangladesh for Pakistan to adjust herself to the reality of the
situation and extend her recognition to the new State. It is better late than
never. It may now be said that with this recognition a new chapter begins in
the history of the sub-continent and of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The recognition was welcomed by the
Government of India and by the people of the country. It has eliminated one of
the factors that contributed to political instability, and tension in the area
during the last two years and it is naturally a matter of great relief to all
well-wishers of peace and prosperity. This is the most that can be said of it.
It is, however, extremely doubtful whether it will really bring peace to the
area or promote tensions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

India many causes for misgiving. She has now to face a situation far more
complicated than what existed during the last two years. Statesmanship and
diplomatic: skill of a high order will be required if she is to deal
successfully with the new situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The recognition of Bangladesh was
brought through the intervention of third parties contrary to the expectations
of the Government of India. All along the Government has been saying that
problems of the sub-continent should be settled only through bilateral
negotiations or by tripartite negotiations among the three sovereign states in
the sub-continent. But Bhutto so managed the situation that it was through the
intervention of the states assembled at the Islamic Summit Conference at Lahore
in the last week of February that recognition became an accomplished fact.
India had no other alternative than to accept a situation to which she was most
opposed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To add to this sense of disappointment
there was the factor that the intervention was that of States whose bond or
unity was religion and not common interests of a secular character. In the past
India had to pay a high cost in consequence of the prominent role which religion
played in the politics of the sub-continent. These memories are still fresh in
the minds of the people or <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the
country. Naturally the Government and the people became sorely </span>disappointed
that it was the factor <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of religion
that </span>brought about reconciliation between <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Pakistan </span>and Bangladesh. There are unlimited possibllities for
mischief if religion becomes the bond of unity between Pakistan and Bangladesh
and if Islamic States from outside give their support and helping hand in
strengthening such a bond. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The immediate outcome of recognition
was the participation or Bangladesh Prime Minister in the Islamic Conference at
Lahore. He was for sometime anxious to participate in it as it would bring him
into touch with Arab countries controlling the oil supplies. He informed the
Indian External Affairs Minister, who visited Decca a few days previous to
recognition, that in case Bhutto extended recognition to Bangladesh he would attend
the conference; but it appears that he did not take India completely into
confidence in the negotiations which went on between him and Bhutto through
third parties for a number of months preceding the actual recognition. This was
contrary to the spirit of the Simla and Delhi agreement. As a result of these
negotiations it was settled that Pakistan should first recognise Bangladesh on
the eve of the Summit Conference and that Mujibur Rehman should drop the idea
of trying Pakistan prisoners on charges of war crimes. Mujibur conveyed to
Bhutto through the negotiating third parties that he was not serious about the
trial of war prisoners. The recognition then became an accomplished fact. The
delegation of the Islamic Conference which visited Decca on February 21 merely
performed a formal function of conveying to the Bangladesh Prime Minister the
fact of recognition by Bhutto. All these developments took India by surprise
not because she was against recognition or against the dropping of the trials
of prisoners of war. In fact she was in favour all along of the dropping of
trials. The surprise was all due to the way in which negotiations were carried
on, the religious tone that was given to recognition and the secrecy in which
the whole affair was shrouded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>No purpose is served by going into
the history of these negotiations and the way in which India was by-passed.,
What is more relevant for our purposes here is how recognition will affect
Indo-Bangladesh relations in future. Here there are certain factors which have
to be taken into consideration. One is that the initiative in shaping the
evolving situation in the sub-continent has now passed into the hands of
Bhutto. India can only react to his moves. It is quite certain that he will
stress the bond of Islamic brotherhood in his dealings with Bangladesh. This is
the purpose of his forthcoming visit to Dacca. Many politicians–perhaps Mujibur
also–will respond to his appeal as he is a member of the committee appointed by
the Islamic Conference to devise ways and means for easing the oil crisis and
as he is also one of the managers of the proposed Islamic Bank. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We should note here that the Arab
world is now a power to reckon with in spite of its internal disunities. The
control over the oil resources of Western Asia and Northern Africa has
increased its bargaining position and it is sure to exercise a large amount of
influence over the politics of South Asia. Bhutto has become highly influential
with the Arab world, and this will naturally be taken into consideration by Bangladesh.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>China is sure to follow Pakistan and
recognise Bangladesh. Both countries will soon have diplomatic missions in
Dacca. We are aware of their anti-Indian attitudes and they will use all their
strength and skill to encourage such an attitude in Bangladesh. China is now
trying to extend her influence into the third world. A Chinese embassy in Dacca
will be utilised for this purpose. It will also try to embarrass India in collaboration
with Pakistan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All this may not be a source of
worry to India if there is no anti-Indian sentiment in Bangladesh. As a matter
of fact there is such a sentiment and it has recently been on the increase as
has been stated by Kuldip Nayyar, an eminent journalist. It is partly an old
legacy. We should not forget that what is now Bangladesh was in the
pre-partition period a centre of the activity of the Muslim League with its
theory of two nations and its anti-Hindu attitude. Large numbers of Hindus had
to leave this area after the country was partitioned and come to India as
refugees. Even today the refugees who were forced to come to India as a result
of Pakistani atrocities in the war of December 1971 and who went back to their
homes after Bangladesh was liberated have not got back all their property.
There is consequently–we may regret it–a section which is anti-Indian and which
does not believe in secular policies. Moulana Bbashani has been using all the
influence he has to strengthen <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>this </span>section.
The danger <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>that <span

diplomacy to encourage these elements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the rise in prices was the outcome of deficit-financing, the pumping into
the economy of large quantities of currency notes. This in its turn was due to
Government’s inability to control in an effective manner the non-developmental
expenditure. Much of this expenditure arises out of the pressure which the
organised sections of the public like Government employees and workers in
public sector concerns like Railways, Life Insurance Corporation and Banks are
able to exercise on Government with the unorganised sections looking on
helplessly. The Finance Minister also agreed that there has practically been no
growth in industry and that in agriculture there is only a slow rate of growth
due to inadequate supply of fertilizers, improved seed, pesticides and water
for purposes of irrigation. It is the stagnation in economy that is responsible
for the increase in the numbers of the unemployed. What is most discouraging,
however, in the economic survey is that there is no near hope of any
improvement in the situation and that 1974-’75 will be a much more difficult
year than 1973-’74. It appears as if a sense of despair and utter helplessness
has overtaken the Government, as if it lost all control over the situation and
that it will allow things to drift. A Government which lacks self-confidence
and confesses its inability to bring about improvement loses all legitimacy in
spite of the gains it happens to secure, in a general election as it has now
secured in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>U.<i> </i></span>P. and
Orissa. Such gains cease to convey any meaning to the people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the economic crisis with which the country is faced is due to factors which are
beyond the control of the Government. There is first the high rate at which
population has </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>been growing and the failure of the people to respond
effectively to measures relating to family planning sponsored <span

needs. Even in a country <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>like </span>Soviet
Russia, which <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>taken by
several sections of our people as a model to follow, there is an inadequate
supply of consumers’ goods. The Western countries took more than a century to
industrialise themselves. We are passing through a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the mistakes committed in determining the order of priorities. What the public

</span>taken effective steps to bring about a more equitable distribution of what
is being produced. The prices of articles of food, for example, have risen
because of the failure of the Government’s procurement policy. <span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>1973-’74 when the food production has gone
up to 110 </span>million, prices have risen to unprecedented heights. There has
been a good deal of hoarding and the administrative machinery totally failed to
bring all available stocks to the market. Rationing has been introduced but
very few ration shops have the stocks needed to satisfy the requirements of
card-holders. It is this situation that has led to food riots in several parts
of the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>country. </span>The affluent
sections and those who wield power find no difficulty <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

effective. The Government has not been able to do this in a satisfactory
manner. It will be satisfactory if there is more honest effort on the part of
the political leadership and its administrative machinery to <span

which the Government is responsible is the irrational wage and income structure
that we now have. There are public concerns–for example, the shipping
corporation–where the minimum emoluments of a sweeper or a peon come to Rs. 600
a month, according to the calculation of an expert, while a junior doctor with
all his educational qualifications has to be satisfied with only Rs. 200 a
month. The average emoluments of a bank employee have gone up from a little
less than Rs. 3,000 a year in 1956 to Rs. 5,700 in 1966 and further to Rs.
8,500 in 1973. All this stands in contrast to the emoluments of teachers in
educational institutions managed or aided by Government. Employees in both
Central and State Government services get their salaries and dearness allowances
periodically raised not because they have higher educational qualifications or
do more responsible work but because any strike <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>by<i> </i></span>them will bring about the collapse of administration,
They are in a better bargaining position than employees in quasi-public or
private concerns. Instances like these may be multiplied. There is no rational
basis for the kind of disparities in respect of incomes enjoyed by people and
no effort has been made by the Government to create such a basis. This creates
frustration and this is at the root of most of the strikes, bandhs and other
pressure tacticts which adversely effect productivity and impede economic
growth. It is a sort of <i>ad hocism </i>that is resorted to by the Government.
It yields blindly to any organisation which brings pressure on it for more
emoluments whether their demand is reasonable or not and cares little for those
who are not able to bring such pressure. All this is opposed to the principle
of socialism by which the party in power swears. This frequent increase in the
emoluments of organised sections is also one of the causes of inflation which
brings so much suffering to those who are not organized–the large majority of
the people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1'>            </span>This is not all. Almost all departments of Government and
the public sector concerns are over-staffed. The Sixth Finance Commission
estimated that forty per cent of the staff in the former is surplus. The same
is true of the staff employed in the Indian Air Lines, the Life Insurance
Corporation, the nationalised banks and several other organisations in the
public sector. Many of the foreign companies carrying on business in the
country indulge in over-staffing. Let it also be noted that Government
Departments and several other oganisations are not productive in the ordinary
sense </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of the term. They do not directly contribute to
economic growth. The work done by the staff in them is mostly of a clerical character.
The result of over-staffing in an under-developed country like ours is that it
adds considerably to inflation and serves as a powerful factor in bringing
about a rise in prices. In spite of all this over-staffing work goes on at a
slow pace and this leads to the phenomenon of overtime work and the additional
emoluments which accompany it. This has been going on for years. Government has
connived at it and to some extent it has done this with a view to provide
employment to the unemployed, although every one recognizes that this is more
like relief through charity than employment as is ordinarily understood. Any
attempt to reduce the staff resisted as has been seen recently in the strike of
the employees of Indian Air Lines. No one, however, cares to see that this kind
of over-staffing leads to increase in costs of production and adds to the burdens
of the people. Government has lost the courage to deal effectively with the
problem and pursued a policy of drift. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rationalise the structure of wages and other incomes and the laxity which it

resorted took the usual form, with which the country has become familiar these
days. Cars, buses, and all sorts of public and private transport were set on
fire; shops were looted and nearly 3 crores worth of property was destroyed.
Hoarders and black-marketeers were manhandled and forced to disgorge their
stocks. There was general lawlessness and to deal with it the corrupt Ministry
used all the police forces at its disposal. The police resorted to firing in
the usual course and many innocent people either lost their lives or got
injured. The military also were called in to restore order. Curfew was imposed
in most of the towns. But the agitation continued. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

participation of several factions in the Congress which was the ruling party,
in the violent agitation. They felt nothing wrong in joining hands with the
opposition in the attempt to get rid of the Chief Minister then in office. It
was then that the Centre realised that the removal of the Chief Minister and

inevitable if agitation should come to an end and law and order restored. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

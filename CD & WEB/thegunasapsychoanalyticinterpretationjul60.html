style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Freud
began writing in the 1890’s, and by the time of the <span class=GramE>first
world war</span> his main ideas had become widely known. The intellectuals of
the West received them like a revelation. There was fierce opposition but also
enthusiastic acceptance, and they quickly became part of the Euro-American
culture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the usual time-lag, Indian intellectuals dutifully acquainted themselves with
Freud’s writings. But his ideas have never made any deep impression here. Why?
Are Indian intellectuals more discriminating, quicker to see the errors and
limitations of an abstruse theory? It seems unlikely. Did they know it all
before? Despite laborious efforts to draw parallels between Freud and <span
class=SpellE>Patanjali</span>, that view is no more plausible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

European intellectuals responded so vigorously, for or </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>against,
because Freud’s work was a genuine revelation to them. Whether they liked it or
not, they felt that it exhibited their true psychic anatomy. Indian
intellectuals have failed to respond because they have no <span class=GramE>such</span>
feeling; and they have no such feeling because their psychic anatomy is
different from that which Freud revealed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
psychic character typical of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
and that typical of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> are described,
though briefly and inadequately, in the doctrine of the ‘<span class=SpellE>guna’s</span>.
The Indian is ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’ and the European is ‘<span
class=SpellE>rajasik</span>’. But the doctrine, as it is usually stated, omits
to set forth the varieties of which both types are susceptible. It is said that
there are mixtures in various proportions of ‘<span class=SpellE>sattva</span>’,
‘rajas’ and ‘<span class=SpellE>tamas</span>’, but none of the authorities
appears to go beyond that. The ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’ is presented
as always conforming to the ideal, perfectly detached, balanced, pure, whereas
many people who, in any plausible system, would be classified with the ‘<span
class=SpellE>sattvik’s</span> are not so admirable. In the same way the ‘<span
class=SpellE>rajasik</span>’ is not only wrathful and turbulent, but can be
nearly, perhaps quite, as self-controlled and virtuous as the ideal ‘<span
class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’ himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
‘guna’ theory places ‘<span class=SpellE>tamas</span>’ as a psychic factor or
ingredient on the same level as the other two. If we equate ‘<span
class=SpellE>tamas</span>’ with the Freudian ‘id’ or animal nature, this is
inconvenient. Freud regards the id as the source of all psychic energy and,
therefore, a main factor in every psyche; but it is more or less effectively
controlled and sublimated. It is therefore better to look upon ‘<span
class=SpellE>tamas</span>’ not as a psychic ingredient independent like ‘<span
class=SpellE>sattva</span>’ and ‘rajas’ but as a common lower limit to which
both ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’ and ‘<span class=SpellE>rajasik</span>’
types degenerate in the extreme case. ‘<span class=SpellE>Sattvik</span>’ and ‘<span
class=SpellE>rajasik</span>’ are then different but parallel series of types,
both capable of high excellence, though, even at the highest, somewhat
different, but both more commonly only mediocre or downright bad, and having characteristic
and different faults. There may be mixed ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik-rajasik</span>’
types, as the theory holds, but it is more convenient to deal with pure types
to begin with. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
Freud’s theory the two types are described and <span class=SpellE>analysed</span>
as follows. He <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> two basic drives,
picturesquely called ‘<span class=SpellE>eros</span>’ and ‘<span class=SpellE>thanatos</span>’,
love and death, or, more familiarly, libido and aggressiveness. The psychic
type which he described more fully, and assumed from his experience in <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> to be normal, I venture to name the “punitive”. In
this type the libido is directed mainly upon the outer world, while a
considerable amount of aggressiveness is directed by the super-ego inwards
against the ego. Any failure of the ego to live up to the standards of the
ego-ideal sets in motion this <span class=SpellE>internalised</span>
aggressiveness, causing unconscious guilt, the great spur to self-improvement
and external activity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
psychic structure is of course unconscious, but it strongly influences the
conscious life. It is like the bony structure of the body, which determines the
appearance in outline though not in detail. However, even this framework is
variable. The ego-ideal, which is formed mainly in childhood under the
influence of parental and other authority, may be more or less elevated, and
the super-ego may function more or less effectively. Thus the id may succeed in
imparting much of its animal character to outward <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>.
In particular, the aggressiveness of the super-ego, directed against the ego,
provokes further aggressiveness, so that the characteristic vices of this
punitive type are variants of aggressiveness, often cloaked in conscientious
disguises. Quite high-level <span class=SpellE>punitives</span> are often
guilty of unconscious ambition, rapacity and cruelty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

"Times New Roman"'>So far the punitive type.</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Freud also describes a different psychic structure, which in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
is observed only in a minority. He calls it narcissistic. In a psyche of that
type a large part of the libido is directed inward upon the ego, while the
super-ego and its internally directed aggressiveness are weak. Freud considered
that in any individual the flow of libido, arising from physiological sources,
is approximately constant, whereas aggressiveness is not wholly a spontaneous
product but in part at least a response to provocation, and is therefore variable
in quantity. If the inward-directed aggressiveness is weak, it calls forth only
a weak aggressive response. Thus the narcissistic type is relatively lacking in
aggressiveness, both inward and outward-directed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
person of the narcissistic type may have a high ego-ideal. He is not vigorously
spurred on to live up to his ideal by inward-directed aggressiveness; he is
relatively lacking in the punitive conscience. But his inward-directed libido
may serve the same purpose in a less tense and self-torturing way. The ego
strives to attain to the ideal because it loves itself. Its virtue derives from
love of good rather than hatred of evil. The best type of narcissist has a
calm, poised, balanced virtue which the punitive can scarcely attain to,
however hard he may struggle with himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
examples of narcissists of a high type I may mention <span class=SpellE>Montaigne</span>,
Goethe and Wordsworth. All showed pronounced individuality and independence,
together with balance, detachment, non-partisanship (the “Olympian” Goethe), and
a devotion to truth and the good of mankind. In an age of religious fanaticism <span
class=SpellE>Montaigne</span> was a <span class=SpellE>sceptic</span>, but
Goethe, and more especially Wordsworth, had an inclination towards pantheism, a
natural doctrine for the narcissist, who, concentrating the libido upon the
ego, tends to feel that the ego is the only real existent, and, therefore, to
identify it with the universe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is plausible, then, to equate the Freudian narcissistic type with the ‘<span
class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’, the term ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’
being used in the broadened sense mentioned above; and also to equate Freud’s
normal type, here called the punitive, with the ‘<span class=SpellE>rajasik</span>’.
But just as the punitive who fails to reach perfection shows characteristic
vices, which are mainly varieties of aggressiveness, so the ‘<span
class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’ who falls below the ideals has his characteristic
vices, and these are variants of self-love–self-satisfaction, self-absorption,
self-indulgence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

classical literature provides many illustrations of<i> </i>these failings. <span
class=SpellE>Harishchandra</span> is certainly a ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’
type; and his conduct towards his wife and son, whom he sells into slavery in
order to avoid the sin of breaking his promise, is characteristically self-<span

his old age for his son <span class=SpellE>Puru’s</span> youth, and is thus
enabled to enjoy himself for a thousand years, <span class=SpellE>realises</span>
at length that <span class=SpellE>wordly</span> pleasures are fleeting, and is
then regarded as a paragon of virtue for he is admitted to all the heavens.
Finally Indra casts him out, not for his sensuality but for his
self-satisfaction. <span class=SpellE>Swarochi</span> dallies in a sort of <st1:City

beautiful and sweet-tempered wives for hundreds of years, until even the birds

narcissistic type also has characteristic faults at still lower levels. The
ego-ideal may be orthodox, so that professed principles will be lofty, but, in
the absence of a conscience, there will be little effort to live up to them and
little distress at failure to do so. The weakness of aggressiveness brings it
about that external activity is slight; the narcissist tends to be slothful. He
will refrain from violence, but he may try to attain his ends by scheming,
which is morally little better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the inward concentration of libido in the narcissist, little can be directed
towards outer objects, and accordingly loyalties tend to be weak. The punitive
directs libido upon a sovereign or other political symbol, which may serve to
unite an extensive realm, and his loyalty to it is reinforced by his aggressive
feelings towards rival political entities. Both of these emotions are weak in
the narcissist, who tends to remain linked to small groups, family, tribe or
caste, and to be indifferent to wider ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvaguna</span>’ with Freud’s narcissism, this is
explained; and in general we can understand the close association of religion
and sex in Hinduism, and also the wide gulf officially maintained between them
in Christianity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

manifestations of libido–sexual activity, the arts, elaborate manners,
ceremonial, luxury. This tendency will be the more marked, the higher the moral
level the punitive attains. This, and not any abnormality in St. Paul’s mental
constitution, is the cause of the hostility of Christianity to sex. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the narcissistic psyche; on the other hand, aggressiveness is weak and libido
is dominant. At the highest level, libido is directed into self-development or
love of mankind, but at any level short of the highest it is apt to find direct
expression in sexual activity, unimpeded by the puritan’s in-turned
aggressiveness. Hence the sexual side of Hindu religion, so puzzling and
shocking to Christian puritans. Deities are often female, and are usually
unexacting in their demand on their devotees, as contrasted with the oppressive
male god of the punitive. To the true Christian, sin is the very centre of
religion; to the Hindu it is a matter of minor concern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has been noticed above that the narcissist tends to identify the ego with the
universe. Only in a society where the intellectual class were mainly of the
narcissistic type could the doctrine of Advaita, the identity of the ‘atman’
and the ‘<span class=SpellE>brahman</span>’, be widely accepted. The principal
teaching of the Gita, <span class=SpellE>Nishkama</span> Karma, is also
characteristically narcissistic. It tells the believer to act rightly, but to
be indifferent, to the practical outcome of his actions: i.e., it tells him to
confine his concern to his own moral rightness, and to withdraw his interest
from the external world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘<span
class=SpellE>Tapas</span>’ is a practice characteristic of the narcissistic
type. True, mediaeval Christian penitents wore hair shirts in order to subdue
the flesh; but for them it was aggression against the self. It was supposed to
be accompanied by meditation upon the crucifixion, <span class=SpellE>i</span>.
e., upon their own guilt, and to lead to a hatred of self and an increase in
zeal for outward activity. For the narcissist, ‘<span class=SpellE>tapas</span>’
is an exercise in withdrawal of the libido from external things; the pain, if
any, is secondary. The main theme of Hindu ‘<span class=SpellE>tapas</span>’ is
‘<span class=SpellE>dhyana</span>’, concentration of the libido inwards. Yoga
is a variant in which the painful element is entirely eliminated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Hindus delight in self-sacrifice. This has misled some writers, who have
inferred that Hindus are <span class=SpellE>punitives</span>. But the <span
class=SpellE>punitive’s</span> attitude is rather different. He submits to
sacrifice as an unpleasant duty; he does not welcome it. Analytically, the
difference is this: in accepting sacrifice, which archetypal is the loss of the
sex organ, the punitive is suffering punishment for rebellion against his
father; on the other hand, in undergoing that sacrifice the narcissist is
identifying himself with his mother. This is always his unconscious aim, and
hence the sacrifice is welcome. There is good evidence that in the Hindu
unconscious, generally, sacrifice conforms to the narcissistic type:
identification with the mother. I will cite only one example: Satyagraha. It is
a method not of attacking but of winning over the opponent by a display of
virtue, harmlessness, good temper, even helping him in other matters, and
submitting to his violence without complaint, the process culminating, if
successful, in the conversion of the opponent to love for the <span
class=SpellE>Satyagrahi</span>. It is clearly the attitude of a woman to a man,
and was <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> by the Mahatma to be so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
the narcissistic type has little aggressiveness, a society made up of such
types will tend to be sluggish. In the punitive type, much of the
aggressiveness of the young is directed against their fathers, whose ideas,
accordingly, tend to be repudiated. Hence, variety and rapid change, especially
of ideas, artistic fashions, and the like, are features of punitive society. In
a narcissistic society, on the other hand, sons will accept the ideas of their
fathers without much protest, and such a society will be conservative,
conformist, and dominated by the sedate, unadventurous and other-worldly
preferences of old men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are other grounds for identifying the ‘<span
class=SpellE>sattvaguna</span>’ with the Freudian narcissism, and for thinking
that the predominant psychic type among Hindus is the narcissistic. Of course
not all Hindus conform to the model. Among public men of recent generations, I
should say that Ram Mohan Roy and Tilak, for example, were <span class=SpellE>punitives</span>;
but Nana <span class=SpellE>Farnavis</span> and Gokhale were typical high-level
narcissists. Judging from his writing. Kalidasa was a narcissist, as I have
suggested above. And, judging from either his life or his writings, Tagore was
clearly of that type. I have studied Mahatma Gandhi’s life more closely than
that of any of these, and am inclined to the more complicated hypothesis that
he began as a punitive but, in middle life, perhaps under the influence of ‘<span
class=SpellE>tapasya</span>’, began to revert to type. </p>

theory entertained by the mind about itself cannot tell it much that it did not
know, or enable it to predict <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> much better
than its untutored judgment enabled it to do. But it can point out connections
which are otherwise overlooked, and put familiar facts in a new perspective.
The thesis advanced here about the meaning of the ‘guna’ doctrine, and about
the narcissistic as the predominant psychic type among Hindus, may have such a
value. The weakness of aggressiveness in Hindus is familiar, but its connection
with the weakness of the punitive conscience, and hence with low morals, and
with the weakness of effort and of innovation, is not commonly <span
class=SpellE>realised</span>. The connection of these facts with the devotion
to mothers and goddesses, and with the strength of caste and other parochial
loyalties, is also a new insight. But these weaknesses are closely tied in with
the virtues which Hindu rightly cherish. The true ‘<span class=SpellE>sattvik</span>’,
is moved not by opposition to evil but by love of good. He is impelled to
action not by unconscious guilt nor by rivalry or emulation, but by the call of
the ideal and the example of ideal leaders, and for him the ideal leader is one
in whom the internal concentration of the libido is complete, the ‘<span
class=SpellE>vairagi</span>’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

position of India in the modern world is such that the defects of the ‘<span

these obsolete ideals are a heavy burden. Modern-minded men affect to despise
them, but how many have really cast off their spell? In any case, those who
aspire to change them should know what they are doing. What has been said above,
if it has any truth, should help the modern-minded reformer to get a glimpse of
the magnitude of the task he has undertaken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

situation at home, it is still worse. Let me take you into confidence:
Returning from office a bit early, that is 6-30, one evening, I discover the
lady of the house lying down in our bedroom upstairs, with the fan whirring
overhead, and the old maidservant sitting at her feet. As I enter, the maid,
whom we call <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma, says in a rasping voice,
addressing no one in particular: “So the Master has decided it is time to
return home! That is something at least!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

unable to fathom the cause of this very cheerful welcome, I inquire: “What’s
the matter? Why is the Mistress lying down? Has she a head-ache or…<span
class=GramE>..?</span>” Cutting me short, <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma
says with stinging sarcasm: “What should she do but lie down? Go about dancing
and carousing? It is three days since my child was ill. But does anyone care?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I must explain that <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma is an ancient
servant, who has brought up my wife from childhood, and who came to us with her
as a sort of dowry. She is called <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma, after
her daughter, and is devoted to my wife, of whom, under stress of emotion, she
still speaks as “my child”. Naturally she is in entire command of the
household, and no one dares to contradict her. Besides, who else is there to do
so, apart from my wife and myself? We have a daughter, but she has been married
these two years, and is happily settled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

meekly, “I would have rushed back from office earlier, had word reached me that
the illness was so serious.” “Is the illness only of today?” asks <span
class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma pointedly. “It has been going on now for a
month. At lunch the poor child tries to swallow a morsel of rice. Can you call
it a meal? She sits at the plate just for form, and gets up and returns to bed
straight away. Till five in the afternoon she lies prostrate. Neither is it for
pleasure that she leaves the bed then. When I try to dissuade her, she brushes
me aside. ‘It is time for Master’s’ return, she says. ‘Who is there to look
after him if I don’t?’ But what does Master-care? Is there any strength left in
my child?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

through this vigorous indictment I find no hint as to what sort of illness it
is, or how and when it started. At no time before have I heard or seen anything
unusual. Since, in the prevailing tension, it would be sheer folly to say so, I
humbly admit guilt and, rallying all the sympathy I can muster, say: “That is
so, indeed. She has suffered a lot. I slave at the office like a donkey the whole
day, and have no energy left to carry out my domestic duties. But for my
inattention her health would not be so ruined. Well, let us leave all that
aside now. Regret won’t mend what is over. So what is the good of dwelling on
it? We must think of the present. I’ll run to Dr. <span class=SpellE>Lalit</span>
just now and get him here at once.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the maidservant was vehemently impeaching me, the Mistress had kept silent. But
the moment I mentioned Dr. <span class=SpellE>Lalit</span>, she flared up. “Why
go to the extent of having Dr. <span class=SpellE>Lalit</span>?” she asked
sarcastically. “The <span class=SpellE>compounder</span> <span class=SpellE>Sricharan</span>

wretched fate and nobody’s fault!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

you catch the point? I, who adorn the post of <span class=SpellE><i>Bada</i></span><i>

wife and better half!...Dr. <span class=SpellE>Lalit</span>, who has not even a
horse carriage, let alone a car, who does not ask for–and would probably never
get–more than one rupee as his visiting fee! To have the audacity to call such
a one to attend upon the Presiding Deity of my hearth and home, in her
precarious state! Could temerity go further? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a forlorn attempt to recover from this <i>faux pas, </i>I exclaim: “How hastily
you draw conclusions! Am I getting this <span class=SpellE>Lalit</span> to take
up your treatment? Don’t you see, in a dangerous illness like yours, it is
necessary to have a doctor at hand all the time? That is why I want to send for
Dr. <span class=SpellE>Lalit</span>, while I proceed to get a Specialist.” What
I said silently to myself, however, had better be left unrecorded! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

having no <span class=SpellE>altemative</span>, I left home at that late hour,
without changing my office dress, and started in search of a reputable doctor.
The question was<span class=GramE>,</span> whom should I approach? Were I to
report the so-called grave condition of my wife to <span class=SpellE>Neel</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ratan</span> Sarkar or <span class=SpellE>Bidhan</span> Roy,
I would be driven out as a lunatic, or perhaps, impelled by pity, handed over

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then I remembered Dr. <span class=SpellE>Bose</span>,
who was said to be an expert in temperamental troubles of this kind. I did not
know him very well, having just met him a couple of times at some friend’s. We
knew each other by name, and had exchanged courtesies when brought face to face
by chance. But that was all. There was no question of any intimacy. Still, as I
had heard many people speak highly of him, I decided that he was the right man.

in.” I followed him and took the proffered chair. “This is a late hour and you

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“The fact is, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>, I
don’t quite know what the illness is,” I continued. “I leave home at 9-30 in
the morning every day and return at 6.30 or 7. At no time have I seen the wife
suffering. To me she appears as I am accustomed to find her all these 18 years.
There are no children to try her patience. We’ve only one daughter, and she has
been married these two years, and pays only fleeting visits. There is an
adequate household staff, including cook, maidservant, <span class=SpellE>syce</span>,
coachman and others. The Mistress is not required to go through any domestic
drudgery. This is the background, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>. Well,
this evening, a short while ago, I returned from office as usual, only to find
the wife in bed, and her old maidservant glaring at me. This maidservant has
raised my wife from childhood, and has been with her all these years. Everyone calls
her <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma, after her own daughter. With the
prerogative of such association she refers to my wife as “her child”. The
moment I stepped in, this evening, I was faced by <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span>
Ma pent up with resentment, and accusing me of callousness towards “her child”
who, it seems, had long been “seriously ill”. You can imagine, Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Babu</span>, how thoroughly dumbfounded I was at this news and the
gratuitous charge. All that <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma said of the
illness, interspersed with a scathing commentary on my heartlessness, went
completely over my head. I could not follow a word. They say you are an expert
in peculiar cases of this type, and may therefore be able to make something of
this. <span class=SpellE>Shyama’s</span> Ma says that every day “her child”
comes down for lunch at 11, but doesn’t touch food, and goes back to bed, only
to leave it at 5 in the afternoon. So severe is her suffering! When I return
home at 6, I neither see nor know any thing about all this. The good lady
herself has indicated nothing till now. It is only today that she has kept to
her bed even after 5….This is all I can report to you, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>.
This is why I have to seek your help so urgently at this hour.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Listening to my story, Dr. <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>
smiled. “There is no need for you to say more,” he remarked. “I think I can lay
my finger now on your wife’s illness–as well as on your own.” </p>

instructions about the treatment? ‘What sort of Specialist you have brought?’

available the moment he is asked?’–This will be her reaction. Though so
learned, you don’t seem to have considered these aspects, Dr. <span

I painted a fanciful picture of my vicissitudes in search of a Specialist.
Addressing the wife, I said: “You know it is only today that I fully <span
class=SpellE>realise</span> how hard it is in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City> to get a reputable doctor
immediately. Take my own case of this evening. When I left home, I could not
decide, in the first place, whom to call in. Ultimately I asked myself: What
was more precious–Money or Life? Immediately I went straight to <span
class=SpellE>Neel</span> <span class=SpellE>Ratan</span> <span class=SpellE>Sarkar’s</span>
place. There I learnt he was himself ill these three days, and could neither
come down nor see patients. There was no go but to approach <span class=SpellE>Bidhan</span>
Roy. On arriving at his residence, I find him filling his emergency bag. What
was the matter? I enquired. He was starting for <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Narsingarh</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> or <span
class=SpellE>Pratapgarh</span> for an urgent case. The car was ready, with the
engine on. The train from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Howrah</span></st1:place></st1:City> would leave in a few
minutes! Intruding in the midst of the bustle, I spoke to the Doctor of my
misfortune. He was moved and said: “Do one thing. Go to Dr. <span class=SpellE>Bose</span>.
From what you say of the case, he would be the right person. Even if I were
here, I would have advised you to get him.” So I hastened to Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Bose’s</span> house, for what was the point in delaying? I arrived
just as he was leaving for a serious case. He had one foot in the car and had
no time to turn back. When I spoke of my trouble, he explained how fully booked
he was. “I am very sorry, <span class=SpellE>Bijoy</span> <span class=SpellE>Babu</span>,”
he said. “There are so many patients to be seen today that I won’t be back till
11 at night, and it will not do to see your lady at that hour. Well, let me
see,” he added, opening his diary, “it would be very difficult to take up your
case before one in the noon tomorrow.” So again I was disappointed. I pleaded
hard and promised any fee he would name, all to no purpose. It was impossible
for him to come tonight, he repeated. As I would not leave him and as I spoke
of the critical nature of the illness, he agreed to make it 8-30, as a <span
class=SpellE>favour</span>, and entered the appointment in his note-book. For a
moment, I thought of asking him what the fee would be. Then I thought to
myself: What is more precious–Money or Life? I’ll pay whatever he would ask.
Wasn’t I right?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

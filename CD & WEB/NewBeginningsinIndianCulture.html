<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a widespread idea, especially in the West, that India 
  is a very old land with a culture which has already seen its highest expression. 
  This judgment is partly true, because India is a very old land and, to a superficial 
  observer, Indian culture seems hard and unyielding. Yet, as a matter of truth, 
  very great changes are taking place just now, in spite of the fact that, to 
  the superficial observer, everything is the same. Only the other day, an Australian 
  friend of mine expressed with a sense of depression, 'I was in India twenty 
  years ago, and everything seems exactly the same now!' He noted only the signs 
  of poverty, and the general untidiness and lack of organisation. He, of course, 
  could not know the changes which have already begun to be effective in the Indian 
  mind during the last fifteen years. India does seem as if she were 'played out,' 
  if we note only the conservatism in customs and manners. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, one of the most interesting things in India 
  is that, though she is old, she is really at the beginning of a great career. 
  There is it great parallel between India to-day and the beginnings of Greek 
  culture. There is this difference, however, that Greece began for the first 
  time; whereas India, which has already a great culture in the past, is beginning 
  once again. This is a thesis hard to prove, and yet, I will do what little I 
  can to justify my belief. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me first take Indian drama. As one sees Indian plays, there 
  is a great rigidity of form, and a very slavish subservience to an old and effete 
  tradition regarding scenery and presentation. In the old days, the Indian drama 
  was not intended to be realistic, but symbolic. Therefore, exactness of costume 
  and scenery was no part of the dramatist's equipment, for the audience co-operated 
  with him in imagining the atmosphere, which normally is created in the best 
  equipped theatres by intense truth to scenery and to period of action, etc. 
  Indian plays, as one sees them to-day, are intensely distasteful, because of 
  their artificiality and lack of actuality. Yet, on the other hand, the appeal 
  they make, not so much to the outer senses as to the mind, is many steps in 
  advance of what is known in the West, except in a few of the greatest dramatists.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> That it is possible to retain the Indian spiritual and subjective 
  quality in drama, and yet be perfectly true to nature, is evidenced by the work 
  of Tagore and Chattopadhyaya. One of my most vivid memories is Tagore's <I>Post 
  Office, </I>performed in his own house during the Congress of ten years ago, 
  when Tagore himself took one of the parts. Everything was true to life in scenery 
  and costume, and yet, the play retained its own subtle quality. Those of us 
  who have seen the work of Harindranath Chattopadhyaya know how, without in the 
  least ceasing to be Indian, he is at the same time true to nature in his staging 
  and action. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these characteristics of the new age can be applied to 
  develop Indian drama, without in the least taking any- thing away from its own 
  striking characteristics. I do not think there will ever be any need to imitate 
  the West in this matter blindly. But, on the other hand, Indian drama can be 
  more accurate in presentation. When it does so develop, I see before it a very 
  great era. As the Greek drama grew out of the simple songs and dances of the 
  religious festivals, -the word ‘tragedy’ means the ‘songs at the goat festivals’ 
  -when the dancers sang and danced in honour of Pan, so I foresee a bright future 
  for the Indian drama out of the present stratified ideas. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly too with Indian music. All European musicians know 
  at once the remarkable subtle quality in Indian melody, and the rhythm in the 
  Indian drummer always amazes them with its complexity. But, on the other hand, 
  Indian music has no sense of harmony, and there is, therefore, a sense of monotony. 
  A great Indian musician has told me that he does not foresee that India will 
  ever in her singing develop on the lines of the West with ‘four part’ singing. 
  This may well be. Yet, on the other hand, I do feel that Indian music, though 
  old, is just at the beginning of a great expansion. I am fairly conversant with 
  a good deal of Western orchestral music, and I do not think that India will 
  ever achieve the great range of spiritual ideas revealed in music by composers 
  like Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, and others. When one listens, for instance, 
  to the best <I>vina</I> play, one feels that in that pure music, there is something 
  like the effect of a Western orchestra, but in miniature. Just as when we look 
  through the wrong end of an opera glass, the scenery, though clear, is tiny, 
  similarly the delicate tones produced by the <I>vina</I> have a symphonic quality.<B> 
  </B>I see no reason why Indian musicians, if they will study Western music, 
  may not apply its philosophy of music to develop Indian music along her own 
  lines, but into a new field. A great deal can be done in India with Community 
  Singing, because song is very near to the Indian temperament. Every Friday evening 
  at the Headquarters of the Theosophical Society, there is Community Singing, 
  where the residents sing together Eastern and Western music. If Community Singing 
  could be developed at public meetings, Indian composers would quickly see new 
  possibilities in song. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking the field of painting, one of the most amazing things 
  is to note how the Bengal School of painting has such great similarities with 
  the earliest Italian School. Both schools are 'primitive,' that is to say, are 
  bent more on the feeling side of life than its actual photographic representation 
  to the mind. In Italy, the 'primitive' school went its way developing stage 
  by stage, till it reached a climax in such an artist as Bottcelli, in whose 
  best work, life and form are balanced, and exquisiteness of painting is inseparable 
  from great feeling and idea. Similarly, 1 see for Indian painting a development 
  in the course of a few generations, which will make painting something closely 
  woven with the highest cultural life of the people. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In similar ways, department after department of Indian culture 
  is feeling a new birth. It is by comparing what the West has already achieved, 
  that one sees clearly the signs of this new birth. In India, in all the arts 
  and crafts, there is a great sense of beauty, but it is now traditional, that 
  is to say, the craftsman works by rote, and does not feel sufficiently a true 
  creative urge. But since life is all the time creative, this urge is in the 
  very texture of our being. If only we understand the principles of creation, 
  that is to say, the principles of art, - 'art' means only 'doing' - we shall 
  feel how our future life as an Indian civilisation is inseparable from artistic 
  expression. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If only our artists will look with the eyes of the West on 
  Indian scenes and on Indian men and women, they will find plenty to inspire 
  them. Almost every day, as the fishermen pass on Adyar river in their catamarans, 
  I can see many a Greek statue. Even when I look at one of the most pitiful sights 
  in Madras, that is, coolies pushing loads in George Town, I feel a thrill of 
  delight at the perfection of their muscles, and note what perfect models they 
  are for sculpture. There is nothing so lovely as an Indian road, with its colour; 
  a coaly woman sometimes can become the subject of a great poem, so graceful 
  she is. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rebirth of Indian culture is wonderfully assisted by the 
  fact that there is behind India a great storehouse of spiritual energy waiting 
  to be released. When, with her patriots and her religious leaders, Indian artists 
  come to do their part in the Great Plan for India, once again there will be 
  such a flowering of Indian ideals and achievement, as has never been in the 
  past. Wonderfully great as Indian achievements have been in the long past, I 
  believe that greater achievements still are in store for her in the future, 
  not only in the domain of religion and international achievement, but also in 
  the domain of art.</P>

do not precisely remember if I was sixteen or fifteen then. We went to a
village for a marriage in a relative’s house. We were of the bridegroom’s
party. A house was allotted for our stay. The owners of the house adjusted
themselves in a part of the house and vacated the rest for us. It was a
village, and the marriage was a five-day affair, and the house owners too had
their food twice in the day along with us of the marriage party. Within two
days both moved intimately with each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

acquainted with Telugu literature and accustomed to reading Telugu verses

girl grew up, she bade fair to be like her mother. She was strong; her hands
were like parcels. The beauty of her face beggared speech–her wide eyes and
thick-penciled eyebrows. Her<i> </i>face was a successful experiment by God in
creating beauty, as if to point out: Beauty should be like this. My
recollecting, now, her laughter, shows how much my mouth watered then. But my
mind grieved as much as my eyes <span class=SpellE>joyed</span> at the<i> </i>sight
of her beauty. My father had got me </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>married in my tenth
year. That afternoon the mother and the daughter came to me lying in the

joked, my body <span class=SpellE>horrippilated</span>; my mind was the home of
<span class=SpellE>ecstacy</span>. Her complexion was carat gold. It was as if

my childhood I studied in a town and hence there were many things of a village
beyond my comprehension. I have <span class=GramE>a knowledge</span> of many
trees and plants. But I didn’t have any idea of capsicum <span class=SpellE>frutescens</span>;
it is of the size of a big ant; it gets ripe within that size. The girl went to
her backyard, brought a capsicum fruit and asked me to eat it saying it was
sweet. Cleverly she removed the stalk and brought it. I know fruits like <span
class=SpellE>solanumrubrum</span>. I thought this was one of that species. I
put it in my mouth and masticated it. Imagine! <span class=GramE>the</span>
mouth was burning. It was not easy to alleviate the burning pain. I ran for
water, <span class=GramE>gargled</span> my mouth, and spat out; still the pain
did not lessen. The eyes watered; the ears were steaming; I was <span
class=SpellE>fidgetty</span> with pain and the girl was laughing at my agony.
The mother was smilingly neutralist. They had no hatred towards me; both of
them respected me. Was it not silly of me to bite the capsicum fruit? I felt
ashamed to myself. The shyness arising out of my callow silliness mocked at my
love for the girl. Of course I was angry at her enjoyment of my pain. But I
suppressed that shyness and anger and could not but pretend that the whole
thing was a playful prank. The mother learnt through my mother in casual
conversation that I was already married. Laughing she said, “Alas! Is that so?
I thought you would wed my daughter.” After the fifth day we came away. A year
or two later my wife joined me. 1 used to think of that girl for five or six
years. There was no relationship between them and us. There was no tie between
us and that village. The whole </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was midsummer. I had no food since morning. I boarded the train at <st1:place
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Bezwada</span></st1:place> at 6 A. M. I reached <span
class=SpellE>Guntakal</span> at 5 P. M. That day was the seventh in the bright
fortnight and the evening moonlight was waxing. The <span class=SpellE>Anantapur</span>
train started. The tongue clave unto the roof; the wind sawed through the ears.
The wind was withering as much of the face and hands as it touched. The train
moved unwillingly. In the distance small mounds sat like </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>heaps
of darkness. Wherever the eyes turned, only stones were to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be
seen. The train was moving over streams and the sand in the moonlight appeared
like a parched tongue sticking out. In the bogies there was no water. I looked
forward to drinking water as soon as a station was reached. We passed by one
station and another and there was no water. Tins meant for storing water were
empty. My life was fluttering at the end of its tether. It was nearing 9 P. M.
Getting down at every station and seeking water on the platform in that night,
the moonlight spreading itself away, was my business. At a station, as I got
off the train, and proceeded in search of water, a woman from the ladies’ compartment
called me with the request: “Please, can you get some water for my children
whose mouths are parched with thirst?” The light in my compartment was dim; the
light in the ladies’ compartment was very bright. But as she leaned out of the
window and spoke to me, the light did not fall on her face. Her facial features
could not be seen distinctly. Still she struck me as handsome. I said, “All
right. I am going for water only. I shall get you some, if found.” She handed
to me a vessel, having unscrewed the lid, with ‘Please, take this vessel’. In
that condition of thirst, man-woman differences were nil; the idea of a
stranger was nil. That woman’s hand touched mine. Death was certain if water
was not available for another hour. If I derived happiness out of that contact
within an hour’s reach of death, is it <span class=SpellE>animality</span>? Is
it <span class=SpellE><i>adharma</i></span><i>? </i>Water was available at that
station. I drank my fill, filled the vessel to the brim. More than the pleasure
of being rescued from death was the pleasure of the feasibility of procuring
and handing some water to the lady. Was I doing her a great act of kindness? As
a return for this should she think well of me? I gave her the vessel of water.
This time she received the vessel, carefully, avoiding contact with my hand.
She gave some water to the children; she drank some herself. I could have gone
away </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>then. But I didn’t. I stood there enquiring of her: “Is it
enough? Shall I bring another <span class=SpellE>vesselful</span> of water?”
She said, ‘There is no need.’ The signs of gratitude that I brought her water
were in her face. Of course, she didn’t utter words of civility like: ‘I am
grateful to you. Thanks,’ unknown to the non-English knowing. But gratitude,
more than double what is contained in those words, peeped out of her face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
face was distinctly seen by me in that bright light, as she moved this side and
that to give water to the children. First her beauty struck me vividly; later I
felt I saw her somewhere. Her face didn’t indicate if she saw me earlier. If I
saw her once, she should have seen me too! Let this alone! When we see some
persons, it is as if they were former acquaintances though we knew them not. We
might have seen some with the same facial features. Because of such resemblance
we feel we knew them earlier. Perhaps it would have been better, if I had
questioned her: “Which is your native village? Where are you bound to?” She
appeared like a woman of the Krishna or<i> </i>the <st1:place w:st="on">Godavari</st1:place>
districts and not like one of the Ceded districts. Intending to enquire of her
but without enquiring, I went to<i> </i>my compartment. But she and her
beautiful face were imprinted on my mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

years later I was posted to that place. I went there and searched for a rented
building. At last I secured a portion, of a building. That evening my ‘people’
arrived. The other portion had been locked since four days. The house owner was
living elsewhere. I made enquiries about the tenant of that portion. I learnt
that the tenant was a clerk in the Collector’s office, that his wife went to
her mother’s house for <span class=GramE>delivery, that</span> he was alone in
that portion, that he went home on a four-day casual leave. On the fifth day he
returned. After his term as a sub-magistrate, he waft posted to the Collector’s
office as one of the head clerks. In the nights he used to return at about 10
P. M., and in the forenoon he used to go away at 9 A. M. It was 7-30 A. M. when
I got up daily. We had no chance of meeting and talking to one another. Further
he had a bit of snobbery that he had served as a sub-magistrate. Though we were
together for four or five months, we never met and talked to each other. Who
was he? Who was I? Another month passed by. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

evening a <span class=SpellE>jutka</span> came and stopped at the house. Out of
it got down three children, and a mother, with a child in her arms. I was
writing something in the verandah. I lifted my head and saw her. Immediately I
could not identify. It was the same </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>face which I saw two
years ago at night in the bright light of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the compartment. Those
eyes and eyebrows spoke: “We are here.” She got down from the <span
class=SpellE>jutka</span> and went into the house without raising her head.
Perhaps she thought: ‘Someone is in that portion; it does not concern us’. Or
the husband had hinted to her that somebody was a tenant in that portion.
Whatever we may think, it is human nature to look up and look at a person
nearby. Or perhaps her mind was filled with egoism that she was a magistrate’s
wife, and that her husband would become a <span class=SpellE>Tahsildar</span>
soon. I was looking in her direction till she went inside the house. Her
husband was with her. He knew I was looking in the direction of his wife. He
might think I was unmannerly but could not possibly ‘bang’ me. There was no
scope for litigation. In his looks and carriage there were rejection and
discourtesy which, however, did not flow out. But why should I write like this?
Is it a sin to see? It is just human nature. How do we </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>know
whether persons look at a woman just because it cannot be </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>helped
or with a bad motive? Though that day the woman was struck by heat, her body
and face appeared full of embonpoint, now she was reduced. The physical
fullness of that day was not, there. The cheeks were depressed. The eyes
concealed themselves within the sockets. Perhaps it was a difficult delivery
and she did not yet recuperate. Ten days passed by. My mother said: ‘Oho! they
are snobs. They do not talk to us, even when we take the initiative’. I said:
‘Let alone’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wells in that village were as deep as nether regions. One day their maidservant
did not turn up. The lady had to draw water for bath, for drinking, etc. She
was very weak. If by 9.30 A. M. she did not give him food, her husband would
boss over her like a magistrate. It seems he told her that she should prepare
his supper very early so that he could go to his office after food. In the
evening when I reached the house at 5 P. M., she was drawing water. Her life
seemed to ebb out, when a single bucket was drawn from the depths. She kept two
big vessels and she needed two <span class=SpellE>vesselfulls</span> of water.
Four buckets of water would fill a vessel. I said: “I wish to wash my feet.
Will you give me the bucket?” She left the bucket and went inside. I washed my
feet, filled the two vessels and entered the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

days later, one evening, as I was getting into the house, she came face to face
to me. She fixed her eyes on me and it seemed as if the eyes grasped at
something. Perhaps she was more appreciative of us because of my drawing the
water for her, or recollected my bringing the water to her compartment; she
began conversing intimately with my mother and family. The talent, of reciting
a verse tunefully, of my young days, grew within me. Lifting my voice and
singing ten or fifteen tunes in union with verses, and the listeners okaying
it, was a matter of frequent experience. It was my habit once in a week or ten days
to sing in the nights after food. One night I sang like that. The next day that
lady seemed to have told my mother: “Your boy, madam, can sing.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Two houses after our house, there is <span class=SpellE>Ramarao’s</span>, and
he has rented that building. Her mother, like me, is pretty old. She was trying
to recollect where she saw you. After you sang, she could ‘spot’ you precisely.
You sang that verse, it seems, exactly as you sang in your young days. Then it
came into her memory.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

years later I resigned my job in that place and went to my native town. The
brother of that lady and his family tenanted <span class=SpellE>Ramarao’s</span>
house. We daily referred to their welfare and whereabouts. We learnt that the
lady was enceinte again and would be brought by her brother for delivery. The
fifth month passed by; it didn’t happen in the seventh month; the ninth month
arrived and, unable to put up with his mother’s complaints, he brought her and
her delivery was expected in a few days. On the third night the woman had birth
pains; the doctor was brought and the night passed by somehow. Two days later
her condition was very uncertain. The disease was not connected with delivery;
some other disease seized her. I too went there. Within a minute after my
going, her life made its exit. There was none to ‘put her down from the bed’.
The husband was wired to; he didn’t come. Her brother and I ‘set her down’. The
next day none came forward to carry her. It was a matter of carrying two
extinct lives and inauspicious for all. I was one of the carriers of the bier.
After the day sank, and I had a sight of the stars, I took my food. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with pain. I woke up crying. Perhaps I slept with an open mouth, snoring, and a
‘fire worm’ settled on the tip of my tongue; it burned with pain. When I woke
up, I understood the situation. Not only the tongue but the lip too was
injured. The wound did not heal for ten or twelve days; I could not even take
my food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

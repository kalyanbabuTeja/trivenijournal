Truth is an aesthetic criterion and if so whether it is unimodal or multi-modal
is still a point of controversy in modern aesthetics. Yet all the schools of
literature in general and poetry in particular claim not merely an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>empressment </i>with but make an encaenia of
it. The hoary Indian tradition positively confirms this. Valmiki declared that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Srimad Ramayana </i>does not contain any
falsehood. Vyaasa affirmed that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mahabharata
</i>is a ‘Satyavaak Prabandha.’ The multi-modal nature of Truth has also been
appreciated and apprehended on various ontological bases not merely in
metaphysics but in literature too. Thus we know that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Satyam, Sivam and Sundaram </i>are but different modalities of one and
the same thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>klou </i>of difference between classicism
and romanticism essentially rests on their approach in becoming the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>custos </i>of Truth. Classicism observes an
empathetic interval between the poet’s emotional experience and its imaginative
reconstruction. The romantic theory dispenses with this interval on the plea
that Truth has to be apprehended in a composition simultaneously with experience.
The result is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sfumato </i>performance.
For the rest the stress on the personal experience, abstract idealism,
renaissance mood is merely a matter of historical accent, not intrinsic to romanticism
as such. For, romanticism shorn of its historical text, is a natural concomitant
of all poetry pertaining to the formative stage of any poet. Indian tradition
has provided for it under the branch of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Madhurakavita
</i>and smaller genres. Even so the empathetic interval called ‘Samaadhi’, is a
must. Indeed Wordsworth, the romanticist, when he defined poetry as ‘emotion recollected
in tranquillity’ has clearly implied the interval if only to get away from the
tumult of emotions and the heat of imagination! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

poetry in Telugu that emerged since the second quarter of this century is
generally called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bhaavakavita. </i>Considering
the observance of empathetic interval it cannot be called romantic poetry in
any strict sense except perhaps in one or two cases. Generally it can be better
described as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kaantivaada-kavita. </i>For,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kaanti, </i>one of the Gunas mentioned in
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Alankaara saastra, </i>provides for
the ‘fine excess’ as well as the outlandish streak that pervades this genre of
poetry. The witty definition that classicism is classicism attained and
romanticism is classicism attempted seems to be substantially true. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

literature. Though a sensitive artist his rugged strength made him seem a <i

his growth as a poet coincided with the surge of romanticism in Telugu. The
external characteristics of preoccupation with the historical past, with nature
and love have led many to the antilogy of classifying his early works as
romantic poetry. If it is romanticism at all it is merely that natural
precursor of classicism referred to earlier and not the Western romanticism.
And one should not forget that these characteristics and the ebullient /
depressive emotions are not exclusive to romanticism. Nor are they extrinsic to
classicism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the poet’s preoccupation with the historical past of the Andhras. But it
must be observed that he is subjective in a restrained way. He records only his
reactions. He does not exhort others. There is sentiment but no sentimentalism.

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a colloctanea of
forty-seven verses, singularly enough for romanticism opens with an invocatory
verse capturing the ethos characteristic of classicism. It also expresses the
poet’s preference for a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dhvanikaavya </i>of
the Indian tradition. Paraphrased it runs to this effect: “O! Universal Mother!
Rajarajeswari! May you be pleased to sound the string-notes that
uninterruptedly rang in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>neepa </i>woods
while you played the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>veena </i>to grace

removed by the breeze of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chaamara</i>–fan<i

implied reminiscent mood becomes articulate, pathetic at the havoc time has
wrought, yet optimistic about Divine grace, thinking about the heritage of
heroism of the Velama chieftains, of Prataparudra, of Krishnadevaraya and
Paapaaraaya of Bobbili. Then follows a bout of pessimism about the present; followed
by a lamentation over the loss of prosperity of the Reddy kings. His only
consolation is an awareness of the heroism of Reddies, Kapus, Kammas, etc.
Alternately eulogising and lamenting over the kingdoms of Vijayanagar,
Warangal, Kondaveedu, the present decadent state of Andhras is criticised. Palanadu
is touched upon. Then his thoughts turn to the greater Andhra and the influence
Telugus had over Maharashtra and Bengal nearer home; and Sumatra and Borneo in
the Far East. Another bout of criticism on the internecine quarrels, cultural
unawareness, and hand-to-mouth existence of Andhras. He closes on a query
regarding the present decadent state. What caused it? A wrong note in the
chanting of Veda? Loss of chastity in women? Dereliction of duty on the part of
Brahmins? Or is it that Andhravishnu is angry? These are but references to the
poet’s scale of values so devoutly cherished! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

story of the destruction of Nisumbha by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Andhravishnu

to the first stage after catharsis. In Indian literature it is <i

cognitive-experience-base called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sattvaapatti,

a boy by one Yaksha called, Saata. This boy being borne by Saata in the form of
a lion came to be called Saatavaahana. He is the founder of the famous era
named after him. This story recaptures some of the beauties of
Dushyantopakhyana in Nannaya’s Andhra Mahabharata. This has an ontological base
reference to what is called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sadyahparanirvriti
</i>in literature and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Samsaktinaamika </i>in
metaphysics. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gautamiputra Saatakarni </i>describes
the defeat of Nahapaana Mahakshatrapa of Saurashtra at the hands of Saatakarni
resulting in the stabilisation d Andhra suzerainty. Its ontological base
reference is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kaantaasammitatva </i>in
literature and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padaartha bhaavana </i>in
metaphysics. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Maadhava Varma </i>is a
dramatic poem which describes the sense of justice displayed by the king of
that name. He had to put his own son to death for having caused the death of a
youth under the wheel of his chariot howsoever unintentionally. Even the Gods
were so pleased at the king’s sense of justice that there occurred a <i

emotional experience alternated by stupefaction and cognitive experience. <i

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nannayabhattu </i>gives a word-picture of
the beginning of translation of Mahabharata into Telugu at the court of

whose progeny flowered into the Kakatiya dynasty. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

own son in a blinding religious fervor. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kondaveeti
Pogamabbulu </i>(The cloudlets of Kondaveedu) is a piece of pure poetry,
effervescent yet reverberating. Thematically it is a song of loyalty with
haunting melody and distilled charm. It recaptures with a rare <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>finesse </i>the historical glory of
Kondaveedu kings. This piece is justly famous and is everyone’s favourite. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chandravanka Yuddhamu </i>describes the
vindication of honour of a proud horse in Palanaadu. It almost led to a real
fight between two friends and had to be resolved by a mock-killing. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Yamadamstrica </i>(The fang of death)
describes how Aliya Ramaraya succeeded in taking the fort of Kalyani.
Unsuccessful for a month, Ramaraya early one night threw his gem-studded sword,
in the presence of his commanders, over the ramparts making it fall inside the
fort. The commanders were surprised at this. Ramaraya asked “What kind of a
king am I with my sword in the enemy’s camp?” Sadasivanayaka of Kaladipura
undertook to retrieve it and lo! by the next morning the fort had fallen! Such
was the initiative of the Telugu kings and commanders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of great merit. His acute powers of observation, sensibility and verbal etching
can be seen vividly in this work. Just as he interpreted the Telugu land in
terms of its Vedic heroism and spirituality, he interprets the seasons in
Telugu land in terms of its mundane activity. For each season he gives something
like a monochrome, unforgettable for its vividness. Thus in <i

fields–common sights in Andhra–come for a fine description. During <i

various crops of the season on drylands, the homeward cows, the daffodils, the
slight chill, the moon, the buffalo-ride of the Kapu boy, the Panchama girl,

sugar-canes and the daffodils. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sisira </i>the
fright of chill affords the people a little pleasure also. People smear ghee on
their lips, oil on their bodies. Cocoanut oil freezes. Clothes get cold. Warming
up for carnal pleasures alone drives the chill away. The tobacco, green-gram

chill while the ants lay their eggs. Inimitable in its style, content and

undertones <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sringaara Veedhi </i>employs
both the subjective and objective modes of narration. The topic with the

His lust knows no bounds. He wishes every creeper, deer, cuckoo become a woman.
Obsessed thus one day he meets a woman and craves her company. The woman with
the clothing of death, swording looks, snaky plait of hair and poisonous
glamour is willing. They indulge themselves in the sex play. It was all heat,
fire of kisses and the dance of Death. In shameless nudity their amatory game
goes on. Krishna casually asks her name. She mumbles something. He hears only
the word Maaya! And lo! the disenchantment comes! The Sun and the Moon shine in
his eyes. A third eye appears between his eyebrows. The blind lust is burnt
out. This is one of the most powerful pieces of Viswanatha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a small stream that conjoins the mighty Godavari somewhere before it touches
Bhadrachalam, the well-known pilgrim centre of Andhra. According to the outline
of the story conceived by the poet Kinnera, ill-treated and stigmatised by her
mother-in-law, leaves home. Her husband goes and entreats her to come back. The
sensitive girl unable to bear the accusation, melts away in his arms in anger
and sorrow into the form of a stream. For the rest the composition is a series
of lyrics in eight parts, which describe its origin, its gait, its dance, its
music, the tides of the sea, Kinnera’s sorrow, its confluence with Godavari and
its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vaibhava. </i>At the surface level
the conjugal affection of a Telugu girl, her desires and ambitions, her
chastity, her devotion and piety form the subject matter. Kinnera’s helpful
service to pilgrims to Bhadrachalam ends the poem. But it is also a fact the
poet has treated Kinnera as a symbol of Telugu, its sweetness, plasticity,
music, etc. The Telugu poesy that was Viswanatha’s Kinnera also has culminated
into <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Srimadramayanakalpavriksha </i>which
earned him the award from Bharatiya Jnan Pith in 1973. It is also a known fact

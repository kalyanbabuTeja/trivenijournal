is a singular trait of the Westerner to preserve in print memories of persons
whom he admires or holds dear, however little the information he is able to
glean of them. The Indian feels no such strong inducement to write the lives of
great men whom he regards as his ideals in life. On the other hand we are often
told that the very heroes have laid a ban on those coming after them, not to
attempt any such biography. Our sense of reverence for the departed is so very
great that we do not violate their wishes. Perhaps, we are more ready to
respect their wishes in this than in any other matter. Again, we hear of the
complaint that is usually laid against the heroes themselves, that they have
not left regular diaries or connected correspondence, which alone form the most
valuable part of a biography, apart from </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>other contemporary
sources of writing of record. True, that a </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

magnitude, characteristic of an earlier century in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>, needs all the materials to
swell the pages. But, if we view biography with the moderns like Andre <span
class=SpellE>Maurois</span> and <span class=SpellE>Lytton</span> <span
class=SpellE>Strachey</span>, as a work of art, we may have to eschew a lot of

great men like <span class=SpellE>Gopala</span> Krishna Gokhale have not left
adequate materials in the shape of correspondence and diaries.</span> But
Srinivasa Sastri, despite his master’s strict injunctions of ‘no biography,
please’, made some efforts to reconstruct the life from what little he gathered
from available records as well as his own personal contact. Within a small
canvas Sastri has filled adequate art that keeps us absorbed in the lessons of
that life. Certainly he could have expanded the theme, if only to receive
greater appreciation of his inimitable presentation of the subject. But judging
from what we have, however limited in form, the earnestness and sincerity of
the true patriot in Gokhale have been brought into sufficient prominence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

gave, in ‘The Story of my Experiments with Truth’ his first impression of
Gokhale thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

totally different after Independence that we can hardly comprehend, at this

contribution to the freedom struggle. I am not now dealing with the main work
of Gokhale. I shall only <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span> to throw a
sidelight on his noble life. Fortunately for<i> </i>me, I have in my possession
some letters written by him to my late father with whom an unusual bond of
affection closely knit him. Sastri has alluded to the bond of affection that
subsisted between Krishnaswami Aiyar and Gokhale. He quotes Gokhale’s words: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

failed him at the last minute. Not only did he refuse to disclose their
identity, in fairness to them, but he even tendered an apology to the
authorities. Apart from what any other </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Gokhale did not see eye to eye with Tilak in the methods he advocated for
winning ‘freedom for the country. Nor was Gokhale imbued with the same fiery

divergences in their outlook and action. Still Gokhale’s innate gentleness,
forbearance and balance helped him easily to overcome prejudices and even
contradictions in persons with whom he had to measure swords. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his fondness for, one of my sisters, who is now no more, knew no bounds, and

that, to his own two daughters after the death of his wife, he could hardly pay
any attention. Sastri in his own restrained manner narrates an episode which
moves us to the depths. When Gokhale was staying in <span class=SpellE>Triplicane</span>
with Sastri, as guest, a wire came from Poona that his second daughter was very
ill. For a few brief moments, Gokhale seemed unable to decide whether to leave
his political work and go home to the sick-bed of his child. He seemed, he
said, to hear his own child half-reproachfully saying: “What have I known of a
father’s love and care!” The poor girl did not survive that illness, and that

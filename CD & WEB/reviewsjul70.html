tracing the history of Gandhiji’s forebears and their antecedents as well as
their upbringing in the religious atmosphere of those periods of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s exclusiveness from an outer wide world,
the first chapter of the book naturally deals with the times which preceded the
British conquest of <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>. The early contact
with the ruling house of one of the smaller principalities, <span class=SpellE>Porbandar</span>,
gave the family of Gandhiji its status among the folk of the times. The
influences of Jain religion were responsible for the later development of
Gandhiji’s proneness to fasts and <span class=SpellE><i>padayaatras</i></span><i>.
</i>Also the Christian Missionary’s work of conversion alienated the sympathies
of Gandhiji towards the religion, though Christian ethics easily attracted him
from the first. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

form of idealistic monism that reconciles all differences and dualities in a <span

non-dualism, but dualistic non-dualism closely resembling the system of <span

inscrutable power of <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place> and the logically
inconceivable nature of the relation of difference in non-difference. While <span

between God and the finite spirits as also between God and the world as natural
and logically explicable, the teachers of the Bengal school of <span

difference-in-non-difference, though undeniable on scriptural grounds, is not

he manages to survive at all, is taken for an eccentric–the more uncompromising
he is the more cranky he would be deemed to be. Nor should it be a matter for
wonder to anyone who keeps his eyes and ears open. Gone by are the days of
great editors in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>

the <span class=SpellE>Rothermeres</span> and the rest of the Press barons had
taken due care about this. So is the case almost everywhere in the world. In <st1:country-region

himself a square peg in the round hole of a conservative sort of liberal
newspaper, whose self-righteousness he could not share. Lucky it was that the
Directors of <i>New Statesman </i>(J. Maynard Keynes and Arnold Bennett,
besides Shaw and the <span class=SpellE>Webbs</span>, who were the founders)
were looking for a successor to Clifford Sharp who had drunk himself out of the
job and Martin was badly in need of it just at that time. But, as it so
happened, it was not merely a professional job for him. He ate, drank, slept
and lived with it till 1960, when he retired from the paper. He retired from

Commercial success, however, came to it as a natural by-product and not worked
for as the only end in its life. <i>New Statesman </i>established itself as the
voice of Radicalism and dissent in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

work for, if one was on the National Executive as well. It made a nice and
precise conflict of loyalty between truth and ideas on the one side, and
practical possibilities on the other. These are, of course, the essence of
politics; and this dialectic of Kingsley’s between idea and practice is the
central problem of politics. He was in on the central problem, and yet he was
tackling it in a way that bore no relation to what we thought practical, and in
so doing he was helping to create a social climate, within which change could
take place. This was the art of Kingsley: ideas as a solvent of the
establishment, ideas to debunk, ideas to corrode established authority...This
was the attitude that made the <i>New Statesman </i>the most exciting paper to
write for. I think myself, therefore, that he was the greatest of our

culture here stands for “the essence of the traditional culture in India at the
end of Indo-British convection, a culture of rigid and narrow caste or class
superiority, subservient attitudes to authority, and static attitudes towards
change in thought, systems and relationships. Its roots are partly in Hindu
History and partly in Muslim and British Governments in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>, and they spring from an
ancient and heterogeneous past.” The modern or industrial culture on the other
hand is “essentially international, not village or caste-based in its social
motivations. It is scientific, rational; it is achievement-oriented and it
acknowledges not a hard hierarchy but <span class=GramE>a mobile</span> elite
of intellect, skills, and wealth or material advancement which is its
objective.” <span class=GramE>The means that the author prescribes to bridge
this gulf is shedding of our static culture and acquiring the world “<span

study, or who is alive to the latest developments in his field Like the politicians,

topics like Science and Technology, Decision making, Inter-disciplinary skills,
Organisation building and Mass communications, wherein he draws our attention
to the drawbacks in our modern set-up. Many of his remarks are noteworthy. “They
put political or policy decisions first and leave the technical work to suit
those decisions.” “Political attitudes have substituted scientific ones.” “The
planners have failed to see that there can be economic growth without macro-
economics, but with a great deal of micro-economics as in <st1:country-region

though they are untouchables. His confidence that God does not render undue
harm to him is shattered by the death of his own beautiful young wife and child

struggle for freedom. Although his contribution towards an understanding of the

his work as a whole will be possible until his writings on sociological and
economic affairs are viewed in the right perspective. Here it will be relevant
to review a recent publication entitled. <span class=GramE>‘Facets of Gandhi’.</span>
This collection of articles on Gandhi can be described as a combination of commentary
and sermon. The commentary<span class=GramE>– <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>derived</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>from <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

and Prof. <span class=SpellE>Yamunacharya</span>–includes some aspects of <span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> thought ranging from a discussion of means and
ends in politics to an understanding of the impact of the Gita on the Mahatma.
The sermon–based on the articles of contemporaries like <span class=SpellE>Pyarelal</span>,
Rajendra Prasad, <span class=SpellE>Diwakar</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kripalani</span>–is
on the text of the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> dispensation which not
only unveils the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>vistas </span>of a
new world order, but also suggests that the action of the Government of India
ought to be conditioned by the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> ethic! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is not generally known that Gandhiji was a man of taste. For example, Nehru’s
comment on Gandhi is less than fair: “Gandhiji had little sense of beauty or
artistry in man-made objects, though he admired natural beauty.” “My room may
have blank walls,” he wrote, “and I may even dispense with the roof so that I
may gaze upon the starry heavens overhead that stretch in an unending star
expanse of beauty. What conscious art of man can give me the panoramic scenes
that open out before me when I look to the sky above?” “This, however,” he
added, “does not mean that I refuse to accept the value of productions of art
but only that I personally feel how inadequate they are compared with the
eternal symbols of beauty in Nature.” It is this feeling for beauty which he
expressed in his impassioned response to the <st1:place w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place>:
“I was charmed with the natural scenery and bowed my head in reverence to our
ancestors for their sense of the beautiful in nature, and for their foresight
in investing the beautiful manifestations of nature with religious
significance. His response to the concept of tree worship is equally
impassioned: “I find in it deep pathos and poetic beauty, It symbolizes true reverence
for the entire vegetable kingdom which, with its endless panorama of beautiful
shapes and forms, declares to us as it were with a million tongues the
greatness and glory of God.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Gandhi’s
technophobia was based on an aesthetic view of ancient and mediaeval Indian
civilization. He believes that earthen lamps were beautiful than electric
lights. This approach is reminiscent of <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span>
nostalgia for “the beauty and the logic” of the authentically Indian way of
life. It is hardly surprising that Gandhiji was critical of the factory age which
ushered in an era of ugliness and alienation. It is a view of life which has been
<span class=SpellE>analysed</span> in depth by <span class=SpellE>Ananda</span>
<span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy</span>. For <span class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span>
thesis is based on the argument that the cultural cleavage between East and
West became pronounced in the wake of the Renaissance. Indeed <span
class=SpellE>Coomaraswamy’s</span> world view which encompassed the insights of
Plato, Meister <span class=SpellE>Eckhart</span>, Buddha and <span
class=SpellE>Anandavardhana</span>, was a more sophisticated <span class=GramE>version<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>of</span> Gandhi’s emphasis on <span
class=SpellE>teraditional</span> Indian view which did not set up barriers
between arts and crafts. In the ultimate analysis, Gandhi’s aesthetic approach
to life was derived from ethical foundations. <span class=GramE>For he defined
art as “the mirror of truth “.</span> Furthermore he explained that “when man begins
to see beauty in truth, true art arises.” And just as Gandhi’s non-violence was
inspired by the ethical idealism <span class=GramE>the of</span> the Buddha, so
was Gandhi’s aesthetic view influenced by the Buddha who observed that the
essence of the good life consists of the “contemplation of the beautiful.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

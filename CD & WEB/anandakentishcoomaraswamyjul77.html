be critical is not to be non-creative; to be intellectual is not to be
unaesthetic. Critical acumen enhances the creative ability while intellectual
analysis increases the aesthetic sensibility. The scientific observation does
in no way diminish the artistic introspection. Dr Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy
was a living harmony of these apparently-opposite pairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

conventionally-conceived antitheses had found in Dr Coomaraswamy a lovely as
well as lively synthesis. He was a scientist, a literary artist, a remarkable
linguist, a celebrated art-critic, a philosopher, a scholar and what not? He
was, in short, a living embodiment of all that was culture., Nothing was beyond
the horizons of his reach. Whatever he touched had turned into light; whatever
he felt was transformed into delight. He was a supergenius! He is acclaimed as
modern Plato! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

him the nationalism and internationalism co-existed; in him patriotism and
pan-humanism did blend into each other. Dr. Coomaraswamy was, a traditionalist
in art-theories, yet he was antagonist of modern art. The very source of his
birth was a unity amidst diversity. His father was a Ceylonese Indian by name
Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy and his mother an English woman, Lady E. C. Coomaraswamy.
Later, Ananda Coomaraswamy married an American woman by name Dona Luisa (later
Mrs. Shilamani Dona Luisa Coomaraswamy). Thus his birth and life were full of
international significance. Literally he was an internationalist, for he knew
many of the world’s languages–English, French, German, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit,
Pali, Italian, Spanish, Leelandic, Duetch, Persian, Tamil, Sinhalese, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr. Coomaraswamy was
born in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) on the 22nd of August 1877. He was educated in
England where he took English the degree of Doctor of Science in Geology. Later
he served in Ceylon in the Minerological Department as its first Director.
After some years he eliminated the post and dedicated himself to cultural
pursuits especially Indian art, including Ceylon’s art. His true unfoldment of
genius as well as name and fame made its advent after he had joined the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts in U. S. A., as the Keeper of Indian and Oriental Art. He
was a veritable bridge between the Orient and the Occident. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his retirement he was planning to come to India and settle in the Himalayas
along with his family. But the inevitable death had annihilated all his future
dreams. He breathed his last on the 9th of September 1947. No physical death
could cause any harm to such immortal celebrities like Dr Ananda Kentish
Coomaraswamy who lives in the light of his innumerable luminous achievements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguished services in the sphere of Asiatic art, in general, and the study
of Indian art, in particular, have been unique and stand as an immortal
monument in the history of Indian art criticism. His profound exposition of
Indian classical art has not merely enabled the Western connoisseurs to
appreciate Indian art but also opened the otherwise-closed petals of the Indian
hearts so that they could vibrate to the vivant rhythm of Indian sculpture and
the enchanting tune of Indian painting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr
Coomaraswamy was once amazed at the utter ignorance of the Indian educated
persons towards the existence of their cultural treasures. He observes in his
“Art and Swadeshi,” “A well-educated Indian professional man once asked me,
‘what is a Sufi?’ On another occasion a well-known nationalist enquired ‘What
is a Gopi?’ Little use to think of an ‘Indian people’ when such are the fruits
of Indian education!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
doubt, Indian culture alone is not the only unique culture and yet, if an
Indian of higher education happens to be ignorant of his own culture and knows
more about the cultures of other countries, that too superficially, is not
tolerable. It resembles the utterance of Jesus the Christ “What shall profit a
man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” Such ignorance of
the Indian educated elite had annoyed Coomaraswamy’s sensitive heart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In fact, Coomaraswamy was not a victim of narrow national
and racial bigotry and yet he was not a hypocrite belittling the cultural glory
of his own country. Awareness of one’s national cultural treasures would
enhance one’s awareness of the cultural treasures of other lands too. Nationalism
is the stepping-stone to internationalism, Knowledge of the greatness of one’s
own individuality would enable one to know the greatness of other individuals. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was a marvellous interpreter of the mysteries of the Indian Shilpa Shastras or
the cannons of Indian art; these scholarly interpretations have indeed created
a new place of honour as well as admiration in the minds of the Western
intelligentsia. More than a half a century back Indian art was a mere curio in
the Western eyes. The abnormal anatomy, the peculiar mannerisms and the absence
of perspective of Indian art were seen with ludicrous eyes in the Western
countries. This improper understanding of Indian art was, no doubt, not due to
any sort of national or racial prejudices, but due to lack of study of Indian
cultural environment amidst which those works of art were produced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Coomaraswamy’s erudition in diverse fields of knowledge was unique. He knew not
merely the physics but also the metaphysics, not only the logical reasoning but
also the psychological stimulus and response, not only the facts of geology but
also the fiction of mythology. This vast and profound knowledge had helped him
in the deep and proper study of Indian art. His literary style <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is vivid and impressive. He was not confined
to the use of either exclusively short sentences or exclusively long sentences.
He used both of them with equal dexterity according to the content and the
degree of emotional fervour. Whatever sentences he wrote, wrote with scientific
precision and yet with aesthetic appeal. At times his prose creates the
illusion of poetry. In the realm of art criticism, literary craftsmanship is a </span><i

master literary craftsman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

India we could not escape the conviction that sexual love has a deep and
spiritual significance. There <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>nothing with which we can better
compare the ‘mystic union’ of the finite with its infinite ambient–the one
experience which proves itself and is the only ground of faith–than the self-oblivion
of the earthly lovers locked in each other’s arms, where ‘each is both’.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is indeed a very powerful yet sensitive style. His writings concerning art
criticism are rather prosaic in style while his general writings on human
interests are literary in style and akin to poetic expression. His literary
talents are best displayed in his writings on mystic subjects. They are poetry
expressed in the disguise of prose! He is again a fine blending of materialism
and mysticism. He was not credulous, for his life’s background was of
scientific realism and at the same time he was a mystic, for his intimate
contacts with the mysteries of fine arts, his studies of esoteric subjects and
eventually his aesthetic fervour had enabled him to cherish an affinity with
things mystic. He wrote, “It is not till the ear ceases to hear the outside
world, that it is open to the music in the heart, the flute of Krishna.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
it was not his mystic propensities, nor his literary talents, nor his
linguistic achievements which had made him known to the world but it was his
art criticism, especially the interpretation of Indian sculpture and painting
to the West that made him a celebrity. None can claim of appreciating an alien
work of art unless he is acquainted with the cultural traditions of that nation
which has produced it. Sometimes it would be possible, to some extent, to
appreciate the formal beauties of a work of art even without any familiarity
with its cultural history. But formal beauty alone is not all that is to be
appreciated in a work of art. Even if we assume that form is everything in a
work of visual art, we are not, at times, able to fully appreciate even the
form without having a rudimentary knowledge of the mannerisms as well as its
cultural background. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, the form has got no independent existence apart from idea. Every visual
form is, in one way or another, associated with some idea as every idea is
associated with some visual form. Hence form and idea are interdependent like
seed and plant. The sight of every known form would immediately create in the
beholder some idea. It is in order to avoid this idea from the pure form that
the creators of abstract art have tried and continue to try to create forms
that neither resemble nor represent any familiar object of the phenomenal
world. Thus representation has turned into distortion and distortion into
abstraction. Indian traditional sculpture and painting are not genuine
representations nor pure abstractions; they are distortions to some extent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the versatile genius of Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy which had interpreted to
the puzzled West the mysteries underlying the apparently distorted form of
Indian art, both painting and sculpture in addition to the decorative motifs.
His activities in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

could really be acclaimed as the foremost Museum in that continent which
possesses the richest collections of Asiatic arts. The Indian section was
opened in this Museum in 1917. Dr. Coomaraswamy presented his magnificent
collection of Indian art to this Indian section in addition to the still more
magnificent collection of Dr Ross. The Indian section of the Boston Museum has
been a highly representative one of all the phases of Indian art–painting,
sculpture, industrial arts, crafts, folk arts, etc. All schools of Indian
classical art have found their place in this Museum under the
scholarly-cum-aesthetic guidance of Dr. Coomaraswamy. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

the Rajput paintings are lyrical. In those days Ajanta frescoes were well-known
throughout the world, whereas the Rajput paintings with their resplendent
lineal-cum-chromatic charm were little-known. The credit of popularising the
Rajput painting goes to Ananda Coomaraswamy who had first made the

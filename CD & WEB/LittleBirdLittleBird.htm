</SUP><P>Little bird, little bird, will you return to me?</P>
<P>Little bird, little bird, will you not remember</P>
<P>The little pleasant autumn hour?</P>
<P>Little bird, little bird, will you not remember </P>
<P>My breath which has mingled with the wind?</P>
<P>No, no, my little one, you will fly away I know;</P>
<P>You will fly away with the first coming of the summer wind </P>
<P>And disappear from my poor forsaken world.</P>
<P>Stay awhile, therefore, little thing; for once</P>
<P>Let me look at you.</P>
<P>See this little scar you made on my wrist when you</P>
<P>First came to me, little bird . . .?</P>
<P>The scar will remain: but you will be away.</P>
<P>Forget me, little bird, in the great wide world</P>
<P>And fly away. </P>
<P>But stay awhile, and accept this tearful farewell</P>
<P>Little bird . . .</P></DIR>

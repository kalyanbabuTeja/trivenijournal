subjects without reference to notes. His phenomenal memory is only equaled by
his eloquence and it is illumined by his profound scholarship and ample topical
reference. His style of speaking without notes is not confined to ceremonial
functions, but extends to academic performances also. His six <span

Buddha, the president, while thanking him, said that the lecture, on the

his <span class=SpellE>Hibbert</span> lectures, <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span>
propounded his system of philosophy, which is based on <span class=SpellE>Sankara’s</span>
Vedanta. Some critics express the view that <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span>
has no distinct system of his own, as Russell, Whitehead or James. Professor <span
class=SpellE>Muirhead’s</span> reply to the critics is a fitting answer: “It is
<span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan’s</span> modesty that disclaims any
originality for the views his books expound. But if originality in philosophy,
as in poetry, consists not in the novelty of the <i>tale </i>(matter), not even
in the distribution of light and shade in the telling of it, but in the depth
with which its significance is grasped and made to dominate over the details,
his book never fails in this quality.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

assessed the great stature of Buddha, by interpreting his message not as
nihilism but as the finest type of “applied metaphysics” and as the most
remarkable form of ethical idealism. His excellent translation and edition of
the <span class=SpellE>Dhammapada</span> bears testimony to this. He has
reconciled the two great religions, Buddhism and Hinduism, lifting them from
their traditional antagonism and mutual intolerance. He has claimed back Buddha
into the Hindu heritage, by his power of argument, against the opposition of
the orthodox <span class=SpellE>Vedantins</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

instrument of social regeneration. In almost all his speeches and writings, he
has put forth the ideal of the Religion of the Spirit. He has inveighed against
the false dogmatic religions that make for heterodoxy, blasphemy, cruelty,
convention and other evils. The function of true religion is to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>foster
humanist ideals and world-unity. It must <span class=SpellE>harmonise</span>
the claims of the mind, heart and spirit. Religion is the response of the total
nature of man. Technology and science have made the unity of the world a
possibility, but to make it actual is the role of religion. Religion is not
mere faith, it is conduct also. It is dynamic, not quiescent. It helps us to
transform our life and gives us a new outlook. It banishes disquiet, anguish,
sense of aimlessness from our fragile and fugitive existence. <span
class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span> believes that at the core of all religions
there is a wide field of agreement. This field of agreement he calls the
Religion of the Spirit: other savants call it ‘eternal gospel’ or ‘perennial
philosophy’. It is only such a pure religion that can reduce the world’s
tensions. We have to build from inside, and a true faith alone can engender
tolerance and fellow-feeling. <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan</span> holds
that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has, in her religion, and her traditional national temperament, such an
outlook. She should revive it. By it she can save herself from moral and
spiritual crisis, and hold out a model to the rest </span><span

book, ‘Eastern Religions <span class=GramE>And</span> Western Thought,’
published when he was a Professor at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>
in 1939. The book was hailed in the Times Literary Supplement as a book which
indicated a turning-point in religion. With added emphasis, these ideas are
again reiterated in his book, ‘Recovery of Faith in the World Perspective’
series (1954). <span class=GramE>In his book ‘East and West’ (1955) he records
his reflections on the relations of the East and the West.</span> He pleads for

Buddha, <st1:place w:st="on">Krishna</st1:place>, Gandhi, etc. His work in the
field of comparative religion, and his earnest <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>

brief, the outlines of his philosophy may be described as ‘Spiritual Humanism’.
He believes in the existence of an ABSOLUTE which is posited on the authority
of the scriptures, and affirmed by spiritual experience. The absolute is
dynamic; it is manifested progressively in Matter, Soul, World and God. God is
the Absolute in the personal form, in the world-context. Every soul is divine
in nature. The individual’s soul reaches its consummation in ‘God-union’,
through his works, meditation and <i>Bhakti. </i>He does not believe that the
world is unreal. To him spiritual realisation does not mean loss of
individuality or ceasing to do any work. He believes in the power of intuition,
and to him intuition is not anti or contra-intellectual. It is a higher form of
consciousness, to discern Reality. “We discover by intuition and prove by
logic.” He supports his metaphysics at every step with arguments and evidence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

central philosophical category in his idealism is the primacy of the Spirit,
and its manifestation in matter, life, mind and self. The Spirit is not a
homogeneous, non-composite entity like the <i>Brahman </i>of <span
class=SpellE>Sankara</span>. It is not the <i>Substance </i>of Hegel. It is
dynamic energy, not immobility. It is something real in itself, and by itself,

It is not physical body or the vital organism, or the mind or the will, but
something which underlies them all and sustains them. It is the basis and
background of our being, the universality that cannot be reduced to this or to
that formula.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of God and the world in <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan’s</span> system. God
is not the mere appearance of the Absolute but is the very Absolute in the

Concept of intuition is central to <span class=SpellE>Radhakrishnan’s</span>
idealism. Intuition is wisdom transcendent, it is different from intellectual
knowledge, yet not discontinuous with it. It is not contra-intellectual but
trans-intellectual. It is not an instinct. “It is not a shoddy sentiment or
pathological fancy fit for cranks and dancing dervishes.” It is the <span
class=SpellE>bonafide</span> discovery of Reality. It is the response of the
whole man to reality. Intellect, emotion and will are fragmentary aspects, and
intuition is their totality. Great scientific inventions, literary productions,
artistic achievements, and moral reforms, are all touched by the spirit and
rooted in intuition. “We discover by intuition and explain by logic.” Spiritual
intuition is another name for mystical experience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bharati, the Tamil bard, has greater need in recent years to be saved from his
aggressive admirers. If once, as has been too often deplored, he suffered from
too severe a neglect, he suffers even more acutely today from excessive
attention from all and sundry. Rabindranath Tagore said in one of his epistles:
“It is far better for a poet to miss his reward in this life rather than have a
false reward or have his reward in an excessive measure.” No profounder
observation is required to bear out a similar fate for Bharati at the hands of
the Tamil enthusiasts of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the case of Bharati his active participation, though for a short time, in the
political struggle for freedom and his early upsurge of patriotic songs have
gained him readier response and the consequential wider popularity which,
perhaps, had he remained a mere poet and writer of distinction, he could not
have received in an equal degree. Even after so much of recognition and honour
done to his memory, as evinced in the annual celebrations and in the raising of
monuments for him, there is hardly any serious study of his poetry and his
writings with a view to assessing him honestly and with profit to literary
criticism. It is in this context that we feel a sense of deep gratitude to Sri
P. Mahadevan for his venture of a critical appreciation of Bharati, his times
and his writings. <sup>1</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Within
a compass of one hundred and eighty odd pages Sri Mahadevan has compressed
material pertaining to the incidents of the poet’s life and achievements, the
history of the times, critical appreciation of his works and a representative
collection of Bharati’s writings in English translation (Appendix I). The
agreeable surprise is that the author has succeeded within a narrow span in
supplying us with not only good matter gathered with diligence and
discrimination from various sources (mentioned in the Bibliography), but also
fresh criticism which makes for the present volume’s special attraction. There
have been books already from experienced writers on Bharati both in Tamil and
in English, but few have really chosen to measure true merit with adequate
equipment and judgment. Sri Mahadevan has done real service, therefore, in
providing us a penetrative study and a sound appraisal of Bharati’s claim to be
ranked among the immortals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the outset we are indebted to Sri Mahadevan for his chapter entitled ‘Poet and
Patron’ in which he has narrated </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with consummate
brevity how Bharati’s genius received recognition as early as the year 1907
from a discerning publicist of Madras, the late V. Krishnaswami Aiyar. Perhaps,
there is not much merit in a later generation’s discovery of Bharati after his
attainment of an established reputation. It redounds to the lasting glory of
that early patron to have not only predicted a great future for the bard but to
have suspended all narrow prejudices against a political opponent in adjudging
of his poetic merit. There were, no doubt, a few contemporaries of the poet
like the late Dr. M. C. Nanjunda Row of Mylapore not finding any reference here
but who deserve, under any circumstances, notice in any narrative of the poet’s
times. “Police Krishnaswami Aiyar” referred to in this book is none else than
Rao Bahadur A. Krishnaswami Aiyar of revered memory whose appreciation of Tamil
devotional songs led him always to help Tamil singers and poets, however
unknown they may be to the world. It was he who in a great measure was
responsible for Bharati’s escape from the clutches of Government spies and C.
I. D. dogs. There are certain minor points requiring slight correction such as
Bepin Chandra Pal’s addressing gatherings at Tilak Ghat. For, during those
years, we are told beach meetings that he addressed were opposite a hotel on
the marina adjacent to Mani lyer’s residence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the whole, Sri Mahadevan has faithfully followed accounts in recognized books
on Bharati’s life, and if there should be slight variation in details here and
there from stories that are current, his responsibility for them is negligible,
if not nil. Again, should there be any difference in present-day inferences and
estimates of what Bharati’s exact motives were in particular situations and
contexts, Sri Mahadevan may have to be totally absolved of any personal bias or
predilection for any representation made by him, as everything that he has
given us traces its source to the extant literature on Bharati.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
chapter on ‘Bharati’s Circle’ is prefaced carefully with the remarks: “It is a
misnomer to speak of a Bharati Circle, for it implies that he was the centre of
it. Just as Goldsmith belonged to the Johnson Circle, and yet had a personality
and individuality of his own, so did Bharati succeed in preserving an identity
not merely separate and unimpaired but also in developing it creatively under
stimulating conditions.” The chapter promises interesting prospects of a
fruitful study. But, no doubt, even as the author himself has devoted more
pages to the poet’s exile in Pondicherry, the significance of episodes connected
with the Poet’s inspiration is only found in that chapter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nearly
fifty pages have been set apart for dwelling upon Bharati’s works and,
legitimately too, much criticism that Sri Mahadevan has levelled is in effect
more at the analysis of his poems by the early publishers, which bears no
relation in fact to their chronological order or, for that matter, any
recognised method of classification. But as the author has owned without
hesitation that the main corpus of Bharati’s works in a clean text is available,
there is no bar to a searching examination of it from a critical or expository
standpoint. Bharati’s prose has also received from the critic a succinct but
illuminating chapter. The remark, “A poet’s handling of the prose medium–that
other harmony–will carry tell-tale marks of fancy or imagination no less than
of the arresting word or phrase,” contains enough to suggest the quality of
Bharati’s numerous short articles in journals supplying ample sidelights on
various aspects of life in an age of political serfdom and social inhibitions.
Bharati’s prose-poetry as well as his English writings have also received
significant reactions from the pen of Mahadevan. He says: “Pride of place
should be given to Bharati’s rendering in English version of a few of his own
poems. Some of them are in wonderfully compact verse forms, not merely without
a flaw but with a polished brilliance which is a joy to contemplate.” We can
vouch for such a satisfaction awaiting us always, when authentic poets with a
capacity to express in another language take to rendering their original works
in it. Have we not had similar examples of Tagore’s own English translations
from his Bengali writings?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
last chapter ‘Conclusions’ strikes a sound note before finishing: “Bharati was
in a grand tradition because of his familiarity with the mighty minds of old.
Even if he should be deemed a Tamil classic by the coming generations, a full
appreciation of the formative influences on his genius would involve a pretty
close knowledge of a considerable body of Sanskrit Literature.” Sri Mahadevan
makes this observation with characteristic restraint. Let us add, without any
fear of offending interested circles, that many of Bharati’s ideas were born of
an intense appreciation of Sanskrit literary masterpieces and an unusual taste
for Vedic poetry. If present-day zeal for Bharati would consider<o:p></o:p></span></p>

can also point out that Bharati’s ‘Panchali Sapatham’ is more or less a
faithful rendering of the original Mahabharata, though stanzas describing
nature’s beauty here and there find their birth in the poet’s own imagination.
To prove Bharati’s adoration of Sanskrit, we need make no apology for quoting
one passage from his prose writings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“There
is a word <i>Dhairya </i>meaning courage in Sanskrit. Courage is the natural
quality of the brave. If we examine the root of the word <i>Dhih </i>it will
connote also intellect. The Sanskrit language bears the same root for both the
courageous man as well as the man of intellect. Hence <i>Dhairaya </i>means
also intellectual. Thus it becomes creditable for a language that it should
retain expressiveness in a single word for two ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

us refer to some other points made by Sri Mahadevan. He has clearly indicated
how in India the poet, seer and philoso</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pher are not quite
different, how the poet easily transforms himself into the mystic, and how
religion and poetry are one and the same experience. Need we demur at this
none-too-early exposition of India’s spiritual and poetic traditions
commingling, as it were, into one stream from the hoary past? This land of
Alwars and Nayanmars, the quintessence of whose poetry easily revealed their
God-intoxicated experiences, this land of the ecstatic outpourings of a Suka
Brahmam, alchemising every bit of lead and iron into pure gold, needs no fresh
guidance for a poet to burst into devotional songs. That well-established
conceits, so far as aesthetics are concerned, like the Rasa Theory too have
influenced Bharati, evokes little or no surprise from us. What if aestheticians
in other countries have not, in the abstract, analysed the source of enjoyment
of art and arrived at <i>Rasa </i>as its basis? They would reach the same
conclusions, provided they also probe into the very source of enjoyment
resulting from the mind’s impact with art or literature. The wonder is not so
much that our ancients have divined the cause of enjoyment as <i>Rasa, </i>as
that they should have classified enjoyment itself into eight or nine main
facets of the same <i>Rasa. </i>It is only on a par with the analysis and
classification of sound itself into seven notes </span><i><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Mahadevan’s opinion of Bharati’s ‘Kuyil Pattu’ as having reached the peak of
his poetic art will be shared by many others. Even the statement that “the
artistic soul freed from the urgencies and conflicts of mundane existence
floats on a sea of unalloyed happiness,” will receive instantaneous agreement
from many others. But one would just like to make a gentle observation by way
of criticism of that poem that, however delightful it may be, however happily
wedded may be its unforgettable melody with deep meaning, still there is a kind
of vagueness in the poet’s inability to sustain the continuation to a finale of
the story of the Bull and the Monkey, whether you call it sheer allegory or

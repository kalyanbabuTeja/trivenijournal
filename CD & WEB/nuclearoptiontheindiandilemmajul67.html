style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the early months of this year the Indian Government conducted one of the most
unusual and extensive diplomatic exercises it had ever undertaken since India
became free. That this was done to determine India’s final position on the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty shows the tremendous importance attached by
India to the containment–and the ultimate elimination–of the nuclear menace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from other aspects of the treaty, two major issues which have worried India
are: one, a guarantee from the nuclear super powers, Russia and the U. S. A.,
of protection in the event of a nuclear attack or threat from Communist China,
who will included in the Nuclear Club; two, complete freedom to develop nuclear
technology for peaceful purposes without discriminatory limitations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
has been, ever since China set off her first atomic explosion in October 1964,
a continuing debate in India whether we should develop our own independent
nuclear deterrent or not. Pandit Nehru was committed, for humanitarian and
other reasons, to the abjuring of nuclear weapons by India, but at that time
China had not entered the nuclear race. The late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur
Shastri, confronted with the Chinese threat, had to redefine India’s attitude
to nuclear armament. With increasing pressure, particularly from the militant
anti-Pakistan Jan Sangh party, Lal Bahadur tried to find a way out of the
nuclear dilemma by seeking what he described as a nuclear shield or umbrella to
be provided by the nuclear giants if India chose not to manufacture the bomb.
British Premier Wilson was responsive to the proposal, but before it could be
seriously discussed India was engulfed in the war with Pakistan, and other
developments in the country, including the tragic death of Lal Bahadur at
Tashkent, drove the issue to the background. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
draft Russo-American non-proliferation treaty has made the issue of nuclear
protection for India a live subject again. If India is to renounce the right to
make a nuclear deterrent–as required under the non-proliferation treaty–how is
she to be protected from an attack or a threat of attack from China, whose
hostility to India has been manifest since 1962? Should a guarantee of
automatic intervention by the nuclear superpowers be incorporated in the
non-proliferation treaty or should it be provided by independent declarations
by the two powers? How willing are they to give such guarantees and in what
form should these be expressed so that they can be credible in a real
emergency? It was to find out the answers to these questions that Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi sent her special envoy, L. K. Jha, to the capitals of
the Big Powers in April. Mr. Jha is said to have got a sympathetic response to
India’s case in Moscow, Washington and London. In Moscow, it appears, the
Soviet leaders expressed a willingness to issue a declara</span><span

of intent to react appropriately in the event of a nuclear </span><span

to India. The Soviet leaders felt that it was more important to prevent such a
threat from materialising rather than mete out </span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
Washington will fall in with the Soviet view and commit itself to a
declaration, jointly or separately, is not clear. From India’s point of view,
the precise wording of the declaration is very important. A vague assurance of
intervention may not satisfy the Indian Government or its highly vocal critics,
who have been considerably reinforced in the new Parliament, who are pleading
vigorously for Indian self-reliance in defence and other spheres. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
a guarantee from the nuclear giants is forthcoming or not, some military
experts in India are raising the question whether any such guarantee will prove
effective in the event of an attack from China and, secondly, whether such a
guarantee would be compatible with the continued maintenance of India’s
non-alignment stance? The latter problem is not an academic question because if
any nuclear protective guarantee is to be implemented, can it be done without
India giving facilities to either the U. S. or the Soviet Union, or both to
operate missiles from Indian bases? One Indian military expert has pointed out
that the minimum requirement for making the guarantee effective would be the
provision of new airfields, an extension of radar network and communication
lines, and improvement of port facilities. India will have to bear the cost of
all these. A joint guarantee, he urges will call for a joint strategy and the
moment India agrees to this, there will be an end of non-alignment even in the
modified form in which India has adhered to it since the Chinese attack. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
conclusion of this expert is that India should not sign the non-proliferation
treaty and should go in for “a small nuclear deterrent of her own.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>More
may be heard about India’s independent deterrent in the coming months, when the
non-proliferation treaty is presented in its final form for signature. The
pressure on the Indian Government is likely to increase, while the voices that
have hitherto been firmly against India going nuclear may get weaker. Among the
latter, the elder statesman, C. Rajagopalachari, has been the foremost. He has
been unqualifiedly opposed to India’s manufacturing nuclear weapons for
primarily humanitarian reasons. He is not, of course, unconcerned about Indian
security, especially against China. His recipe, however, is simple. He wants
India to have a clear defensive alliance with the West, led by the U. S. A,
which, he feels, is the only barrier to the advancing tide of Communism in
Asia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are, admittedly, large sections of Indian opinion, which for economic and other
reasons, would agree with Rajagopaiachari’s solution and plump for an American
alliance. At the moment </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Government the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>shift to such a stand is unthinkable, unless a
very real and compelling threat–as in 1962–makes it inevitable and acceptable
to the people at large. The predominant Leftist opinion in the country
continues to swear by non-alignment. The pro-Soviet group within the ruling
Congress party is also a big factor to reckon with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the controversy over the choice between a Big Power nuclear guarantee and the
development of an independent deterrent, it is doubtful whether so far all the
relevant facts have been considered or even made known. First of all, an
independent deterrent cannot be considered unless India is in a position
technologically to make the bomb and economically afford the cost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
far as technological capability is concerned, the remarkable progress made by
the Indian Atomic Energy Establishment since 1954, thanks to the vision and
dynamic genius of Dr. Homi Bhabha, has brought India within a group of eight or
nine countries which are immediately capable of making the bomb within a year
or eighteen months from the moment they take the decision. The others in this
group are Canada, Germany, Sweden, Japan, Israel and Switzerland. Indian
scientists designed and built the first Indian reactor of the swimming pool
type in 1956. It was then the first reactor in Asia outside the Soviet Union
and was in operation two years before China had its first reactor, designed and
built by the Soviet Union. Since then India has built two other reactors–the
Canada-India reactor and the Zerlina–and has embarked on the construction of
two atomic power stations, one at Tarapur near Bombay (380 M. W. capacity) and
the other in Rajasthan (200 M. W.). A third atomic power plant is to be
constructed near Madras (400 M. W.). India’s AEC has now got establishments for
the extraction of pure uranium metal (completed in 1957), a heavy water plant
with a capacity of 14.5 tonnes per annum, a plutonium plant at Trombay,
designed and built entirely by Indian engineers and scientists, for
reprocessing irradiated uranium rods to extract plutonium and other fissionable
materials (commissioned in 1965), an electronics division capable of developing
and producing electronic computers, and several technical departments devoted
to research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy in the spheres of health and
agriculture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
in spite of its lead in atomic technology over other Asian countries India
chose to devote herself entirely to the peaceful uses of the atom, it was
because of the deep internationalism of Mr. Nehru and the profound humanism of
Dr. Bhabha. Dr. Bhabha realised, as long ago as 1944, before Hiroshima, that
India’s future as an industrial nation depended on the development of atomic
power. India has the largest reserves of thorium in the world and our long-term
atomic power programme is based on the use of thorium in atomic reactors. At
the same time the country’s known resources of uranium ore and monazite are
being exploited in a big way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>India’s
atomic power programme gives it a built-in nuclear capability which lends an
edge to the present debate over non-proliferation. It has been estimated that
when all the three atomic power plants are commissioned, India will have enough
plutonium annually to<i> </i>make 40-50 bombs. As it is, the plutonium
available can enable India to make two bombs a year. If “a small deterrent” is
adequate for Indian security against China, it would seem that India has the
technical capability to make it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the economics of nuclear armament have not been properly examined at all. In October
1964, Dr. Homi Bhabha mentioned in a broadcast that in terms of destructive
power atomic explosives could be considerably cheaper than corresponding
explosives. He was quoting from an American report on the Engineering
applications of Nuclear Explosives. “A 10 kiloton explosive, equivalent to
10,000 ton, of TNT, according to the report, would cost $350,000, while a two
megaton explosion would cost $ 600,000 or Rs. 3 million. The cost of 2 million
tons of TNT would be Rs. 1,500 million! These figures produced a deceptive
impression in India that an atom bomb of the Hiroshima type would cost Rs. 1.7
million. Dr. Bhabha’s intention, however was to suggest that it might not be
beyond the capacity of many countries to build up a small stockpile of atom bombs
and that because of this possibility it was necessary to strive for
non-proliferation and for nuclear disarmament before the widespread possession
of nuclear weapons plunged the world into a nuclear holocaust. His broadcast,
in fact, concluded with the warning:” The explosion of a nuclear device by
China is a signal that there is no time to be lost….The great powers under the
aegis of the United Nations may take concrete steps towards nuclear and general
disarmament within the next couple of years that they may act more effectively
in deterring a spread of nuclear weapons. We have to strengthen the United
Nations in order to replace the law of forces by the law of reason in
international relations, and so to build a safe and peaceful world.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
India, with its formidable internal economic problems the inflationary
pressures caused by the increase in defence expenditure since 1962, the
challenging problems of food shortage and the low standard of living of the
population, it would seem to be the height of unwisdom to join in a nuclear
armaments race the end of which can only be universal destruction. The Chinese
threat is not perhaps so menacing today as it was in 1962<i> </i>or even 1964.
One waits to see what will be the outcome of the tremendous internal struggle
for power between the Maoists and the anti-Maoists now going on in China. The
Sino-Soviet rift has been widening instead of narrowing, as was expected after
the exit of Khruschev. The cost of nuclear armament for India will not be
limited to the cost of making the bombs but will extend to the outlay on
building up a sophisticated delivery system. China’s capacity to practise
nuclear blackmail may be </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>greatly exaggerated. In any case, if the
Soviet Union and the U.S.A. can offer credible guarantees, India should accept
them and strive in concert with other non-nuclear nations for the building up
of an effective nuclear shield under the aegis of the U. N. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
looks as if, however, that the Indian objection to the non-proliferation treaty
will come not so much from the standpoint of adequate nuclear guarantees, but
from the point of view of the freedom that the non-nuclear countries will have
to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The clauses of the draft treaty
seem to envisage inspection and control over the atomic establishments in the
countries outside the Nuclear Club (U. S. A., U.S.S.R., France, Britain and
China) for determining whether they are observing the non-proliferation treaty
and are not carrying out atomic tests which could be used for developing atomic
weapons. Both Germany and Japan, which are well advanced in nuclear technology,
have strongly objected to this clause and India also has made clear its
opposition to a discriminatory provision aimed against the non-nuclear
countries. India’s External Affairs Minister, Mahomed Currimbhoy Chagla, told
Indian members of Parliament that India will not agree to any limitation on her
right to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes and will not accept
inspection on a discriminatory basis. He condemned the one-sided character of
the draft non-proliferation treaty, which placed all kinds of obligations on
the non-nuclear countries, while there were no checks on the nuclear powers,
either on their stockpiling of weapons or the tests they could carry out. The
nuclear powers which wanted a monopoly (or oligopoly) of nuclear weapons could
not also ask for a monopoly of nuclear technology. India is expected to propose
amendments to the treaty which would remove this discrimination and make the
treaty equitable and acceptable to the non-nuclear </span><span

One thing is clear: India will be in no hurry to sign the non-proliferation
treaty. She is concerned about her security and as a country with an
acknowledged nuclear capability, she will not denounce the option to make
nuclear weapons without sufficient guarantees for her security and safeguards
for her right to develop freely atomic technology for peaceful purposes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

will doubtless be guided by the country’s defence and scientific experts.
Perhaps the one person whose views may count more than any other’s is Dr.
Vikram Sarabhai, Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, who heads the
army of Indian scientists and engineers working in India’s atomic energy
establishments. Son of a millionaire businessman of Ahmedabad, a brilliant
scientist with an international reputation, 48-year old Vikram Sarabhai is the
man on whom the responsibility for making the bomb may fall if India makes the
fateful decision. As a member of the Indian AEC, Dr. Sarabhai was closely
associated with Dr. Bhabha and kept in close touch with every aspect of India’s
atomic energy development. Dr. Sarabbai’s own specialism has been in the field
of Cosmic Ray Physics. He has been intimately associated with space research in
India as the Chairman of the Indian National Committee for Space Research. He
was primarily responsible for the setting up of the Equatorial Rocket-launching
Station at Thumba on the Kerala coast He set up the Experimental Satellite
Communication Earth Station at Ahmedabad which is the second of its kind in
Asia. Dr. Sarabhai has been for many years interested in disarmament problems
and has been the convener of the Indian Pugwash Committee. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever
the politicians or the Defence Chiefs may feel about the value of an
independent nuclear deterrent, the public and Parliament cannot ignore the
views of the scientists who will be most intimately involved. It may be
relevant here to recall who Dr. Sarabhai said in June last year immediately
after he became Chairman of the Indian AEC. Dr. Sarabhai stressed that if India
wanted to embark on a nuclear bomb manufacturing programme it should have a big
industrial base, particularly the electronic one, which was its principal
hardware. To halt the internal economic development of the country, he said,
would endanger internal security and this risk had to be reckoned with in
assessing the burden of defence expenditure in terms of a nuclear programme.
India’s main hope, in his view, lay in developing collective security. That
assessment still remains the most realistic appraisal of the choice before
India. Parliament would be well advised to listen to Dr. Sarabhai’s views
before it takes a final decision on the renunciation or retention of the
nuclear option.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

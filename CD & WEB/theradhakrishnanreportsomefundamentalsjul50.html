the first time in the history of modern India, real power is vested in the
hands of our elected representatives and trusted leaders to administer all our
affairs and order the life of the nation in every aspect, in conformity with
our needs and aspirations and the genius of our race. And, despite the manifold
problems that beset us all round and sap our energies, the soul of the nation
is agog with a new vitality and eagerness to burst through the enveloping
darkness and confusion and express itself in constructive planning and
activity. The Report of the University Education Commission presided over by
our philosopher-statesman, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, is a striking manifestation of
this national vitality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a happy augury for the future of the nation that higher education has come
to receive its due share of the attention and thought of our leaders so soon
after the assumption of responsibility them in the Central Government. Alien in
its original conception and basic structure, and haphazard in its growth and
development, the existing system of University education has been, all through
the later phases of our struggle for independence, the target of attack
unceasing denunciation by our political leaders who held it, perhaps rightly,
responsible to a large extent for our national degeneration. But by way of
constructive criticism or alternate planning on considerable scale, we have had
precious little to show so far, Many of our leaders used to declare frankly
they had not bestowed any thought on the subject and had therefore no settled
views or definite suggestions to offer with regard to the positive features of
the ideal system of University education for our country. They were preoccupied
with other pressing problems of national reconstruction in the political,
economic and other spheres, and when they turned their attention to education
occasionally, they were obsessed with the importance of the primary stage and
of the need for rapid progress in the spread of literacy among the rural
population.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

educational ideals of the nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Refreshingly original both in its approach to the
problem and scope and spirit of its recommendations, the Report of the
Radhakrishnan Commission constitutes a welcome phenomenon in the history of
higher education in our country. The Report points out at the outset the
inadequacy of the definition of education as a means by which society
endeavours to perpetuate itself by training the young moulding them to a
pattern sanctioned by tradition. It stresses the desirability of recognising
the complementary principle that education is at the same time, an instrument
for social change, by which society consciously evolves towards a desired ideal
condition. Therefore it proceeds to seek the guiding principles for educational
reorganisation in the aims of our new social order, so clearly formulated in
the Preamble to our Republican Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Preamble declares the aims of our Democratic
Republic to be to secure to all its citizens, Justice, economic, social and
political Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship, Equality
of status and opportunity, and to promote Fraternity to ensure dignity of the
individual and the unity of the nation simultaneously. In the chapter entitled
‘The Aims of University Education’, essential elements of the new social order
are defined and interpreted from the educational standpoint, and their logical
consequences in the educational sphere are traced in brief outline but with
admirable eloquence and cogency of argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the chapters that follow, the various problems of
high education relating to Teaching Staff, Standards of Teaching, Courses of
Study, Professional Education, Religious Education. Medium of Instruction,
Examinations, Students' Activities and Welfare, Women’s Education, Constitution
and Control of the Universities. Rural universities, are taken up for detailed
consideration. With regard to each problem, the Report gives a clear and
analytical description of the existing state of affairs (with the previous
history or a comparison with the situation in other countries wherever
desirable), a lucid exposition of the direction in which improvement is to be
sought in view of the overall aims and guiding principles of our educational
reorganisation set forth in the second chapter, a critical and reasoned
evaluation of the alternative methods for achieving the results, taking into
account the most recent developments in educational theory and practice in the
advanced countries of the West and the opinions of great thinkers, and, at the
end, a summary of all the specific recommendations relating to the subject. The
appendices on Objective Intelligence and Achievement Tests, the General
Education Courses of American Universities, the History of the People’s
Colleges of Denmark etc., form a very interesting and useful feature. The
Report reveals throughout a genuine concern for improvement and advance, an
earnest resolve to set the nation on its new career in its natural shape and
appropriate garments, to enable it to discover its soul and express itself and
realise its high destiny and mission. A spirit of sweet reasonableness breathes
through the pages.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of the recommendations may be open to objection, or admit of difference of
opinion, and the final decisions will have to be taken after due deliberation
by the Governments. Central and Provincial, and the various University
authorities. But meanwhile the Report constitutes an educational manual and
sets before us the importance and urgency of the various problems that have to
be tackled in the field of University education, their bearing on the future of
our nation, the spirit and temper in which, and the directions along which,
reorganisation has to be attempted. The authors richly deserve the thanks of
the entire nation for the invaluable service rendered to the cause of higher
education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
particular, the chapter on ‘Aims of Education’ reveals the general attitude of
the Commission and the spirit behind their detailed recommendations in the
chapters that follow. It is unexceptionable in its entirety and forms the crux
of the whole Report. It should be studied carefully and critically by students,
teachers, managements and all others interested in University education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
has another value too. Here we find an examination from one distinct and
important point of view, that of education, of the essential principles of our
new Constitution and their interpretation and application to the problems of a
distinct field of social endeavour. The principles themselves are thereby
revealed to us in greater clearness of outline and content and come home to us
with a new vitality and energy. This chapter of the Report is therefore of
great value to every citizen, as a vivid presentation of the aims of the new
social order envisaged for us in our Constitution by our farsighted and
sensitive leaders. As such it deserves the widest publicity and intelligent
appreciation by the general public.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the teacher is reduced to that of observing and studying the natural tendencies
and potentialities of the student and facilitating and helping the growth by
providing suitable environment and opportunities for experience from time to
time. The corporate life and activities in an educational institution should be
considered as important as the formal instruction that is provided in it, and
the teacher should devote as much attention to the student and the development
of his faculties, character and personality as to the knowledge that he imparts
to him. Whatever be the subject of study, the process of learning should be by
practical work and effort on the part of the student under the guidance of the
teacher. Even in the matter of discipline the element of compulsion and
external imposition should be progressively reduced to the minimum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

human mind is triune in character and one or other three main tendencies,
reflective, emotional and active, preponderates in every individual and
combines with the others in varying proportions. Hence the infinite variety in
human nature in abilities and aptitudes, though the differences are only of
degree and emphasis and not of exclusive types. Democracy recognises this
variety and values the resulting complexity and richness of social life.
Uniformity and regimentation are repugnant to the democratic spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

environment of a human being is also triune in character,–natural, social and
spiritual; and the content of teaching may be classified under three heads:
Science and Technology dealing with our relation to nature; social sciences
including History dealing with our relation to society; and Literature, Arts
and Philosophy dealing with values or our relation to the world of spirit. The
educational system in a democracy must take note of the variety in abilities,
aptitudes and aspirations of the young and organise diversified courses of
study for the different types at the different stages, on the basis of the
different subjects and activities calculated to stimulate and strengthen the
different natural tendencies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

believes in the inherent worth of the individual and in the dignity and value
of human life. It affirms that each individual is a unique adventure of life,
and we must bear in mind that the human mind is also essentially a unity and
all knowledge is interdependent. The division of subjects into sciences, social
studies and humanities is not exclusive, and, whatever be the subject of study,
it can and should excite and satisfy the different mental powers and train the
student in careful observation, effective thinking and proper judgment, and
give him intellectual vision, aesthetic enjoyment and practical power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

history of our society and the world, and literature which feeds our
imagination and stabilises our emotional life, should be provided as a part of
general education for all. Whether we are being introduced to the delights of
literature or wonders of science or the pride of craftsmanship, our whole being

the same time, we have to guard ourselves against the danger of attaching
disproportionate importance to the natural sciences and technical studies in

at any rate, are not wedded exclusively to materialism, but we go in for
increasing national productivity by encouraging scientific studies and the use
of scientific discoveries and technical appliances for ensuring decent
standards of life for our people in order to guarantee social justice. We have
to organise our material resources and productive machinery, with due regard to
the peculiar circumstances of our country and the genius, culture and
aspirations of our people, so that the benefits of our increased national
productivity might reach the common man and result in true national progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

educate the emotions and inspire the youth with noble ideals and high social
aims. We should evolve a balanced system of education, carrying out at

of opportunity in the matter of education is a pre-requisite for equality of

scope for every individual to develop, to the fullest possible extent, the
faculties with which he is endowed by nature. There should be no discrimination
(except in the case of the scheduled castes and that too for a limited period)
in the matter of admission to educational institutions, the only consideration
being merit and the capacity of the student to profit by the course of study he
seeks to pursue. Any such discrimination tends to lower the standards of
efficiency in the institutions concerned, in administration and public life in

peculiar history of our country, our new democracy is faced with a staggering
diversity of language, race and religion in our people. The problem of securing

attached to the corporate life of the students in the Hostels and Unions and on
the playgrounds. These so-called extra-curricular activities should be properly
orgamised and fully exploited to develop the qualities of mutual trust and
fairplay, disciplined and responsible behaviour and tactful leadership. All the
students should be encouraged to participate in the social activities, not
merely in the institutions but in the locality in general. In this sphere there

phenomenon of different cultures in a sense. To transmit the cultural heritage

toleration of other ways of life and modes of worship of the Divine, in the
sincere conviction of the equal worth and dignity of all kinds of religious
discipline and the ultimate destiny of every individual soul. This culture of
ours is not inconsistent with the much vaunted secularity of our democracy, if
the term is rightly understood. Our secularism is only a new term for our
traditional toleration in the religious field and does not at all mean that we
are wedded to materialism. Democracy, as we conceive it and as our leaders have
sought to express in our Constitution, is itself a new variety different from
the Western brand, in that the spirituality of our culture is superadded to it
in place of scientific materialism. In fact, it contains spiritual elements in
it sufficient to constitute a new faith or a new expression of our old faith

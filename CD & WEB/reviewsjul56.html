<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is the story of the people of Assam, their
history, religions, culture, language, literature and mode of life, put
compactly in a simple and readable style by the author who is himself an
Assamese. The title is most appropriate, as the history revolves around the
Brahmaputra Valley (Red River) and Nilachala (Blue Hill). Hem Barua gives a
panoramic view of Assam, “a landscape of deep ravines, of hills and
impenetrable forests, and of steppes and slopes,” all of which “weave a picture
of health and plenty.” Its history tells of mighty tribes as the Ahoms, Koches,
Kacharies and Chutiyas, who in the past held sway here and successfully resisted
Moghul intrusions. The main races that infiltrated Assam in ancient times were
Austro-Asiatic, Dravidian’s, Tibeto-Burmans, Mongoloids and Aryans, the dynamic
synthesis of whose cultures may be seen today in every sphere of life of the
people. Hem Barua then makes a survey of the economy of the region, where
agriculture is the main occupation, and only 14 per cent of the population live
other than by agriculture. The few oil wells and rice mills dotted in the
remote countryside are the only signs of industrial activity. Tea constitutes
‘the crown and glory’ of Assam’s economy, accounting for a third of the world’s
total output, earning for India Rs. 60 crores in foreign exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The author gives a vivid picture of the pattern of
life, based on matriarchy in which women occupy a high pedestal in both family
and social life. Females not only run the home but also are good at cultivation
and small business. They are born weavers, who evolve ‘fairy tales in cloth’.
The people of Assam are nature’s own offspring and love to contemplate nature,
symbolized in their dances, folk-tales and songs, e. g., “I cannot fix my mind
in my home, O my love; I cannot fix my mind in the paddy land; my mind wants to
fly as is the roving cotton.”</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Assamese language and the other tongues in vogue in this region are
Indo-Chinese, Tibeto-Burman and Mon-Khmer in origin, and, due to their
flexibility, have absorbed words of languages prevalent in adjacent regions.
Outside the State, little </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is known about Assamese literature, which
had its origins before the advent of “Sankardev, the father of Assamese
literature,” and includes the sayings of Dak-mahapurusha, the Bauddha-Doha and
Bihu songs, Bongits (woodman’s ballads) and the songs of the boatmen, many of
which have marriage and cradle backgrounds. Hem Barua gives credit to the
untiring Christian Missionaries, who were pioneers in the field of collation
and translation of Assamese literature and gave the region the Roman script in
vogue to this day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a finishing touch, Hem Barua reviews the recent events in Assam during the last
war and after, and aptly sums it up thus: The problem facing Assam today is
‘one of urgent reconstruction and recuperation’; economic life needs planning
on a popular basis; the vast mineral wealth requires an all-round development,
preceded by a thorough geological survey; education and social services have to
be reorganised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

smartness, brightness, epigram, pun, analysis of character and sizing of
situation, ready wit and readier flair for breezy yet arresting sketches of men
and events, were at all called for in an author venturing on his own
reminiscences of a life of a journalist in India, Iswara Dutt possesses them in
a degree beyond all normal expectations. Indeed one has only to take up <i>The
Street of Ink </i>not to place it down till actually there are no more pages to
read. At any rate few in the realm of journalism could vouch, in a narration of
autobiographical matter, for so much about the conditions prevailing in the
field, as well as so many personalities who have done signal service in the
cause of journalism. The panoramic view provided by the author of the past and
present is noteworthy. It is an engaging gallery of men who have had something
to do in raising the standard of the Press in this country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Threshold’ of <i>The Hindu </i>under the fostering care of the late A.
Rangaswami Iyengar. Next he worked under the late C. Y. Chintamani, who and <i>The
leader </i>of Allahabad, were inseparable in the impressions of a past
generation. Subsequently <i>The Twentieth Century, </i>a monthly, was
inaugurated by him with the help and guidance of no less a person than the late
Rt. Hon. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. Then, again, without prejudice to his
connection with <i>The Twentieth Century, </i>he became the Editor of the <i>People’s
Voice </i>started by the Maharaja of Pithapuram. Thereafter he was taken in
service as a Publicity Officer by <i><u>Sir </u></i>Mirza Ismail, both in
Jaipur and Hyderabad. After these two diversions for a period, not totally
insignificant for a journalist, he emerged again as an entity in the office of
the <i>Hindustan Times </i>of Delhi. Finally, as Chief Editor of <i>The Leader
of Allahabad</i>, he served for nearly a year and a half, only to find the way
Press Barons conduct themselves and journals, not to the satisfaction of
working journalists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contents and execution of his pet ‘child’. ‘M. C.’ (M. Chalapathi Rau) comes in
for a lot of endearing references as well as illuminating episodes in the
crusade carried on by the <i>Working Journalists’ Federation. </i>There is
plenty of material also for animated discussion of the way he has described
friends in the field of journalism like Khasa Subba Rau, Krupanidhi, N.
Raghunathan, K. M. panikkar, Pothan Joseph, Frank Moraes, K. C. Roy and K. Rama
Rao. Memories of an older generation of giants have also been cherished in the
most enjoyable manner of telling them, with a pervading sense of humour, and
not too often as well, of sadness over the changes come upon us in the wake of
a steady concentration of more Dailies and chains of them in a single hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the father of love; love is wisdom; wisdom is power; power is life; life is
beauty; beauty is harmony; and harmony is love. And this love in all things,
and all things in love, is God.” This is the essence of all religions, and
around this motif are woven, in patterns of exquisite beauty, the life-stories
of twenty ‘immortals’ that trod the earth at different times and made it richer
by their presence. From Moses in ancient times to Mahatma Gandhi in the
modern–including, of course, the founders of the great religions, Zoroaster,
Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Mahomed–all are presented in a manner that brings
them out in their true glory and greatness. Their individual philosophies and
distinctive characters are dealt with such insight, sympathy and warmth that
the great figures become once again instinct with life. To help the reader, the
important events of each life are given at the end. The book abounds in apt quotations
which enhance its value and indicate what vast reading and patient effort have
gone into the task. The style is simple and refined, and not infrequently does
one come across lines of striking beauty. Who would not, for instance, be
captivated by observations like these? “The Quaker leader (George Fox) was in
many respects another Cromwell, but he was a Cromwell ‘guiltless of his
country’s blood.’ ” “Gandhi is a religious leader upon whose unwilling
shoulders Destiny has imposed the burden of politics.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

enable lay men to clearly grasp these Bhagavata <i>dharmas </i>and carry out
the injunctions, the great devotee, Vishnu Tirth, who was born in the 18th
century, selected 365 <i>slokas </i>(excluding the two verses of introduction
and valediction), equal in number to the days in the calendar, so that the
recitation of at least one <i>sloka </i>a day might put the devotee on the path
to salvation. These verses are arranged in the form of thirty chapters, each
chapter dealing with one topic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

materialistic and idealistic philosophies and interpretations of history, which

Indian readers, and modern Indian poetry to the foreign readers through
translations in English. The first number offers about 30 pages of English
poetry by a number of American English and Indian writers, some of them already
well-known in the field, and about 20 pages of modern Telugu poetry in
translation, very efficiently performed. 30 pages of prose of considerable
literary quality, comprising correspondence with the Editor, fragments from a
Journal, a letter from William Carlos Williams, and a Punjab pastoral are
included. The journal is likely to attract the English educated youth of this
country with a flair for modernity. This venture by talented youngmen deserves
a long and useful career, for it represents a laudable endeavour to bring
together the East and the West in a literary fellowship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Gandhi has been a great man of our times, and it has indeed not been possible
yet to evaluate how great he was. For more than 50 years I have been thinking
of the institution that was he–first when I knew only his writings, then for 33
years as an associate, and also since his death. The more I think the greater
and deeper seems to be the human treasure-house that was Gandhiji, and the more
I feel that the personality of this maker of our era was truly amazing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is said that if we read the works of Tagore and Aurobindo we know the depth of
these intellectual giants. But one does not get the impression that they have
much more worth saying than they have said. In contrast Gandhiji, despite his
simple, straight-forward language, seems to the man who read his works to be
much deeper than it appears through the peep he has in his mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Gandhiji’s younger son, <span class=SpellE>Devdas</span>, was a child, a white
man asked him: “What is <span class=GramE>the</span> philosophy of your
father?” The boy replied, “My father’s philosophy is too simple to understand.”
In one way this statement is literally true. <span class=GramE>Four
words–truth, violence, self-discipline and selfless service–give the epitome of
his faith.</span> He would often say that whatever other faults a man might
have, they would be banished by truth. But his truth had a very wide
definition. To his mind truth and God were indistinguishable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to any man Gandhiji’s eyes showed a spontaneous thy, so that it was easy for
him to understand whatever he meant. He would correctly assess his point of
view and give such advice as would, with the effort he was capable of, give him
success. After long and close observation of him and his methods, I am
convinced that he had more faith in our capabilities than we ourselves. Even in
face of flagging faith he would tell us that we would accomplish the job about
which we had doubts, and we found invariably that we indeed could do it. This
is not my experience alone but of innumerable others. I recall the veteran <span
class=SpellE>Abbas</span> <span class=SpellE>Tyabji</span>, who once told me
that Gandhiji had not accomplished through us jobs which we thought we could
not and which we could still not do on our own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is why <span class=SpellE>Romain</span> Rolland called him a
“poly-psychologist”, or a man who could understand the psychology of various
individuals and societies. From the unlettered Tamil and Telugu <span
class=SpellE>labourers</span> of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region> to the anti-religious
English intellectual, Charles <span class=SpellE>Bradlaugh</span>, only he had
the capacity to correctly understand the psychology of all. He never lost an
argument even with argumentative intellectuals, yet he never tried to show off
his intellectual capacity. Humility was like a shield to him. Study, thinking,
and experience had raised his intellectual capacity so high that we lose track
of it. In contrast, his own capacity to assess others was never found wanting.
Perhaps it is characteristic of individuals who dominate an era that they
invariably have the width, depth and freshness to accomplish the objects they
set out to serve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji’s qualities were <span class=SpellE>unabounded</span>.
As an example, though he had unshakable faith in his principles and unlimited
self-confidence, he was extraordinarily modest. He would say that man either
had inborn modesty or had none; unlike other qualities it could not be acquired.
To try to be modest would only create artificiality, and if one made
extraordinary efforts to acquire it, he would get along with it and pride of
being modest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
again during conversation he remarked that if one was fifty, was he to say out
of modesty that he was only 45, or 49? A truthful man would not boast of his
knowledge, character or faith; <span class=GramE>If</span> he is modest he
would only say that he did not know if his knowledge, character and faith would
be able to stand the test. Where great men had faltered it was not for a common
man to assert that he would not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

times his determination would not deteriorate into foolhardiness, forsaking
propriety. Perhaps his modesty was the obverse of faith in self and in truth,

Gandhiji after their differences came to a head, but he continued to have and
show the same respect to her as of old. It is difficult to say how much of it
was due to <span class=GramE>his own</span> modesty and how much due to
chivalry for a woman. When he was presiding over the <span class=SpellE>Belgaum</span>
Congress and Mrs. Annie <span class=SpellE>Besant</span> entered, he stepped
down and escorted her to the dais close to his presidential seat. How could he
forget that she was a predecessor of him as Congress President? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I had a rather sharp discussion with Gandhiji and remarked, “You advise youth
to be obedient. Of course they should obey their leaders, but you do not seem
to realize how difficult it is to work as a subordinate. <span class=GramE>Whether

He had accepted the invitation. I mentioned its geographical situation and its
vulnerability to pressures both from Europe and <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>.
His reply was: “I do not know anything about <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

by nature had faith in others. Also, he always maintained that what he could
do, others could also do. Despite bitter experiences, he would never lose hope
or be uncharitable to others. It was a matter of principle for him to believe,
rather than disbelieve, others. If the faith is belied, he would say, one can
rectify the situation. But to begin with disbelief is not good not only
morally, but even practically. He said: “I do not follow a decision made
beforehand. Instead I try to fashion the path according to the situation and I
try to fashion it according to principles and practicability. I cannot let
myself be bound by prejudices, except the prejudice in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>

allow spurious rationality or mechanical consistency to saddle him. Thinking
from his own unprejudiced mind, he would follow his intuition, and once having
got the way try to get arguments to explain his intuitive decisions. This is
what explains his success in life. He was not afraid to commit mistakes. He
even defined Swarajya as “the right to commit<i> </i>mistakes and to learn from

In a nutshell Gandhiji put his faith in an action-filled, experimenting life,
not in pre-conceived notions. He was not a slave to any pre-arranged programmes

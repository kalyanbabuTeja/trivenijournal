of the Motherland and pride in her glory are prominent in Telugu poetry. During
periods of domination by foreigners, the yearning for freedom becomes an additional
theme. Nannaya, who composed the Telugu Mahabharata in the 11th century, gave a
glowing description of the Vengi country ruled by Raja Raja Chalukya, and, in
particular, of the Parishats or gatherings of scholars where all literary and
artistic work was appraised. The fertile plains watered by the <st1:place
w:st="on">Godavari</st1:place> were dear to this poet. In the 15th century,
Srinadha composed the <i>Bhimeswara Puranam </i>in which he sang of Draksharama
as a veritable heaven on earth. But it was his ‘Ballad of the Palnad Heroes’
that he stressed the duty of the sons of the soil to protect it from tyranny
and oppression. Srinadha’s verses in honour of the mountain-fortress of
Kondavidu are recited to this day with fervour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

patriotism of the Telugu poets is not just local; their vision comprises the
entire Indian continent. A phrase we frequently come across in the poetry of
the Vijayanagara period is ‘Setu-seetanaga-madhyorvi’–the land between Rama’s
bridge to Lanka in the South, and the cold mountain <st1:place w:st="on">Himalaya</st1:place>
in the North. The monarchs of ancient India–Nala, Harischandra and Dushyanta–as
well as the epic heroes of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are extolled in
Telugu poetry; incidents in their lives furnish themes for the Prabandhas. The
Court-poets of Sri Krishnadeva Raya give expression to the people’s gratitude
to the monarch for preserving the culture and the freedom of the land as
against the Muslim invaders. Thus, ‘Krishnadeva Raya is not merely Lord of
Karnataka and Andhra; he is the ‘Hindu Suratrana’, Sultan of the Hindus. With
the Passage of time there was reconciliation between Hindu and Muslim, and a
famous Telugu poet, Addanki Gangadhara, dedicated a Kavya to one of the
Kutub-Shahis of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Golconda</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

upsurge of militant nationalism in 1906, Telugu poetry took a turn definitely
hostile to the foreigner. The British had robbed us of our political freedom;
they exploited our wealth; they ruined our culture. As Chilakamarti put it in a
short, telling stanza:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then, Andhra was only a child of Bharat; Vanga, <st1:place w:st="on">Maharashtra</st1:place>,
Dravida, Kerala, Karnataka and other units were Andhra’s dear sisters. This
note of friendliness towards neighbouring peoples was the result of the
writings and speeches of the leaders of the Andhra Movement, who viewed the
linguistic re-distribution of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a part of Indian nation-building. So, the love of Andhra and the love of
Bharat have coursed through Telugu poetry throughout the centuries, like the
Yamuna and the <st1:place w:st="on">Ganga</st1:place>, while the love of all
humanity is the unseen, yet powerfully felt, undercurrent of Saraswati. Swaraj
for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and a Province for Andhra, have been the twin-dreams of our political leaders
and our literary craftsmen for over four decades. Both these dreams have formed
the subject matter of Telugu Poetry in recent years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
inevitably, part of this literature is mere propaganda; it does not rise beyond
the level of dull monotonous verse. There are, however, some gifted singers
whose work is of enduring value, and deserves to rank with the noblest poetry
of other lands. The late Gurazada Appa Rao was definitely a pioneer. “Love the
country, O! Brother,” sings Gurazada, “but the country is not just the soil;
the country is the men who dwell in it.” According to him, this love must lead
to service of fellowmen in the present. And again, the love must not be tinged
with hatred. “Do not look down on the Muslim as an intruder; why, if the
British came yesterday, and the Muslims the day before, you came only the day
before that.” The country belongs to all its children, whatever the time of our
ancestors’ migration to it. Rayaprolu Subba Rao is a harbinger of the new age
of Romantic Telugu Poetry. But he is also great as a poet of patriotism. “To whichever
Country you go, and wheresoever your feet might tread, love the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">land</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Bharat</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>; there is no land like ours.” So
sang Subba Rao forty years ago. The Andhra Movement inspired him, and he called
on the Andhras to remind themselves of the glories of Amaravati, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Warangal</st1:place></st1:City> and
Vijayanagara, to dream great dreams, and build modern Andhra after a noble
pattern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Satyanatayana comes a little later? In his ‘Andhra Paurusham’ he narrates the
heroic deeds of the Andhras of previous ages. This book of verse brought him
immediate recognition as a poet of the front rank. But he rises to greater
heights in his ‘Andhra Prasasti’. The lyrical element is more pronounced here.
The poet seizes on important moments and invests them with the halo of
permanence. King Dipakarni of Srikakulam,<sup>1</sup> forerunner of the
Satavahanas, discovers a boy riding a lion on the banks of the <st1:place

dedication of the Telugu<i> </i>Mahabharata by Nannaya to Raja Raja is another
moment fraught with destiny. Satyanarayana, in his ‘Andhra Prasasti’, reveals
himself as a poet who combines lyrical charm with a power of dramatisation. It
was the prelude<i> </i>to poetic achievement through diverse modes of
expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Very close to Satyanarayana was young Kodali Subba
Rao, cut off, alas! in the heyday of his success. Subba Rao’s ‘Hampi Kshetram’
is a series of cameos of life in Vijayanagara–the Court, the monarchs and
marshals, the poets and artists. The memory of Vijayanagara under Krishna Raya
and Timmarasu is enshrined by Subba Rao in poetry that will live as long as
Telugu lives.</p>

coming of Gandhi was a great event in Andhra’s cultural life. His message of
truth and non-violence altered her outlook. His personality captured the
imagination of her poets. The late Basavaraju Appa Rao refers to him as ‘our

loin-cloth? What if he is born as a <st1:place w:st="on">Komati</st1:place>?</span><sup><span

When he moves his foot, the entire Universe is set in motion. When his little

disobedience of the foreigner. For full quarter of a century, the land was
plunged in what was a war of liberation, though the war was a non-violent one.
Lathi-charges, shooting, imprisonment of thousands of patriots, were common
occurrences. Khaddar-clad men and women marched in battle array, and sang
patriotic songs as they marched. This provided occasion for poets and
song-writers to improvise verse and song. Hence, it was not literary charm that
counted, but vigour of expression and the ability to rouse emotion. One Telugu
song by Garimella Satyanarayana–“We do not want this White Government”–rendered
the poet famous overnight, and it came to be sung from one end of Andhradesa to
the other. In prison camps, the non-Telugus learnt the song and carried it to
their respective homelands. Then there were songs glorifying the national flag
which, according to the composer, would fly over all the continents and bring
everlasting fame to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Individual heroes like Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das of an earlier
generation, and Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose were praised in song
and verse. Even plays were written in which they appeared as the principal
characters. The leaders of the Congress Movement in the Andhra country like
Desabhakta Venkatappayya and Prakasam, Duggirala Gopalakrishnayya and Dr.
Pattabhi Sitaramayya, were mentioned in literary productions, and acclaimed as
national heroes. This was literature of the hour. It served its purpose of
carrying the cult of Swaraj to the Andhra people, and urging them to sacrifice
and suffering. The spinning-wheel, transformed in men’s imagination into the
‘Sudarsana Chakra’ of Lord Vishnu, was reverenced as the symbol of freedom; and
inspiring songs were sung about its virtues </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

that freedom has been won, the emphasis shifts. The younger Telugu poets dream
of a brave new world where inequalities between man and man shall not exist,
and the peasants and the workers will, at long last, come into their own. Srirangam
Srinivasa Rao is the leader of this school. In form as well as in content, his
verse marks a revolution in present day writing. He is not an avowed Marxist,
though Marxism has influenced him. There is widespread discontent, political,
social, and economic. Freedom has not solved all our problems, and it has
raised new ones. A nation emerging into the dazzling light of freedom takes
time to adjust itself to the new conditions. The administration of a modern
State, in the complex situation created by internal rivalries, will tax the
energies of<i> </i>the mighty among us. If poets, in common with the rest of
Indian citizens give expression to the feeling of discontent and
disillusionment, they are but giving literary shape to the prevailing mood.
After the inevitable period of transition, a correct perspective will be
reached. Then will the poetry of Andhra become the vehicle of new hope and
aspiration. The poetry of the future will mirror the achievement of<i> </i>peace
under difficult conditions, and the consolidation of national freedom in body,
mind and spirit, as an integral factor of universal freedom. A great epic of
the Gandhian era has not yet emerged in any Indian language. Andhra is rich in
patriotic fervour and poetic inspiration, and may it be given to some rising
poet to chronicle in noble verse the saga of Indian Freedom, recapturing the
stately diction of Nannaya and the tense drama of Tikkana!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

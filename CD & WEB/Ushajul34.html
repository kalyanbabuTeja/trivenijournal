<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - How do you do, Narada?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - How do you do, Baneswara? You seem to be upset. What is the matter?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - My daughter Usha defies me. I brought her up like a pet parrot and this is how she returns my tenderness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - What did you ask her to do?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - I asked her to marry Mayura and she refuses. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Well, if she doesn’t like it, why compel her, Baneswara? Show her portraits of young men of noble birth, and let her marry whom she will.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - I do not wish to do that. Who knows whom she will choose?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - There is one way in which you can avoid that risk. But you will not agree to it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Let us hear it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - There is Sri Krishna’s grandson, Aniruddha. Do you know what a handsome youth he is?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Why, don’t you know? Krishna sent word to me asking that Usha be given to Aniruddha. I replied that it was altogether out of the question.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Baneswara, your grandfather<SUP>1 </SUP>was such a devotee of Vishnu and yet you treat Krishna as an enemy. I do not know what to make of this.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Well, if you please, Narada, I am also a devotee of Vishnu, but not of Krishna. The fellow is too arrogant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Have we not all agreed that he is Vishnu in human form? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Your saying so will not make him so.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - What would you have? He has the conch of Vishnu. He has the discus of Vishnu. And he has such wonderful power. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - No more, Narada. Every one has a conch and every one blows on it. I too have a discus. Without my leave not a living thing can enter the precincts of this city. You speak of Krishna’s wonderful power. Is he the only one who has it? For his two arms I can at need assume a thousand. If he is Vishnu, so am I. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - As you please then. But Krishna will surely take your daughter in marriage to Aniruddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - I shall immediately marry away Usha. What will he do then? Well, I must be going. Good-bye.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Good-bye. I shall look up the others and go too. (Exit Bana and Mayura).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This fellow is hopelessly obstinate. Krishna wishes to win him over. I too have often reminded him of Prahlada and have besought his grace towards Bana and he has said ‘all in good time’. When is this ‘good time’? When will Bana’s good fortune bear fruit? Aniruddha has seen all the fairest girls in the land and wants to marry only Usha. Baneswara’s discus is no bar to him as he can travel in the world of dreams, but if he manifests himself he will be made captive here. (Looks at the back of the stage). Here is Chitralekha. (Addressing her) Good day, Chitralekha. How is every one?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - By your blessings, all are well.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Are you going to Usha? Baneswara was here just now, very angry with her about something.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - He is trying to get her to marry Mayura. She does not agree. Every day there is a wrangle over it. There must have been one today. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - I said something to Baneswara about this. But he would not listen. Come, tell me everything. Why is Usha unwilling to marry Mayura?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - There seems to be some reason, but she will not tell. For the last four months. . . . </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - (Speaking to herself) O my love who came and married me in my dream: be always real to me! May my heart never doubt your reality! When need arises I shall call on you. Come then as you have promised. This is all my prayer. My Lord, my Love (joining her hands in salutation) no more of hesitation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - You are an only child and motherless. You must be either married or punished. And why are you so obstinate?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Do you also ask? If you don’t understand, who will? Did not Mayura wish to marry you? And did you agree?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - No, but that was because the king has always intended that he should marry you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Was that the reason? Was it not because you do not like him?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - (Laughing) No. If I must speak the truth, it was because I am already married! What will you do tomorrow?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - (Wearily) Chitra! Time passes heavily with me. Sit here and continue that drawing and I shall watch you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - For some days now, I have had no skill in drawing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - That was because you were alone. Sit down here with me and finish what you were drawing in the garden.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - I shall tell you presently. Tell me first whose picture it is.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - It is the picture of some one whom I saw in my dream. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Saw him in your dream? Do you see him now? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - No. If I saw him why should I draw his picture? He showed himself. once and disappeared. I have drawn his picture, to fix him in my mind.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Can he be real whom one sees in a dream? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Whatever we see is real. The person was real to me that day. I am seeking to make him real today.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Chitra, I have fear lest you know my secret. Well, if you know, what is the harm? In whom shall I confide, if not in you? But is it possible that a man who appears in one person’s dream can appear in the dream of another also?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Did this man appear in your dream also? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Listen, Chitra. Now four months ago, he appeared one night in my dream. I gave him my heart. I woke up and was grieved that I had become awake. I wondered what merit I had done to enjoy the good fortune of having that dream. He appeared the next night. Do you remember you asked me one day why I was so cheerful? That was the second day of his appearance. Hoping that he would come again I went to bed early on the third day. He came, Chitra, and in dream we were wedded in the <I>Gandharva </I>way. Sometimes I think it was mere dream. But then it is not unreal. His words and behaviour have been so clearly impressed on me that I cannot dismiss it as mere fancy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - The speech and action of a dream are always clearly impressed. That is the way of our mind</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - What if he sang verse, Chitra? I am not a writer of verse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - What verse did he sing?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Of what country is he prince? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - He did not tell me. He has not appeared during the last fifteen days. If I wish, he will come. But it seems, in my life-time I can so call on him only thrice. So I do not wish to do it unless there is need. And now, Chitra, what shall I do if father asks me to marry Mayura? I should say I am married but he will be angrier still.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Usha, now you yourself tell me what I hesitated to ask. Leave alone your father’s being angry if you tell him you are married. In the first place he will not believe it. But do you know your present condition? The good name of the Royal House is at stake. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Fear not, Chitra. I am sure I am married, and if need arises I shall show my lover to my father. He has agreed to show himself if I desire it. But he says that my calling on him thus bodes ill to my people. He says also that then his power to move about in the dream world will be lost to him. Why should I be the cause of taking away from him the divine power that he now enjoys? It is enough, for me that he has accepted my love.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - He has not told you who he is.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - I asked him but he only said that he was related to persons whom my father disliked, and that I should know everything in good time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Usha, rare is your fortune. You see, I saw him just one night and yet I felt that vision was the fulfillment of my life. I can draw his likeness in a picture. I draw it and consider myself most blessed. And so I am. And you, my dear, you own him. He comes when you call. He takes form when you wish. Great is your good fortune. Believe me, there can be nothing greater. I saw him once in my dream and do not desire any other thing. How can you marry Mayura after having owned him?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEELA: - (Entering) The king is coming. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - The king! Why did you call the king?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - O wretch–what falsehood you can utter! Are you indeed my daughter–or was your mother faithless?–You deserve to be killed for your wantonness. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Unsheathes the sword)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MALINI:- Alas! How can you raise your hand against your daughter? And do you not see she is with child?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(She comes between Banasura and Usha. Mayura grasps the hand of Banasura).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - With child! Has she brought that disgrace on my house? Alas! That I begot such a vile creature! Wretch! Renegade!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - I have done nothing to be ashamed of.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Then show me this husband of yours.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - I can show him. But first give me word that<I> </I>you will do no harm to him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Do no harm to him! For what he has done to me, I will kill him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - If you must kill, kill me. I shall not call him, just to be killed by you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Have you got him here concealed?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - No. He will come when wanted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - This is nonsense. It will be well if you produce him immediately. Otherwise, despair of life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Usha–what fitter occasion can there be? Call for him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - You are in the know of this. It is you who have spoilt her. You should be punished first. (Goes to strike Chitralekha)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Alas! What shall I do? (Coming between Banasura and Chitralekha)–O Lord! appear, show yourself. I cannot bear to see Chitra come to harm. (After a moment of silence Aniruddha appears between Bana and Usha. Usha is about to fall in a swoon. Aniruddha holds her).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - Salutations, O King! Is it heroic to hurt women?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Who are you, vile fellow?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - I am Aniruddha, grandson of Sri Krishna. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - You are a thief and are worthy grandson to a thief. But why did you step into this den of lions and get caught? Do you think you will escape, fool? I shall end your life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - Do so. But first let us wake up your daughter from her swoon. (Makes Usha wake and take a seat and fans her.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - This is good; very good. Mayura, keep this rascal here. I shall send servants. Bind his hands with chains and make him prisoner.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MAYURA: - But you must not take his life. It is my business to fight with him and kill him. (To himself) What, is he really more handsome than I? (Looking at his face in the mirror)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Exit Bana)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - (To Aniruddha) My Lord–So you are still here? And it is true that you have come? I feared it was only a dream as usual.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - Dream and reality are alike real to you. Are you better?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Yes. Where is father? I hope he did not hurt you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - No, nor will. (Guards come and stand at the doors).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - What is this?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GUARDS: - The king has ordered that no one should be allowed to leave this place, madam.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - What shall we do now?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - Nothing. The king merely desires that we should not be separated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - What about Chitralekha?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - I have asked of my grandfather that none here should suffer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - O, I am so happy. My Lord, this is Chitralekha. (Chitralekha stands to one side bashfully). Why! you know her already!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - How do you know?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - It is by looking at the picture drawn by Chitra that I fainted. Leela, what an innocent babe you are? Why did you tell the king of the picture?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEELA: - He asked me why you fainted. How should I know it was the<B> </B>picture of brother-in-law? I said ‘picture’ and then hesitated. But he would not leave me I thought it wouldn’t matter and told him. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - Had Chitra drawn my picture?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - (Aside) Why are they saying all this? How is this? He is not so fair as he appeared in the dream. (Goes apart and stands looking through the window).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Yes. That is how I knew you had seen her. Their songs and that picture made me feel that they knew my secret and wanted to test me. Anyhow, Leela has caused a great ado today.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEELA: - Ado indeed! It was I who had married; it was I who drew the picture; and it was I who fainted. All this was myself. Being such a clever girl, Usha, why did you not tell us that it was brother-in-law’s picture before you fainted? See, I have been responsible to get him here and I deserve a good word. But what do I get instead? A great ado? I shall never make a mistake again. The next time I see a picture, I shall conclude it is Chitralekha’s lover and all will be well.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - And the next picture after that will be your lover.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEELA: - Girls who write poems and paint pictures may be satisfied with lovers in pictures. But I and girls like me need real ones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - How talkative you are, Leela. Behave yourself before strangers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEELA: - Who is a stranger, Chitra, and what is it I have done? You ought to show our brother the courtesies due from a sister-in-law. But you are standing speechless like a doll. Shall not I at least offer these civilities to our sister’s husband? Come in, brother, and sit in more comfort. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Moves towards the inner room taking hold of Usha’s hand).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - Yes, I am coming. My grandfather should know of what has occurred. You, sisters, go in. I shall offer a prayer and join you presently.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Chitralekha, Usha and Leelavati go in. Aniruddha offers a prayer)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">O Grandsire, listen to my prayer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is your vow to save those who belong to you and call on you for help.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I your grandson, and this my beloved wife,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need you, sire. Pray come and help.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are everywhere and see everything;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You melt the hardest heart and bend those who are mighty.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make my beloved’s father forgive what she has done;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And for prahlada’s sake give good to this family.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forgive the trouble I have caused in my ignorance,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And save me and her who is mine. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(He goes in)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Curtain drops)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Servants enter from either side)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FIRST SERVANT: - Hi, here: Is the guard all right? The king wished it to be looked to.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECOND SERVANT: - Is no one to be sent to relieve the guard? We have been here four days.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FIRST SERVANT: - That day as soon as the king went out, the guards of the city gate came and said that Krishna’s discus had come before the city and that it was difficult to keep it off. We had to take out our king’s discus and keep it before the other. As we learnt that Krishna was soon coming himself, we made ready for battle. And amidst this bustle, we forgot all about you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECOND SERVANT: - Has Krishna come?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FIRST SERVANT: - He came this morning with a small army. Our people fought but were beaten. Baneswara and Krishna have stood up to fight each other.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECOND SERVANT: - Who is winning?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FIRST SERVANT: - Baneswara has taken on his thousand arms. Who is then to oppose him? Krishna does not however care for that. His discus alone can conquer the three worlds. The result has to be seen.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SECOND SERVANT: - If somebody relieves me, and see the fight. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FIRST SERVANT: - Well, I shall send some one.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(The two go in different directions) </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(The curtain rises. The front of Usha’s residence. Usha and Chitralekha are seen.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Chitra, what is the news?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - It seems that Sri Krishna and your father are fighting. The result has to be seen.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - I cannot wish complete victory to either. Lord Krishna has to forgive the faults of my father and save him. If father would use some patience all would be well. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Wish good to both.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Servant enters.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SERVANT: - Good madam. Krishna won. It seems the king’s discus was broken and Krishna cut off all his arms. The Yadavas are entering the city.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Alas! What shall we do now? I shall send my husband to beg of Sri Krishna to spare the life of my father. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Goes inside. Bustle outside. Sri Krishna, Banasura, Narada and others enter.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Baneswara, though you have always treated me as an enemy, I have nothing but love to you. You are very dear to me, descendant of Prahlada. You too in your heart must have only love for me, but in loyalty to your race you have had to be unfriendly. Now that my grandson loves your daughter we have a new reason for friendship. Narada was the first to tell Aniruddha about Usha. The first night the boy saw some one else and came sway, but the next night he saw Usha. When he said he would marry her I gladly agreed. If you now approve, we shall solemnise formally the marriage that the young couple have already concluded.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANESWARA: - As you please.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - I know it is not out of mere courtesy you say this. Come, let us go. We have to be very grateful to Narada Maharshi for this our friendship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Krishna, I am afraid of your gratitude. You cut off the arms of the bride’s father on the day of the marriage. What may gratefulness from such a person mean to the man who only brought about the marriage?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - You know what it may mean? (Seeing Chitra)–Who is this young lady?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - It is Chitralekha, my daughter’s companion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - And your devotee, Krishna. Chitra, come and make salutations to our Lord.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Salutations to the revered one. (Bends low in reverence)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - May you prosper, my daughter. Where are Usha and Aniruddha? (They enter)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - (Seeing her father) O! father, how are you? (seeing his arms are all right) I was afraid what had happened to you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Have no fear, child. The loss of those arms is no matter. I have merely slipped oft a burden. Do obeisance to your grandfather, and to Narada Maharshi.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - I shall do your bidding. (Stands beside her husband.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Aniruddha, your boyish prank has caused all this trouble. Make your humble salutations to your father-in-law and Narada Maharshi.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANIRUDDHA: - As you command. (Aniruddha and Usha do obeisance to the elders)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - The priests have been asked to make preparations for the marriage. Let us go there. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: -Very well. Rukmini, Satyabhama and everybody else have come expecting the marriage. If you send word to the camp they will also be present for the ceremony. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - This will be done. (They all go in). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - (To Aniruddha) You too go in, love; I shall come in a moment. (He also leaves. Usha takes hold of Chitralekhal) I have a request to make to you, Chitra.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - You are very formal, Usha. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Leave that aside. Now this is my request. You also agree to marry Aniruddha. I shall ask him to agree.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Usha, please say no more about it; my marriage is over. My lover married me in a dream and disappeared. I cannot marry again. Be happy with Aniruddha. I shall be happy in seeing your happiness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - Is that the final word?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - Quite.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">USHA: - As you please then.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - (To herself) Did Usha mean this offer or make it merely out of civility? (Seeing Narada near-by, looks ashamed.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Are you discontented; Chitralekha?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - No-revered sire.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - Supposing you are, I would say give up discontent. The supreme Lord calls each person to His service in a different way. The invitation may come to you differently.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHITRALEKHA: - I am waiting. But when the invitation comes, how shall I know it is the real one? This was an invitation just now.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NARADA: - The ear knows when the strings are in tune. The mind will know when the proper invitation comes. This call to you was not one to accept. That is why your mind turned away from it. The rule is: keep the heart pure; the call will come in proper time; and when it comes you will know.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Sri Krishna and Baneswara enter in front of the curtain)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - This alliance that has taken place today, has confirmed our friendship. We could not be nearer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Though my grandfather was your devotee, I looked upon you as my enemy all these days. I am happy that you have forgiven this. What I say is not merely wisdom learnt by defeat. Nor is it merely due to the desire that my child should be happy in your house. I pray on my own account that I should be counted as your own.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Good sir, I have never stood aloof from him who desired my friendship. Make sure only of your love to me. Of love on my part have no doubt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - I am grateful. (He goes).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Enter Satyabhama)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SATYABHAMA: - The bride and bridegroom are seated. Instead of wasting your time here, you might as well come and see them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Nobody came and told us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SATYABHAMA: - Have I not come now?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Look at it, Narada. She told us just now and so I should have gone already there. This is married bliss and reason!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SATYABHAMA: - Who doubts that it is bliss and reason? Not you! Come, come, and do not waste time. (All go. Satyabhama aside to Krishna) Come and see the fun. If we had delayed ten days, we should have had the decking with flowers<SUP>2</SUP> instead of marriage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Refined women like you have to be meticulous in these matters. Usha is a Rakshasa girl. What does it matter?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SATYABHAMA: - Now Krishna, what do you think? We call these people Rakshasas, do not we? They call us just the same. That woman they call Malini said in my hearing that we talked like Rakshasa women.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Did she refer to you or to others also? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SATYABHAMA: - Enough of that, come. If I am a Rakshasa woman, won’t you be a Rakshasa?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - Anyhow we are entering into alliances with Rakshasas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SATYABHAMA: - If you have a large family you cannot afford to distinguish between Suras and Asuras. Your descendants have to go elsewhere for girls. And then you also don’t make any distinction between person and person. Any one who<I> </I>approaches you as friend you treat as friend.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - True. (They go in)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Curtain rises. Sri Krishna, Narada, Banasura and others enter the marriage pavilion and take their seats. Usha and Aniruddha make prostrations to elders.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - Isn’t the function over? (As Usha bows her head and makes salutation) Live long and happy as wedded wife. Your mother did not live to see this. If the musicians have come, let them show some of their skill before Sri Krishna.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEELA: - The musicians have all hidden owing to Narada’s presence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BANA: - You sing a song then. (To Sri Krishna) If you hear her sing, sire, you will arrange for her wedding also.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SRI KRISHNA: - That is not difficult. There are many youths among us.</P>

has been a record of senseless killing, carnage and destruction, Now at last

cannot get away from the fact that Indo-China has now become Communist. While
one can acclaim that the “little” men of Indo-China have worsted the world’s
mightiest power and that the combination of reactionary nationalism and Western
imperialism has been successfully defeated, yet it cannot be said that the “<span
class=SpellE>communisation</span>” of Indo-China is an unmixed blessing of <st1:place
w:st="on">South-east Asia</st1:place>. Quite apart from the interminable
argument about the relative merits of communism and <span class=SpellE>bourgeoise</span>
socialist democracies, it is a fact that many of the South-east Asian
countries, even <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
would have liked to see the <span class=SpellE>neutralisation</span> of
Indo-China rather than its <span class=SpellE>communisation</span>. The nations
of the region may find it hard to reconcile themselves to the new situations
and are already blaming the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.

communism all along which only helped the Communists to grow internally and

of course the face of communism has now changed beyond recognition. The fall of
Indo-China has not created as much panic as it would have done in the past, say
a decade-and-half ago. It would be interesting to <span class=SpellE>analyse</span>

in Communist Indo-China <span class=GramE>itself</span> pulls and counter-pulls
are patently visible. For example, <st1:country-region w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:country-region>
which has so far steered clear of the Moscow-Peking quarrel has now moved
nearer <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>,
though the latter would be ill-advised to try to exploit this trend too much. <st1:place
w:st="on">Peking</st1:place>, on the other hand, appeared more pleased with the
victory of the pro-Peking Communists of Cambodia, called the Khmer Rouge. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> reciprocates by
being lukewarm towards the Khmer Rouge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The Americans no longer see <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as keen on expansion. This assumption found the main basis for initiating the
Sino-American dialogue in 1971. <span class=GramE>No doubt the escalation of
the Sino-Soviet rift into one of confrontation, and a confidence that <st1:country-region

have now acquired a more realistic view of the nature of nuclear warfare,
together brought about a policy change in the U. S.</span> For the last quarter
of a century the U. S. firmly held the view that in South-east Asia (also
called the Western Pacific Region, in American strategic terminology) she and
her allies must not be at a disadvantage <span class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span>
the Communist powers, that in each country of the area the anti-Communist
political forces required support from the U. S. or her allies, and that local
rivalry between the non-Communist states must be subordinated to the general
need to present a united front against communism. <i>Now the U. S. has adopted
a more flexible policy which assumes that there are now more than </i>two sides
(more than the Communist and the anti-Communist sides), that no one is likely
to gain complete control, that the non-Communist states of the area are more or
less strong enough to defend themselves against internal sub-version and, above
all, that in any case, the equilibrium which now exists between the U. S., the
U.S.S.R. and China likely to be maintained. This in its turn makes the regional
powers hasten the process of readjustments they have been making <span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
point is that the Sino-Soviet quarrel has rendered even a Communist Indo-China
a least likely instrument of Communist expansionism. The attitude of the
South-east Asian <span class=GramE>nations</span> them-selves confirms this.
Most of the members of the ASEAN (Association of South-east Asian States) have
now established diplomatic relations with <st1:City w:st="on">Peking</st1:City>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Thailand</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region

South-east Asia while <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>

relations with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Of the ASEAN membership <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
reaction, the situation is <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> to the Chinese.
<st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> is not able to exploit the fear of the
looming Chinese presence and the undependability of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

later Moscow’s project of an Asian security system has been cold-shouldered by
important powers of the region. Yet Moscow on its part is trying to impress
these powers of the dangers from China in the shape of subversion from the
pro-Peking and insurrectionary movements in the region, particularly in
Malaysia and Indonesia. The Chinese deny any subversive intentions but they
have a delicate problem on hand. As Dick Wilson of the <i>China Quarterly </i>observed
“On the one hand it (China) is seeking to persuade the established South-east
Asian Governments that it will not try to subvert their efforts to deal as they
see fit with insurrectionary movements and that they therefore have nothing to
fear from <span class=SpellE>normalising</span> relations with China. On the
other hand, it is seeking to retain at least enough of its ties with the
radical Communist movements to satisfy its own ideological conscience and to
prevent them from shifting their allegiance to the Soviet side.” The Chinese
have so far succeeded in steering clear of this dilemma. Yet they have to face
a tough problem in the years to come. The South-east Asian states will certainly
be on their guard on the issue of Communist subversion </span><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Outside the ASEAN, one has to examine Japan’s
reactions. Here again, as only to be expected, a certain amount of uncertainty
is visible, At one level, Japan began its adjustment with China since the
traumatic <span class=SpellE>Kissinger’s</span> visit to China in 1971.
Therefore the sliding of Indo-China into communism and the American policy of
withdrawal do not cause any more of a surprise in Tokyo. Yet at another level
of analysis Japan’s dependence on America should be <span class=SpellE>recognised</span>
and on this score Japan shows some worry. For example, a few weeks after
Saigon’s fall Tokyo announced that for its defence it still relies on American
protection. Yet only a few weeks later the Japanese Government could not muster
courage to ask its Parliament to ratify the N. P. T. which Japan had signed
some years ago.</p>

Communist aggression. The present trends in detente and the Sino-Soviet quarrel
are indeed reassuring to the Japanese on that score. But the prospect of a <i>denouement</i>
in which Korea becomes Communist are scaring to Japan. The encouraging signs of
North-South reconciliation in Korea has now receded and a recrudescence of
hostility is once again evident. Japan apprehends that in this explosive
situation either Russia or China might try out a probing operation to test
American readiness to stand by its Korean commitments. In Tokyo’s calculations
the fall of South Korea is an unacceptable security risk. Hence it is eager to
diffuse the Korean situation. Reports are that U. S. and Japan are together
willing to sponsor a resolution in the U. N. to withdraw the U. N. forces in
Korea (which are there to check North Korean advance into the South) provided
both the Koreas agreed to a valid framework for the 1953 armistice agreement.
Coming from the U. S. and Japan this proposal is indeed far-reaching. North
Korea herself has been insisting for sometime on the withdrawal of U. N.
troops. She has secured the non-aligned support and there are reports the North
Korea has even sought non-aligned membership. The reported U.S.-Japanese move,
if true, will reduce the mileage that the Third-World would begetting out

view of the significant change in South-east Asia, as a measure to counter the

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mainly
two proposals have so far been canvassed. First, Malaysia in 1971 proposed a
plan for the <span class=SpellE>neutralisation</span> of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>whole
region–a plan incorporated into the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of November, 1971.
The idea is that <span class=SpellE>neutralisation</span> will insulate the
region both from super-power rivalry and Chinese domination. While the idea is
slowly gaining acceptance there are certain obvious snags. Because of the
developments in Laos–a state <span class=SpellE>neutralised</span> by
international agreement in the early sixties to keep it out of Vietnam-type
conflict - an attempt that proved abortive in the end some are <span
class=SpellE>scepctical</span> of the solution of neutralization. Further any
viable <span class=SpellE>neutralisation</span> agreement should mean
great-power guarantees and here again doubts about the readiness of the
super-powers persist. Russia, in particular, has been un-<span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
to this plan from the start since this does not fit in with its own proposal
for an Asian security system. Predictably enough, China has given its support
to this <span class=SpellE>neutralisation</span> idea “in principle”. Peking
may have calculated that, after all the reasons of geography would obviously
place her in a <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> situation when once
South-east Asia is rendered out of bounds to the super-powers by <span
class=SpellE>neutralisation</span>. It should also be mentioned that the
Malaysian Plan is again being actively canvassed. In view of the developments
of the last four months and on purely commonsensical grounds too the proposal
is most<i> </i>likely to acquire a ground swell in the corning months. Malaysia
and Indonesia are inviting both North and South Vietnam and <span class=SpellE>Loas</span>
into the ASEAN itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the context of “<span class=SpellE>neutralisation</span>”
there is also talk of a purely regional security arrangement. But, of course,
the problem with this scheme is: who would provide the teeth? It is possible
that the Americans may have assured to underwrite any self-help arrangement.
Curiously enough, the Chinese may not really object to any latent American
presence of the Americans either. For example, in the European context they
accuse the Russians of trying to “squeeze out U. S. influence there for its own
ends.” One suspects that a similar fear is playing on the Chinese mind <span
class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span> South-east Asia. They certainly abhor a slow
Russian penetration with the shrinking of American influence. Such Chinese
apprehensions are strengthened by the phenomenal increase in the Russian naval
presence in the Indian Ocean area, the leverage Moscow now has in Hanoi and,
most important of all, the Russian influence in South Asia, particularly India.
brings us to the issue of the prospects of Russian policy towards the powers of
the region.</p>

is not unlikely that Moscow would also try to revive its <span class=SpellE>favourite</span>
project on Asian security. It may be recalled that since 1969 Moscow has floated
this idea though it has so far not given any detailed blue-print. In the
beginning some suspected that there was an anti-Peking ring round the proposal.
Moscow, however, demurred saying that even China is welcome to join the
proposed Asian security system. Now that the American prestige is at its nadir,
would not Moscow revive the theme in one form or the other? But the odds still
are against the Russians making headway as the attractions of the <span

be India’s reaction to the events? Her reaction to the fantastic success of the
N. L. F. in South Vietnam is, no doubt, one of unqualified jubilation. But an
element of perplexity in New Delhi’s reactions at the rush of events can also
be seen. India is conscious that the balance of advantage has swung decidedly
in Peking’s <span class=SpellE>favour</span>. The thing to be done is at least
to make the regional states <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> that some sort
of a new security arrangement is needed, even when from another analytical
standpoint these states may disavow any threat from China. New Delhi would not
like to project herself as surrogate for Moscow and therefore India’s <span

idea of self-reliance through mutual co-operation which is the same thing as
saying that the area must be free from great power influence. To do this

the form of open differences in attitudes over the issue of great power
presence in the Indian Ocean area. While India joined with Sri Lanka in
sponsoring a resolution urging that the Indian Ocean area be made in a peace
zone, the other powers in the area are not fully convinced of the extent of
India’s commitment to this policy in view of the nature of Indo-Soviet
relations. Equally obvious are the differences over the issue of the

fact during the first half of the seventies Indo-South-east Asian relations
assumed a low profile. In contrast, India continued to put its diplomatic eggs
in the West Asian basket. Since the October, 1973 Middle East War, this trend
became even more pronounced. For example, the last 20 months witnessed
phenomenal increase in visits to and from India and West Asia, ranging from
visits of heads of states and governments to those of official delegations
negotiating various types of agreements for trade and industrial co-operation.
Contacts with South-east Asian countries have been most infrequent. No doubt
the strategy of concentrating on West Asia is quite warranted. Considerations
of oil supplies and expectations of aid from Arab oil profits are only the
immediate motivations. More important is the long term consideration that since
the break up of Pakistan, India has to pay great attention to her Western <span
class=SpellE>neighbours</span>. The emergence of Iran has a regional power with
colossal strategic potential and her ambivalent attitude to India since 1971,
made it imperative for India to give top priority to the West Asian front. In
fact India’s success in arriving at a <i>modus <span class=SpellE>vivendi</span>

one -wonders whether the near neglect of South-east Asia has been wise. For one
thing the pay offs from the West Asia diplomatic investments have not been
optimal and one cannot be sure of the prospect of Indo-Iranian relations. Even
without these limiting considerations operating in relation to our </span><span

consultative relationship. Economic and technical co-operation could provide
the growth point in their relationship. Since everybody is agreed that the
optimum solution for the security problem is a viable defence arrangement among
the local powers, India could play a critical role. It is not impossible that
on the basis of a close understanding of each others perspectives informal and
mutual defence agreements can also emerge. As a matter of fact, the Russians
hoped that a series of bilateral arrangements between the South and South-east
Asian states could serve as an alternative to their proposed Asian security
arrangement. This still seems to be a viable arrangement. However, its
prospects would be brighter if the Soviet Union does not don the sponsors
mantle as the regional states are averse to achieve Russian interest in their
defence arrangements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Venkatarangalya’s</span> translation of <span class=SpellE>Kautilya’s</span>
<span class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span><i>, </i>the book under review,
amply demonstrates that technical literature on Social Sciences in Telugu has
come of age. Doubtless, it makes a significant addition to the growing volume
of scientific literature in this language. The translation incidentally proves
what a pliant and sensitive instrument Telugu turns out to be, when handled by
a master, for purposes of scientific writing. Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span>
Telugu rendering combines technical rectitude and scientific precision with
stylistic case and simplicity. The result is happy; while meeting the
requirements of the exacting specialist, the book presents no problem in
comprehension to the general reader. The author, to be literally correct,
defines his work as a ‘translation’. However, a cursory perusal of this 653
page, closely printed volume would reveal that, thanks to the substantial
original contribution of the professor, it far exceeds the dimensions of a mere
translation. The critical review of many issues like the authenticity of <span
class=SpellE>Kautilya’s</span> authorship of <span class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span><i>
</i>in a 48 page introduction and the elaborate commentary that accompanies the
605 page text convert <span class=GramE>it</span> into a multi-faceted
treatise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
a translation should be free or faithful is a question that perhaps provoked
academic debate since translation began. The excellence of a translation
possibly consists in preserving the personality of the language of translation,
without sacrificing the spirit of the original text. In fact, a translator, if
he were a creative writer, is hardly ever confronted by a pair of sharp and
mutually exclusive alternatives–freedom and fidelity. A reconciliation of these
seemingly opposed virtues in the translator’s work is the mark of his genius.
The present work of Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> provides a
shining example of such reconciliation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
present reviewer is painfully conscious of the serious limitation from which his
exercise suffers; while the translation has been done in Telugu, the review is
being made in English. Consequently, the statements of the reviewer run the
risk of being reduced to safe, although flattering, <span class=SpellE>generalisations</span>
unless they are supported by specific illustrations collected from the
translation and presented in Telugu in the review. How the spirit of the
original has been faithfully transmitted, how the correctness and precision of
the terminology have been preserved, how the subtle shades of meaning of the
Sanskrit expression have been conveyed by the Telugu version, how the text of
the translation reads with unaffected ease, in fact, how the various tests of
the excellence of a translation have been satisfied has to be established by <i>citing
relevant examples in Telugu </i>from the present translation. This is precisely
what cannot be done in the current <i>review in English</i>. Thus the reviewer
regrets that the merits of Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span>
translation can only be suggested but not exhibited. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indeed,
the current translation under review represents a refinement over an earlier
effort made by the professor in collabora</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tion with late Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Akundi</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkata</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sastry</span> and published in 1923 at <span class=SpellE>Vizianagaram</span>.
The immediately striking difference between the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>two editions
consists in the quantitative expansion of their contents from 486 pages in the
1923 version to 653 pages in that of 1968 (inclusive of the introductions). Of
course, it is the qualitative difference between the two that sets the seal of
distinctive importance upon the later version. In a sense, the development of
this volume between 1923 and 1968 reflects the impact of a lifetime of
dedicated research by Professor <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> in
the field of Political Science. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
earlier translation was based more or less exclusively upon the Sanskrit
original edited and Published in 1923 by late Pandit R. <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>
of Mysore; the Current translation takes </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>into account a few
more manuscripts Published since then by other scholars, in particular the <span
class=SpellE>recension</span> of the Sanskrit original brought out by Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Kangli</span> under the auspices of the Bombay University in 1960.
The result is that the current work proves to be academically far more
satisfying, apart from being free from the obscurities and ambiguities that
beset the edition of Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
reason for the improvement in the current translation stems from the more
elaborate treatment in its introduction of the life and times of <span
class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> and the controversies that surround his work <span
class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span><i>, </i>with the result that the
introduction itself has expanded from 36 to 48 pages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
outstanding virtue of the present translation consists in its popular style.
Whereas the earlier work bore upon it the unmistakable stamp of the traditional
scholasticism as indicated by its terse, aphoristic, highly <span class=SpellE>Sanskritised</span>
prose, the work under review is <span class=SpellE>characterised</span> by a
style simple and lucid consistent with technical propriety, brief and pointed,
without sacrificing clarity of thought. The work is bound to be popular; in
addition to meeting the requirements of the savant and the researcher, it would
satisfy a much wider circle of the reading public. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
far the most impressive evidence of improvement over the former translation
consists in the copious footnotes and comments that accompany the text in the
work under review. It is no exaggeration to say that, but for these
illuminating comments, quite a few passages in <span class=SpellE>Kautilya’s</span>
text would have remained obscure, even inexplicable to the lay reader. Apart
from being an index of the author’s erudition and scholarship, they reveal how
well and truly his extensive research in Political Science and Public
Administration served him in interpreting Indian Polity of <span class=SpellE>Kautilya’s</span>
times in terms of its modern counterpart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
random illustrations involving a comparative study of Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Shamasastry’s</span> English translation and Prof. <span
class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span> Telugu translation would surely help in
putting the Professor’s work in perspective. In the first instance, the
approaches of the two writers fundamentally differ: Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>,
the classical scholar, confronted by the earliest known <span class=SpellE>recension</span>
of <span class=SpellE><i>Arthasaslra</i></span><i> </i>and anxious to render an
absolutely faithful translation of it into a language alien in both idiom and
structure, had grapple primarily with textual problems. Prof. <span
class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span>, taking advantage of latter and better
edited <span class=SpellE>recensions</span> at his disposal, addressed himself
as much to interpretation as to mere translation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the 15th <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> in sutras Nos. 47 to 49 dealing with
a difference of opinion between <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> on the one
hand and the schools of <i>Manu, <span class=SpellE>Brihaspati</span> </i>and <span
class=SpellE><i>Usanas</i></span><i> </i>regarding strength of the assembly of
ministers, Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> finds occasion to
add an interpretative footnote saying, “It is clear from this that kings used
to consult not only with ministers individually but with an assembly called <span
class=SpellE><i>mantriparishad</i></span><i> </i>(p. 42), while Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>, having no linguistic problem here, contents
himself with a simple translation. <span class=GramE>On the contrary, with
regard to sutra No. 53.</span> Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>,
assuming the original text at his disposal to be mistaken, corrects the term <span
class=SpellE><i>asanna</i></span><i> </i>(as given in it) into <span
class=SpellE><i>anasanna</i></span><i> </i>(not near). Inferring from the ease
with which Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> disposed of this
passage, we believe that he apparently faced no such linguistic problem. We
give hereunder the identical passage as rendered by both the writers, to
provide an interesting insight into their respective approaches to, and
appreciation of, the original. Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>:
“He shall supervise works in company with his officers that are near <span
class=SpellE><i>asanna</i></span><i>; </i>and consult by sending writs <i>(<span
class=SpellE>Patrasampreshanena</span></i>) to those that are not near <i>(<span
class=SpellE>anasanna</span>).</i>”<i> </i>(p. 28, 4th Edition, 1951) Prof. <span
class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span>: “He should take counsel in company with
the <span class=SpellE><i>mantrins</i></span><i> </i>that are present; he
should consult those that are not present by means of writs.” (Re-translation
is ours p. 42) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the second <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span>
22 it would appear as though the original text in sutras Nos. 13 and 14 is
capable of being translated in more than one way. Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>
initially translated it saying, “If cultivators pay their taxes </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>easily,
they may be <span class=SpellE>favourably</span> supplied with grains, cattle
and money.” (p. 46) However, in a footnote he proceeds to Suggest–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“The
passage may mean: Cultivators may be supplied with cattle, etc, and these they
may return at their convenience.” In Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span>
translation, the self-same passage reads thus: “(The king) should <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> (cultivators) by giving them grain, cattle money and
they have to return them at their convenience.” (p. 66) (Re-translation is
ours) He comments in a footnote that “These are like the present day <span
class=SpellE>taccavi</span> loans; it has been a very ancient custom for
government to extend all kinds of assistance to cultivators.” It is noteworthy
that Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span> rendering of this
passage closely resembles (if expressed in English) what Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span> says in his footnote by way of <i>a correction.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again,
in <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> 12, in Sutra 28 Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>
finds that the term “<span class=SpellE>rupa</span>” used by<i> <span
class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> </i>is ambiguous. He is not sure whether it means<i>
<span class=SpellE>Parikshika</span>, </i>testing charge, as the commentator (<span
class=SpellE>Battaswamy</span>) takes it, or the <span class=SpellE>premia</span>
of eight per cent (<span class=SpellE>rupika</span>), or whether it means cash,
is not possible to determine.” However, he uses it in its ordinary sense,
‘cash’ (p. 87). No </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>such ambiguity is traceable in the
professor’s work. He explains in a footnote that the term ‘<span class=SpellE>rupa</span>’
means a fee payable for supervision (p. 121). Here are instances which show
that a knowledge of the fiscal practices of the <span class=SpellE>Mauryan</span>
age, in addition to Sanskrit, would be helpful in extracting the meaning of <span
class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span><i> </i>exactly and correctly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the third <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span> and third <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span>,
Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span> holds the view that <i>the
original text as known to him in respect of sutras Nos. 10 and 11 is corrupt. </i>His
translation of the passage reads: “The same kind of punishments shall be meted
out to a woman, who moved with jealousy or hatred, shows cruelty to her
husband. Punishment <i>for engaging in</i> <i>sports at the door of or outside
her husband’s house </i>shall be as dealt with elsewhere.” (p. 176) c., (<span
class=SpellE><i>Italicised</i></span><i> </i>is ours) He refers in a footnote
to a Tamil and Malayalam commentary which bases the wife’s jealousy on her
husband’s connection with a prostitute. While no mention of <i>such </i>textual
corruption is made by Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span>, his
translation of the passage reads significantly different. (Sutra 11)
“Punishment as indicated elsewhere to a wife who, on account of jealousy, goes
about outside the house.” (Re-translation is ours) (p. 219) A footnote explains
that the wife might be jealous on account of either other wives or prostitutes.
Here is a typical instance where passages of doubtful authenticity in the
original involve even a competent translator in statements of uncertain meaning
such as Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry’s</span> cited above; the more
convincing rendering of Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span> might
be attributed as much to the availability of better <span class=SpellE>recensions</span>
of the original as to his mastery over his craft. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the same third <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span>, the eighth <span
class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> appears to be a fruitful source of trouble to
scholar-translators. Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span> observes that
“The whole chapter is full of obscure technical words,” and admits that his
“translation is only tentative” and further adds that the Tamil and Malayalam
commentary too is not clear in this context (vide footnote, p. 190). The
intriguing passage which provoked this observation is translated thus: <i>“With
the exception of private rooms and <span class=SpellE>parlour</span> (<span
class=SpellE>angana</span>) </i>all other open parts of houses as well as
apartments where fire is ever kindled for worship or a mortar is situated shall
be thrown open for common use.” (p. 190) <i>(<span class=SpellE>Italicised</span>
</i>is ours) The corresponding translation of Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span>
is not merely </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>briefer and less involved but conveys a
significantly different meaning for a section of the passage: “Warehouses,
courtyards, toilettes, kitchens, grain-pounding halls, open places–all these
shall be thrown open for common use.” (p. 236) (Re-translation is ours) It may
be noted<i> </i>that in the statement of the professor no exception is allowed
for purposes of common use. Further, his footnote regarding the passage throws
an interesting sidelight on community living in that age. “From this it is seen
that two or three families lived as tenants in the same house.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

brief comparative study between the translation of Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>
and Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> with the help of a few
select instances (they can be multiplied <i>ad lib</i>)<i> </i>is attempted not
with any intention of assessing their relative merits but solely for the
purpose of <span class=SpellE>focussing</span> attention on the academic
challenge with which an ancient text bristling with technical terms almost
laconic in expression and often obscure in meaning confronts the translators.
We offer our salutation to the great pioneering work of<i> </i>Pandit <span
class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>. At the same time, we are inclined to believe
that the eminently readable rendering under review, so free from uncertainties,
so convincing in its statements, so plausible in its observations, owes in no
small measure to the <span class=SpellE>specialised</span> knowledge of Prof. <span
class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> about the political, economic and social
conditions reflected in the <span class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span><i>. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And this naturally leads us to an examination of the
commentary of Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span>. True, the work
under review mould be assessed, not on the basis of its claims as a critical
interpretation, but solely its merits as a translation. That precisely is the
reason why we have left the substantial introduction severely alone, although
the Professor’s learned discussion of the authenticity of <span class=SpellE>Kaulilya’s</span>
authorship of his date, of his life and career, the exact subject matter of <span
class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span> (commonly misconceived as Economics) and
above all the administrative system delineated in that treatise deserves a
close study by all serious students of ancient Indian history and polity.
However, we prefer to dwell at some length on the illuminating comments of
Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya</span> offered mostly in the form of
footnotes. In our view, they constitute a major attraction of his work, second
in importance only the text proper. These<i> </i>comments that run like an
undercurrent throughout the text number as many as 674; indeed, printed by
themselves they can easily form a booklet. In the last <span class=SpellE>sloka</span>
in the original the author (<span class=SpellE>Vishnugupta</span>) claims to
have himself written both the Sutras and their <span class=SpellE>Bhashya</span>.
Actually, Sutras alone have been found in it, and no <span class=SpellE>Bhashya</span>.
It is good that the Professor supplied the missing element and so completed the
treatise. </p>

Prof. <span class=SpellE>Venkatarangaiya’s</span> comments throughout provide
revealing insight into the subjects under reference, special mention can be
made only of some random samples like the one on page 5 (No.1) explaining the
composition of the original treatise, comprising a little less than 5000 <span
class=SpellE>slokas</span> (instead of 6000 as claimed in it) and 5370 sutras;
on page 33 (No.3) pointing out a similarity between the proposition of <span
class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> in sutra 7 and Social Contract Theory in Western
political thought; on page 56 (No.1) referring to the view of critics that 19th
<span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> in the first <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span>
implies the existence of kingdoms small enough to be directly ruled by kings
and a political situation prior to the establishment of the <span class=SpellE>Mauryan</span>
empire; on page 92 (No.2) showing how <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span>, by
maintaining that punishment should be proportionate to crime, followed a via
media policy, rejecting extremist views (and this opinion is repeated in the
comment on p. 249) ; on page 107 (No.1) arguing that sutra 63 provides one of
the principal items of internal evidence establishing <span class=SpellE>Kautilya’s</span>
authorship of <span class=SpellE><i>Arthasastra</i></span><i> </i>; on page 141
(last paragraph), taking note of the trade and commerce carried on by
government in the time of <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> and commenting
that the 16th <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> in the second <span

in economic sphere has a special relevance to the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>current
thinking on Socialist society; on page 233 (No. 1) differing from <span
class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> in respect of his views about the origin of mixed
castes, as stated by him in sutras 26 to 34 (pp. 232-33) and arguing that some
of the castes are actually traceable to places of origin and others to
occupations; on page 259 (No. l) commenting that sutras 26 to 33 deal with
regulations which resemble modern <span class=SpellE>labour</span> legislation;
on page 315 (No. 1) drawing attention to the unusual legal convention
prevailing in those times, totally unknown to us now that judges who failed to
discharge their duties properly were as much subject o punishment as ordinary
criminals; on page 338 (No.1) expressing a censorious opinion on the dubious
measures mentioned by <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> for purposes of
filling the treasury; on page 373 (No.1) noticing how <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span>
held the view that peace is always preferable to war; on page 387 (No.1)
explaining how <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> was aware of the importance
of conciliating the people for a king intent upon </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(mentioned
in sutras 19 to 28); on page 489 (No. 1) establishing that <span class=SpellE>deceipt</span>
is not repugnant to statecraft, especially when used to get a son given as a
hostage set free; on page 474 (No.2) asserting that according to sutras 17 and
18, first <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> in ninth <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> is the foremost among political theorists
who propounded the thesis that the whole of India constitutes a single empire;
on page 530 (No.1) maintaining that the first <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span>
in the eleventh <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span> is of paramount importance
since it makes it clear that in ancient India in addition to monarchical States
there were States ruled by aristocracies and that it deals with methods adopted
by kings in the former bent upon imperial expansion to sow seeds of dissension
among the confederate rulers in the latter; on page 546 (No. 1) pointing out a
rather <span class=SpellE>anamolous</span> <span class=SpellE>featllre</span>
in the text namely that whereas the 4th <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> in
the eleventh <span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span> claims to contain two <span
class=SpellE>Prakaranas</span>, the 166th and 167th, actually with the
exception of 20th Sutra, the rest of the sutras pertain to the 166th <span
class=SpellE>Prakarana</span> alone; and finally on page 576 (No.1) explaining
the importance of the fifth <span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span> in the thirteenth
<span class=SpellE>Adhikarana</span> on the ground that it deals with the
policy that a conqueror should adopt to win over a vanquished people, and
adding how foreign rulers’ <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> in the modern
age runs counter to this advice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
certain features of the method of translation are particularly gratifying. In
the first place, the enumeration of the sutras in serial order and assignment
of the translated material to its corresponding sutra number (traceable to the
original) makes for quick and easy reference; and clubbing of sutras containing
related ideas in the same paragraph, while allowing such of them as possess
importance all their own to stand separately helps in projecting significant
portions of the text prominently. Further, the close association of the original
and the translation is conveyed by maintaining a one to one correspondence
between the two in respect of <span class=SpellE>slokas</span> at the end of <span
class=SpellE>Prakaranas</span>. These happy features are conspicuous by their
absence in the translation of 1923. However, it may be noted that in the 1923
version at the end of each chapter (<span class=SpellE>Adhyaya</span>) the <i>total
number of <span class=SpellE>Adhyayas</span> </i>covered till then is
mentioned, after the manner adopted by Pandit <span class=SpellE>Shamasastry</span>
in his English translation; this feature has not been repeated in the version
under review. The reason might<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>be that
the provision in this version a table of contents in the modern fashion, giving
details of <span class=SpellE>Adhikaranas</span>, <span class=SpellE>Adhyayas</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Prakaranas</span> along with their names and pages, is
thought to have obviated the need of repeated <span class=SpellE>enumeratian</span>

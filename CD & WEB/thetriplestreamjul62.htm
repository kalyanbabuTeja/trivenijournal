style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
owe an explanation to the readers of <i>Triveni </i>regarding the recent
history of the journal. In January 1958, Sri <span class=SpellE>Burra</span> V.
<span class=SpellE>Subrahmanyam</span>, Advocate, High Court of Andhra Pradesh,
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:place></st1:City>,
assumed the main responsibility for editing and publishing <i>Triveni. </i>He
had been associated with me as Joint Editor during the years 1936 to 1940, when
the journal was being published from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>.
He was in sole charge of it in 1941 when, as a member of the Madras Legislative
Assembly, I offered individual Satyagraha and went to prison for a year. I can
never forget the devotion and efficiency displayed by Sri <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanyam</span>
in the years prior to the shifting of the office to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:place></st1:City> in 1942. From 1950 to 1957, the
journal was published from <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span> by Sri B. <span
class=SpellE>Narasimha</span> Rao of Triveni Publishers, with Sri M. <span
class=GramE>Sivakamayya as Joint Editor.</span> Towards the end of 1957, I
suffered from a serious nervous breakdown and had to resign the Chief
Editorship of the Southern Languages Book Trust, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, after a brief tenure of one year. The
dear friends in <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span> were willing, as ever, to
continue to co-operate with me and publish the journal from <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>.
But I had a feeling that if <i>Triveni </i>was to prosper and attain loftier
heights in the realm of Indian Journalism, it ought to be published from a
great city like Hyderabad which is the meeting-point of North and South, a
university centre, and the home of scholars and writers belonging to
half-a-dozen language groups. I therefore requested Sri <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanyam</span>
to <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span> the function for which he had the requisite
literary gifts, widespread influence, and financial resources. He agreed with
pleasure and took the burden off my ageing shoulders. It seemed as if a new
chapter was commencing in the history of the journal, and a younger and more
energetic Editor would give it a fresh lease of glorious achievement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
a time all went well, and the numbers of the journal edited by Sri <span
class=SpellE>Subrahmanyam</span> bore evidence of his critical acumen and
punctilious attention to detail. But by 1960, it became clear that he could not
devote much attention to <i>Triveni, </i>because of his preoccupation with the
growing volume of his professional work as a lawyer. He tried hard, and with
the utmost sincerity, to do his duty by <i>Triveni, </i>but found it well-nigh
impossible. The journal appeared irregularly and at prolonged intervals. The
impression gained ground that it was languishing and would soon disappear from
the literary scene. After anxious thought, and with some hesitation, I proposed
to Sri <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanyam</span>, early in 1962, to restore <i>Triveni
</i>to me and leave me free to make alternative arrangements for its
publication. He took some time to come to a decision: he loved the work and had
all along intended to pursue his two-fold aim of editing <i>Triveni </i>and of
relieving me of the enormous strain I had borne for over thirty years. But he
realized that our joint dream of 1958 had not come true and that a change-over
was inevitable. The memory of that dream will, however, abide with me and my
erstwhile colleague, and our mutual affection is unabated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

new dream of 1962 is that Sri Sivakamayya and Sri <span class=SpellE>Narasimha</span>
Rao will re-build this broken mansion. Sri Sivakamayya is Principal of the
Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span> Kalasala (<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">National</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>)
which celebrated its Golden Jubilee last year. Through him, as
Editor-Principal, are linked two institutions with an idealistic bent, even as
they were linked once before in 1933 and 1934 when I filled that dual role. On
Sri Sivakamayya devolves the responsibility of editing the journal, with such
slight assistance as a senior like me–tired and old, and with defective
eyesight–can offer. Sri Sivakamayya is a scholar of distinction and devoted to
cultural pursuits. And he has the advantage of being, like Sri <span
class=SpellE>Subrahmanyam</span>, fifteen years younger than <span class=GramE>myself</span>.
The journalists of my generation are verging on seventy, and some of the
noblest among them–<span class=SpellE>Khasa</span> <span class=SpellE>Subba</span>
Rau, V. <span class=SpellE>Bhaskaran</span>, and K. Rama Rao–have passed away.
But I am full of hope that Sri Sivakamayya and the writers of the younger
generation will win added recognition for <i>Triveni </i>as a glowing symbol of
our Renaissance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I love to dwell on Dr. Radhakrishnan as a connoisseur of literature and the

appearance, like the famous <span class=SpellE><i>Hibbert</i></span><i> Journal

distinguished writers. It had a bright, but very brief, existence and stopped
with the thirteenth number. <i>Triveni </i>was then in the third year of its

that <i>The New Era </i>might be incorporated with <i>Triveni. </i>I

part of a well-meant programme of national integration, the three-language
formula has been accepted by the Chief Ministers of all the States of the
Indian Union. But its implementation in the Hindi States presents some
difficulties, and the Government of Uttar Pradesh is already “having second
thoughts”. While provision may be made for the teaching of Hindi in all schools
and colleges in the non-Hindi States, the <i>compulsory </i>study of Hindi by
little children of eight or nine years, in addition to the mother-tongue and
English, is a wholly unnecessary imposition. It is equally unnecessary and even
futile to compel children in U. P., Rajasthan, <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>
and Madhya Pradesh to learn Kannada or Telugu. The Hindi-speaking students may
find it more advantageous to learn Samskrit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not so pronounced now as in the first few years following the achievement of
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>.
The Minister for Education in Andhra Pradesh has directed that the compulsory
study of English in schools should begin at the third standard instead of at
the sixth (corresponding to the First Form). In <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
English will be taught from the fourth standard. With regard to the medium of
instruction, there is a divergence of opinion. While Dr. <span class=SpellE>Shrimali</span>
visualizes the adoption of the regional languages in place of English by all
the Indian universities before the end of the Third Plan period, educationists
of the eminence of Dr. A. <span class=SpellE>Lakshmanaswami</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mudaliar</span>, Vice-Chancellor of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> <span class=GramE>university</span>,
are entirely opposed to such a sudden change. The Education Minister of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City> is of the view
that this question of the medium of instruction during the Degree Course in
universities ought to be left to the unfettered decision of the universities
which are autonomous bodies. Even in the higher secondary stage, the Education
Department of Andhra Pradesh has suggested that, during the third and fourth
years of the new four-year higher secondary course, English should be the
medium for at least two subjects. And the Minister proposes to establish high
schools in every district of the State with English as the sole medium of
instruction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the three-language formula implies the teaching of three languages compulsorily
to every boy and girl in every State of India, it ought to be scrapped
forthwith<sup>1</sup> and give place to a sensible and practicable two-language
formula, covering not only the educational sphere but also the spheres of
legislation and administration. According to the assurance given by the Prime
Minister, English and Hindi will be the two languages employed by the Centre for
all-India purposes. In this connection, it must be clearly stated that the
different States of the Indian Union will have the right to choose between
English and Hindi as the medium of correspondence with the Centre. Within each
State, the two-language formula will imply the use of English and the regional
language at different levels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

examinations conducted by the <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span>, and some of them
served the cause of inter-State goodwill by translating valuable books from
Hindi into their mother-tongue, and <i>vice versa</i>. This good work will
continue when, in addition to the classes run by the <span class=SpellE>Pracharaks</span>
of the <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span>, every high school and college provides
for the optional study of Hindi. Any element of compulsion will only retard
this normal progress of Hindi in the non-Hindi States. From this point of view,
Hindi-enthusiasts of the type of Seth <span class=SpellE>Govinda</span> Das and
Dr. <span class=SpellE>Raghu</span> <span class=SpellE>Vira</span> have done a
disservice to the cause of Hindi. It is time they realized the futility of
their ill-conceived propaganda and allowed students all over India to learn
only two languages–their mother-tongue and English–compulsorily, and to take up
a third one as a matter of free choice at a later stage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

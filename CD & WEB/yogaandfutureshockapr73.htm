<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today’s
culture is a hectic trading floor crowded with competing ideas. The balance
between novel and familiar situations has been altered radically. Accelerating
rates of change compel us to cope with a faster flow of information, and with
more and more situations to which our previous personal experience does not
apply. In his forecasts for the year 2000, for example, Herman Kahn predicts a “learning
society” in which all, young and old alike, will have to get new educations
every four years merely to keep up. Some will be able to maintain the tortuous
pace, but many will not. Falling farther and farther behind, we will become
casualties of change, aliens in our own culture, victims of Future Shock. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Trying
to keep pace in a world which changes faster than we can change is damaging
both to body and mind. According to Alvin Tomer, author of widely discussed
book, <i>Future Shock, </i>this disorder will afflict more as the pace of life
continues to accelerate. For example, when a Peace Corps volunteer suddenly is
without the companionship of his own people in the black country of Brazil or a
rural village in Thailand, he is bombarded constantly with bewildering
experience. The taste of food, the songs and games or children, the greetings
of passers-by are all strange or incomprehensible. His ways of performing even
the simplest tasks, like getting shirts laundered or checking the weather
forecasts, are no longer possible. When familiar cues which guide day-to-day
behaviour are suddenly withdrawn and are replaced by puzzling new ones, his mind
and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>body<i> </i></span>are thrown into
a cultural shock: he experiences acute feelings of agitation, depression,
confusion, and fatigue. The bodily rhythms of sleep and hunger are upset. This
is often followed by illness. A very similar reaction accompanies Future Shock.
According to Toffler, “Future Shock is a time phenomenon, a product of the
greatly accelerated rate of change in society. It arises from the super-imposition
of a new culture on an old one. It is culture shock in one’s own society.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the past, culture was a repository of tradition and long-standing habit. An
innovative idea or a new way of performing a task would require years, even
generations, before it was widely circulated and adopted. But not because of
rapid changes, threatening danger sets off a complex alarm system to prepare
one physiologically for fight or flight. This alarm mechanism is one part of a
complex adaptive system which is activated, at least partially, countless times
in a day. It can be triggered by worry, conflict, uncertainty, surprise, even
by the anticipation of change. And under normal living conditions, the alarm
mechanism efficiently protects us. But as Dr. Hans Sclye has warned, “No
organism can exist continuously in a state of alarm.” When stress occurs too
frequently, or is too prolonged and severe, the body loses its ability to
resist and becomes vulnerable to disease and deterioration. The thesis of “Future
Shock” is that one critical outcome of experiencing too much change too rapidly
is the weakening and eventual loss of adaptive capacity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
sophisticated approach to physiological and psychological self-control,
developed 22 centuries ago by Patanjali and his followers (the system we know
as Raja Yoga), is now attracting widespread interest among scientific
researchers. The reason for their rigorous testing or the traditional claims of
Yoga is that, if confirmed, the techniques or Yoga can be used to protect
oneself from chronic over-stimulation, and thus avoid the danger of being
thrown into Future Shock. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
provocative study was conducted by Dr. Robert Keith Wallace of the ULCA School
of Medicine, who reported his research in science. The physiological responses
of 15 college students were monitored before, during and after a half-hour
period of meditation. All were relatively inexperienced in the techniques of
meditation; most had practised for only a few months before the study. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nevertheless,
within five minutes after beginning to meditate, metabolic processes decreased
significantly; the heart rate slowed and less oxygen was consumed. The
electrical resistance of the skin increased markedly; indicating that the
students had drifted into a relaxed non-vigilance. Brain-wave recordings
revealed a predominance of alpha rhythms, the characteristic EEC activity which
accompanies an alert, non-drowsy state of calm, devoid of thinking or of
concrete, visual imagery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dr.
Wallace pointed out that the meditative state resembles neither a hypnotic
trance nor sleep. The physiological responses which occur during meditation are
most similar to those observed during the transitional “twilight” stage between
sleep and wakefulness. Meditation lasts for a longer time, of course, and does
not end in a loss of consciousness. Meditation also may be more restful and
restorative than sleep since it is more effective in slowing down some of the
metabolic processes. Dr. Wallace concluded that meditation is a unique state of
awareness, what might be described as “conscious sleep”. Related research
conducted at the All-India Institute of Medical Science found evidence that
Yoga breathing and postural exercises, practised over a period of time, produce
enduring changes in physiological responsiveness with beneficial effects on
mental and physical health. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
psychological value of Yoga-inducted meditation is as pronounced as are its
physiological effects. There are four principal benefits: First, one learns how
to monitor inner states, and to detect the early warning signs of impending
overstimulation. Toffler recommends, as a preventive measure against Future
Shock, that we should “introvert periodically to examine our own bodily and
psychological reactions to change, briefly tuning out the external environment
to evaluate our inner environment. The individual can consciously look for
signs of being keyed up too much. Heart palpitations, tremors, insomnia, or
un-explained fatigue may well signal overstimulation, just as confusion,
unusual irritability, profound lassitude and a panicky sense that timings are slipping
out of control are psychological indications. By observing ourselves, we can
determine whether we are operating comfortably with our adaptive range or
pressing its outer limits. We can, in short, consciously assess our own life
pace.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Meditation
heightens perceptiveness of inner processes, and provides a baseline or
relaxation and quietude against which to compare any other state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Second,
one can counter the immediate psychological effects of overstimulation. If
meditation can be understood as conscious sleep, it is a profoundly peaceful,
healing, and restoring sleep. One of the grave consequences of physiological
overstimulatlon is the psychological state which accompanies the exhaustion of
the body’s adaption system. Depression, fatigue, and pessimism result. The
sufferer feels cornered and defeated, impotent and aimless. Meditation and the
practice of Yoga dissipate feelings of depression by promoting the quick
recovery of the adaptive system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Third,
with the mastery of Yoga one gains an effective means of mood control.
Gradually, he learns how to turn on an inner state or tranquillity, calm
alertness, youthful potency–free from fear and worry. At first only transient,
the mood becomes more and more pervasive as a life-enhancing sense of
well-being penetrates our reveries and day dreams, habits of thought and
periods of concentration. Calm purposefulness becomes a style of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally,
the Yoga student discovers enjoyment from the challenge of change, and even
seeks its stimulation and excitement, because he has confidence he can cope
with it–drawing upon self-renewing reserves of strength, energy and resilience
both mental and physical. Confronted with sudden and severe stress, he is no
longer forced to resist rigidly or to retreat into fearful seclusion. The
demands of new circumstances are adapted effortlessly, and the opportunities
for continuing growth and development which change creates are exploited
without delay. There is freedom to seek the exhilaration of change without
risking Future Shock. One can joyfully ride the crest of change while keeping
an agile balance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

wavelengths. Basically chronological. A centennial Biography). By Durai Raja
Singam, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. Price: $ 56 (Malaysian) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Durai
Raja Singam is indeed a wonderful man. Anyone who has watched him at his
performance in bringing out volume after volume on Ananda Coomaraswamy,
containing valuable information of many unknown facts about the great savant,
cannot but be feeling humble to realise how small in contrast to others,
claiming to have studied Coomaraswamy’s works, have been able to do. It, was
only in 1974, we had from Durai Raja Singam a sumptuous volume entitled <i>Ananda
Coomaraswamy: Remembering and Remembering Again and Again </i>and before the
ink is dry there is an­other with a lot of material which any researcher on Ananda
Coomaraswamy would welcome and try to profit by. If Rajaji, once in a letter
(4-10-1958), described Durai Raja Singam as a wonderful person, a most lovable
friend” every epithet of his can be justified as discerningly uttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
the introduction and the postscript to it included here, we are made to understand
how for nearly thirty years the author has toiled in collecting material for
this precentennial publication. He says: “This volume, printed on art paper in
an edition limited to <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>300<i> </i></span>copies,
is a centennial study of Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy. The whole work will take the
form of some forty or more (nearly fifty) monographs under various titles, of
which the first thirty-one (632 pages), forming this volume, have so far
appeared......” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Indeed
none can surpass Durai Raja Singam in his one-pointed devotion to Ananda
Coomaraswamy. We find in this multi-purposed collection of material, the
several aspects of the amazing ­genius of the great savant. The wide reach and
unapproachable accuracy with which Ananda Coomaraswamy had made his exegetical
survey of many of our arts and handicrafts apart from his critical comments and
observations, there are many hitherto, unpublished notes on many subjects and
his own English translations of poems of Tagore and of other Tamil, Gujarati
and Bengali writers which find a place here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
volume has a melancholy interest too to readers owing to the dedication to a
recently departed son of the author who bore the same name as that of the
subject of this volume and whose death under tragic circumstances through a car
accident in London, adds poignancy to the whole inscription. Despite the
consuming sorrow in which Durai Raja Singam was fated to work, the spirit of <i>Tapas
</i>should have held him up for the execution of this momentous work, completed
within the scheduled time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
book of this kind becomes engrossing study to everyone interested in knowing
more about Ananada Coomaraswamy, who unusually resisted all attempts of his
admirers in drawing him out to provide them with details of his life and work.
His reply deserves to be remembered by everyone today with a claim for some
public work done and distinction won in his or her field of activity trying to
blaze forth the triumphs won with ample autobiographical details. As the
reviewer in the <i>Hindustan Times </i>of 17th July, 1977, observed: “For him
(Coomaraswamy) portraiture of human beings is but <i>asvargya. </i>He would
have been content to remain nameless like the ancient artists. This was not
modesty in the human sense, but a rare kind of transcendental egolessness with
spiritual overtones.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So,
even the indefatigable Durai Raja Singam could not persuade the scholar Colossus
to relent to his importunities for details of his life. But what has been so
far collected, without any little slackness, is enough to amaze anybody on the
search for more information of the man and his work. Coomaraswamy’s contacts
with other important persons of the world such as Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi,
Sister Nivedita, Romain Rolland, Okakura, and his correspondence with many
art-critics and writers of the West, are filling the pages here, and
contributing to the zeal of the reader in his curiosity for ampler information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
photo-blocks of the scholar in many of his poses as well as the pictures
relating to some of the domestic scenes of his life add considerably to a publication
so well-planned and executed with enviable finish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
publication has cost the author a great deal. As a labour of unusual love this
unique volume has been brought out and every­one having a chance to get it and
dwell upon its contents cannot but long reflect upon a remarkable scholar and
the none-the-less remarkable disciple of his, in an age of short memories and
un-­steady loyalties. Possessed though of the ardour of a youth in his worship
of his idol, nowhere has Durai Raja Singam overstated anything. The entire
world of scholars are placed in irredeemable debt to him for this single volume
itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
this slim volume of 33 pages of demy quarto, the reader would find enormous
wealth of information of every phase of Indian art. This was a lecture
delivered by Dr Ananda K. Coomaraswamy at the Metropolitan Museum, New York, in
1933. S. Durai Raja Singam has acquired the notes of this lecture from Dr
Marguerite Beck Block and brought out this precious volume. Durai Raja Singam’s
zeal knows no bounds in writing or editing anything on Dr Coomaraswamy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
this volume under review Dr Coomaraswamy has expound­ed the Indian art in a
nutshell in a condensed form; this is an entire history and description of
Indian art in a miniature form. Dr Coomaraswamy discussed in these pages all
the aspects of aesthetics as well as the mysteries of Indian sculpture. Art
creation, art appreciation, art experience, connoisseurship, the relationship between
form and content, form and shape, the diverse aspects of beauty, etc., have
found their critical-cum-creative elucidation in a masterly way. Moreover, a
meticulous chronology also is provided in the end of the book; this chronology
is full of the details of Indian history relating to art epochs. This lecture of
Dr Ananda K. Coomaraswamy is a most comprehensive exposition of Indian art.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
is a treatise which deals not only with formal arts but also with Indian
languages, literatures, ethnology and anthropology. In short, this slim volume
deals with entire Indian culture. About culture Dr Coomaraswamy writes, “Culture
is consciousness; primarily, an unprejudiced comprehension of one’s own
civilization. This is only possible when we have some idea of its relation to
other cultures–likeness and differences. A capacity for making subtle
distinctions must be cultivated actually current ideas about the Orient or
still excessively crude, that is either romantic, or intolerent; this is a
provincial rather than a cultured condition. To make fine distinctions the
student must adopt an entirely disinterested attitude, laying aside notions of ‘this
is higher’ or ‘best’.” Indeed a fine attitude towards culture!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
classification of Indian images is one of the interesting parts of this book.
The differences among the various types, various postures, various gestures and
various expressions are well delineated in these pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All
that a student of Indian art requires has been dealt with meticulously in this
volume. In fact, this is a mini-miniature encyclopaedia. Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy
was discontent of art­-knowledge possessed by the Indians and thus this
lecture, though intended for the Americans, would in every way be of immense utility
to the Indians too.</p>

Tamil Mudaliars of Ceylon (present Sri Lanka), especially the residents of
Jaffna, were instrumental in imparting the new light of Western civilization
and culture to Ceylon through the process of modernization without entirely
eliminating the tints of their own rich religious traditions. Sir Mutu Coomaraswamy’s
father, Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy had paved the way of modern education in
Ceylon. Arumugam Coomaraswamy had established his home at Colombo and thus he
was able to create an urban atmosphere in his family. He married a lady, by
name Visalakshi, in 1833. These were the parents of Sir Mutu Coomaraswamy.</p>

his times in glowing colours. Durai Raja Singam’s English style, which is

Mutu Coomaraswamy was not destined to grow famous by the fame of his more
famous son. Dr Ananda Kenlish Coomaraswamy nor the latter was world renowned

special sphere. In the later half of the last century Sir Mutu Coomaraswamy was
the pioneer Tamil of Ceylon in the new and reformed outlook which he evinced by
marrying an English woman, by name Elizabeth Clay Beeby. Sir Mutu Coomaraswamy
was a living paradox consisting of opposing traits and tendencies. He was a
Barrister-at-law and married an English woman and yet was orthodox in his
religious views. He was an ardent student of Saiva Siddhanta and at the same
time a pro­found scholar of Pali language and Buddhist literature. He studied
English, Tamil, Sinhalese, Pali, Latin and Greek. He was a master exponent of
both traditional and modern ideology. He lived and thought in modern ideology
and yet adhered to traditional religions!</p>

author of this highly engaging book was a Military Secretary of Dr Rajendra
Prasad during his presidentship from 26th Jan., 1950, up to almost the end of
his term in office. It is obvious that as one in his office very near the
President, a high dignitary, he had occasions to know many details of both the
personality of the man and the domestic events of his household, Rashtrapati
Bhavan. However close he might have been and tempted to make amusing comments
of events and persons, there is a healthy restraint in his accounts of the
dealings and activities of the President, especially when as an incumbent to
the position unoccupied by anyone previously, the President felt many things
proving unsuited to his spirit. The narration gains in interest because of the
subdued humour underlying the many inconvenient situations for the President,
when he had to adjust himself to the demands of an experience, the like of
which he had no idea at all in his career till then. Further, there are
occasions when Dr Rajendra Prasad got irritated by the conditioned, official
formalities and observances of rules of etiquette of the office, which made him
have differences (as to the procedure) with the Prime Minister, Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, whose anxiety remained ever to keep up a high tradition in
every matter pertaining to the new office of a President without impairing the
image of India in the eyes of the world.</p>

strict codes of the protocol become often ungainly in their accusations against
such restrictions as have to be undergone in expecting from a President of a

is a soul-stirring devotional lyric of one thousand verses in varied metres
divided into ten cantos in praise of Dayaa or compassion personified as the
consort of the Lord residing in His heart and going in search of sinners to
redeem them unlike the Goddess Laxmi who dwells on His bosom and favours the
righteous only. It is at the instance of Dayadevi, that the Lord incarnated as
a man on this earth several times and suffered a lot, but protect­ed and
blessed innumerable righteous persons. Just as a land though ploughed and
manured yields no fruits if there are no rains, all sorts of worships and righteous
acts prove futile in the absence of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>His<i>
</i></span>Dayaa. Even the Lord cannot transgress her will and hence she is the
only saviour of the sinners. Thus the theory of complete self-surrender is seen
here at work throughout this work. Madhura Sringara for Bhakti wherein the
devotee pines for the Lord like a love-lorn lady is the dominant sentiment
especially in the 4th and 5th cantos. Here the suppliant imagines himself to be
a lady in love with him, sends a message through a cloud to the Lord Venkateswara,
imitating Yaksha in<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Kalidasa’s Meghaduta.
This part of the poem is a piece of poetry appealing to our heart and aesthetic
sense. The author, true to his faith feels that “Dayaa” is far from those that
describe this world as an illusion, the Brahman as “Nirguna” and resort to “Knowledge”
as the sole means of salvation. Srikrishna’s pranks, and the merciful and
valorous deeds of Srirama and Srikrishna as found in the great epics are
recounted and the poet at every step requests the Lord to shower the nector of
compassion on the sinners. Similies, metaphors and Utprekshas that we come
across here and there are meaningful. The editor’s introduction in Sanskrit
enlightens us as to the theory of the self-surrender and the main import and
merits of this poem. Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam in Tamil written by Sri Desika
is added at the end. Delicious food of devotion is served herein and it is for
the ardent devotees to make it their own. </p>

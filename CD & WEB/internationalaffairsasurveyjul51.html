style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
has welcomed the cease-fire talks in Korea. But there is as yet no knowing as
to how far these talks will succeed, and whether they will lead to un armistice
and to a final peace and settlement of all those outstanding issues which have
been responsible for the outbreak of the Korean war. It needed a whole year of
terrible warfare involving loss of the lives of several hundreds of thousands
on either side, and of devastation and destruction over large areas of the
country before the two parties could think of a cease-fire, even though
attempts for the same purpose have been made on more than one occasion
previously by India and several other States. But the statements that are being
issued by responsible spokesmen even after the ceasefire talks have started,
show that they are not quite sure that all this would lead to peace. It is,
therefore, necessary for every intelligent person to understand the true nature
of the talks, the circumstances that have brought them about and their relation
to developments–present and prospective–in the other parts of the worl</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ceasefire talks are not political in character. They might at the most bring to
a stop the fighting that has been going on. Those who are acquainted with the
events in Indonesia after the Dutch and the Republicans agreed to ceasefire and
with the events in Kashmir, even though for nearly two years there has been a
cease-fire there, will hesitate before concluding that the ceasefire in Korea
will necessarily lead to peace. The talks themselves have been necessitated not
so much by the heavy losses sustained by both parties as by a feeling on the
part of the United States that such losses were not worth while in an area like
Korea. There was in the first place the inexhaustible man-power of China, and
the Americans knew that it would take several years before they could crush it
to an appreciable degree. In the second place the view gained increasing
strength not only among Americans, but also among the British and their other
allies associated with them in the North Atlantic Union, that a long war in
Korea would considerably weaken the defences of Western Europe and such a
weakening would place them at a serious disadvantage in a global war with the
Soviet Union for which they continue to make active preparations. For, it is
the considered view of the Anti-Soviet bloc now that the ultimate scene of
warfare between it and the Soviet bloc would be Western Europe and that it is the
events in that area that would finally decide its outcome. It was therefore in
their opinion unwise to waste their resources in Korea–a secondary or a
subsidiary theatre of war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
exactly the motives of the Communists–the North-Koreans, the Chinese and the
Soviet–are which have induced them to propose and accept cease-fire talks is
much more difficult to explain. It is only possible to guess about them. It may
be that they have come to realise that the war was going against them in Korea,
that in spite of the superiority of their numbers they were poor in equipment,
and that it would become increasingly difficult for them to overcome the
growing armaments on land and in air brought by the Americans with their
inexhaustible industrial and scientific resources As a matter of fact the war
became a testing ground as to which factor would ultimately decide the
issue–superiority in numbers and superiority in arms, Another circumstance
which might have influenced the Communists seems to be that the Soviet is now
perhaps anxious to create trouble in some other part of the world–the Middle
East or Yugoslavia–and be ready to divert its men and resources to those areas.
For, it should not be forgotten that today it is in the hands of the Soviet
that the initiative lies and that the Anglo-American bloc has to follow, as it
were, the path indicated to them by the Soviet. They are not as yet in a
position to take the initiative themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Americans have made it clear that the cease-fire talks have nothing to do with
the problem of Formosa or the seating of Communist China on the bodies of the
U.N.O.–two matters which have come of fundamental importance to China. Until
there problem solved to the satisfaction of the People’s Government of China
there cannot be a real peace in the Far East and American policy is not yet
directed to a solution on these lines. A cease-fire therefore in Korea might be
followed by a Communist invasion of Formosa. Besides this there is the cold war
between Soviet Russia and the United States and there is nothing to indicate
that either party is prepared to end that war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is one point however in regard to which the
conviction of the Anglo-American bloc is now much stronger than what it was
before the Korean war started. It is now their firm belief that the Communist
group can never be brought round through peaceful negotiations unless the
negotiations are backed up by irresistible military force. The Marxists
emphasize even in internal polities that no great change can be brought about
unless it be through revolution, bloodshed and violence. The same is their
creed so far as international politics are concerned. If at all they yield it
is to superior physical force that they will yield. It was because the
Americans gave substantial military aid to Greece and Turkey, and also because
they showed that they had irresistible strength in supplying Berlin with all
its needs, that the Soviets gave up their attempts to coerce Turkey and Greece
and their blockade of Berlin. If after one year of war they are willing to talk
of cease-fire the Americans believe that it is due to the Communistic
realisation that their enemies have more armaments than they themselves have. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Western powers are determined to maintain and
even to strengthen their superiority in arms and equipment. Responsible leaders
in the United States and Britain have been proclaiming that there will be no
relaxation of their efforts at increasing their armaments. General MacArthur
was recalled not because of any differences of opinion in this regard but
because he wanted to carry the war into Manchuria and into the Chinese
mainland, while President Truman and his advisers felt that such a course would
adversely affect their global strategy which had Western Europe for its centre.
In giving evidence before the Congressional Committee, Acheson stated: “We need
to use the time we have to build an effective deterrent force. This requires us
to create sufficient force-in-being both in the United States and among our
allies to shield our great potential against the possibility of a quick and
easy onslaught and to ensure that our allies will not suffer occupations and
destruction, and back of this shield we need to have the potential that would
enable us to win a war. This is the measure of the force as we approach it.”</p>

to the dissident Labour group in Britain led by ex-ministers Bevan, Wilson and
Freeman the British Under-Secretary for War–Woodrow Wyatt–recently stated:
“Britain would let down all Europeans if it reduced its rearmament plans now.
“The Russians had 25 divisions under arms, compared with Britain's ten. They
had four million men under arms compared with Britain’s 750,000. They could
mobilise eight million more immediately...Our accelerated arms programme is
designed to ensure that by the time the Russians are likely to have a
stock-pile of atom bombs we, with the other countries of the West, shall have
armed forces strong enough to deter them on the ground.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is because the cease-fire in Korea is not regarded as bringing about a
peace-settlement in the Far East and the end of the cold war, the United States
has become keen on concluding a treaty with Japan and bringing her into the
anti-Communistic fold. The terms of the proposed draft treaty have been
published; and they are to be considered finally at a conference to be held in
San Francisco in September next. Britain, Australia and New Zealand which have
expressed serious apprehensions about Japan once more becoming a highly
industrialised and an aggressively imperialist power, have been brought round
by the United States and it looks as if they would agree to the draft treaty.
Under this treaty Japan is to be a fully Sovereign State. She will not be asked
to pay any reparations. No restrictions will he placed on her armaments or her
industrial development. The only loss she will sustain is the loss of her
oversea possessions and islands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this looks highly just, fair and equitable. But what exactly is the motive
behind this liberality? The United States has realised that if Soviet and
Chinese expansion is to be arrested it can only be achieved through the full
use of Japan’s resources. Japan has been the most industrially developed Asian
country; the military skill and strength of the Japanese are too well-known.
There is also the strategic position of the country in a war between the United
States and the Sino-Soviet bloc. With Japan neutral and weak or fighting on the
side of Communism it would be impossible for the United States to defeat China
or Soviet Ru8si&amp; in the East. A strong and resurrected Japan is considered
to be a lesser evil from the American standpoint, especially because the draft
treaty provides for the stationing of American troops in and around Japan by
mutual agreement. But how far all this will work as planned by the United
States is uncertain. Without a large export trade the growing population of
Japan–nearly hundred millions–will not be able to get food and raw materials.
With China closed to her she will have to find markets in South East Asia and
the Middle East and would thus become a competitor of Britain and India–a
situation which would be naturally resented by them. There would be no outlet
for this growing population in Australia so long as she follows her “white
Australian policy.” And then what guarantee is there that the Japanese would
work as satellites of the United States? That might be possible if the
government in Japan continues to be a government of the “Right” with Fascist
tendencies, but such a government is sure to provoke the leftist groups and
pave the way for &amp; Cornrnunistic revoultion–the very thing that the United
States is anxious to avert.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is the crux of the whole question. If the United States is really anxious to
arrest the growth and expansion of Communism, it is not enough that she enters
into military alliances with reactionary governments as she has been doing
these years. She must encourage and aid liberal regimes–even Socialist
regimes–which can carry out land reform, protect the interests of labour and
mitigate the evils of capitalism and plutocracy. She must boldly take up the
cause of nationalism in Indo-China and other countries where Colonialism still
prevails. Communism finds a breeding place in Japan and in other countries of
Asia, primarily because of the acuteness of the economic problem and the
poverty and degradation of the masses of people. A treaty with Japan is to be
welcomed, but to think that such a treaty as is contemplated by the United
States will stem the tide of Communism is a misreading of the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
corollary to treaty with Japan as proposed by the United States is a Pacific
Defence Pact into which she has now agreed to enter with Australia and New
Zealand. Such a pact is the only way in which she could persuade these two
countries to agree to the terms of the draft treaty with Japan. This guarantees
the aid and support of the United States against any attack that either Japan
or China and Soviet Russia might make on Australia and New Zealand. It is
drafted on the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty. It will become the nucleus
of a wider Pacific Pact. It still further strengthens the tendency and the need
of Australia and New Zealand to align themselves more and more with the United
States than with the British Commonwealth, however strong their sentimental
attachments to the latter. Canada has already been brought very close to the
United States. This Pacific Dafence Pact brings Australia and New Zealand also
closer to that country. All this is bound to have its ultimate repurcussion on
the Commonwealth. It is bound to result in a new political entity being
organised in due course,–an English-speaking Anglo-American League, with the
United States occupying a central place in it. This will also affect the
membership of India, Pakistan and Ceylon in the Commonwealth. The Pacific Pact
therefore has wider implications than what appear to be on the surface.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The proposed treaty with Japan has also to be read
along with the new orientation in the policy of the occupation powers towards
Western Germany. There is as a matter of fact a close parallel between Western
Germany and Japan today. Britain, France and the United States waged the second
world war against them. One of the objects of the war was to prevent the
revival of militarism in these countries and also arrest their industrial
progress, without which no militarism can flourish in the contemporary world.
But all this has now been abandoned by the three victorious powers, and the
reason is that they find in Soviet Russia and her Communism a more dreadful
enemy than in Germany and Japan with their potential Fascism. They have now
come to the conclusion that without the man power and the material power of
Western Germany it would be impossible for them to defend Western Europe
against any Soviet attack and realise the objectives of the Atlantic Pact. It
is this conclusion that is responsible for the proclamation recently issued by
them that the state of war with Germany had come to an end. More important than
this is the new understanding arrived at by them that they would treat the West
German State as a fully sovereign State with a status equal to their own. There
is now every prospect of the West German Government agreeing to raise adequate
military forces and fight alongside of the other Atlantic powers against Soviet
Russia. The closer the re-approchement between the Western powers and Germany
the greater becomes their chance of arresting Communists expansion. It is in
this direction that they are moving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
looks ironical that the democratic States which, during the second world war
and in the years preceding it, looked upon Germany and Japan as the most
anti-democratic and the most aggressive of States, to be suppressed for all
time, should now embrace them as their most friendly allies and make
preparations for a war against Soviet Russia, their former ally, for whose survival
they used a substantial portion of their resources between 1940 and 1945. But
such has always been the course of human history. There are no permanent
friendships and permanent enmities in the political world. It is all a matter
of expediency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
suspicion that Soviet anxiety to have cease-fire talks in Korea might only be a
prelude to the creation of trouble in some other area of the world is
strengthened by developments in Iran. The dispute that has arisen between the
governments of Iran and Britain on the subject of the nationalisation of Irani
oil industry has reached a critical stage, and there are apprehensions that it
might lead to warfare in the Middle East, even though all responsible statesmen
are telling the world that there is no likelihood of any such danger. No one
denies the right of Iran to nationalise any of her industries if she considers
that it would be more profitable for her than the exploitation of her oil
resources by a foreign concern like the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Even Britain
has recognised the validity of the principle of nationalisation. But there are
certain legal and political issues that deserve consideration in a calm and
cool atmosphere, which of course has become prominent by its absence. The oil
company has invested large sums of money in the concern. It has the legal right
conferred upon it by the Iranian Government to run the concern for another four
to five decades. Although the company itself is technically a private
organisation, the British Government is naturally interested in it. It is one
of the elementary duties which every government owes to its citizens that it
should safeguard their legitimate interests at home and abroad. There is
therefore nothing surprising in the British Government intervening in the
matter and regarding it as a dispute between two States and not a mere domestic
dispute between the Government of Iran and a private company. The question of
the amount of compensation that the company is entitled to get in the event of
nationalisation has not been fully settled or even examined. It is one thing to
take over an industry owned by the citizens of the State without paying
compensation to them or paying only nominal compensation. For, in such a case
the right to ownership only changes hands from one section of the citizens to
the whole body represented by government. It is, however otherwise when the
concern is owned by foreigners. In addition to this there is another
complicating factor. Britain depends on Iran for<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>a substantial supply of her oil and there is no knowing what will
happen to this source if the industry is nationalised. And in these days of
active rearmament preparations, the cutting of any source of oil supply is
certain to prove fatal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
neither Britain nor Iran has cared for any kind of reasonableness in the
settlement of the issue. Iran is against any negotiated settlement. She has
rejected the decision of the International Court. Britain has sent units of her
fleet to the Persian waters to keep watch over the situation and to see that
the lives of her citizens, who happen to be employed as experts in the oil
refineries, are safeguarded. This has provoked the Russians who have, under the
Agreement of 1921, the right to send their forces into Iran if British forces
enter the country from the south or from any other direction. It is in this
atmosphere that the United States President has sent his personal envoy, Mr.
Harriman, to bring about a peaceful settlement. He is doubly interested in the
issue. The Americans themselves own petrol concerns in Saudi Arabia; and they
have interests in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East along with the British.
If nationalisation becomes an accomplished fact in Iran it will be made use of
in Saudi Arabia and in other parts of the Middle East. It is, therefore,
necessary from the American standpoint that a reasonable and peaceful
settlement of the question is brought about in Iran. In addition to this the
danger of Iran becoming a centre of war<i> </i>has anyhow to be averted. Riots
have already broken in Teheran. The extremists are active; and the scene is
highly favourable for exploitation by the Communist-minded Tudeh party which
like other Communist parties is under the influence of Soviet Russia. Iran,
therefore, threatens to become a scene of civil war just like Korea, and the
Korean ceasefire talks will lose all their significance if the British and the
Americans are compelled to intervene in the Iranian war to prevent its becoming
a Communist satellite. Strategically the Middle East is of even far greater
importance than Korea in a war against Soviet Russia and this makes the Iranian
problem serious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have been rumours that on the Iranian question some differences exist between
the United States and Britain. It is, however, not known what the nature of these
differences is. On the attempts of the United States to include Fascist Spain
in the European Defence Union also, there are substantial differences between
the view-point of the two countries. It is best that these differences
disappear so that concerted action on the part of all democratic nations might
become possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

survey therefore may be concluded by pointing out that the creation of a world
of peace and plenty depends in the immediate future on a peaceful settlement of
the issues in Korea and Iran, of the conclusion of a satisfactory peace treaty
with Japan and Germany, and the recognition of the right of Communist China to
Formosa and to a seat on the Security Council. But there are as yet no

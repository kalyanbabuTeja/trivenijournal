knowledge can be of any effective value which does not give man the capacity to
have mastery over his circumstances, which does not give him power over the
mechanical workings of Nature in himself or in the universe. It is this promise
of mastery and power which gives him a dynamic impetus to pursue increasingly
comprehensive, <span class=SpellE>harmonising</span>, integrating and <span

modern times, man is put in circumstances that threaten his very existence.
Through Science, he is after acquiring more and more knowledge to achieve
mastery over his circumstances, over the forces of Nature. He is mustering
material energy to gain knowledge and power. But having <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
these energies, he is not in a position to have an adequate control over them
inasmuch as they have become a source of danger to the entire human race. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is because of the exclusive occupation of Science with the realities of life.
Science’s deferment or <span class=SpellE>unreadiness</span> to probe the
underlying forces of Nature that manipulate the workings of life has led to an
unbalanced pursuit of knowledge. It has either ignored or denied the spiritual
element. The psychological and spiritual faculties, which alone would best know
what place a particular kind of knowledge and its application should take in
the total development of man, and which alone would best know how to <span
class=SpellE>utilise</span> the material forces of Nature for human progress,
not only safely but with the greatest benefit to mankind or to all creation,

are not an unmixed blessing. Recent atomic discoveries have become a constant

lives in the most pitiable and the most vulnerable conditions of life. Life is

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sri Aurobindo says that, if the attempts of Science
for a control of the mind and of the life-processes, by a knowledge, of the
material instrumentation and of the process of our normal and abnormal <span
class=SpellE>functionings</span> and activities of mind and life, succeed, “it
might not be without danger for the existence of the human race, even as now
are certain other scientific discoveries misused or clumsily used by a humanity
mentally and morally unready for the handling of powers so great and perilous;
for it would be an artificial control applied without any knowledge of the
secret forces which underline and sustain our existence.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
does not mean that pursuit of scientific knowledge is of no value, or that
Science is an evil which has to be cast off immediately or ultimately. Rather,
it is indispensable for the fullness of human development, though by no means
of the premier or even the most essential importance for any harmonious,
enlightened and peaceful collective living. It is indeed a very essential
contribution to richness of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

knowledge, in modern times, has been zealously pursued as if the inevitable
last key for progress had been found in it. But, for all the material comforts
available to man, he is none the happier than his fore-forefathers centuries
back. Rest, peace and unmixed joy remain inaccessible and foreign to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
obvious reason is that, in his psychological and spiritual stature, he is yet a
dwarf. He is psychologically and spiritually bankrupt. He is yet an animal in
his infra-rational make-up. His mental capacities and <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>
are too occupied with, and locked up in, his infra-rational existence. The
springs of real joy and satisfaction are yet un-discovered and unfathomed.
Seeking to master nature, without mastering himself, he is a complete illusion,
and lives in complete ignorance of the science of living. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is not that, to discover the true science of living, man has to ignore or abhor
scientific knowledge. But, possessing psychological and spiritual knowledge,
which is far more comprehensive, universal, enlightening, unprejudiced,
sympathetic, self-creative, <span class=SpellE>unegoistically</span> powerful,
and stationed at a higher level of consciousness wherefrom he will be in a
position to have a detached over-vision of things, he will be able to
influence, <span class=SpellE>realise</span> and <span class=SpellE>utilise</span>
the knowledge of phenomena with a more effective grasp of it than he at present
has. Not only that, but, with the addition of a spiritual element of a higher
reality, the very mathematics and scope of scientific knowledge will change.
Not only will its field of development widen, and its progress accelerate, but
it will acquire a new upward turn and bring a revolutionary change in its whole
structure, with a promise of unforeseen possibilities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from the material achievements of Science, its one most important psychological
contribution has been the preparation of the field in the mind by which it can
receive still greater and higher truths on more <span class=SpellE>stabilised</span>
bases, on sounder and surer foundations of <span class=SpellE>undogmatic</span>
and impartial intellectual perception, on systematic, unambiguous and logical
thinking. It has succeeded in eliminating the falsity of superstitions, of
cock-sure dogmatic assumptions of irrelevant prepositions, and of mythological
fancies. It has done a great service adopting the method of experiment,
observation and investigation or arriving at knowledge so that the results are
always open to re-examination and verification. This insistence of Science on
evidence, facts and verifiable experiments, and on rationalistic and methodical
pursuit, has been of immense help in the training of the mind to become an <span
class=SpellE>unbiassed</span> and unprejudiced seeker after knowledge. It is
another matter that Science, because of its earth-bound character, and because
of its consideration of the physical as the sole reality to be probed and
investigated and occupied with, has failed to acquire the total view of reality.
The cause of such limited scientific vision, as well as the effect of it, is
that immense occult forces behind physical existence are yet unknown to <span
class=SpellE>unintegrated</span> Science. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Aurobindo says that Science, “masterful in knowledge of processes and in the creation
of apt machinery, but ignorant of the foundations of our being and of
world-being, cannot perfect our nature, and therefore cannot perfect our life.”
So, as the true seeker of reality must seek after total knowledge and total
power, which can perfect our nature and our life, it is necessary that he
should first have knowledge of the foundations of his being and existence.
“Assuredly,” says J. <span class=SpellE>Tauler</span>, “whoever wishes to
discover the universal truth must sound the depths of his own heart.” It is

is only when one finds out the insufficiency of the knowledge of disjointed
phenomena to guide man in the practical problems of his life that the urge
comes to man to knock at the doors of the unknown. Wisdom dawns: wisdom which
is the eternal principle of all things, “the mother of pure love and of all
science and of sacred hope”–(<span class=SpellE>Ecclesiasticus</span>). It is
by identity with the Reality itself that one has true knowledge, lasting
knowledge. Sri Ramakrishna who gives divine meaning to the pursuit of this
deeper eternal knowledge, says, “He alone is truly a man who is illumined by
the light of the true knowledge; others are only men in name.” “The seeker who
would travel in the paths of the teaching of the King of the Ancients,” says <span
class=SpellE>Baha-ullah</span>, “should purify his heart of the dark dust of
human science.....for it is in his heart that the divine and invisible
mysteries appear transfigured.” These are the men who have <span class=GramE>lain</span>
their hands on the source of true knowledge and wisdom, and who, having <span

their own being, point the way for others to follow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Science has limited its inquiry to the visible, the perceptible and the
tangible, the other hidden forces that influence, interfere, move and alter the
phenomenal workings of the world, and, far more, determine them, are a closed
chapter to it. It has no contact with them, no insight into them, no approach
to the perception of them, because, belonging to supra-physical reality, they
are not subject to laboratory experimentation, though none the less real,
concrete, perceptible and experiential. Intuition takes the place of reason.
Experience takes the place of experiment. This is because Science has no known
methods yet by which it can acquire the knowledge of these occult forces and
faculties. Its present methods are not valid or applicable in the region of
metaphysical knowledge. Scientific method useful as they are in the world of
physical phenomena, are powerless and yet for the subtler fields of spiritual
knowledge, and have to be replaced by more appropriate and more effective
methods for the discovery of the sources of greater wisdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

providing man a field of growth wherein he can develop the needed faculties and

knowledge is not empirical in the manner of its being derived through the

through the senses or through the untrained intellect, which experience is both
inconsistent and incomplete in character. And this deeper experience of
reality, through psychical and spiritual methods, is not something cut off or
secluded from the experience of the senses or the experience of reason. It is
not an illusory perception or a psychological hallucination. It is knowledge
which is communicable to different parts of our being, to our intellect, to our
sensations and to our body, etc. It is equally communicable to other persons,

The senses can share the knowledge of the spirit, fully, only later: in the
beginning, less intensely and less concretely, for the very simple reason that
the experience of the spirit is independent of the experience of the senses, or
of psychical faculties even. The spirit is more sensitive, and is closer to the
<span class=SpellE>noumenal</span> world, to the planes of shear Reality to
which it has easier access. The senses, adapted to have knowledge of the

says, “Only from his own soul can man demand the secret of eternal beauty.”
This is why Guru Nanak exhorts mind to discover its true nature: “Thou art the
image of Light, know thy true source and reality.” The knowledge is hidden in<i>
</i>the mind itself. Says Sri Aurobindo, “Nothing can be taught to the mind,
which is not already concealed as potential knowledge in the unfolding soul of
the creature. So also all perfection of which the outer man is capable is only
a <span class=SpellE>realising</span> of the eternal perfection of the Spirit
within him...All teaching is a revealing; all becoming is an unfolding.
Self-attainment is the secret; self-knowledge and an increasing consciousness
are the means and the process.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as described, is a value to be pursued, to be applied to the conditions of
life, so that the nature and texture of life are changed. So is the solution to
the problems of life sought, and so is the remedy to the ills of humanity
discovered. If we want to <span class=SpellE>utilise</span> this knowledge for
the transformation of our being and of our nature, it is not only to understand
it as one aspect of reality, as part of the mass of human knowledge. We should
seek it and we should pursue it as something that concerns our very life,
concerns our very purpose and aim in life. And if this supra-physical knowledge
is to give us a total philosophy of true living, it has to become our total

intellect, heart, will or vital desire-self, which, dissatisfied with its own

Though various religions have their <span class=SpellE>systematised</span>
methods of acquiring the realisation of the higher reality, on the practical
side they have tended to be more or less authoritatively dogmatic. There, faith
has the most important role to play. There is hardly a religion wherein an
unquestioning acceptance of its ideas and all verbal translations of these
ideas are not demanded. In certain beliefs, no enquiry into the validity or
otherwise of their truth, or into the extent of their truth, is allowed. Their
truth is considered to be the Supreme Truth. “Religion has opened itself to
denial,” observes Sri Aurobindo, “by its claim to determine the truth by divine
authority, by inspiration, by a sacrosanct and infallible sovereignty given to
it from on high; it has sought to impose itself on human thought, feeling,
conduct, without discussion or question.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

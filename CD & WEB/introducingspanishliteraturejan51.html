<p class=MsoTitle>INTRODUCING SPANISH LITERATURE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

<p class=MsoSubtitle>By MARCELLA HARDY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“With
us”, writes Salvador de Madariaga in his Spanish version of his own English
book, <i>The Genius of Spain and Other Essays on Spanish Contemporary
Literature, </i>“With us, criticism is almost completely divorced from
creation”. This terse remark touches the very pulse of the tremendous and
intensely rich genius of Spain. Far from being derogatory, the remark explains
much of the exuberance and impetuosity of Spanish literature, its vigour and
colour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
language of wonderful force and resourcefulness, Spanish discovered early those
metres and forms which suited it best, those predominantly imbued with dramatic
power; and the sense of the dramatic is most characteristically of the genius
of Spain. It is natural, then, that the literature should have blossomed almost
more prodigiously in the drama than in the other forms, fine and plentiful
though these undoubtedly are. The dramatic content of life rather than its
philosophy is the burden of this literature; and life, for Spain, connotes Man
in the various situations in which he may find himself. Man having to deal with
three constant factors that he may maintain himself in his exalted position,
duelling with Death the constant enemy, finding inspiration in Love the
inexorable force, and steering his course by Honour his most prized attribute;
these are the motives that dominate all action. Thus pre-occupied, the Spanish
genius has no inclination nor concern for analytical studies, philosophical
dissertation, adventurous explorations into the workings of the mind; it has no
gift for criticism of self, understandably enough, for neither Death nor Love
nor Honour submit satisfactorily to such a test. Man is indeed so much the king
of life that, as de Madariaga also puts it, attacks on him by Death, though
inevitable, constitute almost a crime of <i>lese majeste. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
it is true that in few literatures does one find Death treated–allow me the
paradox–so much as a living force, with such familiarity. A recent novel by a young
Basque writer is an instance: the main character is a sort of waif who becomes
an undertaker, and whole story is treated from the point of view of a man for
whom death is wealth, death is his life, it is to be welcomed not as a release
but as an asset, a tool of vengeance against unfeeling society. The theme is
only incidentally gruesome. The same genius gave birth to Don Juan and to the
death Commendador at the banquet; likewise those grave yet not gruesome
paintings in which the skull figures as an important element of the intention.
There are many traits in the Spanish character–reflected, of course, in the
literature–which are not at all Western as this term is usually understood; one
often has the distinct impression that Spain is only accidentally and
imperfectly a part of Europe; its roots were nourished elsewhere with other
nurture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Alongside
the exuberance of the language with its easy flowering and fertile generosity
and imagery, stand the almost numberless proverbs and wise sayings of the folk–marvels
of wit, conciseness, and wisdom. These proverbs and wise sayings may be said to
constitute the reserves of material from which the literature draws its
strength and plots. Indeed, a surprising proportion of the body of Spanish
writings is, as it were, an amplification of and a commentary on the race’s
store of proverbs. Such titles taken at random through the pages of a history
of the literature are examples: <i>Walls have Ears, You must fall before you </i>rise,
<i>Who can be a father being a King. </i>These plays form part of the serious
drama, and are not mere comedies for the delectation of a moment, and for the
populace. The most celebrated men of letters have taken such themes to clothe
them in the melody and grace of their verse, and create characters taken from
real life–for the country’s genius is more at home with immediate portraiture,
which it does admirably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
unconcern for psychological problems, this realistic approach of transferring
to the stage or the novel the ordinary life of Man, brought with it a keen
sense of local colour; this is perhaps what makes Spanish literature so
intensely personal. It is one of the most documentary of literatures. Anybody
following. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza on their fantastic peregrinations
through Spain, is travelling through Spain itself and meeting all sorts of
perfectly plausible people on the way. Perhaps the only times when literature
was unrelated to reality, was artificial in its tone and setting is when
literary fashions from Italy and France were introduced–at several intervals
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Though such fashions did
affect writers for more or less time; they never found support in the folk who,
as theatre managers complained, crowded to see ordinary Spanish playlets and
themes while the elegant plays from France were performed to rows of empty
seats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was only with the nineteenth centnry, after the French Revolution which, in
spite of everything, did have some repercussions on the far side of the
Pyrenees, that writers became deeply impressed with the thought of the
Romantics in other countries; with this spiritual storm came a reaction against
the fashions of other countries and a reflex of national consciousness that
sought its themes in the country’s past, that turned once more to the folk
genius and introduced it to serious contemporary writing. With this period also
came a consciousness of social problems; and attempts at psychological studies
in verse, drama, and prose were made. Incidentally, a notable break from the
Golden Century (the seventeenth), was the essay in prose taking the place of
the rhymed epistle as an instrument of satire or comment. The Romantic writers
of the first decades of the nineteenth century in Spain–over which this
movement swept more tempestuously than elsewhere–had no tradition of
psychological studies or social problems, with the result that their works have
all the spontaneity and immature formlessness and downrightness of adolescence.
Characters in plays and novels ceased being the Spanish folk called upon to
play certain roles, but became types: the type of evil, the type of goodness,
the type of jealousy–Othello and Lear had recently been introduced to the
reading public–and so forth. Accumulations of circumstances, the imminence of
doom, the consonance of natural elements with human emotions, a quite Gothic
stress on the sombre, all fill the works of the times almost to the exclusion
of the subtleties and flowing humour and humanity of the earlier periods. A
famous name of the Romantic period is that of the Duke of Rivas, a vigorous
writer of tragedies unbarring the intolerance of society and the force of
destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gradually,
however, this turbulence and ebullience settled down to create literature of a
solid and permanent value, readable at all times and in different languages;
criticism started working its way, pruning, analysjng; examining. To the latter
part of the nineteenth century are owed solid works of scholarship and the
translation of contemporary literature into the European languages. Spain was
herself again, in that her literature was Spanish, but schooled in a sterner
manner; in different vein, there was a coming back to the skill of the great
seventeenth century with its Calderons, Quevedos, Rojas, a coming back to the
vigour of a Lope de Vega and the humanity of a Cervantes. To this latter period
of the nineteenth century belong Blasco Ibanez, Valle Inclan, Unamuno, Perez
Galdos, Pereda, and others who have so magnificently increased the fascinating
body of Spanish letters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the branch of speculative writing, which is to akin to philosophy and
scholarship, the record of Spain is one of lost opportunities–not surprising in
view of the national character. Right down the centuries Spain produced great
thinkers, yet they were thinkers in the sense that their capacity for thinking
was tremendous and their imagination and intuition outstanding; they were not
capable of pursuing their thoughts to a logical end. Earlier than most of the
great European brains who helped in the advance of science, Spain produced men
who already had written on such things, pointing a way to later discoveries;
these men never themselves pursued their discoveries to make any change in
contemporary thought. This volatility that throws out indications, that has
visions and instinctive apprehensions of scientific truths is part of the
country’s genius; the present age, apparently, is more and more turning to
pressing that virtue to th</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
are only some scant notes on a vast subject on which it is only too easy to
generalise and, thereby, fall into many errors. So far, the purpose has been to
introduce the character of this literature so that its reading may become all
the richer with attributes. Lorca, for instance, has been acclaimed as one of
the European poets of the present times, but only those who know Spain can
realize how very spanish he is and, knowing this, his work becomes all the more
beautiful; it illuminates the scene of life from the Spanish angle and thus
becomes universal. Of the luxuriant early centuries with their Saracenic
Christian cycles of lays, their pastorals, their plays of social customs, their
interpretation of proverbs, and the unbelievable manipulation of language such
as reached its most fantastic forms during the late Golden Century,–of all this
there is still everything to tell. It is hoped that these notes may bring some
to learn something about this wealth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

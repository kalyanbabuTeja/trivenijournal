style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
month has seen a further deterioration in the condition of China–a
deterioration which has been overtaking her for the last two years. The
Communist war against the national government of Chiang Kai Shek has now
entered on a new phase. The nationalist forces have been defeated in a number
of places in Manchuria; several cities of strategic importance have been lost.
It appears as if the whole key-area of Manchuria will come completely under the
control of the Communists and that this will be followed by their drive into
the equally important area of the north-east. All along there has also been a
further worsening of the financial and economic situation in the country. There
is so much of similarity between China and India in respect of size, the
numbers of population, the enthusiasm with which the overthrow of an empire and
the establishment of a republican form of government were greeted by the masses
of people, and the vast scope which a national government has for the work of
reconstruction. And the history of China since the establishment of the
Republic in 1912 has much to teach the people of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
danger that threatens the Government of Chiang is of a most acute character.
Manchuria which is now in the hands of the Communists occupies a key-position
from a political, strategic and economic point of view and the complete
occupation of the area–with the exception of Mukden the capital–by the
Communists has weakened the stability and strength of Chiang’s Government to an
extraordinary degree. Manchuria is contiguous to Soviet Asia and to Mongolia
and northern Korea which are practically under Soviet control. The region is
also rich in economic resources. The north-east portion which is its heart has
a soil and climate favourable to grain growing. It is now a big producer and
exporter of surplus foods, especially of soya beans. Its soil is not exhausted
and it has greater chances of rapid progress than the older parts of China. It
has rich minerals like coal, iron, dolomite, magnesite, gold, silver, copper,
lead, zinc, and tungsten, and all the principal minerals essential to a sound
development of modern heavy industries are found in great plenty. Cement
materials and very many other non-metallics are also available in large
quantities. The Japanese who were in occupation of the country for a number of
years have started some important industries. It is these economic
advantages–actual as well as potential–that give the significance to the
Communist advance over the whole region. With this vast stretch of territory,
inhabited by nearly forty millions of people, the Communists are now in a
position to steadily undermine the power of Chiang in other parts of northern
and north-eastern China. Their capacity to do this is all the greater in view
of recent developments in Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the course of last month the northern part of Korea, which has been under
Russian occupation for the last two years, has been constituted into a ‘Democratic
People’s Republic’ dominated by the Communist party. An army of nearly two
hundred thousand Koreans has already been trained and equipped by the Russians,
and sections of the army are actively cooperating with the Communists of
Manchuria. It is true that the United States strongly protested against the
formation of such a republic in one part of the country, as being contrary to
the pledge which the Allies gave to Korea at the time of her liberation from
the Japanese yoke in 1945a pledge whose aim was to create a single democratic
State over the whole of Korea after a preliminary five-year period of
trusteeship. But owing to acute differences of opinion between the Soviet
Government and the United States, all efforts at bringing about a single State
of Korea ceased to be of any avail. The Russians have therefore proceeded in
their own way. With a communistic Korean Republic and with Communist control
over Manchuria, they have been able considerably to consolidate their strength
in the Far East-which is one of their effective replies to the manoeuvres of
the United States, Britain and France in Western Europe and the Middle East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
even greater significance in the worsening of the situation of Chiang and his
national government is the incompetence, the corruption and the jobbery which
have come to characterise it and which has today made it so unpopular that
there are many sections among the people–not only among the masses but also
among businessmen–who are prepared to extend a hearty welcome to the Communists.
Very little has been done by the national government to improve the lot of the
common man. Though there has been for years a talk about land reform, nothing
was done to put an end to the vested interests of the bigger landlords. In the
name of nationalisation several government monopolies have been established,
but they are being run on the most inefficient lines by bureaucrats whose main
aim is to amass large fortunes at the expense of the public. Private business
has been ruined without however any corresponding benefit to the people as a
whole. An unnecessarily large army, ill-equipped, ill-fed and ill-clothed, is
being maintained, although experts especially from America have been advising
the Government to reduce its numbers and to improve its quality.
Transport–river as well as rail–has been ruined. The enlisting of able-bodied
perrsons in the army has created a scarcity of labour in agriculture and in
industries. Production has fallen. Inflation became inevitable and there has
been no limit to the rise in prices and to fluctuations in foreign exchange.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there a way out for Chiang? Though it is too late there is still a way out, if
he is prepared to come to terms with the Communists, recognise their rule in
certain areas where they are already in power, consolidate his position in the
rest of the country, make his government broadbased, purge it of vested
interests, purify it and carry out the needed agrarian reforms. The time is
long past for Chiang to rule the country by merely appealing to the sense of
patriotism among the people and to his past services. People are demanding from
him a higher order of constructive statesmanship, and everything depends upon
his realising this and starting work in this direction, not in some remote
future after the Civil War with the Communists comes to an end, but
immediately. The Government of the United States is prepared to aid him if it
is satisfied that any aid extended to him will be utilised on real national
needs and not for enriching the members of the political cliques.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attention of the world has also been focussed on the situation in Palestine in
the course of the last one month. The reason for this is the difficulty which
now confronts the Security Council in the matter of enforcing the scheme of
partition of the country recommended in November last by the General Assembly
of the United Nations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The parties to the issues in Palestine are
multifarious. They are the Jews, the Arabs of Palestine, the Arab States of the
Middle East who are members of the Arab League, the Great Powers–Britain, the
United States and Russia–with their own interests, and finally the United Nations
Organisation. Experience has shown that there is no possibility of reconciling
the conflicting interests and view-points of these parties, unless there is a
large amount of a spirit of reasonable compromise among all of them. As a
matter of fact, however, it is neither reason nor a spirit of compromise that
is to be found. Selfish interests and intense emotion are the only factors that
are to be seen. The Jews are determined to have a national State of their own
in at least a part of Palestine. This was what was promised to them by the
British and their Allies in the days of the first world war, when they were in
need of the financial help of Jewish millionaries in the United States and
several countries of Europe. This was also what the Jewish nation had been
looking for, for the last two thousand years. And their desire to have such a
national State became all the more intense when, in consequence of the Nazi
massacres, five million Jews lost their lives in Europe and another million had
to roam about homeless in refugee camps during the last five or six years. They
want a national State so that the Jews who wish to leave Europe and find a
peaceful place of settlement might migrate to Palestine. It may be noted in
this connection that even when free immigration is permitted, it is only about
750,000 that are expected to settle in the Jewish State of Palestine in the
course of the next ten years, and that this would increase the Jewish
population of the State to about a million and half. It is such a State that
the Jews want to create for themselves–a State so small in size and in numbers
that it can never be a source of danger to the Arabs in the Arab State of
Palestine, who are much larger in numbers and whose birth-rate is far higher
than that of the Jews. The Arabs are determined on preventing the establishment
of even such a small Jewish State, purely on sentimental grounds. It is their
desire to have no partition of the country. They want to have one government
for the whole country, with the Jews occupying the position of a permanent
minority and without permission being accorded to the European Jews–small as
they are in numbers–to immigrate. And in preventing such a partition they have
the support of the Governments of the Arab States of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq,
Trans-jordan, the Lebanon and Syria which have some years ago constituted
themselves into an Arab League under British inspiration. These governments
have proclaimed that they will send their forces into Palestine to fight
against the partition and the establishment of a Jewish State. They have
already done so and some of these armies are actually engaged in fighting the
Jews who, in their turn, have their own armed forces. For the last three months
Palestine has been witnessing a civil war between the Jews and the Arabs, in
spite of the fact that the British are still the legal rulers of the land
having a responsibility for maintaining peace and order. But the British are
not prepared to discharge their responsibility. They have been really sabotaging
the decision of the United Nations in favour of partition. They have adopted an
anti-Jewish policy and a distinctly pro-Arab one and have done nothing to
prevent the Arabs from raising private armies or bringing armies from outside.
All this arises out of the fact that, come what may, they are determined to
continue to exercise power and influence in Palestine, and this they will not
be able to do unless they have the active co-operation of the Arabs not only of
Palestine but of all the Arab countries in the Middle East. Though these
countries today do not constitute one State, they are all members of the Arab
League and they are at one in their opposition to the Jews; and it will be
dangerous for the British to ignore this and adopt a friendly attitude towards
the Jews, however equitable and fair that attitude might be on purely
humanitarian grounds. The British are not interested in the Jews or the Arabs.
They are interested first in the oil of the Middle East which is the most
important source of supply for them, and in the exploitation of which they have
invested large amounts of capital. In this age of petrol Britain would be
ruined economically and politically if she were deprived of access to this
source of supply. They are interested next in having air-fields in the Middle
East of which Palestine is a part, so that they might have no difficulty in
maintaining their communications with their Colonies and Dominions in Southern
and Eastern Asia and with Australia and New-zealand. To be deprived of these
air-fields is to be deprived of whatever Empire they have. And lastly, they
have their other commercial interests in the Arab world. These three interests
cannot be secured unless the Arabs are friendly to them; and Arab friendship
cannot be secured if the British are to favour the partition of Palestine and
the creation of a Jewish State there. The ending of the mandate over Palestine
and the withdrawal of the British forces from that area do not mean the ending
of British influence and power. These they are not prepared to give up under
any circumstances. This also explains why the Jews regard the British today as
their greatest enemies. The interests of the United States and of the Soviet
are more or less of the same character as those of the British. They too want
oil. They too are anxious to establish airbases and commercial connections with
the countries here. And in the game of power politics they do not want to be
left behind. Finally we come to the interests of the United Nations. Of course this
organisation has only one interest,–that of maintaining peace in Palestine. It
has however recommended the partition of the country and it is now responsible
for bringing about partition by peaceful means. It is the difficulty involved
in bringing about a peaceful partition that has complicated the whole
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
United Nations Organisation has appointed a Commission to put the partition
into effect. This Commission demanded that it should be supplied with an
adequate military force for the purpose-especially in view of the outbreak of
civil war between the Jews and the Arabs. The Security Council has not found it
possible to create an International Military Force to help the Commission, and
there is therefore a move on the part of the United States to modify the scheme
of partition. Russia however wants to stick to the original recommendation that
the country should be partitioned. It is quite possible that in this Russia is
influenced by the prospect that, in any army which will have to be sent to
enforce partition, she will have her regiments and that this will bring her to
the Middle East as a military power</span>–<span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a position which she
has been coveting for a century and more. But whatever the motives be, there is
now a stalemate in the Security Council. If it is not able to enforce
partition, the prestige of the U.N.O. will be lost. But enforcing partition
will mean a war with the Moslems of the Middle East in which Russia will have
an active part. So the Great Powers are faced with a dilemma. Meanwhile the
British threaten that whatever might happen they are determined to give up
their mandate on May 15th and withdraw all their forces by August 15th. The
question however remains whether they will do this if the alternative is
anarchy in the Middle East, and disturbance to their oil and strategic
interests. They are, it is true, strengthening themselves by their new treaty
with Trans-jordan and they have their older treaties with Iraq and Egypt and
friendly understanding with Iran. They are also sure that whatever may happen
the United States will send adequate forces to maintain order in the Middle
East, partly to safeguard her own vast oil interests and partly to prevent the
Soviet from extending her influence. The point to note is that the importance of
Palestine arises out of its being a part of the Middle East.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Communistic revolution in Czechoslovakia is another event of world
significance. It is one more blow struck at Parliamentary Democracy and one
more step in the spread of totalitarianism and Soviet imperialism. It is now
clear to the whole world that there is not much difference between the foreign
policy pursued by Russia in the days of the autocratic Czars and at present by
the Communistic government. Expansion of the area of Russian influence and
power is the objective of both. And in this respect there is equally no
difference between the foreign policy of a Communist State like Russia and a
Capitalist State like the United States. The United States has its Truman
doctrine which resulted in her ascendancy over Greece and Turkey, and which
will lead through the Marshall Plan to her ascendancy over Italy, France,
Britain and the other countries of Western Europe. Russia has her ‘Molotov’
doctrine under which she has established herself as controlling authority over
Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Poland, and it is the
application of this doctrine that has made her supreme, through the
successfully planned Communistic revolution of February, over Czechoslovakia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Czechoslovakia
has been known to be a country whose people were really democratic and prepared
to work parliamentary forms of government. It was also expected that she would
act as a bridge between the East and the West. That was also the position which
almost all the political parties in the country wanted her to occupy. She was
anxious to take part in the European Recovery Programme of Marshall but was
prevented by Russia from doing so. It was from that moment that the Russians
were determined on preventing any non-Communistic political parties in the
country from having a share in government. She slowly worked in this direction
during the last four or five months, and the <i>coup </i>which took place in
February is its :outcome. The ground for this was well-prepared. The Communist
ministers in the Coalition Cabinet, which had been in office for nearly two
years, so managed affairs that the Police forces came to be manned mainly by
Communists, that the Army officers also belonged to the same party and that the
Trade Unions fell under the leadership of the Communists. When the
non-Communist ministers in the Cabinet protested against all this, they were
accused of being friends of reaction and of plotting against the State. These
ministers consequently resigned and Dr. Benes, the President, accepted their
resignations, even though there was every reason to think that he was opposed
to the course which events were taking. The ministry was reformed and a Cabinet
dominated by the Communist party came into office. Action Committees were
appointed and all those who were suspected of being opponents of this Communist
dictatorship were removed from positions of responsibility in the public
services, in Trade Unions, in journalism and in all other important walks of
public life. Opponents of the new regime were not allowed to attend the session
of the national parliament which was convened to express its confidence in the
Communist Cabinet. And in this way a totalitarian, one-party dictatorship was
established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pursued the same tactics between 1934 and 1939, and Stalin is doing the same.
The difference is that Stalin’s path is easier and smoother because inside
every country which he wants to bring under his control, there is
well-organised Communist party to obey his dictates. It is this that creates a
feeling that the Communists in Italy and France might be persuaded to adopt a
similar course. This ideological warfare, between Communism on one side and
non-Communism on the other, threatens to engulf the whole world and refuses to
allow peoples and States not interested in it to pursue their lives in their
own way. It is a new form of fanaticism that we see, bringing ruin to the peace
loving races on the earth. Concentration of power which is the creed of all
totalitarians–Communistic and otherwise–is even more dangerous than the
concentration of wealth against which the totalitarians say that they are

downpour of thunder-showers lasted for nearly an hour. The street in front of
Meera’s house was flooded and a red angry current of water gurgled through the
gutters, carrying with it dust and dirt and dry leaves and rags and bits of
paper. A large piece of a torn photograph whirled and danced on the current,
and was at last lost to sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

piece of photograph had for many days past remained locked in a chink in the gutter.
It used to flutter with the breeze, and whenever it waved, it looked like the
hood of a cobra. But even strong gusts of wind had failed to dislodge it. Today
it had been at last released from its bondage. The eddying water had carried it
away. The other bits of the photograph had gone with </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
wind long ago. Only this piece had remained caught in the vicious grip of the
gutter’s crack. It too<i> </i>was now gone at last. The last lingering proof of
Meera’s proficiency in dancing was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wiped out. There was
nothing left now to remind the world that Meera was once a talented dancer and
that people had predicted that she would make a big name for herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Meera was a nine years old young child, dancing had filled her whole life. She
had gone to school but had found no interest in the books. She used to pass
examinations, but her heart was not in her studies. Even when listening to the
geography lessons in the class, little Meera used to rehearse the dancing
steps. Her teacher would ask her a question, and Meera would stand speechless.
“What were you thinking of, Meera?” the teacher would ask angrily. Meera had no
reply. While looking at the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>blackboard on which her teacher solved an
example in arithmetic, Meera’s little feet under the bench moved to the accompaniment
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
an imagined rhythm on the India drum (Tabla). There was no love lost between
Meera and her books. It was a minor </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>miracle how she passed
every grade. Perhaps the blessings of Nataraj (the God of the dancers) helped
her secretly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meera’s
teachers had totally disapproved of Meera’s dancing lessons. The Principal of
the school sent frequent notes to Meera’s father–Dadasaheb–reporting that Meera
was not progressing satisfactorily in her studies, but Dadasaheb ignored those
notes. He knew that Meera had a talent for dancing, and, given proper training
and opportunities, she would excel in that art. Meera responded extremely well
to her parents’ encouragement. She became widely known as a promising dancer
before she was eleven years old. She gave public concerts, snatching prizes and
medals, and newspaper columnists showered unstinted praise on her. “This little
lovely star will shine with increasing brilliance in the future.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the age of eighteen Meera flowered into an artist of wide repute. She had now
passed her School Leaving Examination and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>attended a college.
But she was well-known and popular in the college not as a clever student but
as a danseuse. She gave public concerts not only in her own town but also in
many other places, and music conferences held in distant parts of the country
sent her pressing invitations. Her performances were applauded everywhere. Her
dancing teacher was pleased with her. Her mother and father were happy in the
thought that Meera would always devote herself to the art of dancing, and
achieve greater name and fame. That was to be Meera’s life, they thought. “When
do you intend to marry Meera?” women asked Meera’s mother. She waived the query
smilingly with the reply “What’s the hurry? Meera is still a young child.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meera’s
parents honestly thought that she was a young child. In their loving eyes Meera
was not a young girl of twenty, about to blossom into full womanhood, but an
innocent child in her teens. They looked at her with the same fond affection
with which they had covered her in her childhood. They could only see the
amazing strides which their daughter had made in the art of dancing. They had
no eyes to notice that Meera </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>had left innocent childhood behind, and
grown physically as well as intellectually. They still called her ‘Baby’, and
honestly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>believed that she was still a baby. They
imagined that nothing in the world except the art of dancing held any interest
for Meera. But Meera was growing. Many other things than her art attracted her.
She found delight in the company of girl friends of her own age. The applause
of men gave her a peculiar pleasure. Flattering words of young men tickled her,
and she was even more pleased with what their eyes conveyed to her. There was a
thrill in imagining the words which her young admirers left un</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said.
She realized that there was something mysterious and tantalizing in the company
of young men, and she felt drawn towards a delight which had no name nor shape.
As a child she </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>had been used to express in her dance the joys
and sorrows of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>love only mechanically, but now these emotions
touched her young heart. They lasted even after her dancing lessons and public
recitals. They throbbed in the depths of her being unceasingly, and she
experienced a new nameless restlessness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
dancing teacher engaged a young violin player to accompany her along with the
other instrumentalists. The music of this young man’s violin enhanced the
orchestral effect and increased the beauty of Meera’s dance. Now and again this
young violinist, Madhav, would strike such beautiful notes that the spectators
would feel as though a dazzling flood of light had suddenly illuminated the
stage. Meera would then look at him, and he too would look at her. She gave him
a secret smile, which he too returned secretly. He knew that she had inwardly
said ‘Well done!’ and she too would hear his unuttered words ‘Well done!’
Everyone praised Madhav, and Meera experienced a strange happiness when she
heard people talking about Madhav’s rare </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There was a strange tremulous note of ardour in his
voice, which touched her heart. She had no strength, she thought, to hurt him.
But she also knew that there was no chance of obtaining her father’s
permission. For the first time in her life Meera experienced the tension of two
opposite feelings. What should I do? What should I do?’ she asked herself
frantically. And then something occurred to her which occurs inevitably to a
girl of her age, caught in love. Cheating! Meera gave a start. But that lasted
only for a brief moment. For, when love enters a young woman’s heart, it gives
her a new courage too, just as it impels her to cheat her parents. There is a
peculiar lure for a young woman in love in gratifying some secret desire
without the knowledge of the parents.</p>

knew that Meera used to dance, and that she had made a name for herself as a
popular and talented dancer. He also knew her affair with Madhav. He disliked
that part of her life. He wanted to forget it. He wanted nothing in his house
that would remind him of Meera’s past. Husband and wife avoided that subject very
carefully. And even when a friend or a visitor made a casual reference to it,
Meera’s husband closed it immediately, as one would shut a door.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

curtains look horrid. Take them off.’ He said. He purchased new cloth on the
next day, brought a tailor, and fitted the doors and the windows with new
curtains. He made a bundle of Meera’s curtains and put them away in the attic.
They lay there until Meera one day called an old woman who sold crockery and
glassware in exchange for old clothes, and sold them. She then also took out
all her photographs, tore them into bits, flung them out of the window, and
stood looking at the little pieces as they fluttered away on the breeze. They
pirouetted like little butterflies, and after a while disappeared. One big piece,
however, was caught in a chink in the gutter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

experienced a peculiar happiness as she gazed at the only remnant of her
dancing career and also of her love for Madhav. She often wished to run down
into the street, to capture that piece of cardboard, and to keep it as a
precious treasure. But she never did so. She only stood at the window and
looked at it as it moved up and down and looked like the head of a cobra.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

resulted in the Congress party once more gaining that dominant position which
it held until 1967. The elections proved that the reverses which it suffered in
1967 were only temporary and that the electorate was convinced that in the best
interests of the country the Congress should continue to rule over both the <span

given in the elections to <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span>
in 1971 and it was <span class=GramE>Confirmed</span> by the elections to State
Assemblies in 1972. One-party domination has come to stay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

magnitude of the victory of the Congress is shown by the fact that while it won
71.36 per cent of the seats, all other parties and independents put together
won only 28.64 per cent of the seats. Their debacle may be said to have been
complete. In eleven of the Assemblies the Congress won a two-thirds majority.
In Madhya Pradesh it has a three-fourths majority. All this has enabled it to
form governments without the need to enter into coalitions with other parties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is worthwhile noting in this context that the parties of the Right as well as
those of the Left suffered a crushing defeat. The <span class=SpellE>Swatantra</span>
has been repudiated by the states like <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place>
and <span class=SpellE>Rajasthan</span> which were hitherto considered to be
its strongholds. In <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place> where it secured
in 1967 elections 68 seats and formed the main Opposition to the ruling party,
it did not win even a single seat in 1972. In <span class=SpellE>Rajasthan</span>
it had 48 seats in 1967 and now it has only 11. Similar is the case with Jan <span
class=SpellE>Sangh</span>, another of the Rightist parties. The Hindi-speaking
states of U.P., <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>, <span class=SpellE>Rajasthan</span>
and Madhya Pradesh have always been its strongholds. There was no election in
U. P. but in that held in 1969 the <span class=SpellE>Sangh</span> won only 49
seats while it had 98 in the elections of 1967. The present elections proved
that it has lost its popularity not only in U. P. but also in the three other
states. While it won 78 seats in Madhya Pradesh in 1967 it secured only 48 in
1972. In <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place> its strength fell from 34 in
1969 to 25 in 1972; and in <span class=SpellE>Rajasthan</span> from 22 in 1967

clear even at the time of the elections to <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span

where it had <span class=GramE>a strength</span> of 86 in 1967 it now won only
33. The strength of the C. P. I. has increased from 80 in 1967 to 108 in 1972
but this was entirely due to its alliance with the Congress. For all practical
purposes it has to-day become a wing of the Congress. It has ceased to be a
revolutionary party. Its international affiliations are with Soviet Russia and
as long as Soviet Russia supports the Congress party, the C. P. I. has to do
the same. It cannot be really counted among the leftist parties. The only other
party that falls into this category is C. P. M. While in 1967 it secured 43 and
113, in 1971 in <st1:place w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place>, its main
stronghold, it won only 14 in 1972. The Leftists like the Rightists are nowhere
in the picture. The Left <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> Congress party

of 1972 supported the party. This shows that it has the support of only a
minority of the active and politically conscious electorate–that part of the
electorate which takes the trouble to participate in elections. A majority of
them, 55.33 per cent, are against the Congress and therefore against the
policies and <span class=SpellE>programmes</span> of the party. In our system
of elections to the <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Vidhan</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabhas</span> (and not
to the <span class=SpellE>Rajya</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> or the
Legislative Councils in States) we borrowed the British system of single-member
constituencies in which a candidate who gets the largest number of votes cast
and not a majority of votes cast is declared to be the winner. It is because of
this that there is no correspondence between the <span class=GramE>percentage</span>
of votes cast for a party in the state or country as a whole and the number of
seats it wins. The only remedy for this is the proportional system of
representation adopted in almost all democracies on the continent of <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. But it has its own shortcomings, even though it
secures a better representation to all the political parties and prevents one-party
dominance. This is not the place to examine the merits and demerits of the
proportional system of representation. What is necessary to notice is that both
Rightists and Leftists continue even to-day to command the support of
appreciable sections of the people, though the support is ineffective from the
point of view of power. For instance, compared with its voting strength in
1967, the Jan <span class=SpellE>Sangh</span> has improved its popular support
by 2 per cent in <st1:place w:st="on">Bihar</st1:place>, while in Madhya
Pradesh and <span class=SpellE>Rajasthan</span> it retained its 1967 position.
Despite its losses of seats the C. P. M. has retained 28 per cent of electoral
support in <st1:place w:st="on">West Bengal</st1:place>, its stronghold. In <st1:place
w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place> the <span class=SpellE>Akali</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dal</span> polled 28 per cent which is only one per cent less than
what it polled in the mid-term election of 1971. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have now to account for the extraordinary victory secured by the Congress.
There were both positive and negative factors which contributed to it. Among
the positive ones priority of place should be given to the charismatic
leadership of <span class=SpellE>Srimathi</span> <span class=SpellE>Indira</span>
Gandhi, the Prime Minister. It is no exaggeration to say that the victory of
the Congress is mostly due to her and that people voted for the Congress
because they considered it to be a vote for her. In 1967 there were serious
doubts about her capacity for leadership. By the time of the mid-term elections
to <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> in 1971 these
doubts were completely removed. The unprecedented courage she showed in putting
out of power the other leaders who competed with her and the skill which she
displayed in bringing victory to the candidate of her choice for the <span
class=SpellE>Presidentship</span> of India attracted to her the admiration of
large sections of the people. The boldness with which she <span class=SpellE>nationalised</span>
the banks and put an end to the privileges of the princely order convinced many
that she was determined on putting into effect the Socialist policies for which
the Congress stood in theory from the days of its <span class=SpellE>Avadi</span>
session. The conviction grew that Congress was no longer a party of <i>status
quo </i>but a party which was bent on bringing about all the needed social
changes. It was in this way that she built up her leadership from 1967 and by
1971 she was the only leader who commanded a national stature. All others were
sectional or group leaders. In her capacity for taking decisions she showed
that she was even superior to her father who was also a charismatic leader of a
rare type. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second positive factor was the victory that she brought to the country in the
war with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
People naturally took pride in this and some of them were even inclined to
conclude that it was the first great victory achieved by India in warding off
the attacks of the fanatical invaders from the North-West which began a
thousand years ago. They took equal pride in the war having brought about the
liberation of <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>
with a population of seventy-five millions. No other nation in the contemporary
world has such an accomplishment to its credit. It was also a matter of pride
to the people that the Prime Minister could defy the Americans–a world
power–when they brought their seventh fleet equipped with nuclear weapons into
the Bay of Bengal and threatened to intervene on the side of Pakistan in the
Indo-Pakistan war. President Nixon could have bombed the Indian coastal waters
then as he later on bombed North Vietnam coasts. But the Prime Minister
proceeded with her work in a calm and unruffled manner until victory was won.
She also endeared herself to the people by the way she solved the problem of
the ten million refugees who fled to India to escape from the savagery of
Pakistani armed forces in <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>.
As a true mother she fed, clothed and sheltered them and sent them back to
their homes when their country became free. The elections to the State
Assemblies were held when memories of what the Prime Minister did in all these
respects were fresh in the minds of the people and it is no wonder that they
voted for her party in large numbers. It would have been an act of betrayal and
sheer ingratitude if they had voted otherwise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
third factor which attracted the people to her party was </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
election manifesto which promised that if returned to power the Congress would
take all measures necessary to eradicate poverty, to solve the problem of
unemployment and to remove disparities between the rich and the poor. Of
course, similar manifestos were issued in the past and little came out of them,
but in 1972 the people, as has already been pointed out, believed that under
the dynamic and radical leadership of the Prime Minister the Congress would not
be content with mere verbal socialism but would take necessary action for the
purpose. Other parties also issued manifestos which were more radical in
content but from the experience of those parties while in power between 1967<i>
</i>and 1972 the electorate concluded that they would do little to put their </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>promises
into practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
the measures which the Prime Minister took before the elections to form <i>ad
hoc </i>committees in different states to conduct the election work of the
Congress, to replace Chief Ministers, who were in a position to defy her
because of their local standing and influence, by Chief Ministers of her own
choice, to reconstitute the Councils of Ministers with representatives of <span
class=SpellE>Harijans</span>, Tribals and other weaker sections of society
brought considerable dividends to the party in the elections. Some of the Chief
Ministers belonged to the minority communities who had long been suppressed.
This, along with the large representation given to the weaker sections in the
councils, convinced these sections that if the Congress won the elections power
would be more equitably distributed among the different communities and that
there would be an end to the dominant position which landlord communities like <span
class=SpellE>Reddys</span> and <span class=SpellE>Kammas</span> in Andhra and <span
class=SpellE>Vokkaligars</span> and <span class=SpellE>Lingayats</span> in <span
class=SpellE>Mysore</span> had all along enjoyed. This conviction got further
strengthened when in selecting candidates for election the Prime Minister and
the Congress Parliamentary Committee under her direction chose large numbers
from the weaker sections including women. Next to her charismatic leadership it
is this strategy which she adopted to break the monopoly of power wielded in
the post-independence period by the land-owning castes that worked
substantially in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the Congress. There has
been the criticism that all this smacks of dictatorship. But one should not
forget that elections are a kind of war, though non-violent, for winning power
and that victory in such a war, as in all wars, depends on concentration of
authority in a single commander-in-chief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
the Prime Minister and the Congress were also <span class=SpellE>criticised</span>
for placing before the electorate national issues like Indo-Pakistan war,
Socialism and so on, instead of local issues, which alone were relevant during
elections to State Assemblies. There is some justification for this kind of
criticism but we should remember that the electorate is not as yet in a
position to distinguish between national and local issues and that moreover the
distinction between them is not clear cut–socialism, removal of inequalities,
ceiling on land holdings and urban property and relief of unemployment are as
much local as national issues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the negative factors which contributed to the victory of the Congress was the
people’s loss of confidence in Opposition parties. These parties were voted to
power in several states in 1967 but the coalition ministries they formed did
not prove to be stable. Several states consequently came under President’s rule
which meant the elimination of democracy in the state so long as such rule
continued. There was also nothing to show that these parties learnt a lesson
from their failings in 1967-72 and that they were prepared to work together on
the basis of an agreed common programme. Even the attempt at a common front
which they <span class=SpellE>organised</span> to fight <span class=SpellE>Lok</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> elections in 1971 was not repeated during the
Assembly elections. In this situation the electorate seems to have felt that no
purpose would be served by voting for opposition parties in large numbers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from this factor of a general character there were also special reasons why Jan
<span class=SpellE>Sangh</span>, for instance, lost support in Hindi-speaking
areas or C. P. M. in Bengal. Hindu communalism which was the main plank of Jan <span
class=SpellE>Sangh</span> lost much of its force owing to developments in <span
class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>. In West Bengal the
C. P. M. became completely isolated because of the encouragement which it gave
to violence while in power in that state and also because of the indifference
which it showed to <span class=SpellE>Bangla</span> <span class=SpellE>Desh</span>
issue and the refugee problem–issues which had a wide popular appeal. Many of
its traditional supporters, it is said, have lost faith in elections. This may
account for its debacle to some extent. In the case of Muslims also it is said
that communalism has not the same hold over them now as it had in 1967. The
fact that Congress won in many constituencies in Assam and elsewhere, where
Muslims constituted a majority of voters, shows that once again, as during the
years 1950-1962, they have become pro-Congress and believe that their
interests, as well as the interests of secularism, are closely bound up with
the continuance of Congress in power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in every Assembly there is no danger of defectors trying to meddle with

practically disappears and State Governments and legislatures become mere
rubber-stamps for implementing the policies dictated to them by the <span

Very few states, for example, are anxious to shape ceiling legislation in accordance
with local needs. They prefer to delegate the power to the Central Government.
If this procedure continues the advantages we expect from a federal set-up will
disappear. When Chief Ministers, other ministers, and members of legislatures

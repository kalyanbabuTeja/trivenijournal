<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are many kinds of prayers. There is one
external and physical, that is to say, simply words learnt by rote and repeated
mechanically. It does not mean much. It has usually one result, however, making
you quiet. If you go on repeating a few words or sounds for some time, it puts
you into a state of calmness in the end. There is another kind which is the
natural expression of a wish; you want a particular thing and you express it
clearly. You can pray for an object or for a circumstance, you can pray also
for a person or for yourself. There is still another kind in which the prayer
borders on aspiration and the two meet: it is the spontaneous formulation of a
living experience; it shoots out of the depth of your being, it is the
utterance of something lived within: it wants to express gratitude for the
experience, asks for its continuation or seeks an explanation. It is then, what
I said, almost an aspiration. Aspiration, however, does not necessarily
formulate itself in words; if it uses words at all, it makes of them a kind of
invocation. Thus, you wish to be in a certain condition. You have, for example,
found in you something which is not in harmony with your ideal, a movement of
obscurity or ignorance or even bad will. You wish to see it changed. You do not
express the thing in so many words, but it rises up in you like a flame, an
ardent offering of the experience itself which seeks increase and greatening to
be made more clear and precise. It is true all this is capable of being
expressed in words, if one tries to recall and note down the experience. But
the experience, the aspiration itself is, as I say, like a flame shooting up
and contains within it the very thing it asks for. I say “asks for”, but the movement
is not at all that of a desire: it is truly a flame, the flame of purifying
will carrying at its centre the very object which it wished to be realised. The
discovery of a fault in you impels you to make it an occasion for more
progress, for greater self-discipline, for further ascension towards the
Divine. It opens out a door upon your future, which you wish to be clearer,
truer, intenser; all that gathers in you like a concentrated force and tosses
you up in a movement of ascension. It needs no expression in words. It is
indeed a flame that leaps up. Such is true aspiration. Prayer usually is
something much more external; it is about a very precise object. It is always
formulated; for the formulation itself makes what a prayer is. You may have an
aspiration and you can transcribe it into a prayer, but the aspiration itself
exceeds the prayer. It is something much more intimate, much more
self-forgetful, living only in the object it wishes to be or the thing to do,
almost identified with it. A prayer can be of a very high quality. Instead of
being a request for a fulfilment of your particular desire, it may express your
thankfulness and gratefulness for what the Divine has done and is doing for
you. You are not busy with your little self and its egoistic interests, you ask
for the Divine’s ways in you and in the world. This leads you to the border of
aspiration. For aspiration too has many degrees and it is expressed on many
levels. But the core of aspiration is in the psychic being, it is there at its purest,
for there is its origin and source. Prayers come from the other, the lower or
secondary levels of being. That is to say, there are physical or material
prayers, asking for physical or material things, vital prayers, mental prayers;
there are psychic prayers and spiritual prayers too. Each has its own character
and its own value. I say again there is a certain type of prayer which is so
spontaneous and so disinterested, more like an appeal or a call, generally not
for one’s own sake, but acting sometimes like an intercession with the Divine
on behalf of others. Such a prayer is extremely powerful. I have seen
innumerable cases where such a prayer had brought about its immediate
fulfilment. It means a great faith, a great fervour, a great sincerity and also
a great simplicity of heart, something which does not calculate, which does not
bargain or barter, does not give with the idea of receiving. The majority of
prayers are precisely made with the idea of giving so that one may receive. But
I was speaking of the rarer variety which also does exist, which is a kind of
thanksgiving, a canticle or a hymn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To sum up then it can be
said that a prayer is always formed of words. Words have different values,
according to the state of consciousness of the person when he formulates it.
But always prayer is a formulated thing. But one can aspire without
formulating. And then, prayer needs a person to whom one prays. There is, of
course, a certain class of people whose conception of the universe is such that
there is no room in it for the Divine (the famous French scientist Laplace, for
example). Such people are not likely to favour the existence of any being
superior to themselves to whom they can appeal or look up for guidance and
help. There is no question of prayer for them. But even they, though they may
not pray, may aspire. They may not believe in God, but they may believe, for
example, in progress. They may conceive of the world as a progressive movement,
that it is becoming better and better, rising higher and higher, growing
constantly to a nobler fulfilment. They can ask for, will for, aspire for such
progress; they need not look for the Divine. Aspiration requires faith,
certainly, but not faith necessarily in a personal God. But prayer is always
addressed to a person, a person who hears and grants it. There lies the great
difference between the two. Intellectual people admit aspiration, but prayer
they consider as something inferior, fit for unintellectual persons. The
mystics say, aspiration is quite all right, but if your aspiration is to be
heard and fulfilled, you must also pray, know how to pray and to whom–who else
but the Divine? The aspiration need not be towards any person; the aspiration
is not for a person, but for a state of consciousness, a knowledge, a
realisation. Prayer adds to it the consciousness, a knowledge, a realisation.
Prayer is a personal thing addressed to a person for a thing which he alone can
grant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

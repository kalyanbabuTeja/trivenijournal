is generally said to be an expression or the writer’s personality. But we do
not go to literature to meet the writer. Instead, we go to literature, as
Robert Frost would say, for delight which ends in wisdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then, can we dispense with the writer altogether?
Are the poem and the poet independent of each other? Of course, we do not go to
a poem to peep into the mind or the poet. But can we say we have not had the
feel of it? We cannot; because without the poet the poem would not have
existed. It is he who has the experience. Not that others do not have
experiences or that his experiences are altogether different from those of
others. The poet is always at the point of intersection. He has acute
sensitivity and he is conscious of the meaning, necessity and intensity of
those experiences, which he expresses in the best words possible in the best
possible order, charging them with appropriate emotions and feelings. Thus the
poem grows out or his personality and therefore the poem cannot but bear the
colour of his personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is personality? “Precisely, it is” Sir Herbert Read says, “the
general-common-denominator of a man’s sentiments and emotions.” It is formed
less by the conscious part than the subconscious and unconscious parts of the
human mind, which record the good and the bad, the important and the
unimportant things and events around. A personality is characterised not only
by what it includes but also by what it excludes. Hence the variety and wide
difference in the personalities of individuals. When these personalities are
reflected in literary works, the works are bound to be different from one
another. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Human
nature being the same at all times and at all places, it is impossible to
create anything entirely new. A French critic, says Middleton Murry, has even
calculated the original plots in all literature to be just thirty-six. So what
the writer does is not creating anything entirely new, but to present universal
experiences in his own way. It is this ‘uniqueness’ of a work that makes it a
‘new’ work, in the sense that it could not have been written in any other way,
period or by any other man. Only Milton could write <i>Paradise Lost, </i>and <i>The
Waste Land </i>could not have come out at any other time or from any one else.
It is the unique personality of the writer that gives the work its uniqueness.
And this uniqueness is that we think of when we say that it is ‘Shakespearian
or ‘Keatsian’ or ‘Lawrentian’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
poetry is a more ‘personal’ form it is more or less inevitable that a poet
should ‘reveal’ his personality in his poems, may be in spite of himself,
through his themes, imagery and even metre. In the novel, since the novelist
does not, generally, speak directly it appears to be possible for him not to
give himself away. But, as R. G. Moulton says, “It is impossible to construct a
story, touching things human, which does not involve underlying conceptions of
life; if the author so intended then the story reveals his conceptions of life;
if he did not so intend the conceptions of life are betrayed. Thus, the story
by the manner of its execution connects with art, by its matter with life.”
Drama, by its very nature, is more objective than the novel and the dramatist,
unlike the novelist, enjoys no privilege of commenting on his characters and
events. Yet, the voice of the dramatist can be recognised echoing through his
characters and themes. In modern days drama has been a vehicle of ideas and the
emphasis laid on a particular idea reveals the mind of the dramatist as in the
case of Ibsen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
must remember here that no part of a writer’s work like a poem or play should
be detached from the body of his whole work and singled out for finding out the
writer’s personality. No greater injustice can be done than to single out a
dark comedy of Shakepeare like <i>Measure for Measure </i>and say that his
attitude to life was cynical. Therefore the whole work of a writer should be
studied to get a comprehensive idea of his personality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the writer cannot help being present in his work, how much of a writer’s
personality is permissible and justified? There is not and cannot be any
criterion. Inspiration is essential but poetry is not all inspiration. “There
is a great deal, in the writing of poetry, which must be conscious and
deliberate. In fact, the bad poet is usually unconscious, where he ought to be
conscious, and conscious where he ought to be unconscious. Both errors tend to
make him ‘personal’ says T. S. Eliot. Shaw seems to have been too ‘conscious’
in not letting his characters speak for themselves freely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>T. S. Eliot’s theory of impersonality is only a
development of Keats’s theory of “negative capability.” Keats says that a poet
should be able to suspend his own self and take part in the men, things and
events around. According to Elliot a writer’s personality is a complex whole
which includes important as well as unimportant things. All that a poet feels
may be important to him, but in poetry the expression of all his emotions and
feelings, i.e., his ‘personality’, may not be important at all. Because the
emotion in poetry has to be a very complex and significant one. So, he has to
keep his ‘personality’ away in order to create a work of art, lest his
personality intrudes and influences it. It is in this sense that Eliot says,
“Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is
not an expression of personality but an escape from personality.” He also says,
“The poet has not a ‘personality’ to express, but a particular medium, which is
only a medium and not a personality. Therefore the emotion of art is
impersonal. And the poet cannot reach this impersonality without surrendering
himself wholly to the work to be done.....The progress of an artist is a
continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.” Eliot seems
to have stated what an ideal artist must do to be highly original and great or
‘traditional’ in the Eliotian sense. The long and glorious history of English
literature does not provide any instance of a writer other than Shakespeare,
who died continually in his work and lost unity to gain meaningful
multiplicity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sir
Herbert Read makes a stimulating statement that ‘romantic’ and ‘classic’ are just
two kinds of art springing respectively from personality, which is the
general-common-denominator or a man’s sentiments and emotions, and from
character which is a disposition resulting from the repression of certain
impulses which would otherwise be present in the personality. And it seems that
the greater the strength of character the greater will be the degree of
impersonality, for which Eliot hankers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Literature
certainly is not an ‘expression’ of the writer’s personality. It is the result
of an artistic effort to create meaningful and delightful patterns in words.
However imaginative a writer may be the depth and the width of life are beyond
human comprehension. A slice of life is chosen by the writer while expressing
in literary forms and however objective and impersonal he may be, the choice,
for which he alone is responsible, certainly reflects his personality. As Prof.
Menezes says, “The poet publishes the poems and the poems publish him.” Thus,
literature is not an expression of personality. But personality is ‘revealed’
in it. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

personality is but a part of i</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Curiously
enough a learned critic like C. S. Lewis argues that a writer’s personality is
not at all revealed in his works. According to him the writer’s personality is
a limitation, and the writer’s business is, starting from his own mode of
consciousness, to find out that arrangement of public experiences, embodied in
words, which will admit him to a new mode of consciousness. The writer proceeds
partly by instinct, partly by following his predecessors and largely by trial
and error and the result is an annihilation of his own particular psychology
rather than its assertion. Evidently, Mr. Lewis is nearer to the theory of
impersonality. But, regrettably, he ignores the fact that a writer is ever
confronted with the problem of choice, which is determined by his own
disposition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
all what is it that we really ‘enjoy’ in literature? If the basic plots are not
more than thirty-six, why are so many new novels and plays coming out daily? If
the themes for poetry hardly change how and why are so many poems written! Yet,
no two are alike. The reason is the simple truth that each man is different
from the other in his conception of and responses to life. It is undoubtedly
the poet’s ‘unique’ personality that makes a poem ‘new’ and it is the
personality of the poet that we really enjoy. In Wordsworth’s ‘The Daffodils’
we share the enthusiastic pleasure of the poet white in Herrick’s ‘To
Daffodils’ we share the sense of transience of human life, like that of
daffodils. While reading ‘<i>Three Men in a Boat’ </i>we not only get an
account of the experiences of three sailors but also an interesting commentary
on life around by Jerome K. Jerome. It is not implied that we go to literature
to meet the writer. But as he breathes through the work and as his presence
makes the work unique and on that account delightful, we ‘enjoy’ the
personality of the writer too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

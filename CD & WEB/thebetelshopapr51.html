<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is no wonder that, to Narayana who had acquired
fame in a big city like Madras, this little town looked like a desert. Here,
there were no trams or buses, nor stylish buildings. No, not even
Cinema-houses. Narayana could put up with the lack of many things, but without
a Cinema-house life wasn’t so worthwhile. And this was not without reason. His
education at College had been cut short by his zest for cinemas. But then, he
had acquired so much of worldly wisdom. In order to spread this wisdom he had
actually run a monthly magazine devoted to the cinema. That was only for a
short while. As the magazine was making some progress after the initial
troubles, he was actuated by an ambition to produce a picture himself, and he
plunged into this venture after selling his entire property. He was like
Yudhishtira staking Draupadi at the last throw. For eight months he did not
know where he was drifting. All the time it was agreements, advertisements,
salaries, allowances and the rest of the bother.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
never dreamt that the concern would become insolvent so soon. God might take
care of the Company, but his magazine too suffered an eclipse in the process.
Not only that, in that huge city</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

like himself could not even secure a. job!...But in a way that was fortunate.
For, otherwise, he would have, by this time, got stuck up in some rotten job.
Surely, it was thousand times better to remain unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Indeed, he was not so utterly unemployed, and just
wasting his as a guest of his boyhood friend Mr. Seshiah. He was pursuing his
plans, and any day they might succeed. Till then, he wished to spend his time
in that town like a mariner taking shelter on a tiny island after ship-wreck–till
some ship should rescue him. And surely he did not belong here.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In his daily routine the only item that brought him
a little excitement was the after-dinner stroll every night to the Railway
Station. If anyone disturbed him by accosting him at that time, he felt greatly
distressed. But it often happened that someone or other did impede his
progress. Today that fell to the lot of Mr. Ramachandrudu. After the usual
enquiries about his welfare, Mr. Ramachandrudu wished to know if Narayana had
seen a recent picture ‘Suprabhatam’ in the neighbouring town. It was true that
Narayana had not seen it, but no one had a chance to appreciate it so well as
himself. The actual story and the actors and actresses were not of much
account, and so, he started off on a grand discourse about the ‘technique’
which after all was the main thing. Poor Ramachandrudu felt his heart sink,
for, there was no knowing how many hours this discourse might take to finish.
After a great deal of agitation as to how he could get out of this mess, he
said, “Look here, Sir, we common people cannot easily follow all this, so you
will be good enough to come to my house and talk at leisure. I forgot my
umbrella at the cloth shop in the bazaar, and if I do not run up immediately it
might get lost”, and he slipped away. For a few moments, Narayana sustained the
speed of his discourse, proving the truth of Newton’s first law of motion.</p>

felt hurt but was relieved to find that the interruption to his walk was
removed. Already it was a little late. Radha’s betel-shop near the station
might be closed by now. True, he could pay cash in some other shop and get the
cigars and betel needed for the next day. And even the other shop-keepers may
not refuse to give him things on credit. But, poor woman, she hadn’t much
custom. Moreover, this stroll had become a daily habit. As he crossed the
bridge he realized that he was walking a. little too fast. As he came within
sight of the little lamp in the betel-shop, his pace steadied it</span><span

sat down on the bench in front of the shop and, leisurely, lighted the last of

preach about the splendid chances in the cinema industry. But they had not so
far noted another weakness of his. That related to women. Whenever his eyes
rested on a women who seemed pretty, he would at once think of her as a
prospective cinema star. If only she got the requisite training, people who
would not notice her now would flock in their thousands to admire her on the
screen. Sweet visions like this were always focussed onto the curtain of his
mind. Whenever he cast his glance on Radha at the betel-shop, it was difficult
for him to retain his mental balance. Poor thing! She sat here at the wretched
shop wasting her thoughts on petty transactions of one pice and two pice, and
wasting her beauty and youth. Previously Narayana used to utter these words to

here peacefully. You needn’t talk. Very likely, it was my fault not to have
spoken to you quite frankly.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Narasingh was not overpleased with this question.
“And so, you didn’t want that I should ever come back,” and he cast a glance
towards Narayana. Narayana who was already shaking all over with fear, began to
sweat, as he encountered that glance. Narasingh looked at Narayana with
contempt, as if he were a poisonous insect, and thundered, “Who is this?” Narayana
did not remember the sequence of events that happened after this thunder. He
was conscius only of the lamp on the table being overturned and breaking
against the floor, and of Radha’s words uttered in a plaintive tone. And then,
the words that Narasingh uttered referring to him–he was not clear whether he
said anything in reply–and a tremendous blow on his back to the accompaniment
of the words, “Get out, you dog!” And he found himself thrown into the street.</p>

another four days he was oblivious of the world. The day after he was
completely cured of the fever and took diet, Mr. Seshaiah expostulated, “Why
shouldn’t you stay a liltle longer, till you feel better.” But Narayana
wouldn’t hear of it, and taking a loan of Rs. 50 he left the town without even
casting a glance at Radha’s betel-shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who purchased things for one anna and half an anna had no connection whatsoever
with Radha’s thoughts of the daytime, or her dreams in the night. A few days
after, Radha got news that Narasingh had committed suicide in prison. Quite
apart from any news of this kind, Radha was mentally prepared to follow
Narayana wherever he led, even to drown herself in the ocean along with him, if
only Narayana should come again and invite her. Such was her revulsion of
feeling towards Narasingh. He had shown such distrust of her, that fatal night.
But, how could Narayana know of this change in Radha! That distinguished
individual who dreamt of world fame, was content to drag on his existence as an
Assistant Manager of a Film Distributing Company. And she who was like ‘Urvasi’<sup>4</sup>
unto him, kept on the betel-shop without a day’s break and did business to the
tune of about Rs. 2 per day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

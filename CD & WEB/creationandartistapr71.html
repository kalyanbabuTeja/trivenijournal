humans are not artists but all artists are humans. In general, the artist does
not remain an artist throughout the 24 hours; he becomes an artist only in the
effulgent moments of creative candescence when the amorphous is transformed
into form, silence, into sound and the static into the dynamic! At other
moments they remain mere ordinary human beings. But even during these ordinary
moments their observations and introspections are distinct from those of the
ordinary men and women. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

German poet and dramatist, says, “Those organs which guide an animal are under
man’s guidance and control.” Thus Goethe here has wisely distinguished the
volitional faculties of man from those of the animal. And now we have to
distinguish the artist from the man, the common man. Where the common man fails
to comprehend beauty, the artist comprehends, and where the former fails to
give a concrete form to the elusive beauty, the latter does, Aesthetic
conception and material execution are the two main characteristics that distinguish
the artist from the common </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

empirical as well as transcendental. Art is both icon and idea–image and

autumn dawn, vernal dusk and winter mists, of man, beast and bird is, no doubt,
immensely enchanting, but the creation of line, colour, form, rhythm, tune,
harmony, contrast, etc., by the artist is far more enchanting than that of the
natural phenomena, for the artist transforms Nature into art. What Nature fails
to do, art accomplishes, for Nature is ‘being’ while art is ‘becoming’. Nature
is objective, while art is ‘ambijective’, which word I have coined, to indicate
the blending of the subjective and the objective. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Artist does not create objects but he creates the
forms of objects. The form of an object is more fascinating than the object
itself. The form of a mountain looks more beautiful than the mountain itself.
Object belongs to the pragmatic realm, while the form of the object does to the
aesthetic realm. Everybody cannot separate the form from the object. The artist
alone can accomplish this. The chair yields us comfort by allowing us to sit on
it, whereas the curves of the form of the chair give us aesthetic delight,
distinguishing itself from the utilitarian aspect of the chair. Object is
reality, while its form is an appearance. But appearances are sometimes more
real than the realities themselves. Shadow looks lovelier than the substance, despite
the fact that the shadow is cast by the substance. </p>

and colour are interdependent. Although colour and form are independent
entities, they can never exist apart from each other. Colour cannot be
perceived as colour, unless there exists a form and again it is the same with
form too. No form in the visual world could be visible devoid of any colour.
So, colour is formal and form is colourful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is mainly twofold–visual and auditory. Painting, sculpture, architecture, etc.,
are visual arts and hence they are spatial arts because they belong to space.
Form exists on space alone; all visual arts are formal arts and hence they are
spatial arts. Auditory arts such as music, poetry, etc., are temporal arts
because they belong to time. Vision and audition or form and sound represent
space and time respectively. Spatial arts are concrete while temporal arts are
abstract. Painting is concrete while music is abstract. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

simplest definition of art is ‘transformation of the impression into expression
is art’. The artist receives his impressions either from the external world or
from his internal world of imagination. In<i> </i>either case the artist transforms
his abstract impressions into concrete expressions. The impression when turned
into expression is called a work of art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
process of the artist’s creative thinking contains four phases, according to
Wallas: preparation, incubation, illumination and verification. In the
preparation period the artist receives his first impression through his
sense-perceptions, awaiting expression. But gradually these newly-acquired
impressions become part of the artist‘s unconscious and thus his conscious attention
is diverted from those impressions. This stage is called incubation. Later, in
due course, the unconscious-bound impressions will re-appear in a sudden flash
of inspiration to the artist; this third stage is called illumination.
Eventually the artist endeavours to judge critically what his mind has
perceived–whether it is a truth or a hallucination; and this last phase is
called verification. After having passed through these four phases of creative
thinking the artist, at last, starts to create works of art in his chosen
medium, method and mannerism. Here thought turns into action, impression into
expression and idea into icon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

place; contemplation is ideological </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>creation, while
creation is technological contemplation. The finished work of art he intends to
execute has to be visualised vividly before his mental eye, prior to create the
same. This psychological precision would later yield perfection of dexterity to
the finished work. Artistic creation is conspicuous by the presence of
consummate dexterity. Rhythm is the lively dexterity of every work of art. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

said in the beginning that all men were not artists. But this statement is only
true in one sense. Thus we have to state in another sense that all men are
artists–not waking artists but sleeping artists. Every person is a dormant artist,
distinct from the fact every artist is a waking artist. In every individual the
artistic talents remain latent. The moment a latent talent ceases to be latent,
its possessor turns to be a talented person. Every individual possesses
aesthetic sensibility within him to some extent. He or she would react to form
and sound but cannot create form and sound. That is why they are dormant or
passive artists while those who can create are waking or active artists. In one
sense, ‘to be’ ‘to become’. So, ‘to live’ is ‘to create.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Here one should never forget that the artist alone
is not the ideal human being on our terrestrial globe. There are scientists,
heroes, scholars, saints, etc., in addition to the artists. Artist is first a
man and then an artist. The artist should not deem to be above his fellow
beings, the common men. In this context aptly says Odibon Redon, “The artist
must not think that a divine right has placed him above the others. The sense
of creation is something, but it is not everything. Some thoroughly mediocre
man, or even one totally incapable of appreciating beauty, can show lofty and
noble traits of conscience.” Odibon’s statement about the artists is apt in
every sense. </p>

pictorial presentation is flat and thus it is not tactile. Painting does not contain
elevations and depressions which are called depth. “Mahaayana Sutralankara”
says, “<i>Chitre natonnatam nasti cha; Drisyate tha cha.” </i>There is no real
relief in a painting, and yet we behold it in the same. The Western artist,
through the technique of chiaroschro and perspective, has been able to create
an optical illusion of three-dimensional relief on a two-dimensional flat
surface. But the oriental painter has been content with his flat two-dimensional
depiction of objects, persons and places on the two-dimensional surface.
Formerly before the renaissance in Europe the entire European painting was done
in two-dimensional flat technique as their oriental brethren did in the east.
Byzantine painting has been one of the pre-renaissance flat paintings. The art
of painting is purely visual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sculpture is more virile than painting. Atmospheric effects could well be
brought out in painting, while they could not be in sculpture. Figure study
finds its finest medium in sculpture. North India has contributed the figure of
Dhyani Buddha in stone to world sculpture, while South India gave the figure of
Nataraja in bronze. The former is a static figure of serenity, solemnity and
equipoise, while the latter is a dynamic figure of vagrance, expression and

the arts; it is also the most elusive of arts. Music and dancing are twin-arts.
Music has its independent existence apart from dancing, while dancing cannot
exist devoid of music. The art of poetry is more comprehensive than all the
other arts. Pure music is made of sounds but general music is made of words
which display meaning. Poetry is a phase of music in one sense. Music is more
melodious than poetry and poetry is more semantic than music. It is said,
formerly poetry was meant for singing; later it was for reading and now poetry
is meant for thinking. But modern poetry is becoming non-semantic like pure
music as well as abstract painting. Archbald Macleish writes, “A poem should be
wordless as the flight of birds.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

dream of becoming a sculptor. So, the student went to a master painter and
requested him to accept him as his disciple, but the latter asked him whether
he knew the art of dancing. But the student confessed his ignorance. The
painter said that one should know the art of dancing in order to become a

postures one could not be able to depict them in painting. So the student was

humanity, this creative urge found expression through various media. The primitive
cave-man was by no means less interested in the creation of art than the modern
man. In those days of Stone Age, art was not for art’s sake; art was for
magic’s sake. Those primitive artists of remote yore were unable to create
realistic forms that represented the objects in the visual world. As their
spoken language was free from the restrictions of past, present and future tenses,
their art of painting too was free from the differences of perspective of the
foreground, middleground and background. Variations of planes were unknown to
them. Not only to them but even to the civilised painters of the orient, it was
not known. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

one side of the face would be visible and yet we know that there exists the
second eye on the other side of the face. In simultaneous presentation two eyes
are depicted on one side of the face in profile. This is the transcendence of

make copy of the visual appearances is not deemed as good art; it is called
imitation instead of creation. Imitation of the visual objects is re-creation

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is interesting to observe how in the early twentieth century many English
novelists and writers considered <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a good theme for their
works. Not all, however, were inspired by the same motives; there were some
authors like Kipling and Flora Annie Steele who drew on their own experiences
of the country and wrote novels which were thorough and meticulous studies of
the country, but were at the same time <span class=SpellE>coloured</span> with
their own personal views. In spite of their efforts one is aware all the time
of their superior attitude. Both these writers are extremely sympathetic and
understanding towards the Indian temperament and they try to fuse their own
views with that of the subject, and yet the Imperialistic views creep in. The
novels of both Kipling and Flora Annie Steele are based only upon their limited
experiences of the country in a special type of society. Their attitude is
again different from that of L. H. Myers who also wrote and published novels
with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as the subject. It is amazing how he could build up a vision of the country,
not from his personal experiences as he had never been to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> but on
his vast reading and scholarship. E. M. Forster and J. R. <span class=SpellE>Ackerley</span>
have on the other hand a first-hand experience of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>. Though <i>A Passage to India
</i>is a very subtle and clever study of Anglo-Indian relations, Forster makes
it very clear that “<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a spirit and all those who want to understand her must regard her
spiritually.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the writers who have been mentioned are well known authors, but very few would
have heard of Philip <span class=SpellE>Steegman’s</span> book <i>Indian <span
class=GramE>Ink</span>. </i>Nothing is known of this author’s life beyond the
fact that he was born in the year 1903, and that he is an English portrait
painter. This book seems to be his first attempt at writing; and since its
publication in 1939 he has not written any other book. He cannot be considered
as an outstanding author, but the work is interesting as it deals with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
presents a very sensitive and picturesque view of the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>country.
Many writers have been interested in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, not necessarily </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>because
of what it can offer with its variety, depth of knowledge and natural beauty,
but for the mere sake of curiosity in a life that is so different from their
own. Philip <span class=SpellE>Steegman</span> is least concerned with any
imperialistic and political view of the country. His view is the painter’s
view, the sensitive and artistic attitude that can discover beauty in every
nook and corner of life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book can be considered as a travelogue or a journal of his experiences in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. His description of the
country is interesting enough, but what is more unique is his point of view and
his attitude which is so different from other English authors who have written
on the same theme. In his foreword to the book, Hugh Walpole is very
appreciative of this artistic attitude and he explains it as an attempt on the
part of the author to show that “there is life behind the life, a world within
a world.”<sup>1</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but behind all this is the essential beauty of the Indian spirit, and Philip <span
class=SpellE>Steegman</span> understands this quality and he tries to bring it
out in his book. The sense of disillusion that had come over him in the highly
artificial social life of the West gives place to a sense of beauty and peace
after his experiences in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
narrative starts with the author going to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in search of patrons for his
art. So far as his knowledge of the country was concerned, he knew nothing
beyond the fact that ‘it was a pleasant country for administrators,
missionaries, soldiers, sportsmen and businessmen. That it was V-shaped <span
class=SpellE>coloured</span> pink in the map and therefore belonged to us.”<sup>
2</sup> As he is going with a very open mind, the moment he reaches <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> his whole attitude
towards the country starts changing. He meets various types of people in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> and he takes as
instinctive dislike to the Europeans who look down upon the Indians. He is
fascinated with the Indians on the other hand, because they may not know much
about every day affairs, but they knew far more about those things of which we,
in all the arrogance of our blind faith in our own age, have lost the meaning.”<sup>
3</sup> Bombay and its artificial club life does not produce a very <span
class=SpellE>favourable</span> impression on </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>him, and though
his European friends label him as an eccentric </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and queer, he
feels much more at home with the Indians than with the snobbish Europeans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<st1:City w:st="on">Bombay</st1:City> he goes to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> and he is absolutely charmed by this
city and its sharp contrasts. He comes to consider <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City> as an embodiment of the beauty and the
meaning of the East. “The romance of the East does not have to be courted. It
comes easily and unexpectedly to the passive <span class=SpellE>traveller</span>,
for violent contrasts are always at hand. Even the seven-mile drive from my
hotel in old <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
to the new Imperial city was a perpetual thrill of contrasts.”<sup> 4</sup>
Even in Delhi he is constantly ridiculed and criticized by his English friends,
because he is mostly found in the company of Indians and acquires ‘disgusting
native habits like chewing pan’. The teeming humanity of <st1:City w:st="on">Delhi</st1:City>
provides him with ample subjects for his canvas, and the lives of Indians
appear more interesting and appealing than those of Europeans in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> who only
know how to cling to false values and <span class=SpellE>prestiges</span>. The
painter is apparent in every line that he writes; the sensitiveness of the
artist is unmistakable in lines like these. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

face in a crowd when eyes meet and linger for a second, which invoke free play

most memorable event in his stay at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>
was his encounter with a <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span>. He realizes that
there is an unknown quality in life which science and reason cannot explain; he
also understands that it is much better to accept than to argue. He had made
plans with one of his English friends to visit the <span class=SpellE>Taj</span>
<span class=SpellE>Mahal</span> by car, and he meets a <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span>
who is held in great esteem by one of his Indian friends. The <span
class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> warns him not to go that night as it would be fatal
to him. His Indian friends counsel him not to argue but to obey the <span
class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> as he is gifted with what they called “inner-vision.”
The <span class=SpellE>Sadhu’s</span> physical presence is revolting to him as
his whole body is affected with leprosy, but reluctantly he agrees not to go on
the journey. His English friend, however, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>goes ahead alone to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Agra</st1:place></st1:City> and on his way back
is involved in a car accident and is killed. His other English friends consider
this </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>accident as a mere coincidence, but for the author this is a
revelation that there might be forces behind life of which we are not aware. On
the last occasion of their meeting, the <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> had <span
class=GramE>Said</span> they will meet again after eight months, three weeks
and two days, but the author does not attach any importance to this prediction
but forgets all about it in the excitement of his journey from <st1:City w:st="on">Delhi</st1:City>
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City> and
subsequently to many native States where he painted many portraits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had always been attracted to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
its history and natural beauty. After an extensive tour of South India he
finally manages to go to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The description he gives of <span class=SpellE>Khatmandu</span> is one of the
most gorgeous spectacles. For him the sheer beauty of this scene with the <st1:place
w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place> in the background appears like a mystic vision.
He says “High up above the opposite slopes and moving to the right and left as
far as I could see, a huge gleaming, white mass of snow and ice surged up and
hovered in the air like a crescent of ghostly square-rigged ships hiding the
sky with their white sails filled with the breath of the gods and their decks
awash with the spray of all my hopes. No face, no figure that I have ever seen,
no moment of passion and no echo of a dream I have ever known could dim the
faultless <span class=SpellE>lustre</span> of that vision and when all is done
with me, when life has nothing more to give me nor I to give to life, a few
specks of spray perhaps, will prink my eyes before they shut and I shall know

The author makes it very clear that it is beauty alone that matters in life and
that it is a manifestation of the divine, the unknown and the mysterious. It is
the impact of beauty on the senses of an individual that awakens him to the
sense of life. This feeling had always been with him but had grown stronger
during his stay in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
One incident, however, makes him believe fully in the unknown and mysterious
quality behind life. On his way to the temple of <span class=SpellE>Shambhunath</span>,
he meets a <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> who is absolutely emaciated and
unrecognizable and it is only from the bright look in his eyes that he suddenly
recognizes him as the same <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> he had met in his
friend’s house at Delhi; a rapid calculation of the dates shows it is exactly
eight months, three weeks and two days since he had last seen him. His mind is
full of doubts and questions, but the words of his Indian friend came to his
mind and he thinks it best not to question but to accept the fact that “Strange
men and minds meet in the <st1:place w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place>.” He
understands that explanations and clarifications are unnecessary and futile.
Many things have to be understood through the feelings and responses and it is
that things had increased the intensity of the individual character. He tries
to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mystery

vision is there in his mind only for a moment and he comes back to the material
world with the realization that one cannot always live in the spiritual world,
but must also learn to live a full material life. If only the West can learn to
approach the East with the eyes of an artist, materially dispassionate, but
hungry for spiritual knowledge, there will be a great bond of amity and
friendship. The author shows in this book how he was spiritually richer after
his experience in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<span class=SpellE>Steegman</span> is not a popular writer. Evidently he was
not a best seller. He can be interesting to only those readers who are well
acquainted and familiar with the scenes he describes. Besides, he makes very
little use of the devices generally used by writers about India–snakes,
rope-trick and dancing girls; the elephant, the Rajahs and <span class=SpellE>Sadhus</span>
are there, but these are inevitable as they form an essential part of his
experiences in the country. To the reader who is not familiar with India, his
descriptions will appear to be lengthy and exaggerated. There was a <span
class=SpellE>favourable</span> review of this book in <i>The Fortnightly Review
</i>of June 1939, but even there his experiences are referred to as “amusing if
slightly superficial, a series of filmy, shadowy and flitting impressions.” For
an Indian, however, they are the familiar scenes, presented in the vivid
language of an artist who deals with real <span class=SpellE>colours</span> in
life. He is very honest about his views and there is no trace at all in his
language of any pomposity <span class=SpellE>cliches</span> and superfluous
words. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book is mainly the account of a personal experience, not only of travel in
India, but a pilgrimage of the soul; how from a mood of disillusion he attained
an attitude of peace and serenity by the effect of beauty on his life. Though
the author refers to many characters not one is given any importance or a
prominent place; even the <span class=SpellE>Sadhu</span> who plays such an
important part in the author’s spiritual development, is not elaborately
described; we are aware only of one character, the author, through whose vision
we see the other characters. There seems to be a deep underlying meaning in the
book, it seems as if the only solution for frustration and defeat in life is a
belief in the spiritual values and a response to beauty in nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

distaste and ridicule. For <span class=SpellE>Steegman</span> India was a
rewarding experience. It is not as if he closes his<i> </i>eyes to the defects
and ugliness. However filthy and dirty the Ganges might be, there is that
indescribable quality in her which makes her holy to the Indians. Instead of
sneering at the beliefs and the traditions of the Hindus, he perceives an inner
meaning behind them. Thus he says: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

probably life is all the more meaningful and livable because of these elements.
If everything could be understood by the yard-stick of reason and science, then
the mere beauty and charm of existence would be lost. He has the open mind of
an artist willing to perceive beauty wherever it can be found. It is in this
sense that though the author is obscure his work is unique and worth studying.
It is the sensibility of the artist that makes the book different from other
books on the same subject. Hugh Walpole in his foreword to the book has pointed
out this quality and the artistic of the writer. He says: </p>

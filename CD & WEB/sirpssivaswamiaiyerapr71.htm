the stalwarts of the Indian political scene in South India in the earlier
decades of the century was the great P. S. Sivaswami Aiyer, the subject of this
short biography by Sri K. Chandrasekharan. Sivaswami Aiyer was a legal luminary
in the high tradition of Sir Muthusami Aiyer. Sir V. Bhashyam Iyengar and Sir
S. Subrahmanya Aiyer. (He became a “Sir” himself in later years.) Unlike these
illustrious predecessors, however, he and his personal friend and fellow
advocate, V. Krishnaswami Aiyer, added to their importance by active
participation in public affairs. Krishnaswami Aiyer achieved more spectacular
distinction than Sivaswami Aiyer but died too soon. Sivaswami Aiyer lived much
longer and worked till almost the end for the great causes which had received
his earnest devotion in the heyday of his powers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
is difficult for this generation of our people to realise the atmosphere of the
times in which Sivaswami Aiyer and his fellow patriots worked. An earlier
generation had accepted alien rule as a state ordained by Providence. Sivaswami
Aiyer belonged to the next generation which wished the foreign ruler to
understand that the Indian intelligentia should be received as partners in the
service of the country. This generation believed that persuasion and argument
would yield the result that it had in view. It was patriotism of this kind that
inspired the Indian National Congress in the earlier years. A later generation
and a few men like Tilak even of this generation felt that this was mere
mendicancy. Indians, they thought, should fight for their rights. Sivaswami
Aiyer and his type came out of the Congress when the extremists led by Tilak
gained prominence in the organisation to form themselves into a separate party.
This was the Liberal party counting among its shining figures V. S. Srinivasa
Sastry, disciple of Gokhale, and later President of the Servants of India
Society, Poona. The opponents of the Liberals, and the alien Government
possibly, called these people Moderates. The word when used by the “extremists”
had no doubt an overtone of a little malice and a little contempt. That is
inevitable in politics. Gandhiji came on the scene about this time and the
civil disobedience which he adopted as the weapon <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>to<i> </i></span>fight the foreign ruler led on to the claim for Purna
Swaraj made later by his disciple and successor Jawaharlal Nehru. The Moderates
now became even more moderate and looked almost like supporters of alien rule.
That this was not the case appeared clearly when P. S. Sivaswami Aiyer
condemned the Jalianwala Bagh massacre and described the Simon Commission’s
report as intended to make India “safe for British Imperialism”. Sri Srinivasa
Sastry spoke in righteous indignation of an unfair settlement of the problem of
Indians in Kenya and said that “The Indian people are no longer equal partners
in the British Empire but unredeemed helots in a Boer Empire.” But statements
in this sense were rare and the Liberal politicians continued to co-operate
with the Government of India hoping for better days. They feared the liability
of violence implicit in disobedience of the laws however civil in intent and
the danger of Chous if England should quit India as demanded by the Congress
under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Aiyer was a Moderate by temperament and conviction. He did <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>not<i> </i></span>accept the Mahatma-ship of
Gandhiji and showed this by referring to him always as Mr. Gandhi. He disliked
the idea of India becoming independent of Britain because he feared that she
would not be able to defend, herself from inimical neighbours. He predicted
that the civil disobedience movement would result in making it a habit to break
laws. He held on to his faith to the end and served the country loyally in his
own way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in his own way he was a great man appears <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>from<i> </i></span>this biography. He was a most successful
practitioner of the law. He became Government’s Advocate-General for one term.
He was offered a judgeship of the High Court but refused the place. It would
bring prestige but he would lose his large income; he needed the income. He
became a member of the Governor’s Executive Council in 1912 and created a great
impression of capacity and fairness in the minds of those who knew his work. He
became Vice-Chancellor of the Madras University, and later of the Benares Hindu
University, a member of the Imperial Legislative Assembly under the reforms of
1920, and a member of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1922. He worked
on various Commissions of the Government and was noted as contributing on every
occasion views born of sound and deep thinking and a true love of our country
and our culture. He made a special study of the problems connected with the
country’s defence and became an authority on the subject. This record of public
life was one of which any one could be justly proud. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this was not all. Sivaswami Aiyer’s personal life would seem to have been
equally great and even more beautiful. It was in the main a simple and
unostentatious life. It followed the good principles prescribed by tradition
meticulously. The simplicity went so far that Sivaswami Aiyer was accused by
some people of parsimony. Perhaps he was parsimonious in small things. He saved
all he could in this way and founded schools and charities and made monthly
payments to a number of helpless people ranging up to a hundred rupees per
person. Altogether the man was a type by himself and the type was rare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Aiyer’s physical presence matched his intellectual eminence. I have heard that
when he became Chairman of a Board or Court of the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore, it was found that the chair that his predecessor had used with
comfort was not big enough for him. They had to get a new chair made. He
dressed neatly and produced an excellent impression even at first sight. He
read widely and was up-to-date in all modern knowledge. He loved art. He was
devout and was specially attached to the <i>Bhagavata Purana. </i>He was very
particular that “Aiyer” in his name should have ‘er’ and not ‘ar’: a detail
carefully noted by Sri Chandrasekharan as indicating character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book by Sri Chandrasekharan is an excellent piece of writing and is very
pleasant reading. One may wish a word omitted here and another altered there,
and an occasional sentence rewritten, but as a whole the writing is beautiful
and the material well-marshalled. It gives a very good picture of the great
man. It sets out to describe and that, in a biography, is a cardinal virtue.
Not the least beautiful part of the book is the preface in which
Chandrasekharan states in touching words his qualifications for writing about
his hero: Sivaswami Aiyer compelled love and respect by his qualities and
achievement but had for our author the additional claims of having been his
father’s close personal friend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

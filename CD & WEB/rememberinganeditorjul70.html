the present writer, then in his early youth, sent his first contribution–translation
of a Bengali folk-song–to <i>Triveni, </i>he did not much hope for its
publication. <span class=GramE>Yet published it was and the editor used a line
from the song–“I do not see the end of the river” –to underline the
difficulties he was then experiencing.</span> So doing <span class=GramE>he</span>
not only admitted an unknown, obscure, young writer from a distant part of the
country into the <i>Triveni </i>brotherhood, but he established communion with
the world of ideas prevalent in folk life in a distant part of the country. If
this was not work for national integration, one would wonder what else such
work could be. It was all the more real because absolutely spontaneous–not
planned or loudly proclaimed. It was work from the roots and absorbing the
fundamentals of national life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

were the thoughts that arose in my mind as I read in the papers on May 21,
1970; the news of the passing of <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> K.
Ramakotiswara Rau and also the news that <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> <span
class=SpellE>Brahmananda</span> Reddy had described the illustrious deceased as
a “Rare kind of editor”. That remark from the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
was not difficult to understand. <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> Ramakotiswara
Rau was in the grand line of the great political and journalist thinkers who
had dedicated their lives to the building up of a new <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He was
thus far distant from and above the political and journalist workers of the
present day who are constantly getting lost in the mess of perversities and
uncertainties–if also duplicities–caused by trivial, temporary controversies.
Perhaps they cannot help that: they have their problems to face. Yet it should
be expected of them not only always to remember the broad national perspective
but to relate every matter to the task of building up Free India in the grand
tradition of old. However, that is a digression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
prominent feature of <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> Ramakotiswara Rau’s
editorial approach, so far as it lay within my experience to understand, was
that he left contributions sent to him, generally untouched. That showed his
respect for and confidence in his contributors. It was, I believe, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Pothan</span> Joseph who once said that editors had a habit of
displaying their superior wisdom by breaking up the structure of an article
into paragraphs with the help of the conjunction “However”. Let it be
acknowledged that the editor has not only the right to revise a piece of
writing: quite often it benefits by his intervention. But cases of
unintelligent intervention are also many. <span class=SpellE>Shri</span>
Ramakotiswara Rau was the kind of editor who depended upon the writer to
determine what to write and how to write it. I gratefully remember that none of
my contributions were refused publication though I feel in retrospect that some
of the scrappy things I <span class=GramE>produced,</span> might have been
reasonably rejected. Such was <span class=SpellE>Shri</span> Ramakotiswara Rau’s
rather unusual consideration for the writer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=SpellE>Shri</span> Ramakotiswara Rau built <i>Triveni </i>with such
co-operation as he spontaneously received, into a forum for acquaintance and
understanding between the constituents of the Indian nation. It <span
class=SpellE>behoves</span> us all who belong to the paper to maintain it as
such and to develop it further. Even at the risk of sounding expansive, I would
say that even that would not be enough. Those who have been initiated into the
spirit of <i>Triveni, </i>would look forward to the emergence of a band of
writers from all parts of the country who will pursue the task of making the
thoughts, feelings and experiences of their respective groups known to others
and of knowing others not merely as a part of their professional careers but in
a crusading spirit of revival of the urge that was among our forerunners, of
rebuilding and reawakening India to an equal place among the nations of the
world. Concomitant of this task would be active and organized efforts to
inspire and enable literary workers among the rising generation to pursue this
task as a national and personal duty. But then this is no hackneyed advice.
National life is now in doldrums and unless it can be brought again on an even
keel, we shall find ourselves up against regional, linguistic or communal
barriers and circumscribed within our narrow bounds. That will reduce our
usefulness, even harm us materially. The situation is more complicated by the
studied effort at downgrading the English language which has so long been the
ready medium of our mutual self-expression. It should be worthwhile for us now
to learn one or two regional languages in addition to our own and attempt
direct introduction of ourselves there through. For, the essence of existence, <span
class=SpellE>Shri</span> Ramakotiswara Rau would have told us, lies in
communication: an incessant dialogue which removes uncertainties, solves
perplexities, clears obscurities and ushers us into the bliss of an enlarged
life. Without joining life to life, said Tagore, even an offering of songs is
in vain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

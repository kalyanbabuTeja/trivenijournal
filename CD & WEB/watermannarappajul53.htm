a <i>taluk </i>headquarters town in Vijayapuram district, was only a big
village. Though removed from the railway station by some twenty miles, it was
removed from civilisation by hundreds of miles. A court and some offices are
there with some officials and graduates who made their living; they are islands
surrounded by a sea of ignorance. Latterly a few buses ply to this village, and
sound their horns announcing reformed life. In the wake of buses have sprung up
some tea-shops and cigarette booths, catering to different communities, and
providing the amenities of civilised existence. One of these shops is dedicated
to the Radio goddess, and invites people to see and hear her. But the life of
the people continues as a stagnant pool. If there should be any new ideas, it
is like disturbing the stagnant water,–they are like garbage washed to the

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In such a village was a lawyer of the name of
Bhagavantha Rao; Waterman Narappa arrived into his house. Naturally this raises
the question whence he came: and indeed Narappa’s advent was something that
attracted notice. Bhagavanta Rao was a noted lawyer, and his constant visits to
villages had spread his fame far and wide. In any big criminal case he was
certain to be the Defence Counsel. Those who were accused of murder took refuge
in him hoping to be acquitted by his forensic skill, for he was so keen in
argument and so fluent. Once he went to a village in connection with a murder
case. The Headman of the village had made elaborate arrangements for his dinner
and stay. But no cook was available. There was none to be found among the
Brahmins of the place. Bhagavanta Rao was camping then for four or five days.
Just about that time Narappa came to the village to call upon the Headman. He
was not a professional cook or water-carrier but was handy at all jobs at a
pinch. He readily agreed to go to the rescue of his life-long friend, the
Headman. The question of dignity or prestige never once crossed his mind. The
lawyer was greatly pleased with his efficient services. His preparations were
delicious and the lawyer even acknowledged that his success in argument before
the presiding Magistrate was indeed the result of the tasty <i>rasam </i>Narappa
had served him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
night he was taking rest about 10 o’ clock at night quite tired after a day’s
hard intellectual work. His work in the village was over and he proposed to
return to Muddabbehalli the next day. He was reclining on an easy chair with
legs out-stretched before the village <i>chavadi. </i>It was a bright moonlit
night. Suddenly a bright idea struck Bhagavanta Rao, and looking at the Headman
who was sitting near, he said: “Look here, we shall have Parched Rice and Curds
tonight. Send for four or five pots of curds.” The Headman heartily welcomed
this chance of arranging a farewell dinner as suggested. But soon a shadow
passed over his face as it was doubtful if he could secure curds so late at
night. Immediately servants were sent round, but, as ill-luck would have it, no
curd pots were available. Only an old woman had two pots in her keeping–it was
found after some investigation and research. The village Headman went to the
old woman himself but she would not part with the curds. She said that they had
to be delivered to someone the next day and in any case she was not going to
open a curd pot on a Monday. The real reason must have been that she feared she
would get nothing in return from the Headman. The Headman returned
disappointed. The lawyer awaiting the Headman’s return had dozed off to sleep
on the easy chair and probably had dreams of Parched Rice and Curds! Narappa
who was silent all this while broke in: “You wait; I shall bring the pots from
the woman,” and taking a couple of rupees from the lawyer’s clerk went to the
same old woman. He did not at first refer to object of his visit. He spoke of
himself as an astrologer, hinted at the birth of a grandson to the old woman
and thus insinuated himself into her favour. The old woman was charmed with his
talk, bristling as it was with proverbs and wise sayings and looked upon him as
almost a godly personage. After talking of this and that, he said, “You see,
revered lady, you have always curd pots though they may be scarce in other
houses.” “Yes, I have two, sir” owned the old woman. “Then please give them to
me,” said he, and with this he took out the two rupees tucked in the cloth
round his waist, and jingled them on the floor. The old woman’s mouth watered
at the sight of the coins. “But today is Monday, sir,” she groused. Narappa led
the old woman, outside the hut, showed her the full moon in the sky and said,
“Look,’ Monday is past and Tuesday has come. It is past mid-night. Take my
word, old woman, I am an astrologer.” And thus Narappa wheedled the two curd
pots out of the old dame and carrying them on both his shoulders, stalked back
to the <i>chavadi, </i>like Maruti carrying Rama and Lakshmana. The lawyer, who
had just got out of his doze, and the Headman who was eagerly expecting him,
were both greatly surprised at his success. It need hardly be mentioned that
the further programme of Parched Rice and Curds was successfully gone through.
Next morning when Bhagavanta Rao was leaving the village, he invited Narappa,
“Narappa, go with me, and stay in my house.” Somehow Narappa was tired of his
own village and he felt that the lawyer would be of help to him. So Narappa
readily fell in with the proposal and after a few days went and settled down in
Bhagavanta Rao’s house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
arrival of Narappa brought great relief to Bhagavanta Rao in many ways.
Muddabbehalli was notorious for its water scarcity. The wells of the village
were mostly situated on its outskirts and people had to undertake long pilgrimages
(as to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tirupati) to fetch water. If there was
sufficient rain the tank would, fill and the wells too would get their supply
of water. But </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>if the rains failed, it was a different story.
Instead of water one found frogs and crabs in the wells. In the past, they say,
the village, was well stocked with water as in the Malnad regions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But water seems to have become scarce with
the advent of modern people. And so it was a common sight to see ladies from
all households, high and low, the lawyer’s as well as his clerk’s, undertaking
their daily trek to distant wells. As Bhagavanta Rao prospered in his
profession, he arranged for his supply of water through professional water-
carriers. But still the ladies of the household were not entirely exempt from the
drudgery. After Narappa came, he fetched all the water himself without allowing
any one else to take any trouble in the matter. Moreover Bhagavanta Rao had
married a second time only two years previously, and he was loth to expose his
charming wife to this sordid task. His elder sister was a widow, and had been
living for a long time past in his household. She was attending to kitchen work
with the help of the new daughter-in-law. So Narappa became merely Waterman
Narappa! Bhagavanta Rao had two children by his first wife–a boy four years old
and a girl of two. He had employed the services of a person only to look after
them and play with them. He felt that his second wife might not take so kindly
to his first wife’s children. But somehow he had persuaded himself that a man
employed on a salary would take adequate care of them. As time passed, he
realised that this was a vain expectation. The man employed by Bhagavahta Rao
was just doing mercenary work. But the atmosphere changed with the advent of
Narappa into the household. The children took to him very affectionately and
would not be separated from him. As soon as Narappa’s daily task of fetching
water was done, he spent his time with the children, playing, talking, and
sightseeing in their company. They were very fond of his interesting talk and
fine story-telling. And Bhagavanta Rao’s second wife Susheela Bai, who had
entered the house with apprehensions because of the presence of step-children,
was gratified by the ways and demeanour of Narappa, and his cheerful, humourous
manner lightened her life. Thus Narappa became a favourite of all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looked a happy soul and a fine jolly fellow. But this was only on the surface.
Whoever suspected the thousand torments that troubled his inner life! Only some
features of his daily life caused some surprise to the people in the house. As
soon as he got up in the early morning he would go round the Tulasi plant
muttering some prayers. He had installed an image of Maruti <sup>1</sup> in
front of the Brindavana. He would sit in front of the image offering prayers,
slap his cheeks by way of repentance, and offer devout prostrations to the
image. Often he was heard giving vent to heavy sighs. After a cup of tea, he
wou1d smoke a country cigar, and get ready for his task of carrying water from
the well. He was lank and thin of build but his limbs were firm and pliant like
stalks of bamboo. It was a sight to see him hurrying back with a springing gait
from the well carrying two pots of water. His body was dark of complexion and
his face was a shade darker still, sunburnt by the tropical sun of the plains.
And excessive smoking had rendered his lips particularly black. Only when he
laughed and made others laugh, his shining rows of white teeth betokened his
purity and character. Later, he wore a woollen piece of cloth and brought a few
pots for the use of those who observed ceremonial purity. All this would be
over by noon. And then he would have his cold water bath at a well, and, with
his clothes dripping with water, he would visit the temple of Hanuman in front
of the village, pour a pot of water on the image, go round the temple, offer
prostrations and return to the house in the blazing sun. By that time
Bhagavanta Rao would have had his dinner and gone to the court. Every day he
had his food along with the ladies of the house–a late and cold meal. The
lawyer had often remonstrated with him, out of sincere affection, to have his
food earlier. He told him sternly to finish his ablutions and worship, earlier
and join him at dinner. But to no purpose. Narappa’s was an iron will and his
observances were inflexible. One day, returning from the Hanuman temple with
bare feet and parched with thirst, he leaned against a wall and sank down.
Susheela Bai who was seeing this felt greatly sad. Half in fun, and half in
sorrow, she said to him: “Look here, Narappa, you go to the Hanuman temple
every day without fail and pour water on Hanuman But what has he given you in
return?” Narappa was roused by these words and he spoke with some warmth, “What
you say, madam, is not untrue. I wash him every day with water. He has not
softened towards me. He is a piece of stone and I am another. But, see, we must
suffer our Fate. Has not the saint sung– <o:p></o:p></span></p>

used to have a nap for about an hour after dinner. After a wash, he would take
out the bundle containing his old papers, documents and song books, and pore
over them. His brother had wasted the ancestral property. A few good bits of
land which had been mortgaged were likely to come back to his possession. He
had begged Bhagavanta Rao to help him secure these properties, and the lawyer
had said, “Let us see.” If he could get this much of help in return for all his
services, he considered himself well-rewarded, and lived in that hope. Towards
evening, clients returning from the court or other friends would gather in
front of Bhagavanta Rao’s house. After taking his tea, Narappa would sit with
the children and entertain them with his endless stories and encyclopaedic
talk. He had perhaps read up only to three or four primary classes in the
villages school, but the traditional idiom of the Kannada language was at his
command and flowed from his lips like a perennial current. His humour was
remarkable. He had suffered his fill of disappointment and sorrow, and had
acquired the art of glossing them over with a veneer of humour. It was not the
profound realisation of Vedantic truths: it was merely an intellectual reaction
to the ironies of Fate of which he had been a victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

kinds of people made up to him and engaged him in talk. Ningappa was among those
who got into his company. Ningappa was fond of litigation in courts and, though
he lost his lands as a result of it, his fondness for courts had not left him.
Narappa knew all about him. Once Ningappa asked him, “Narappa, I am wondering
when I shall get back my fortune.” “Shall I tell you when?” replied Narappa
laughing. “This sun must rise in the West and set in the East: the stream in
front<i> </i>of your village must turn back its course. Then you shall regain
your fortune. Even the Bombay High Court Judge cannot rub off the line of Fate
engraved on your forehead. You have heard the story of Kunti’s sons, haven’t
you? It is like that. Somehow, anyhow, Kunti’s sons shall not have their
kingdom, as the saying goes. It is the same with us. Who owns anything forever
on this earth, Ningappa? You gain a span and lose a yard–all gone to the dust.”
Ningappa was gaping with wonder at this torrent of words. Still he would not
give up expressing his optimism. “But, Narappa, our village astrologer is a
knowing man. He also said that my lands would be redeemed and come back to me
by the New Year’s Day. Then we shall raise crops and you must come to partake
of the produce.” Narappa could not restrain his laughter. ‘O, yes. It is by
eating such produce that I have been reduced to this condition. Isn’t it like
carrying bags to fetch the grain seen in a dream? Dear fellow, please bid
good-bye to the courts, and start on a pilgrimage. Go to Srisaila.” In this way
Narappa’s discourse, with humourous thrusts, flowed on; and Ningappa continued
to watch with open mouth and wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was frequented by many people. More than his recipes, his wise and humourous
talk helped in effecting many cures. Once a lad about 20 years old who had been
stung by a scorpion came howling with pain. Narappa could not help laughing on
seeing him. He performed his incantations, spat on one side, pinched the boy
hard and asked him, “Has the pain decreased?” “O God, it is burning; the pain

treks to fetch water became less frequent in the evenings. He brought just four<i>

usually spent in lonely walks to the neighbouring village. A mile from
Muddabbehalli, near the village of Muddanahalli, there is a field. It is
surrounded by trees. It appears a devotee had a dream that Good Venkateswara of
Tirupati was hidden in the rock. Since then worship was being offered to that
stone. Some devotees had put up a platform there. There Narappa used to go and
sit in peace. He used to offer his prayers to God Venkateswara for happiness
and peace in life. One evening, as the sun was setting, its golden rays
suffused the whole land as if a light yellow cloth had been spread over the
earth. The leaves were fluttering and dancing in the gentle breeze. Just then a
young husband and wife, with their child, from Muddanahalli came to offer their
worship to Lord Venkatesa. They offered their prayer for the granting of their
cherished desires. They took some of the ash and charcoal bits lying about and
smeared it on their faces and the child’s and went back satisfied and happy.
Narappa was watching the scene from his seat; but he was so demure and glum
that they did not feel like engaging him in conversation. After going a few
paces, the wife asked, “Who was that?” “Well, who knows answered the husband,
“maybe a Sanyasi.” Narappa overheard this conversation. He was touched to the
quick. Controlling himself with some effort till the visitors reached a safe
distance, he jumped down and exclaimed, standing in front of the stone, “Yes I
am a Sanyasi–only, a Sanyasi with wife and children,” and he fell to sobbing
loudly. The picture of his family came vividly before his eyes. The wife whom
he did not want, the child who was blind, and his own miserable life made up
his family, and made his life an unending agony. He was enveloped in darkness.
He sighed heavily, then pulled himself together. Folding his hands in prayer
before Lord Venkatesa, “It is a dreary wilderness. But I have hardened myself.
Death is the end anyhow, and then, I shall have release,” he prayed. He then
trudged back to the village.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Narappa had grown to be a favourite in the village.
If anything impossible had to be done, Narappa could be depended upon to do it.
He became the trusted counsellor of Bhagavanta Rao, His first wife’s children
had grown on Narappa’s lap, and took more to him than to their step-mother.
Thus passed eight or ten years. Susheela became mother of a boy and a girl and
the children were growing. Somehow they did not take kindly to Narappa. But
Narappa was equally eager to play with all the children. Love of children was
part of his nature. But in spite of him, differences showed up. Susheela Bai
got the idea that he was fonder of her step-children than her own, which was
not true, but she didn’t give expression to it for fear of offending her
husband. The innocent children had, by their behaviour, only strengthened the
notion of Susheela Bai. Once Narappa went on a visit to his village after a
long interval. To the first wife’s children the home lost its charm in his
absence. They were remembering him at every turn. It happened that the boy took
ill with fever. Susheela Bai sat near him and did all she could to nurse him.
But he was not feeling comfortable and was calling for Narappa every now and
then. It was an unbearable situation <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>for
Susheela Bai. “Whatever I do, these children are not pleased,” She said with
tears in her eyes. “Why so?” asked Bhagavanta </span>Rao, “Why? Because of that
incarnation of your first wife whom you have brought into the house,” said
Susheela Bai in a moment of indiscretion. “Ah! Who may that be?” asked the
lawyer with some annoyance. “Who else, but Narappa, the dirty Narappa,”
answered the lady. The lawyer was deeply disturbed on hearing these words. He
hummed and hawed but didn’t know what to say. “One should not use these words
against such a person,” was all he said mildly. But the lady did not stop
there, “Well, what is past is past. All this is because you have admitted him
into the household. You have no idea of the differences created by him. Only
those who suffer can understand. I can swear by God that he has not so much as
touched any of my children,” proceeded Susheela Bai piping the usual tune of
the jealous second wife. The lawyer’s heart shook within him that the demon of
jealousy had entered his household. He uttered a few conventional words of
comfort, and removed himself from the place on the pretext of some business.</p>

returned from his village after four days. What he experienced in the village
had cast a gloom on him: his cheerfulness was gone. Still he tried to recapture
something of his buoyant temperament. He heard about the illness of the eldest
boy; but naturally he had no idea of other things that had happened. But
somehow he gradually realised there was a change in the demeanour of the lady
of the house. He didn’t however mind anything else and became absorbed in his
duties as usual. The lawyer’s daughter by his first wife was now fourteen; and
the problem of her marriage became a source of anxiety to her father. After a
prolonged search in many quarters, he at last decided on a match for his
daughter, the dowry to be paid being two thousand rupees. The boy was a B.A.
and had an income from his property of about a thousand a year. Narappa was as
pleased as Bhagavanta Rao at this choice. He was happy that the girl whom he
had brought up was going into a good household. He decided that the marriage
should be performed with all due grandeur and he assured the lawyer of his best
services to make the occasion a grand success. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
marriage was fixed to take place in the middle of May in the month of Vaisakha.
This was the first big celebration in the lawyer’s house and preparations for
it went on for two or three months. But the lawyer was filled with anxiety in
regard to one particular matter. The wells in the village were drying up. The
rains had failed this season. The village tank had breached and a great deal of
water had been lost. Everyone was afraid of water scarcity such as had not been
seen for ten or twelve years past. The girl had grown up, and putting off the
marriage was out of the question. And neither the lawyer nor his friends liked
the idea of having it celebrated in Tirupati or a far-off place quietly. If a
noted lawyer like Bhagavanta Rao did not celebrate his daughter’s marriage in
his own home-town, it would not redound to his glory. This social aspect of the
matter led to the decision that the marriage should be performed in the village
itself. One day the lawyer called Narappa into his room to take counsel with
him regarding the problem of water: Narappa also agreed that the marriage
should be performed in the village itself. “But how shall we provide for
water?” asked Bhagavanta Rao. “You leave that to me,” assured Narappa. “Anyhow
I have earned the name of Waterman Narappa. I shall see how much water there is
in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>me.” The lawyer felt encouraged by this assurance. He knew well
the capabilities of Narappa. So he said, “All right” without </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>further
thought. Somehow, Susheela Bai came to know what had passed between her husband
and Narappa. That very night she put the other side of the case before her
husband in the privacy of their room. “What does that Narappa brag about? There
is not a drop of water in any village well. What is there for him to draw?
One’s eyes are filled with water before one can get enough water for one’s
daily needs.” “But,” said the lawyer, “don’t you know the prowess of Narappa?”
“O, Yes, I know all about it. Drinking tea and smoking <i>beedies, </i>he has a
strong chest indeed. He gasps ten times before bringing home a pot of water.
You don’t understand these things. Later we shall be exposed to disgrace in the
public eye,” said the lady. “Then where do you think, we should celebrate the
marriage?” “Somewhere, say Yalagur, for instance, and have a quiet function.”
The lawyer was greatly disturbed in mind by this conversation. He thought there
was the malice of the<i> </i>step-mother behind all this. “Yes, yes, what
matters it to you where the marriage is celebrated?” said the lawyer with
undisguised disgust. And at this the lady wept and moistened all the sheets on
which she lay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had begun. Only fifteen days were left<i> </i>for the marriage. The friends and
relations of the lawyer began to arrive. The spacious residence of the lawyer
was crowded with women and children, like a motor lorry on the day of<i> </i>a
village fair. A thatched <i>pandal </i>was erected in front of the house and it
was being decorated like Indra’s Palace-hall. But the water situation grew
alarming day by day. There were queues of pots before every well in the
village. There was a small vessel or cup accompanying each pot. People kept
awake far into the night awaiting their turn. The placid life of the<i> </i>village
seemed to hum with activity on this account. Water provided the sole topic of
conversation. The summer was growing warmer but there was no indication of
rain. When the skies were overcast and streaks of lightning appeared, “Yes; it
may rain,” said the optimistic lawyer. But the lightning was like a mocking
smile. “What shall we do? If there is no water at all, how indeed can you fetch
any,” said Bhagavanta Rao in anxious tones to Narappa eight days before the marriage.
“Don’t you worry, sir. Has not Sarvajna, the wise poet said, ‘The one who does
things without talk follows the best way’?” The lawyer was obliged to be
silent. To the wise sayings quoted by Narappa, what could indeed be added? But
he was at a loss to know what stunt this modern Sarvajna was up to in the
present crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

big well with plenty of water. It was by the roadside. This turned out to be
very convenient. Narappa secured four<i> </i>bullock carts and four pairs of
bullocks, enlisted the services of eight to ten boys who used to carry water
for the villagers, and, equipped with huge metallic pots, put them into the
carts, went to the well at 4 A.M. and returned with the rattling and gurgling
noise of water pots by 8 A.M. to the village. There were still two<i> </i>days
for the marriage. The previous night Bhagavanta Rao went to bed and the
nightmare of water-scarcity oppressed him. Waking up next morning, behold!
there was water and any amount of it in the house. He was astonished said,
“Bravo! Narappa!” “Nobody should waste water. Every one should realise what it
means to Narappa to fetch all this water,” mildly appealed Bhagavanta Rao to
every one in the house. “No, no,” rejoined Narappa, “No one should think of my
trouble. This is a marriage house. Let everyone spill as much water as he or
she chooses. I shall replenish all you need,” said Narappa like one inspired.
It filled everyone with admiration for his prowess. In this drama of the
marriage celebration, Narappa was the hero, and he became the centre of
admiration by his extraordinary capacity for work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

month went by after the marriage; and the feast usually held to mark the end of
the month was also celebrated. By that time the rains had come and the wells
were supplied with water. Narappa’s burden was somewhat lightened. The marriage
<i>pandal </i>was removed; the festoons of green mango leaves, which lent
colour and grace to the auspicious occasion were now withered and dried up and
consigned to the dung-heap. After the month’s celebrations, there was an
unexpected incident. The gold necklace of Susheela Bai was missing. On the day
of the feast numerous persons, including strangers, had assembled for dinner.
It seems Susheela Bai had worn the necklace on that day, and, after polishing
it, kept it on the platform in the worship-room in the evening and gone out as
someone called her. She forgot all about the necklace. Next day when she was
placing all the jewels and valuables back in her box, she noticed with a shock
that the necklace was missing. Immediately she ran to her husband and told him
about it. Everyone in the house carne to know about the loss. It was a valuable
jewel, eight to ten tolas in weight. Who could have taken it? was everybody’s
question. And then it was placed in the worship-room where servants or
strangers had no access! Everyone was trying to solve the problem of the
missing necklace. Suspicion moved and lighted for a moment on every possible
person. Narappa was also greatly worried when he heard about the loss. But in
his usual manner he consoled the lady “Why do you worry, madam? I shall trace
it for you; the master himself may have hidden it from you in a mood of fun.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

attempt to make Susheela Bai laugh did not succeed. Two or three days passed
but still there was no trace of the necklace. One day the master was seated at
dinner, Susheela Bai broached the topic. Narappa had gone to the Maruti temple
as was his daily custom. Susheela Bai seemed bent on bringing the matter to a
head. “I feel that someone who is well acquainted with the house has taken it,”
she insinuated. “Whom do you mean?” asked the lawyer. Instead of answering directly
she said, “The man who enjoys your utmost confidence.” “Ah, who may that be?”
asked the lawyer with some amount of warmth. “Who else?” rejoined the lady, and
just at this moment unfortunately Narappa returned home. Susheela Bai did not
notice this but went on. “Narappa, your trusted Narappa,” she said with some
scorn in her voice. These words fell on Narappa’s ears; he was startled and sat
up to listen. The lawyer was also dismayed. “What! You mean Narappa is the
thief? Your head has gone wrong,” said the lawyer raising his voice. Susheela
Bai with a tearful face persisted, “Yes, I am always wrong, but that day when I
left the necklace in the worship-room and left the place, Narappa was filling
the vessels with water in that very place.” She advanced this evidence with her
prejudiced mind. “Enough of your words,” said the lawyer with anger and went to
his room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gone to the backyard of the house. He was shocked and thunderstruck beyond
words. He was terribly pained that in this house they talked about him in this
manner. Later, he retired to his room, wrapped himself up and rested. The lady
sent word, through servants, calling him to dinner. He pleaded indisposition
and excused, himself. She misunderstood this rather seriously. “What need of
food for him after securing a precious necklace! Well, only we who talk about
it make fools of ourselves,” she groused. That night was indeed a night of
agony for Narappa. He could not get a wink of sleep. He was plunged in thought
and at last came to a serious decision. Morning dawned.” Narappa went to the
lawyer’s room and said abruptly, “Please give me leave.” Greatly surprised, the
lawyer asked, “Why? What for?” “I want to go,” replied Narappa. The lawyer
didn’t like the way things were developing, and made Narappa sit down and
talked over with him. Without assigning any definite reason, Narappa begged for
permission to leave. The lawyer obstinately refused to grant his request. Knowing
that Narappa’s reason for leaving might be that he was the victim of an
undeserved suspicion, the lawyer reassured him, “Don’t take these things so
seriously. I am here with you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Thus two or three days passed. Susheela Bai, with
conventional insincerity, asked him not to leave. But to Narappa a house that
he had looked upon as his own for the last twelve years, now seemed forbidding,
with people who scorned and suspected him. He could not bear the situation any
longer. He packed up his things, and went one morning to the lawyer’s room and
said to the master, “Don’t stop me any more; I am going with pleasure. I was
the child of your affection all these twelve years. That has been enough. As
Rama had his twelve years of forest life, I spent twelve years in your company,
that has been my good fortune.” Saying this, he offered his prostrations to the
lawyer and took his leave. The lawyer was visibly moved. Tears trickled down
from his eyes and he said in a husky voice, “Well, then, good-bye. I may
recover the necklace; but how shall I get one like you!”</p>

whom he had reared up and bade farewell to them. They sobbed at the separation.
Taking up his things he passed the front door. The neighbours who looked on
were greatly moved. One of them asked, “Where are you going” Narappa?” “Where
else? I am going to the place wherefrom I came. All things have sometime or
other to get back whence they came. If the village monkey strays into the town,
won’t it be beaten back with sticks?” And joking in this strain he went on his

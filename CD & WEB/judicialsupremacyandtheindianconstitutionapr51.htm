supremacy in a Constitution ensures to the citizens protection against both
executive as well as legislative tyranny. In the case of written Constitutions
in particular, with defined powers of the several governmental organs or with
defined powers of the different units of a composite or federal State, the
doctrine of judicial review secures the rule of law. Where the powers of a
legislature are limited, whether the limits relate to territorial jurisdiction
or to subject-matter, the validity of its acts can be scrutinised by the
tribunal before whom the question is raised, however supreme within its
appointed sphere the legislature may be. England and the United States of
America afford examples <i>par excellence </i>of the operation of the rule of
law in democratic Constitutions. The Indian Constitution has taken ideas from
the Constitutions of both these countries, the former of them being the
champion of Parliamentary supremacy and the latter the country where Judicial
supremacy is in full o</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

therefore be useful to inquire how far the provisions of the Indian
Constitution have ensured the rule of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness are the aims of all democratic
governments. But the concept of liberty has never been an absolute or constant.
It has stood related to time and place, environment and history. Among the
highly cherished liberties of the West are political and civil liberties.
Modern emphasis on economic rights, associating social welfare arrangements
with liberty, has pushed to the front a new concept of freedom. Individual
liberty is sought to be directly related to the status of the society. In
Soviet Russia, for instance, social and economic rights, such as right to work,
to leisure, to security in old age, etc., are considered to be more paramount
than political and civil rights. The essence of individual liberty is held to
consist in the citizen’s chance to grow and to rest on the freedom and
opportunity available to him to develop himself and obtain social recognition
in the process. It is felt that economic equality, in the sense of economic
opportunity, must precede the flowering of individual freedom. Governmental
guidance has been made compulsory and external restraints have been imposed on
citizens to achieve the object. The strictures of conformism will no doubt
affect creative effort. Since maximum attainment in any society turns on higher
creative activity of its individual members, it is essential that citizens
should have in a large measure genuine freedom from external restraints.
England and the United States had developed economic systems which had made
them prosperous and wealthy, and so, from early times, emphasis was placed on
sanctity of individual rights, and attempts were made to secure to the citizens
the largest possible amount of political freedom and the maximum of civil
liberties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is axiomatic that without an organised society there can be no safeguard of
individual rights. It is also true that in an organised society there can be no
absolute or unrestricted individual rights. It has been observed that “the
liberty of the individual to do as he pleases even in innocent matters is not
absolute. It must frequently yield to the common good”.<sup>1</sup> In the
words of Prof. Jaspar, ‘the genuinely human State achieved along with power a
simultaneous limitation of power, because it aims at rendering justice”. Civil
liberties imply the existence of an organised society maintaining public order
without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained
abuses.<sup>2</sup> Rule of law may be achieved through enlightened public
opinion, the moral value of traditions and intelligent political consciousness,
or by writing into the Constitution of certain rights as fundamental and
transcendent rights of the citizens. The former process operates in England. In
the United States, the latter device has been resorted to. It is true that
there is often the complaint that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Judiciary is everywhere the guardian of
individual rights. There is however a difference between England and the United
States in regard to the sphere within which it can play the role. In England,
the Constitution is unwritten. There is no code of fundamental rights. In the
words of Lord Wright: “In the Constitution of this country there are no
guaranteed or absolute rights. The safeguard of British liberty is in the good
sense of the people and in the system of representative and responsible
government which has been evolved.”<sup>3</sup> It is somewhat paradoxica1 that
England is the home both of the rule of law and the sovereignty of Parliament.
Parliament is omnipotent and omnicompetent. No Act of Parliament can be held to
be void by a court of law. Checks on Parliament have been dispensed with as not
being really wanted. In practice the pressure of public opinion has been a
sufficient safeguard against an abuse of its powers by Parliament. In the words
of Sir Erskine May: “The Constitution has assigned no limits to the authority
of Parliament over all matters and persons within its jurisdiction. A law may
be unjust and contrary to the principles of sound government. But Parliament is
not controlled in its discretion, and when it errs, its errors can be corrected
by itself.” There can thus be no judicial review of Parliamentary legislation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was not always so. During the Middle Ages municipal law was believed to derive
its efficacy from divine law. Absolute sovereignty of Parliament could not
therefore be formulated. It had in those times been admitted that an Act of
Parliament could not operate within the sphere of the Church. The limitation
proceeded on the analogy of the Church to a foreign sovereign State. Also the
idea of a fundamental law had appeared as early as 1578 and exercised influence
till about 1710 as a practical principle in the law courts. Both Crown and
Parliament were sought to be subjected to such a paramount law by Coke, and
some decisions applying the theory had held that legislative acts against
common right and reason and in contravention of fundamental law were of no validity.<sup>4</sup>
It was thus said: “Even an Act of Parliament made against natural equity as to
make a man judge in his own cause is void in itself; for <i>jura naturae sunt
immutabilia </i>and they are <i>leges legum.</i>”<sup>5</sup><i> </i>Chief
Justice Holt had regarded it as part of the Judge’s duty to “construe and
expound Acts of Parliament and adjudge them to be void.”<sup>6 </sup>Subsequent
events like the establishment of the Reformation Settlement and of new forms of
religion and changes in the succession to the Throne had proved that there were
no legal limitations on the powers of Parliament. The position was
authoritatively defined by Justice Willes as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“I
would observe as to these Acts of Parliament, that they are the law of this
land; and we do not sit here as a Court of Appeal from Parliament. It was once
said...that if an Act of Parliament were to create a man judge in his own
cause, the court might disregard it. That dictum, however, stands as a warning
rather than an authority to be followed. We sit here as servants of the Queen and
the Legislature. Are we to act as regents over what is done by Parliament with
the consent of the Queen, Lords and Commons? I deny that any such authority
exists. If an Act of Parliament has been obtained improperly, it is for the
Legislature to correct it by repealing it: but so long as it exists as law, the
Courts are bound to obey it. The proceedings here are judicial, not autocratic,
which they would be if we could make laws instead of administering them.”<sup>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Though the courts in England cannot question the
validity of Parliamentary legislation, they have yet power to examine the
validity of rules and bye-laws passed under the cloak of such legislation. They
can also examine the legality of the acts of municipal bodies and corporations
constituted under an Act of Parliament. Again real encroachment on the
liberties of people in an advanced democracy like England can only be through
acts of the Executive, and against this type of tyranny the courts function as
real bulwarks and give effective protection. Lord Atkin stated the principle
thus: “In accordance with British jurisprudence, no member of the Executive can
interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except on the
condition that he can support the legality of his action before a court of
justice. And it is the tradition of British justice that judges should not
shrink from deciding such issues in the face of the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>E</span>xecutive.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the United States of America, the Supreme Court has become “the balance wheel
of the Constitution.” The American Constitution was framed after a successful
revolution and on the then existing realities of state autonomy and individual
rights. It sought to provide against both executive as well as legislative
encroachments. In the words of a learned Judge: “It is not to be disguised that
the framers of the Constitution viewed with some apprehension, the violent acts
that might grow out of the feelings of the moment, and that the people of the
United States in adopting that instrument have manifested a determination to
shield themselves and their property from the effects of those sudden and
strong passions to which men are exposed.”<sup>9 </sup>The Constitution has
provided for a diffusion of sovereignty and for constitutional sanction being a
<i>sine qua non </i>for every act of the Government. The Constitution being
federal, it has distributed sovereignty by vesting the federal government with
certain enumerated powers leaving the residue to the state governments. It has
also provided for a separation of powers between the different organs of
government, at the same time guaranteeing individual rights in certain matters.
The Constitution so framed has through a combination of political usage and
judicial interpretation been made a flexible instrument. There is no specific
Article in the Constitution vesting jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to veto
an Act of the Congress as Unconstitutional. According to Chief Justice
Marshall, judicial supremacy flowed from the inner logic of the Constitution
and the special province of the Judiciary to declare what the law is.<sup>10</sup>
During the early days of its history, its main task was to reconcile national
authority with state sovereignty. Later on, it had to deal with what might be
called the basic problem of reconciling liberty with authority, and individual
freedom with national organisation. Article III (2) of the Constitution stated
that the Court shall decide “all cases arising under the Constitution”. Article
VI (2) laid down that “the Constitution and the laws of the United States made
in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land.” These two
provisions together formed the basis of the establishment of judicial
supremacy. The Court claimed thereunder the power to adjudge upon the
competency of legislation. Also the 5th Amendment to the Constitution directed
that no person was to be deprived of his life or liberty or property except by
due process of law. This was as regards the Union. The 14th Amendment gave the
same direction in regard to the States. The courts thereby came to examine laws
to satisfy themselves weather the laws offended the “spirit of the
Constitution” and declare them void if there was such violation. Laws thus came
to be scrutinised not merely as regards competency but as regards their
inherent goodness as well. Again, in the United States, no limitation had been
imposed upon any of the fundamental rights added to the Constitution by the
first ten Amendments made in 1791. These rights could be touched, if at all,
only by amending the Constitution. Again the 9th Amendment to the Constitution
had expressly provided: “The enumeration in this Constitution of certain rights
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained in the people.”
This meant that any legislation, though not affecting the enumerated fundamental
rights, may yet be declared void as being repugnant to the natural rights of
the people. Not even danger to the security of the State nor emergency would
justify the curtailment of such rights. It was, however, soon realised that for
maintenance of public order, prevention of corruption of public morals, etc.,
some limitations will of necessity have to be imposed on the liberty of the
individual. It was judicially recognised that such limitations could be imposed
by way of what were called “police powers” of the State. The doctrine was
rested on the principle that “the whole is greater than the sum total of all
the parts, and when the individual health, safety and welfare are sacrificed or
neglected the State shall suffer”<sup>11</sup> Under the guise of “police
powers” the State can regulate the exercise of individual rights in the
collective interest. The determination, however, by the Legislature that the
concerned matter fell within the scope of such powers is not conclusive. It is
the Court that should be so satisfied.<sup>12</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
interpretation of the American Constitution has been influenced in a measure by
what has been termed “the intentions of the people”. Importance is also
attached to legislative discussions, reports of Committees and other external
aids. The British practice is quite different. The courts will not look at the
preliminary discussions (called in the Continent <i>travaux preparatoires) </i>or
to the Parliamentary debates to elucidate the meaning.<sup>13</sup> Prof.
Frankfurter sums up the position thus in his book on the Supreme Court:
“Whereas British Courts approached the interpretation of the Constitution on
the principle that the Constitution must speak from within, the American Courts
have to a certain extent approached the problem from without.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Indian Constitution has striven to maintain a balance between individual rights
and collective interests. It has followed the American model in enunciating
certain rights as fundamental. The Preamble recites that it is the aim of the
Constitution to secure to all the citizens of India: Justice, social, economic
and political; Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
Equality of status and of opportunity, and to promote among them all Fraternity
assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the nation. Part III
sets out the fundamental rights. Article 13 (1) enacts that existing laws, in
so far as they are repugnant to the rights mentioned in Part III, are to that
extent void. Sub-clause (2) of the Article provides that no law can be made
hereafter which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III.
Article 32 provides for the right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate
proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III. Article
141 enjoins that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all
courts within the territory of India. All authorities, civil and judicial, are
directed by Article 144 to act in aid of the Supreme Court. There are in the
Indian Constitution no unenumerated or natural rights reserved in favour of the
citizens. Some of the rights set out in Part III arise in virtue of inhibitions
laid on the State, as for instance, in regard to discrimination. These
prohibitions are binding both on the Executive as well as the Legislature and
the court can declare void any law found to be in violation thereof. Certain
other rights such as the right to life and personal liberty are subject to
regulation by the Legislature. Article 21 enacts that no person shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure
established by law. In regard to rights like freedom of speech, both executive
as well as legislative authorities are permitted by Article 19 to impose
reasonable restrictions in the interests of the public. In every case it is an
abuse of the freedom conferred that is sought to be controlled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apart
from the vista thus opened for judicial review of acts of the Executive and
Legislature, there is the further fact that the Indian Constitution is of the
federal type, whether of the orthodox pattern or not. Consequently there is a
distribution of powers between the Union and the Units. There is a careful
enumeration of powers in 3 Legislative Lists. The first is the Union List with
97 items. The second is the State List with 66 items. The third is the
Concurrent List with 47 items Article 245 (1) provides that the legislative
powers set out are always subject to the provisions of the Constitution which
would, of course, include Part III dealing with fundamental rights. Under
Article 28 any matter not covered by any of the Legislative Lists is reserved
for the Union. Very often questions do arise as to which Legislature, the Union
Parliament or State Legislature, is seized of a particular subject of
legislation. The validity of legislation may fall to be examined by the courts
in that way as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is true that the Indian Constitution does not provide for individual rights
existing as natural rights, apart from the rights regarded as fundamental under
Part III. It is also true that unlike the American Constitution there is no
Article expressly vesting the judicial power of the Union of India in the
Supreme Court. At the same time it falls to be noted that, though many of the
principles of the English Parliamentary system have been adopted, the
Constitution has not accepted the principle of Parliamentary supremacy in
matters of legislation. Also, so far as Part III is concerned, it is the
American model that has been followed, and under Article 32 the Supreme Court
is made the guardian of the rights enunciated in that chapter. To that extent
the Constitution remains supreme. And as is made clear by Article 245, a
statute law to be valid must in all cases be in conformity with the
constitutional requirements and it is for the Judiciary to decide whether any
enactment is unconstitutional or not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Constitution, Kania. C. J. stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“There
is considerable authority for the statement that the courts are not at liberty
to declare an Act void because in their opinion it is opposed to a spirit
supposed to pervade the Constitution but not expressed in words...It is
difficult upon any general principles, to limit the omnipotence of the
sovereign legislative power by judicial interposition, except so far as the
express words of a written Constitution give that authority...It is only in
express constitutioual provisions limiting the legislative power, and
controlling the temporary will of a majority by a permanent and paramount law
settled by the deliberate wisdom of the nation, that one can find a safe and
solid ground for the authority of courts of justice to declare void any
legislative enactment. Any assumption of authority beyond this would be to
place in the hands of the Judiciary, powers too great and too indefinite either
for its own security or for the protection of private </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be submitted, with respect, that the statement is over-charged with
caution. The British approach to the interpretation of the Constitution has
been adopted rather than the American. It is from without and not from within that
the approach should be made, particularly because Part III is fashioned after
the American model. Again, as was recognised by Patanjali Sastri J. “in
construing these provisions the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble as well
as the constitutional significance of a Declaration of Fundamental Rights
should be borne in mind.” In the Constitution of the United States the
legislative power is no doubt vested in the Congress and in a sense it is the
supreme legislative power. The written Constitution is however supreme above
all the three limbs of the government, and checks and balances have been
provided so as to prevent any one limb from paralysing the others. Still the
Supreme Court has established its supremacy over the Executive and the
Congress, mainly through a reference to the spirit of the Constitution brought
out in particular by the 5th and the 14th amendment, providing, “Nor shall any
person be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law”.
‘Due’ in the phrase “due process of law” was taken to mean ‘just’, and ‘law’
was held to refer to principles of natural justice. These were not wild
assumptions. The Magna Carta in the 39<sup>th</sup> chapter provided that “no
free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized...but by the lawfu1 judgment
of his peers and <i>by the law of the land”. </i>The words “due process of law”
appeared during the reign of Edward III in the Statute of Westminster of the
Liberties of London, guaranteeing that no person will be deprived of his
property or imprisoned or indicted or put to death without being brought in to
answer by due process of law. The expression “due process of law” had been
regarded by Coke and others as signifying the same thing as ‘law of the land.’
The American colonists had carried with them these concepts and in that way the
phrase “due process of law” had crept into the American Constitution. It also
got into the Constitutions of some of the Constituent States, either in that
very form or in the form of such phrases as “in due course of law” or “according
to the law of the land.”<sup>15</sup> All these phrases had been, broadly
speaking, held to refer to the principles of natural justice. In course of time
the phrase was restricted in its meaning to what was quaintly described as
“procedural due process”.<sup>16</sup> Article 21 of the Indian Constitution
provides that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty except
according to the procedure established by law. In the Indian Constitution the
words used are “procedure established by law”. In the American Constitution
they are “due process of law” identified with what was called “procedural due
process.” The provision in Article 21 had its genesis admittedly in Article 31
of the Japanese Constitution. It is instructive to look into the roots of that
provision in the Japanese Constitution. In October 1945 the Japanese Cabinet
had been asked by General MacArthur to take steps for framing a Constitution
for Japan. But as progress was slow, in February 1946, it was decided to have
the matter taken over by General MacArthur’s Headquarters in its Government
section. Thereafter the Constitution was drafted with the assistance of
American lawyers. It has been said that the Constitution bears strongly the
impress of American ideas.<sup>17</sup> One of the chapters of the Constitution
deals with the “Rights and Duties of the People”. One of the Articles in that
chapter was Article 31which stated: “No person shall be deprived of life or
liberty, nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed except according to
procedure established by law.” It is quite conceiv</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>able
that, having regard to the American influences that operated on the drafting of
the Japanese Constitution, the phrase “proce</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dure established by
law” in Article 31 was a substantial reproduction of the phrase “due process of
law” in the American Constitution. Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution had
that evolutionary history and it may therefore be plausibly argued that the
phrase; “procedure established by law” in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution
should, in the circumstances, have received the same interpretation as the
words in the comparable context of the Japanese Constitution, which, according
to American authorities, were intended to mean the same thing as procedural due
process. Mr. Justice Fazal Ali seems to have considered the argument as not
fanciful. Anyway, for the reasons stated, it looks as if a less conservative
approach to the interpretation of the Judiciary’s position in the Indian
Constitution would have been amply justified. The deliberate choice in favour
of the English rather than the American approach means that the Supreme Court
has denied to itself the larger area of judicial review which otherwise it
would have had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

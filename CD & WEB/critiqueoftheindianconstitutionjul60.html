<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Constitution of India asserted, in its Preamble,
that the people of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
resolved in their Constituent Assembly to constitute <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> into a sovereign, democratic
republic. How far has this multiple objective been <span class=SpellE>realised</span>?
Is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
today sovereign in status, republic in form and democratic in function? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sovereign in status? The Indian Constituent Assembly was not a sovereign body,
created by the people of <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
after attaining independence from British imperial rule, as was the case in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It was
convoked by the British rulers by executive action before <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
independence, and its composition was determined by them. It was in the nature
of an extra-constitutional convention to draft a constitution, which was to be
given constitutional sanction by the British Parliament subsequently, as
happened in the case of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South
  Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>. On July 18, 1947, still before <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>’s independence, the British Parliament
enacted the Indian Independence Act, and thereby gave constitutional sanction
to the Indian Constitution <i>in advance </i>of its formulation, whereas in the
case of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
parliamentary recognition <span class=GramE><i>followed</i></span><i> </i>the
drafting of her constitution. Since the British Parliament is sovereign, it is <i>constitutionally
possible</i> for it to repeal the Indian Independence Act, though it is <i>politically
impossible</i>. It would thus seem that even after independence and the
enactment of the Constitution, <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
is not as sovereign as <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>,
though she is politically as independent as <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a republic inasmuch as the sovereign cannot overrule Parliament. <st1:country-region

republic as a matter of sentimental courtesy and a diplomatic concession to her

democratic? The Constitution provides for it, but the adoption of the

notwithstanding the almost axiomatic view to the contrary held by very eminent
authorities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Is
the party system essential to democracy? Or, is it undemocratic and even
anti-democratic? It is significant that no constitution which professes to be
democratic has given constitutional recognition to the party system. The
Constitution of India is perhaps the latest and the most comprehensive. It
considered that the age qualification for the <span class=SpellE>Presidentship</span>
of India was of sufficient constitutional importance as to warrant its
inclusion in the Constitution! But it made no mention of the party system which
is obviously extra-constitutional. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
seems very odd that one should start with the proposition that democracy is
good, and then proceed to the proposition that the party system is essential to
work it, and then proceed to create parties! It is just the other way about in
practice. Since, with<i> </i>freedom of thought essential to democracy, some
public policies do not receive universal assent, each of them divides the
people into two groups: for and against. In view of the multiplicity of
dividing issues it is not possible to form just two political parties, coherent
and homogeneous. Many issues cut across one another and do not line up. Often,
differences and criticisms within a party are greater than between parties.
Some issues will have to be subordinated rigorously, if only two parties are to
be permitted. It amounts to denial of freedom to some people and to some views,
which is anti-democratic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Freedom of speech and vote are essential to
democracy. Under the party system, there is such freedom in the meetings of the
party, which have, however, no constitutional status, whose proceedings are not
public and whose decisions are not binding on the people. But in the duly
constituted legislature, whose proceedings are public and whose decisions are
binding on the people, freedom of speech and vote is denied to the minority in
the party, which has to toe the line of its majority in the legislature.
Members who form even a bare majority in the ruling party but a minority in the
legislature can have their way which is also anti-democratic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
party system is even more anti-democratic in the parliamentary than in the
presidential system. In the former, a party forms the Government only if it has
a majority in the legislature. Its defeat on any important measure involves its
resignation and perhaps the dissolution of the legislature as well. Candidates
generally spend comparatively large sums of money to fight elections. Those who
succeed get salaries and opportunities for patronage. Some of them become
Ministers, with larger emoluments and patronage. If the Ministry be defeated
and resigns, the Ministers lose the advantages. If the legislature be
dissolved, all the members lose theirs also. Members, who plead poverty when
approached for a donation to a well-known charity, manage to large funds to
fight elections, and take the risk of forfeiting their deposits. In their
cases, it is not so much service to the public as to themselves that motivates
them. If a Ministry resigns or the legislature is dissolved before its
constitutional term, the legislators lose their opportunities to recoup their
investments, and face the risk of another election and its uncertainty. Humanly
speaking, it is not their interest to risk such a contingency by exercising
their democratic right of freedom of speech and vote in the legislature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Though
the party system occurs in America under her presidential system, party
discipline is not so rigid as in Britain or India under the parliamentary
system, because the executive is not “responsible” to the legislature, and the
defeat of a President’s proposal does not involve his resignation or the
dissolution of the Congress. The consequent stability permits greater freedom
of speech and vote in the American Congress. It is, therefore, more democratic
than the parliamentary system in Britain or India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is noteworthy that America has not yet acknowledged that the parliamentary
system is the best form of democracy, and has not adopted it, In fact, she
deliberately discarded her inheritance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

party system is inconsistent with national interest. A party cannot be national
as long as there is another party. It has to subordinate larger national
interests to its own narrower ones. <i>Democracy demands all for the nation and
none for a party, but the party system demands each for his party and none for
the nation. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

party system in India has been a handicap to good government. Most Ministers

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Swiss Federal Constitution seems to offer an example which India may well
follow, with adaptations if necessary. It is a democracy which, in the opinion
of very competent critics, is the most efficient in the world, and yet it is
neither parliamentary nor presidential. It is collegiate or coalition
democracy, opposed to party democracy. “The most interesting feature about the
Swiss party system is the absence of strongly <span class=SpellE>centralised</span>
parties on the American or the British model,” said Prof. R. C. <span
class=SpellE>Ghosh</span> of the Calcutta University. (<i>The Government of the
Swiss Republic, </i>1953, p. 128.) Christopher Hughes remarked that the Swiss
Confederation has never known the two-party system where government alternated
with opposition. (<i>The Federal Constitution of the Switzerland, </i>1954, p.
84). It has always a national government consisting of all parties. Hans Huber,
Judge of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, said: “If a party had or obtained an
absolute majority, as a rule it soon handed over a few seats to one or more
minority parties. Switzerland has become a country of coalitions.” Article 91
of the Swiss Constitution provides that the members of the legislature shall
vote without “instructions,” which means without party mandates and according
to their conscience. As regards its operation, Christopher Hughes said that the
Swiss democracy was noted for its stability, cleanliness, swiftness and
moderation which were virtues essential for ordered freedom, and in which
Switzerland led the world. In that country politics is serious business, as it
should be everywhere, and not the sport of political parties. Prof. Dicey
observed that the Swiss Federal Council was a Board of Directors appointed to
manage the concerns of the country in accordance with the wishes of the Federal
Assembly. According to Prof. <span class=SpellE>Ghosh</span>, the Swiss
Government was remarkably free from bitter party rivalry or monopoly of power,
and offered little scope for professionalism or demagoguery in politics. The
administration was highly businesslike and efficient, which is what the people
everywhere want. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may be recalled that the late Rt. Hon. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri advocated the
Swiss system for India, in 1916. He acquiesced in the parliamentary system as
expedient for the moment when the late Rt. Hon. E. S. <span class=SpellE>Montagu</span>
declared it as the goal of British policy in India. Subsequently, when the
Indian Constituent Assembly was contemplated, he recommended the Swiss system.
It was open to the Assembly to adopt it, but it was so obsessed with the
British parliamentary system that it copied it pretty wholesale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Maurice <span class=SpellE>Duvarger</span> spoke the truth when he said that
the organisation of political parties was certainly not in conformity with the
orthodox notions of democracy, that the general development of parties tended
to <span class=SpellE>emphasise</span> their deviation from the democratic
regime, and parliamentary representatives themselves were compelled to an
obedience which transformed them into voting machines, controlled by the
leaders of the party. He clinched it when he asserted: “Parties became
totalitarian”. (<i>Political Parties, </i>1954, p.422-23.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is best served by “independents” who are elected for their individual
character, competence, and experience and are free to speak and vote on the
merits of each question in the elected bodies, national or municipal. It is
true that freedom of speech and vote is allowed even under the party system,
but only on rare occasions. It should be universal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is unique in that her Constitution is neither unitary nor federal in the
typical sense. It is largely unitary, with a few federal elements which have
been a handicap to good administration. The Constitution is federal in that the
functions of Government have been divided into the Federal, to be administered
by the Government of India, and the State, to be administered by the several
States, and makes jurisdictional disputes <span class=SpellE>justiciable</span>.
It is also federal in that some kinds of amendments to the Constitution require
the assent of the States. On the other hand, it is unitary in that there is a
single Constitution and a single citizenship for the whole of India, there is a
concurrent list of subjects in which both the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
and the States can legislate but the Central prevails over the State law, and,
on the recommendation of the Central Upper Chamber, the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
can legislate on a State subject, and, finally, the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
can suspend a State government. There is one judicial hierarchy for the whole
of India, with the Supreme Court at the top. The <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>
was not created by pre-existing sovereign independent units by the transfer of
limited powers to it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

administration, there is but one Planning Commission which plans mostly for the
State subjects, which the States find it obligatory to follow if only because
they look to the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> for finance, inspiration and
directive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

federal elements have been defended on the ground that India is a large country
with a large population, and that one single government at the <span
class=SpellE>Centre</span> would not be able to administer all the subjects
efficiently and democratically. It may be pointed out, however, that the
federal subjects, which the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> alone is competent
to administer, constitute nearly half the number of all the subjects of
administration, and the concurrent subjects form nearly another quarter, which
the Central government can administer and even supercede State legislation. It
follows that, for nearly three-fourths of the subjects of administration, India
is unitary, notwithstanding her large area and population. If the <span
class=SpellE>Centre</span> is competent to administer them democratically and
efficiently, there is no reason why it cannot administer the State subjects
also equally democratically and efficiently. In any event in view of the single
Planning Commission and of the finance and prestige of the Government of India,
the State governments have, in practice, become its agents. Apart from that,
the needs of the citizens in the State sphere of administration, like
education, health and police protection, do not vary with the State boundaries,
but are common. The need for uniformity of policy and administration through
out India is being increasingly <span class=SpellE>realised</span>. The latest
instance was the plea of the Central Food Minister to constitute the whole of
India into a single zone for food. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the circumstances, the federal aspects are a handicap to economy and efficiency
in administration, as their primary function has been to provide some
politicians with power, pelf and patronage, and with opportunities for
corruption and interference in administration. The only advantage of State
legislatures and ministries is that they can provide knowledge of local needs.
But this can be secured by the constitution of small advisory committees. <i>For
</i>instance, the Railways, a Central subject, have formed several regional
advisory committees. It is highly desirable that the federal handicaps should
be eliminated, and India given an undiluted, unitary government, in the
interest of the people which should be the paramount consideration.</span><span

have known our friend Sri Ramakotiswara Rau for some twenty-three years now. It
was about the same time that I came to know our mutual friend Sri
Chandrasekharan of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>.
I came to know his brother, our respected President of this evening, somewhat
later. Ever since that time the feeling has grown stronger in me that we are
all children of one land and of one culture, members of one household. No one
has done more to strengthen this feeling in me than our friend Sri Ramakoti.
We, children of this country of ours, speak many different languages. We are nevertheless
members of one house, a large house with many mansions. “In my father’s house,”
says the Bible, “are many mansions.” <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

clear water of his village well the <i>mantra, Gangecha Yamunechaiva, Godavari,
Saraswati etc. </i>He could invoke the waters of the seven sacred rivers of
Bharatavarsha. It was one land to him. This sense weakened in a later
generation, and now with independence and a wrong notion of language
patriotism, things have grown worse. It is in consequence of this that we have
at the present day problems like those of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bellary</st1:place></st1:City>

Banyan trees, which have sprung from one parent tree. The parent tree is not to

linked to one another and all of them form one tree. The position of our
languages is just this. That is a grove of trees and one tree. There are twelve

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What I have said about the difficulties encountered
by our friend Sri Ramakoti in running ‘Triveni’ should not be taken as the
statement of a problem relating to a particular person or place or time. The
problem of ‘Triveni’ has been the problem of a high-class journal. It has been
a problem in every place and time. Middleton Murry could not run his ‘Adelph’
for more than a few years, and Macmillans with all their resources, stopped
issuing the ‘Realist’ after some 12 or 14 numbers. The high-class journal is
necessary in civilized society and, if it is to run, the journalist who runs it
is necessary. The Journal has to live; the journalist has to live. How is this
to be accomplished but by the cultured people of the land and Governments
taking special trouble to help such causes? The problem is <span class=GramE>specially</span>
important in our Country. The population that can take in a high-class journal
is very small. A good part of it does not know the problem and another good
part of it might not afford the expense. It is, therefore, the duty of those
who care for such work to render all the help they can and also express to the
workers their recognition of the service they are rendering.</p>

that he has been able to run his magazine so long. At the same time we are not
thinking of this occasion as marking the conclusion of any period. We are

noble service. We wish Sri Ramakoti to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the
magazine and in due time other jubilees. I might also report to the assembly
something of which we have heard only now and which is a good augury for the
future. Knowing that Sri Ramakoti is at the end of his resources, I took it
upon myself to consult some friends sometime ago, and, requesting Sri Ramakoti
not to object, I wrote to our Sahitya Akademi and the Education Ministry of the
Union Government, asking for some help for him. I am glad to say that the
Government of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>

is really the devout offering of heroic self-sacrifice by Sri Ramakotiswara Rau

himself says that the name, like the whole scheme of the Journal, came to him
like a flash, and that he adopted it since it sounded so beautiful. It so aptly
connotes the aim, scope and spirit of the Journal. As you all know, the
Sanskrit word ‘Triveni’ means the confluence of the triple streams of <st1:place
w:st="on">Ganga</st1:place>, Yamuna and Saraswati. In the spiritual plane it
signifies the convergence of the triple spiritual energies running through the <span
class=GramE><i>Ila</i></span><i>, Pingala </i>and <i>Sushumna nadis </i>of the
human body. Likewise, this Journal is devoted to the triple streams of culture,
namely, art, literature, and history, and it is conducted in the spirit of “a
votive offering to Him who is the source of the Triple Stream of Love, Wisdom,
and Power, towards whom <span class=GramE>converge</span> the self-same streams
of Bhakti, Jnana, and Karma.” Thus the word imports a commingling, <span
class=GramE>a unification</span> and a synthesis. Strangely enough it has had a
triple home, in <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

is natural on an occasion like this to contemplate a little about the future of
journals published in English and devoted to Art and Letters. Periodicals can
never compete, in point of financial success, with daily newspapers which deal
with events and topics of daily interest to the public. But the future of
periodicals published in English presents a special problem. Owing to the
formation of linguistic States and the increasing importance given to the
regional languages, the leadership in periodicals will naturally vest in papers
conducted in Indian languages. But the opinion is slowly gathering strength
that English should be retained as a language of study in high schools and in
colleges, and for many years to come it will be the medium of instruction in
Universities. English has also attained great importance as a world language in
which diplomats have to confer and embassies have to conduct their work. The
inflow of knowledge into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the other parts of the world can only take place in the English medium and
not in any other. Considering all these factors, the future of the existing
periodicals in English need not be considered to be gloomy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Indian Culture, which has persisted throughout India’s long history, in

Democracy, and culture will have to play a vital part if Democracy is to

the occasion with Sri Masti Venkatesa Iyengar as Chairman. Appeals were printed

for collection was undertaken, it was gratifying that over Rs. 1,300 was

its return to Madras and lastly its publication from Masulipatam. The ‘Triveni’
was an expression of great ‘shakti’ and its Editor and contributors kept it
alive in a spirit of dedication. It faced great troubles and even extinction;

enough philosophy in him not to take a tragic view of his losses and his

poor and the needy or the good soldiers who had suffered battle-scars. If
Ramakoti has not attained success in the usual sense, he is confident and happy
that he has served a cause. <span class=GramE>That cause is two-fold,<span

to the world abroad.</span> The Journal is therefore entitled to the support of
all cultured people in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
I hope it will enlist more subscribers. The past twenty-five years were a
period of struggle for the nation, and the political struggle absorbed the
country’s resources somewhat to the neglect of its cultural life. Now that the
country is independent, we are in a period of consolidation as regards our
national life. At such a time a Journal like ‘Triveni’ has a large part to play
in the service of its twofold purpose. The future of ‘Triveni’ therefore is,
and ought to be, a matter of deep personal concern to all of us. May the
Journal flourish and go on to its Golden and its Diamond Jubilee!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Chief Minister, Sri K. Hanumanthaiya, who was present, was requested to say a
few words. He rose amidst cheers, and referred to Sri Masti Venkatesa Iyengar’s
personal letter to him. He held Sri Masti in such high esteem that he gladly
responded to his invitation. When he learnt that Sri Ramakotiswara Rau was
being felicitated in connection with the Silver Jubilee Celebration of
‘Triveni’, he felt it was a great event. He had profited by coming to the
function and listening to the speech’s that had been made.<span

Rau, in acknowledging the felicitations, recalled that ‘Triveni’ was
inaugurated in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>
on the 25th of December 1927, before a distinguished gathering of poets,
artists and scholars. A talented lawyer-friend from his home-town
(Narasaraopet, Guntur Dist.), Sri Chavali Venkata Krishnaiya, presided on the
occasion. He passed away before the end of the first year. Sri Adivi Bapiraju,
poet and painter, prepared the first Cover-design and worked as Associate
Editor. Sri C. Jinarajadasa wrote the first article on “New Beginnings in
Indian Culture”. Friends like K. S. Venkataramani and Justice V.
Govindarajachari took great interest in ‘Triveni’. It was sad to think that
none of these was with them for the Jubilee. He <span class=GramE>Wished</span>
to refer to some other friends who were no more, but there was a risk of his breaking<i>
</i>down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was exceedingly happy<i> </i>that ‘Triveni’ had survived many crises and was
celebrating the Silver Jubilee. The idea of a Silver Jubilee was first mooted
by him 18 years ago, in the course of a conversation with Sri K.
Chandrasekharan on the sands of the <st1:City w:st="on">Marina</st1:City> in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. That was a very
dark day for ‘Triveni’. It seemed impossible to continue the Journal and Sri
Chandrasekharan was even more worried than himself. It became his duty to cheer
up Sri Chandrasekharan by talking of the future and of the Silver Jubilee. That
dream was fulfilled this day, and he was grateful to his esteemed brother, Sri
Masti Venkatesa Iyengar, and other friends who had organised this beautiful
function. The carved sandalwood casket in which their Address was enclosed
redeem him of a similar casket he sent as a birthday gift to a pretty little
girl in Berhampore forty years ago, while he was a Law student in Madras. She
was present on this occasion to share the honours, even as she had shared his
struggles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

occasion, in which he reffered to ‘Triveni’ as an incarnation of goddess
Lakshmi. Yes, she had been pleased to take this shape to bless him and his
wife. She was their only child, and more precious than any mortal child could
be. He had just completed </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

glad that younger men had been found who could be trusted to continue the

carefree and full of hope. He thanked them all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

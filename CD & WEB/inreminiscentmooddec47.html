practise in the High Court at Madras but was caught up in the maelstrom of
Gandhian politics! How elegant he looks in his ‘closed collar’ coat of white
khaddar and his khaddar turban! And what a balance he has achieved between
intellect and emotion, and between speech and silence!” Such were my thoughts
as I followed the arguments of Sri C. Rajagopalachariar delivered in measured,
level tones, during the discussions in the Subjects Committee at the Nagpur
Congress of 1920.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I saw him again a year later at the Swarajya office
in Madras, and liked the winsome smile and the words of kindly humour with
which he returned the greetings of ‘subs’ like me. The Working Committee of the
Tamil Nad Provincial Congress Committee used to meet in the <i>Swarajya </i>office,
2/27 Broadway. I ‘listened in’ one night when the decision was taken that C. R.
should defy the Magistrate’s order under Section 1440 Cr.P.C. banning meetings
in Vellore. Sri E. V. Ramaswami Naicker grumbled like a recalcitrant child,
because he was not given the first opportunity to offer Civil Disobedience. But
C. R. argued him into acquiescence. Next day, he went to Vellore and disobeyed
the order. He got some months in Vellore prison, and wrote his famous <i>Jail
Diary</i>. One passage, in particular, dwells in my memory. The music of a
piper in some near-by village floated down to C. R. from beyond the prison
walls, and put him in mind of village homes and simple festive gatherings. The
artist in C. R. appealed to me. Twenty years after, we were together in Vellore
prison,–he as the ex-Premier of Madras, and I as an M.L.A. from Guntur. One
day, I reminded him of that passage in his <i>Jail Diary</i>. He smiled and
said, “Ah! You remember that! Now I am back here again!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Though I was an ‘M.L.A.’ for six years (1939-1945)
and displayed the magic letters on the front page of <i>Triveni </i>and on my
visiting cards, I functioned as a legislator only for a couple of days: I was
returned in a bye-election, and the Congress went out of office soon after.
Thus C. R., the leader of the Madras Congress Legislature Party, was my Chief,
only in name. I never worked with him in the Legislature, as I worked with Sri
Prakasam in <i>Swarajya </i>or with Dr. Pattabhi at the Kalasala, Masulipatam.
It was, in fact, the <i>Triveni</i>, which brought us into fairly intimate association
in the years before he became Premier. And it is <i>Triveni </i>that today
serves as a golden link between him and me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sri K. Chandrasekharan, son of the late V.
Krishnaswami Aiyar, was a guardian of Triveni before the migration from Madras
to Bangalore in 1942. On Sundays and holidays, when he did not have to attend
the High Court, we used to call together on contributors of articles and
Possible ‘life-subscribers’ from whom we inveigled cheques for a hundred rupees
to spoon-feed Triveni. C. R. of course could not pay money. But he had leisure
in those days, for he was not in active politics. So, Chandrasekharan, my
charioteer in the battle of life, drove me one morning to the secluded spot in
Tyagarayanagar where C. R. lived in comparative retirement. We made the usual
request for literary contributions, and, to convince him that <i>Triveni </i>was
a worthy a medium for the expression of his views on life and letters, we left
with him quite a pile of copies of the journal,–the two-monthly of the earlier
years, and the monthly of the Current period. We called again after a few days.
Eager to have a word of appreciation, I asked him what he thought of the
journal. A little sadness clouded his brow as he answered, “You have given
years of devoted labour to <i>Triveni</i>. You have spent a fortune on it. You
have tried to maintain a high standard in form and contents. You have given me
all these copies free. And now, you are waiting for just a word of
encouragement from me. All this shows that literary, cultural effort is not
having its due reward in our country.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Our visits to him became fairly frequent, and We
used also to meet at Chandrasekharan’s house–the ‘Ashrama’, Mylapore–where C.
R. called occasionally along with Sri T. K. Chidambaranatha Mudaliar, the great
Tamil scholar. At the ‘Ashrama’, C. R. always refused a chair; he preferred the
pials of red cement, smooth and polished, and reminiscent of village homes in
South India. He would spend a quiet hour with Sri K. Balasubrahmania Aiyar, K.
Chandrasekharan, and their gifted sister, Srimati Savitri Ammal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Very early in our acquaintance, I noticed that his
style of conversation–in its humour, its gentle raillery, and its many similes
and parables–was self akin to that of Sri Masti Venkatesa Iyengar of Bangalore.
I had learnt to call it the ‘Masti manner’. I now found that it was also the
‘C. R. manner’. I ventured to draw his attention to this resemblance between
himself and Masti. “Don’t you know,” he said, “we passed through same College
at Bangalore, breathed the same atmosphere, and came under similar influences?”
Then he said he liked Masti’s writings published in <i>Triveni </i>in the
English garb. “I read the story ‘Masumatti’ and admired it. After finishing it,
I turned to the first page and noted it was written by Masti in Kannada and
rendered into English by Navaratna Rama Rao.” Here, as usual, came a simile.
“It was as if I liked a pretty child, playing in the street, and was then
delighted to find that it was related to me as a grandchild!” He rendered
‘Masumatti’ into Tamil, and afterwards wrote an Introduction to the four-volume
edition of Masti’s stories in English translation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>After the Satyagraha prisoners, mostly legislators,
were transferred from Vellore to Trichinopoly in 1941, we had, both of us, a
long spell of leisure in which to meet oftener. We spoke of common friends in
Mylapore (Madras) and Basavangudi (Bangalore). When the news of the premature
demise of Thirtharappan, son of Chidambaranatha Mudaliar, came through, I felt
desolate, for I had known Thirtharappan–alias Chelliah–for some years and
developed a fondness for him; he was so tender and so gifted. I yearned that day
to be in the company of someone who cared equally for Thirtharappan. I sought
out C. R. and was comforted by his gentle, reminiscent talk. “Have you read
Chandrasekharan’s note on Thirtharappan in <i>The Hindu</i>?” he asked me.
“There is an unsigned paragraph, but why do you think Chandrasekharan wrote
it?” “I know the style. All of you express yourselves in the <i>Triveni way</i>!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Of his work as Premier and as leader of South
India, a great deal has been written. He has been, by turns, the most loved as
well as the most distrusted of leaders. The storms gathering round him have
sometimes forced him into retirement or threats of retirement. But about his
intellectual eminence and his administrative ability, there is not the
slightest divergence of opinion between his admirers and his traducers. He has
not always followed the lead of the Congress, and sections of Congressmen have
found it difficult to reconcile themselves to his attitude to the ‘Quit India’
Resolution of August 1942. But one can understand his point of view even
without complete agreement. He claimed, and exercised, the right of individual
Congressmen to go out of the organisation and criticise its methods. There is
neither dishonesty nor disloyalty in such an attitude. And it is the correct
position for any citizen to take up in a time of crisis, when frank criticism
of public policies is needed for clarifying the issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I like to think of C. R., the scholar and
philosopher, the lover of poetry and music, the man with a genius for
friendship. Only last month, Sri Masti Venkatesa Iyengar mentioned to me, “Do
you know, C. R. has written to Navaratna Rama Rao telling him that he liked his
story in the September number of <i>Triveni</i>?” Next day, I met Sri Rama Rao
by accident in Sri D. V. Gundappa’s house. When I asked him about C. R’s
letter, he replied, “Well, it is true that he has written to me. But I don’t
trust his judgment in this matter. He always addresses me as ‘Dearest Rama Rao’
and signs himself ‘Yours most affectionately’. Now, how can such a man judge my
literary work dispassionately? He is prejudiced in my favour.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

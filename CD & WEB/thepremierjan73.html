Legislative Assembly in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City></st1:place>
its proceedings on the Speaker’s <span class=GramE>election day</span>. To him,
as it must have been to several others, it was an unforgettable experience. A
strange and an almost infectious liveliness pervaded the scene. The small
officials in charge of the arrangements were more than usually alert, while the
orderlies were doing their best to be as deferential as their calling and
tradition would permit. The hall was filled with khaddar-clad ladies and
gentlemen in as many types of unconventional attire as one could imagine–as if
they sought to signalize their new acquisition of power in a riotous
non-conformity to the usual dress styles. The few European gentlemen looked
almost apologetic for the clothes they were in. Tail coats and flashing ties
were absent; and with them seemed to have vanished also the aloofness and
pomposity that marked the manner of the old Councils. Democracy literally
seemed to have come into its own. The people at last seemed to be tenanting the
central seat of power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the head of them all sat the Prime Minister. All eyes were riveted on him; yet,
there was so little to see. His small frame looked even frailer than ever, as
he sat in the padded recess of the heavy Treasury Bench. The usual landmarks,
however, were there–the white apparel, the dark glasses, and, of course, the
famous smile. He should have been more than human if he was not affected by the
situation. But his keen, mobile face did not show any trace of the emotion
within. Neither was there the touch of weariness and disillusionment that can
be expected in one who had just formed a Cabinet. His manner was, as usual,
calm and humble.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he rose to felicitate the Speaker on his election in that tranquil, cultured
voice of his, the thoughts of this writer went far into the past. He thought of
the days of 1922 and 1923 when a violent schism rent the Congress in twain. He
conjured up the tall, gaunt figure of the late Mr. C. R. <span class=SpellE>Das</span>–already
in the grip of the malady that was shortly to lower him to the dust, pale and
haggard, and yet as if possessed by <span class=SpellE>sombre</span>
passions–crying hoarse over the Council programme. Pitted against him was Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>, cool and collected, meeting Mr. <span

syllogisms. The two great men measured their strength on the freezing banks of

neither of the two doughty combatants was the controversy a matter of personal
equation. Their difference was due to a difference in temperament and
intellectual bias. In the reaction that followed the first phase of the
Non-co-operation movement and in the then spreading feeling of frustration,
both agreed that some new momentum should be given to the Congress policy. On
the method they differed. The eager, volatile temperament of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Das</span> <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> a spectacular fight
through the Councils. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span> was not
blind to the popular appeal in such a policy. But he had other notions about
the Non-co-operation movement. To him it meant nothing short of a huge attempt
at a moral regeneration of his race. The first campaign failed because the
moral stamina of the people was not equal to the job. That stamina should be
strengthened. The moral and spiritual resources of the people should be
galvanized. The process might be slow. But there was no other go. If one
believed in the philosophical foundation of the movement, there was no other
conclusion possible. His logic was flawless; and he expounded his view with
that simplicity and directness of which he is so great a master. The Congress voted
for him; Mr. <span class=SpellE>Das</span> walked out in rout and rebellion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

buried, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>, once the prince of
no-changers, is the peerless leader of the parliamentary programme of the
Congress. “None but the dead,” says Louis Blanc, “come back”; and if by any
chance the ghost of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Das</span> should emerge out of its
home of shadows with a smile on its bloodless lips, it might perhaps be
forgiven. The incident has enough irony<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sober reflection would reveal that in no aspect of his busy and eventful life
has ‘C. R.’ shown more authentic marks of high statesmanship than in the quiet
and almost imperceptible evolution of his views in regard to the work in the
Councils. A smaller man would have felt both intellectually and morally
intimidated by his past predilections. But like the great leaders of democracy,
who by their conduct illustrate that democracy is leadership and not the rule
by the howling mob, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span> has shown
that he possesses the two great assets of a public man, flexibility of mind and
the courage to act in scorn of consequences to himself. We read in Morley that
Mr. Gladstone always thought that the statesman’s gift consisted in an insight
into the facts of a particular era disclosing the existence of material for
forming public opinion, and directing that opinion to the given purpose. It is
this faith that explains much that is in the nature of abrupt and violent
change in the political strategy of the great Victorian and exposed him to the
blistering gibe of Huxley, “Here is a man with the greatest intellect in <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> and he debases it by following the crowds and the
majorities.” The popular superstition, that change of policy betokens
shallowness of conviction, is mainly responsible for the anxiety of so many
sententious public men trying to end their politics as they have begun them, in
the <span class=SpellE>unctious</span> belief that there is no higher political
virtue than consistency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the political background of the country has shifted from what it was in 1922.
The old orthodoxies are no longer possessed of vitality. Disenchantment has
come over the people and the early idealism of the movement is nothing more
than a wistful memory. The Councils might be good or bad. They might even by
design be blind alleys. But they had been got at by men who had no touch with
the real thought and aspirations of the people. The bubble had to be pricked.
The country had to be saved from an endless reign of flummery. The people were
anxious that the Congressmen should go into the Councils. To ignore this state
of feeling would have been to forfeit the faith of the people in the political
wisdom and the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

is well known that Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari’s</span> attitude in
regard to the work in Councils was one of the contributing factors in the
decision of the Congress executive to lift the old ban. In his attitude there
was not a trace of personal ambition. The place which he now occupies has come
to him unexpectedly. It has come to him naturally, inevitably. The peculiar
exigencies of the political situation in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City></st1:place>,
to which it is no use referring just now, have conspired to bring him to a
place which he never desired and which, if he had consulted only his personal
feeling, he would have rejected. No man who has achieved so much distinction in
public life has ever been swayed by so little of personal ambition. The play is
the thing in politics as in <i>Hamlet, </i>and it is of little consequence <span
class=GramE>who</span> the player is. In fact, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>
would like to be relieved of all these responsibilities, for, hidden deep down
his smiling courtesy, his dry intellectual manner, his tranquil dialectical
powers, there is a mystic element in his nature that bids him away from the
cliques and the cabals, the polemics and the pot-boilers of political life and
seek his peace in some rural abode where, in silence, he can deepen his spirit.
When, the other day, over what is known as the ‘Rajan incident,’ he intimated
his desire to wash his hands of all this political turmoil and retire, he was
not expressing the injured sense of leadership but was merely articulating the
profounder<o:p></o:p></span></p>

none. When we discover a man who is unwilling to govern, says Plato, then let
us be sure that we have discovered the man that is </span><span

is more than two months since he formed his Cabinet; the fact of these

was not lost on the public whose relish for the unusual is ever so notorious.
It has enjoyed the legends that have already grown round what may be called Mr.
<span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari’s</span> art of taming the lions of the
Secretariat. The news that an important permanent official accepted from the
Premier a gift of <span class=SpellE>khadi</span> and actually wore clothes
made of it, tickled the imagination of the people in a manner that is out of
all proportion to its importance. The excitement was visible everywhere and in

the sensation is dying down and life reverting to its normal plane of routine,
the crucial question is shaping itself: what will Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>
do? Will he settle down, as the most democratic of leaders often do, never
wanting to be reminded of the idealism of the pre-election speeches, merely
running the administration and sending up every night of their life the
pathetic prayer, “Oh Lord, peace in my time”? His past, and the dynamic
character of the great body of ideas he represents, make this eventuality
impossible. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span> is going to tell on
the life and thought of his people, and so the further question arises,” In
what way is he going to tell?” Will he usher in an age of general dissolution;
will he upset the apple cart of the present economic order? Will the two
puissant postulates of British jurisprudence that rules this realm, </span><span

the sanctity of property and the freedom of contract, receive from him the same
respect that they have hitherto </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>received? It is
curious how, already, he has created a flutter among certain groups. He has
said nothing; he has as yet done nothing to justify these fears. But his very
presence, and the feeling that his presence means so much, has been responsible
for a good deal of nervousness in what we call ‘vested interests.’ Already they
seem to see as if in a nightmare his thin, spectral fingers closing round the
neck of privilege. Is there warrant for these fears? Even speculation requires
some data for its sustenance, and for the data we have to go into his past and
his general point of view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

main incidents of his life are but briefly told. Born in an orthodox family in
the district of Salem, and doing his collegiate education at Bangalore, there
was nothing in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari’s</span> early life and
upbringing, suggestive of the social courage that he has shown or the political
faith that we now associate with him. Like a thousand other boys similarly
situated, he was brought up to be an ordinary flourishing middle-class man of
the world. In a recent speech he related, with all the charm of his limpid <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>, how his parents debated as to what education they
should give their child, whether like his sires he should be trained in
Sanskrit schools, or like so many prudent people he should be given English
education. Somehow, in the duel between things of this world and of the next,
the present world won, as it seems to be always winning; and so Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span> was denied to Sanskrit and old traditional
culture, for, if he had taken to them, he would have won an equal distinction
as the most authentic successor to the medieval logicians and the <span
class=SpellE><i>Naiyayikas</i></span><i>. </i>After a bright career at college
he settled down as a lawyer at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Salem</st1:City></st1:place>.
Success came to him soon. Not merely briefs began to pour in increasing
measure, but he was building up a reputation as a most acute and accomplished
advocate. Almost immediately after his famous <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
of Dr. <span class=SpellE>Varadarajulu</span> <span class=SpellE>Naidu</span>
in a political prosecution, he came over to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:City></st1:place> and promised to take his place amongst

deluge. The <st1:place w:st="on">Punjab</st1:place> troubles created a <span
class=SpellE><i>furore</i></span><i> </i>in the country. Mr. Gandhi came on the
scene. His arrival was perhaps in many ways the most significant event in the
political life of this country for a century. It was the birth of a man and a
method. The Satyagraha movement found in Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>
a most ardent and devoted follower. If for the new creed sacrifices were called
for, he was in a mood to give them gladly, and gladly did he give them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an atmosphere that is congenial to the growth of fanaticism, and with a creed
that is helpful to the growth of self-righteousness, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>
has retained both his native sense of proportion and innate modesty. He is not
like some of the grim figures of history ruled by a single idea to the
exclusion of all else. It is such men lacking historical perspective, lacking
pity, hard, relentless, implacable, <span class=GramE>that are</span> the
menace to the peace of the social order. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>
has enough sense of <span class=SpellE>humour</span> not to be dangerous.
Looking at his thin frame and his dark glasses, and a certain austerity of
bearing and manifest rigidity of principle, one might be reminded of
Robespierre. But the comparison is by no means apt; for Robespierre never
smiled, not to speak of making others smile. The man that can see a joke and
make <span class=GramE>one,</span> will never be a fanatic. He will never
inflict pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he is free from emotional extravagance. He is innocent of passion. A calm, dry,
intellectual atmosphere pervades his being. His mind is an evolutionary mind.
His thoughts move in an even progression. He does not share the exotic ideology
that looks upon religion as dope, tradition as tyranny, and the past an
encumbrance. Like his great preceptor, his mind has an Eastern bias, arid his
attachment to the faith and tradition of his fathers is deep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

injustice of the present economic order appeals to him, not as a whetstone on
which to sharpen dogma but as a thing that calls for immediate redress. To set
the present wrongs right, the socialist approach is not the only one. There is
much that can be done even without borrowing from the <span class=SpellE><i>Das</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Kapital</span>. </i>Callousness and incompetence of the
State is not by any means an inevitable alternative to Socialism. The State is
the contrivance of civilisation to checkmate the inexorable laws of biological
evolution. The pernicious philosophy that seeks to incorporate the theories of
struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest into the affairs of <span
class=GramE>men,</span> has been the excuse for the powerful classes exploiting
the weaker ones. The organic character of society which regards the prosperity
of one section as dependent upon the prosperity of the other is looked upon by
the bloated plutocrats as a jejune adaptation of the <span class=SpellE>vapourings</span>
of religious simpletons who cry, “Under Heaven one family.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Life
has its prizes, it is said, not for the moony folk who think of others but for
the resolute men that run in blinkers and seek their own destiny. If in so
doing they have to trample upon others, it is just inevitable. “The many have
to go down,” says an eminent Indian writer, “so that one may go up; that is the
passionless law of life.” To avoid the heartlessness of such a situation, to
protect the weak from the strong, to falsify the rule of might being the right,
to check the cupidity and barbarism of primitive life, the State was evolved.
“The Polis came to make life possible,” says Aristotle. “It exists to make life
better.” That is the justification for the State. And so long as this Province
has a man like Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span> at the helm, the
activity of the State will be inspired by nothing but the highest interests of
the common weal. There is no higher tribute that can be paid to a statesman
than to say that he creates such faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>Nehru, as Peace-maker</h3>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the difficult conditions created by the flare-up
in Korea, the Indian Prime Minister sought to play the role of a peace-maker.
The effort is certainly praiseworthy and it indicates Republican India’s
resolve to hold the balance between the warring blocs. As a member of the
Commonwealth, India is technically allied to the Anglo-American group of
countries. She is also interested in checking the spread of Communism in Asia,
especially when the Communist Party of India is ranged in insurrectionary
opposition to the National Government at New Delhi. Membership of the
Commonwealth, however, is not the sole test of India’s position in
international affairs. As a matter of fact, Pandit Nehru has always emphasised
India’s right to determine her foreign policy, unhampered by any commitments,
and even to maintain a neutral attitude in case of an armed conflict between
the Powers. The recognition of Communist China by India is a clear proof of the
Nehru Government’s capacity to play an independent part without waiting to be
led by Britain or the U.S.A. The peace move initiated by India reflects India’s
anxiety to localise the conflict, and prevent a world conflagration. A
discussion in the Security Council with Communist China represented on it might
have led to tangible results, including the withdrawal of the North Korean
forces to the 38th Parallel. But America, as the controlling power in the
U.N.O., took a strictly legalistic view and insisted that the question of
Communist China’s representation ought not to be mixed up with the immediate
problem; as a proclaimed aggressor, North Korea must retrace its steps. This
unhelpful attitude blocked all further attempts on India’s part to ease the
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But India is a party to the Security Council’s
resolution on Korea; she is pledged to render aid to South Korea, even though
that Aid may be confined to the despatch of a medical mission. Russia’s
lightning decision to suspend her boycott of the U.N.O., and to permit her
representative to preside over the meetings of the Security Council this month
must create a new situation. While India will not help Russia to reverse the
Security Council’s previous resolution on Korea, she is bound to vote for the
representation of Communist China on all bodies of the U.N.O. including the
Security Council. The latest Russian move is not an indication of Soviet
Russia’s desire to co-operate with all other States in the restoration of a
peaceful atmosphere. On the other hand, it is a step in furtherance of her
designs to weaken the U.N.O., by imposing her veto at every turn. It is also a
step in her peace-offensive.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pandit
Nehru’s efforts to restore peace in Korea have been discounted by certain
sections of the British and American Press; they question why a settlement has
not been reached with Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. India is accused of
deliberately blocking the plebiscite in Kashmir with a view to perpetuating her
sway over that State. But it was India which made the offer of a plebiscite,
though the offer was made to the people of Kashmir and not to Pakistan, the
unwanted aggressor. The U.N.O., bungled by seeking to place India and Pakistan
on the same level, even after its own Commission reported the presence of
Pakistan troops in the valley. It fur complicated matters, when it virtually recognised
the Azad Kashmir administration as the local authority, having a status similar
to that of the Abdullah Government. The latest effort of the U. N. Mediator Sir
Owen Dixon, to find an agreed basis for further negotiations has not been
successful. Kashmir has been an integral part of India ever since its
accession, and the Government of India is thus charged with the duty of
protecting the State against all aggressors. Any plan of demilitarisation
envisaged by Sir Owen Dixon must take note of this primary consideration.
Indian troops are needed not merely for the maintenance of law and order with
the Collaboration with the Government of that State, but also to protect the
citizens of all parts of the State–including those at present occupied by Pakistan
controlled troops–from violence. India has not withdrawn her offer of a
plebiscite nor has she attempted to evade it. But she maintains that the
withdrawal of Pakistan troops and of all outside elements from every inch of
the State of Jammu and Kashmir, is a pre-requisite to the holding of a
plebiscite. The subtle propaganda in favour of the eventual partition of
Kashmir on the basis present cease-fire line must be counteracted. In her
anxiety to find a peaceful solution India has conceded point after point, which
she deemed of minor significance. But a limit must be set somewhere. Any
yielding on the question of the ‘simultaneous’ withdrawal of the Indian and
Pakistan forces from Kashmir, or on the question of holding a plebiscite while
yet some parts of the State are garrisoned by Pakistan troops, will prove
fatal. If, however, Sir Owen Dixon can propose a solution satisfactory to India
and to the people of Kashmir without the need to hold a plebiscite, India will
give earnest thought to it. And Sir Owen’s powers are wide enough to cover even
such a solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as compact, organised groups within the National Congress, the Socialists and
the Communists are now functioning as independent parties with clear-cut
ideologies and programmes. As the general elections are drawing near, they are
marshalling their forces in order to try conclusions with the party in power.
They do expect to function as the Government either at the Centre or in the
various States of the Indian Union, but they hope to wean away large numbers of
Indian citizens from their allegiance to the Congress. The Congress had to
change overnight from a fighting organisation to a government making body. In
the process of adjusting itself to new conditions, it has made mistakes. There
has not been enough time at its command to thoroughly overhaul its
organisational side; conflicts have arisen between the Congress bodies and the
Congress Ministries at various levels. To add to this, the presence of large
numbers of ‘heroes’ in the erstwhile fight for freedom clamouring for rewards,
has inevitably led to a certain amount of corruption and of favouritism to
ensure loyalty to the party. These things happen in every country in the first
stages of freedom, but the evils were accentuated in India by the lack of a
vigilant organised public opinion; While a certain amount of evil undoubtedly
exists, the tendency has been to magnify it and use it as a means of
discrediting both the Ministries and the Congress bodies. Curiously enough,
Congressmen have come to hate each other more cordially than they are hated by
non-Congressmen. Even the highest dignitaries of the Congress organisation find
themselves powerless to restrain their following or to bring about harmony
between rival groups. In the process, the Presidentship of the Congress has
been robbed of its prestige; the President is no longer the Rashtrapati, for
that appellation has been quietly transferred to the President of the Republic.
The Congress is today a house divided against itself, and unless effective
measures are taken at Nasik to stop the rot, the great organisation will suffer

despite all this, the Congress continues to be the largest and the most widely
respected political party in India. It is fairly certain to be returned in
comfortable majorities everywhere, and form the Governments at New Delhi and in
the States. But a strong opposition is bound to function in every legislature,
and prevent the evils of perpetual one-party rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

every scheme of ‘leftist consolidation’, the Socialists and the Communists have
kept clear of each other. The Socialists will under no circumstances coalesce
with the Communists or condone the methods, for the Socialists are wedded to
the ideal of ‘Democratic Socialism’; they prefer to pursue democratic methods
and make use of the machinery provided by the Republican Constitution to
achieve their ends. In his mental make-up and his general approach to national
problems, Sri J. P. Narain is much nearer to Nehru than to Joshi or Ranadive.
He will not accept dictation from a body like the Cominform nor indulge in
violence and bloodshed. The Socialists are also breaking up into groups but Sri
J. P. N arain and Sri Narendra Deva may be trusted to keep a hold on the party,
and win a position for it in the legislatures, though parliamentary power is
not their prime objective. At present the Socialist leaders are unable to
gather large numbers into their fold because there is no nation-wide
constructive effort to their credit. The few that gather under the banner are
disgruntled Congressmen or non party men who believe in attaching themselves to
a party without a record–clean or unclean–in order to make an appeal to the
electorate on the strength programmes not yet tried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Communist Party of India covered itself with
ignominy during the war period and during the first years of freedom, by
adopting a frankly anti-national attitude. Their campaign of murder, loot and
arson has thoroughly discredited them. And their allegiance to an outside power
is the weakest point in their armour, for, in the name of world-revolution,
they are antagonising the progressive, but peace-loving, sections of their
countrymen. No one believes in their recently advertised change of front; it
may be yet another ruse to ‘legalise’ themselves and fight the elections. The
country has suffered too much from their insurrectionary methods to put trust
to their new professions of peaceful intentions.</p>

the leaders of political parties are measuring their strength, those who value
the things of the mind continue to devote themselves to literature and the
arts. The National Government of India is anxious to help literary and artistic
effort, but it is preoccupied with matters of more immediate concern. Its
cultural programmes are halting and infructuous; the requisite funds are not
available. Private bodies like the P.E.N. India Centre, under Srimathi Sophia
Wadia’s leadership, are struggling against odds to keep alive the interest in
the literatures in the various regional languages and to coordinate the efforts
of literary persons and associations. The Conferences at Jaipur (1945) and
Benares (1947) formed important landmarks in our cultural history, for they
brought together the litterateurs of India and representatives of foreign
cultural organisations. Further P.E.N. Conferences have not been held, because
the Government of India wished to take the initiative in calling an all-India
literary conference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Governor of the U. P., proclaimed her faith that “Literature is the only way in
which truth of life can be kept alive.” During the five-day session, important
papers were read and discussions held on problems relating to literary
expression and the responsibilities of writers. The first part of the volume
gives a fairly accurate version of them all, while the second gives a brief
account of the growth of the Indian literatures between the Jaipur and Benares
sessions. But those were the years when the post-war depression weighed heavily
on all literary effort, and the partition of the country created fresh
difficulties. The triumph of the freedom struggle, however, is reflected in all
our literatures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the prevailing discontent. The literature ‘of the moment’ will score over the
literature ‘of all time’, but the abiding values of life are bound to assert
themselves. Writers in Free India, if they are to fulfill their destiny, must
not be afraid to dream, must not fight shy of sentiment. And while giving
expression to their inmost thoughts, they must learn to love the work of
kindred scripts writing in other Indian languages, or in languages other than
Indian. In every linguistic area, groups of scholars must de themselves to the
study of languages, and function as ambassadors of culture by translating from
one language into another. Through the monthly Bulletin, <i>The Indian </i>P.E.N.,

have their fads, and those fads must perforce be experimented upon the young.
Educational theory, the capacity of the student, and even commonsense are being
set at naught in South India in the excessive zeal to multiply the number of
languages taught in schools. The first glimmer of light in all this chaos is
provided by the Education Minister’s heroic effort to let off a youngster with
two languages, but leaving him free to learn four if he wishes to. Knowledge of
words is not necessarily knowledge of things; it may not be a step to wisdom.
The mother-tongue, the regional language, the classical language, the
‘national’ or federal language, and the international language–all these have
their advocates. There can be no objection to anyone learning even a dozen
languages, if he is so inclined, but most of us ought to be content with two.
No compulsion can be exercised with regard to any language other than the
mother-tongue till the child reaches the lower secondary stage; and then let
him choose freely between Hindi and English as a second language right up to
the end of the high school course. At present both Hindi and English are being
given compulsorily from the first form. Let our leaders at New Delhi make up
their minds definitely on this point–that it is injurious to teach three
languages simultaneously and compulsorily at the first form stage. If students
and their parents are free to decide between Hindi and English from the first
to the sixth form, any possible deficiency can be made up by providing a
language test in Hindi for <i>all-India </i>services for those who have not

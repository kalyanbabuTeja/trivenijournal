was the least imposing as he was the least demonstrative of men. He belonged
more than anyone to the great Congress tradition–the ‘<span class=SpellE>spiritualising</span>-politics’
tradition, touched by the strong personality of the Mahatma. He had no respect
for mass hysterias and misguided movements of the hour with their rapidly-waning
enthusiasms and quick disillusionments. “How many ineffective groups calling
themselves parties!<span class=GramE>”,</span> he seemed to say with absolute
diffidence. Yet there was no trace of bitterness in his <span class=GramE>words
nor</span> contempt. If he wanted anything to be of help to a functioning
Government in a democratic set-up, it was a, disciplined opposition in the
legislative bodies. He suspected very early–long before anyone dreamt of our
gaining <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>–the
disruptive forces here, which would easily assume such huge proportions as to
obstruct our even progress. He went to the extent of prophesying in his <i>Jail
Diary </i>(1921), that a situation might arise after our winning <span
class=SpellE>Swaraj</span>, which would make us <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the folly of having gained <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Liberty</st1:place></st1:City>
without adequate preparation and equipment for the task of running governments
with efficiency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

constant watchfulness of our inherent weaknesses in public administration, he
developed from early years a sense of detachment and unsentimental outlook upon
all problems. As a Municipal Chairman in his own native town of <st1:place

removal of untouchability, especially in the enjoyment of civic amenities like
drawing water from public taps. Long even before the Mahatma’s crusade against
the intolerance of the higher castes towards untouchables, he had started his
reforming zeal in ameliorative measures towards the poor and the fallen. If he
was an inveterate foe of all methods of the Moderates in the days of the pre-<span
class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> Congress, he was at the same time never slow to <span

different approaches towards the same goal.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

was a great event to welcome back Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Besant</span> and her
two co-adjutants, Dr. George <span class=SpellE>Arundale</span> and B. P. <span
class=SpellE>Wadia</span>, from their internment at <span class=SpellE>Coonoor</span>
for their seditious propaganda of Home Rule. The three were passing in the
train to <st1:City w:st="on">Madras</st1:City> and at the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Salem</st1:place></st1:City> station, where the train was likely to
stop, a big crowd of admirers had gathered. The police cordon proved
impregnable to C. R. (as he was then known) and his followers, who wished to
join the rest at the station. He sought a way out by opening a side-gate, at a
distance from the platform, and led the crowd to the train for cheering the
three patriots on their release. It was then said that C. R. made history in
the <span class=SpellE>mofussil</span> town by so many of his acts of <span
class=SpellE>intrepedity</span>, unknown to the leaders of the times in public.
His letters, in those early days of his entry into public life, to the
editorial columns of the press as well as his trenchant articles in Tamil
dailies and journals, breathed as unbending spirit of nationalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>, where
he shifted towards the year 1919, he began to <span class=SpellE>practise</span>
as a lawyer in the High Court of Judicature. Having been a successful
cross-examiner in criminal trials in the <span class=SpellE>mofussil</span>
courts, he had earned a reputation for his legal acumen and powers of eliciting
truth in matters complicated by facts. Instances have emerged to public
knowledge of his voluntary attempts at bringing to book culprits who tried to
cheat the gullible public for gaining their private ends. A Brahmin with his
family appeared one day before him for help saying that he was a school-master
in <span class=SpellE>Palghat</span> and that on his way of pilgrimage he had
lost the contents of his purse and needed pecuniary assistance. Rajaji shrewdly
suspected that it was a pose to hoodwink the public into the belief of his
story. Hence without much ado, he sent a wire to the headmaster of the
particular school of which the visitor had mentioned he was a teacher and
ascertained that there was no such person by that name. So a complaint was
lodged with the local police by Rajaji, and the person was arrested and taken
before the presiding magistrate. The accused confessed guilt and the magistrate
sentenced him to pay a heavy fine of <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 200, in
default of which he was to undergo imprisonment for three months. Then Rajaji
pleaded for reduction of the fine before the magistrate, who became irritated
at his request, particularly when he had been himself instrumental in bringing
the culprit to custody. But all the same Rajaji pleaded before the magistrate
for a lesser fine and for merciful treatment of the accused. Finally the amount
got reduced to <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 10 which also the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>accused was in a
position of despair to find the wherewithal to pay. Rajaji himself paid the
fine and admonished the erstwhile accused not to indulge in such games in
future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from his spirit of reformation of people with anti-social tendencies, he was
not lost to any feeling of humanity and con­sideration for erring mortals in society.
Very often he was found trying solutions for difficulties in which people were
caught and his mind proved active and resourceful in showing the way of
intelligence in straits of those who had become totally incapable of
restoration. Even domestic trifles engaged his attention of those who gained no
little relief by his advice and sincere approach to their problems. A young
doctor was commissioned to serve in the thick of the fight near the borders of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, wherein
the <span class=GramE>second world war</span> hostilities grew into heavy
proportions and inflicted casualties on Indian armies engaged in the fight. In
spite of the fact that as a Congressman he was for non-co-operation with the
war efforts of the <span class=SpellE>Britisher</span>, he advised the <span
class=SpellE>youngman</span> to join service in the theatre of active fight, as
it would give him vast experience and a sense of fearlessness in doing the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>duty<i> </i></span>of assuaging the pain of
the wounded and the disabled in war. The doctor was benefited much by that
advice, and for long he remembered the words of Rajaji in making him, proceed
without fear to the scene of war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

later years, however much he was inclined to induce people to repose faith in
the efficacy of religion, he was at the same time not forgetful of the claims
of rational thinking and liberal education on them. If he fought with
persistence the mass <span class=SpellE>innoculation</span> of the B.C.G. and
the methods of family-planning adopted by the Government, he was not for one
moment advancing any argument based on unscientific knowledge or mere belief or
sentiment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

always insisted on the wholesome concept of Dharma of our ancient land to be
the only guide for us in all our integral activities. In following Dharma his
mind normally harkened back to the dictates of scriptures such as the Gita and
the Upanishads. The doctrine of duty without attachment to the fruits of one’s <span
class=SpellE>labours</span> held him from the very first in its firm grasp. His
efforts to spread the message of persons of light and wisdom like Marcus
Aurelius, <span class=SpellE>Avvai</span>, Socrates and <span class=SpellE>Tirumular</span>
did not stop at all till his last breath. In unadorned simplicity, his language
spoke the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wisdom of an ardent soul, ready to <span
class=SpellE>recognise</span> merit wherever it was found. Thus in extracting
supporting passages for his informative articles, he showed no disinclination

remembrance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

procedure for raising a vast populace, which though not literate cent per cent,

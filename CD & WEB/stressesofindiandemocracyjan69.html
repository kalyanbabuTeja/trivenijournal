grave problem of the stresses of Indian democracy posed by the eruption, in
recent times, of subversive and undemocratic trends and tendencies in the
country, is causing serious concern to all wise citizens, and it is essential
that there should be a full and frank debate on this problem, if democracy has
to survive stresses and to take firm root in our country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

legislative powers are distributed between the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>
and the different sub-constituent States, is not federal in the traditional or
technical sense. Dr. Ambedkar described the Indian Constitution as a federal
constitution, inasmuch as it establishes, what may be called, a dual polity
which consists of the <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place> at the <span
class=SpellE>Centre</span> and the States at the periphery, each endowed with
foreign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively by
the Constitution. He, however, took the precaution to add that the Constitution
had deliberately avoided the tight mould of federalism in which the American
Constitution was caught, and could be both unitary as well as federal according
to the requirements of time and circumstances. Our Constitution has made
specific provisions of a radical character, which empower the Union Government
to deal with the problem posed by any serious challenge to the observance of
the Constitution in the governance of the States, or to the unity and integrity
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

democracy; but the manner in which one party rule was conducted in all the
States and at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span> did not assist the
development of healthy and proper federal conventions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will be recalled that soon after Nehru’s death, for about two years before the
fourth general election was held, the public life in the country was rudely
disturbed by the eruption of violence in different cities, not excluding
university campuses. It then appeared that the opposition parties did not hope
to succeed in obtaining political power by ballot and became frustrated, angry
and in some instances showed traces of irresponsibility. Continuous exercise of
power developed complacence in the minds of the party in power, and whispers of
corruption in high places became very current. Public at large was dissatisfied
with the grave disparity between promises made by politicians and their actual
performance and a crisis of character overtook the whole community. In the
result, friends of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
began to fear and her enemies began to hope that the fourth general election
would be the last general election that Indian democracy will witness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, however, the fourth general election disclosed that a large mass of our
illiterate and semi-literate voters exercised remarkable political judgment and
more than half of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was lost to the Congress and began to be governed by United Front. This
development raised the fond hope in the minds of all democrats in this country
unattached to any political party that as result of the working of the Congress
and the United Front governments in different States, polarization of parties
on rational economic lines would take place and a new era in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
democracy would begin. Many people thought that the fourth general election,
far from being the last general election, was in fact the first true general
election in which the votes exercised their political choice in a vigorous
manner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

working of the United Front governments, however, disclosed that anti-<span
class=SpellE>Congressism</span>, which alone seemed to be their binding force,
was not enough to sustain the governance of the States from day to day for a
long time. Fissures soon began to appear and public controversies were carried
on by the constituents of the United Front governments themselves. If only the
United Front governments can succeed in governing their respective States on
the commonly agreed minimum socio-economic programme, it would still assist the
development of true democratic traditions in his country. But it is essential
that all political parties must treat political power not as an end in itself,
but as a means to bring about a socio-economic revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first stress of Indian democracy arises primarily from the fact that defection
and crossing of the floor has become very common. Except for members who stand
for election as independents, all other elected members owe a loyalty to the
party on whose ticket they were elected. Defection is, in my judgment,
undemocratic, unethical, and has a tendency of subverting the faith of the
public in democracy itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

verbally condemning defections; but I think it would be legitimate to say that
each political party is playing the game, and defections have led, in some
cases, to the formation of minority governments, which is totally undemocratic.
In some States, President’s rule has been introduced, and the process of
democracy has thereby been suspended. These developments have created in the
minds of the public at large, complete indifference and apathy to politics and
absolute lack of faith in politicians, their promises and their words. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Besides,
we cannot ignore the fact that the continuous rise in the cost of living and
the economic <span class=GramE>depression</span> from which the country at
large has suffered for some years, also cause frustration and anger in the
minds of common men and women, and that is a stress which the Indian democracy
faces today. This stress may not be articulate today; but when it grows in
dimensions, it is not unlikely to explode in violence. And this poses a grave
potential danger to the safety of our democracy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
a result of the political instability which seems to emerge from the current
unhealthy, undemocratic trends several subversive forces are raising their ugly
head in the public life of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Regionalism, <span class=SpellE>religionism</span>, <span class=SpellE>linguism</span>,
<span class=SpellE>casteism</span> and communalism, which are entirely
inconsistent with the secular democracy which the Constitution has built up for
India, are becoming more and more articulate and are showing signs of
disturbing the public life of the country. Chauvinism, which, according to the
dictionary, means: bellicose patriotism or Jingoism, is taking different forms.
The narrow loyalty to a citizen’s region or religion or language is
understandable and cannot be eliminated from public life. But loyalty to caste
and community is <span class=SpellE>ununderstandable</span> and must be treated
as a very grave danger to democracy. Even the loyalty to the region, language
or religion needs to be subordinated to the primary loyalty to India.
Otherwise, different regions will begin to feel, subconsciously in the first
instance and articulately later that they are <span class=SpellE>subnations</span>,
and federalism, as conceived by the constitution-makers, will lose to have any
meaning or significance. It is my hope and belief that these subversive trends
are a passing phase. I believe that in course of time, sooner rather than
later, all political parties will <span class=SpellE>realise</span> the danger
involved in the eruption of these subversive trends and tendencies. I do not
think that there is any need to make any radical change in the provisions of
the Constitution. The provisions of the Constitution are elastic enough to
admit of the development of healthy federal traditions. The Union Government in
its dealings with non-Congress governments must be wise, patient, tolerant,
understanding, sympathetic, but firm. The Union Government must scrupulously
avoid giving rise to a legitimate apprehension in the minds of non-Congress
governments that it is interested in putting an end to their rule and replacing
their rule either by the President’s rule or by some sort of made-up coalition.
On the other hand, non-Congress governments as well as Congress governments in
the States must <span class=SpellE>recognise</span> that in dealing with the
problems of their regions, the unity and integrity of India must never be overlooked.
All political parties owe allegiance to the Constitution and are equally
committed to democracy, the rule of law and the establishment of socio-economic
justice. In their approach to the problem of socio-economic justice, they may
differ; but the difference is one of emphasis, of pace, or of methodology. That
being so, it would be easy for all political parties to <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
the danger which Indian democracy is facing today and to evolve healthy,
democratic traditions which will combat the narrow subversive trends and
tendencies and make democracy safe, in this country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
am clearly of opinion that the task of fighting these narrow chauvinistic
tendencies must be undertaken primarily by the intellectuals who are not
committed to any political party, but who passionately believe in the basic
postulates of Indian democracy. Indian democracy believes in the rule of law,
in the achievement of socio-economic justice by the operation of law, in
secularism, in social equality and in economic justice. Unless, these
postulates become a part of the faith and belief in each one’s mind, and are
reflected in our individual and collective lives, the stresses which Indian
democracy is facing today will continue to disturb all wise men. In that sense,
Indian democracy is passing through a difficult phase. At this hour it is for
the intellectuals of this country to educate public opinion and carry on a
dialogue with political power. If such a dialogue is carried on vigorously,
articulately and ceaselessly, it will create a climate which itself will help
to conquer the present unhealthy trends which have posed stresses to Indian
democracy. I firmly believe that progressive, revolutionary ideas are mighty
weapons and if the intellectual community is dedicated to the task of spreading
these progressive, revolutionary ideas, it would not be difficult for Indian
democracy to withstand the stress which it faces today. The call of the hour is
addressed to each one of us, and each one of us must make up his or her mind
that whatever be our differences on any issue–social, economic, political or
religious–we must never forget that we are Indians first, Indians second and
Indians last. We must never forget that we are committed to democracy and to
the rule of law and that our primary loyalty must be to the unity and integrity
of India. I am a great optimist and though the stresses from which Indian
democracy seems to suffer sometimes disturb and even frighten me. I am always
prayerfully hoping that this passing phase will soon disappear and we will have
democratic institutions functioning in this country in a healthy and
progressive manner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

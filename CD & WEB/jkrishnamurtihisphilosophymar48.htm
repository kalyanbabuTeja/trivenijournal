at Adyar, when he announced in 1927 that he was not going to be world-teacher
and he repudiated the Messiahship. He woke up, as he says, from his dream to
the reality of life. Krishnamurti says that he knows no Sanskrit and has not
read the Upanishads. He does not like to know what other philosophers have said
or preached. He hates patterns and theories. He approaches the problem of
Reality from a fresh, unbiased and disinterested viewpoint, and this
originality of his thinking constitutes the uniqueness of his contribution to
world-culture. Today he is a seeker after Truth and he does not care for the
establishment of any organisation, school, or Asrama for the dissemination of
his ideas. Alone, calm and serene, Krishnamurti today lives in Madras, leading
the peaceful life of realisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Krishnamurti has not presented his philosophy in a
systematic form. His philosophy is strewn over his talks, lectures and answers
to numerous questions which have been put to him by his disciples and admirers.
According to him all sin, misery, confusion and contradiction are due to the
sense of duality. Each individual thinks of himself as one unit and the world
as the other. But the individual and the world are not two different entities
with separate problems. The individual and the world are one. “Your problem is
the world’s problem…..if you kill another, you are destroying yourself. You are
the centre of the whole, and without understanding yourself you cannot
understand Reality.” (Oak Grove Talks, Ojai, 1945). One has to go beyond the
pattern of duality in order to attain Truth. Common thinking leads to dualistic
pattern and opposites. What is wanted is right thinking which comes with
self-knowledge. “Without understanding yourself, you have no basis for thought;
without self-knowledge what you think is not true.” (Oak Grove Talks, Ojai,
1945). As long as the thinker separates himself from his thought, so long the
vain conflict of the opposites will continue. In right thinking there is union
of the thinker and his thought. When through right meditation the thinker and
his thought are thus integrated, there is joy and in joy the ‘ecstacy of the
Real’ is experienced and realised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Krishnamurti
does not believe in the reality of religious practices for salvation. “To me
all organised religions are utterly false. They do not, in my opinion, lead man
to the realisation of eternity.” (1933, Adyar Talks). Again he says elsewhere,
“I have followed all these old paths of discipleship and worship and I see they
are much too long, too complicated, unnecessary–because whatever path you may
follow, whatever God you may worship, whatever shrine you build, you are forced
at last to come back to yourself and solve that Self.” (Extracts from his talks
and writings, V–Star Publishing Trust). This Self is to be realised by clear
knowledge and understanding. The ego or the ‘I’ has to be banished. What is the
ego? According to him the ego is a mere symptom of spiritual ill-health. Those
who are spiritually backward, cannot feel the true and unimpeded flow of life.
They are always aware of obstruction and this obstruction constitutes their
‘I-ness’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
most philosophers, Krishnamurti too affirms that the cause and effect of
suffering is ‘I’. It is the ‘I’ that suffers. The ‘I’, however perfected and
glorified, cannot evade suffering and pain. <i>(Star Bulletin, </i>September-December,
1931). The ‘I’ is the seat of all desire and craving. There is no end to our
ever expanding desire. This desire leads to passion, ill-will, oppression and
war. Krishnamurti draws a distinction between ‘becoming’ and ‘being’.
‘Becoming’ according to him is conflict, sorrow and pain. But the self can
transcend the stage of becoming and rest in ‘unpremeditated clarity, a deep
ecstacy’. This stage is that of Being.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What,
according to Krishnamurti, is the character of the ultimate Reality? He is
rather chary of describing the Real which is causeless. Since discursive
thinking is occupied with Causation, it cannot comprehend Reality. The real for
him is to be experienced in self-knowledge. “Only in utter simplicity, when all
craving has ceased, is the bliss of Reality.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
does he view life and its opposite, death? For him life and death are one. Our
ideas of death, as something different from life, are due to our sense of
duality. “We think-feel in terms of time, of living, of becoming beyond death.
The pattern of our thought-feeling moves from the known to the unknown, from
the past to the present, to the future; if there is fear of the future, it
clings to the past or to the present. We are held in time, and how can we, who
think-feel in terms of time, experience the reality of timelessness in which
life and death are one!” (Oak Grove Talks, Ojai, 1945). Life is often
misunderstood. Had it been properly understood by clear thinking, the mysteries
of Reality would have been solved. While answering certain questions,
Krishnamurti on several occasions has identified Life with God or Ultimate
Reality. Here is his final account of life. (See J. Krishnamurti: Extracts from
his talks and writings, Vol. II–Star Publishing Trust).</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
concluding, let us try to determine the place of Krishnamurti in the history of
contemporary Indian Philosophy. Contemporary Indian Philosophy begins from Raja
Rammohun Roy. Maharshi Devendranath, Keshab Chandra, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda,
Dayananda, Rama Tirtha, Sri Aurobindo, Rabindranath, Gandhi, Radhakrishnan and
Krishnamurti, are the prominent philosophers of contemporary India. All of
them, save Krishnamurti, have re-interpreted the ancient Indian Philosophy.
There is hardly a philosophical idea in them that cannot be traced to the perennial
spring of the Vedas and the Upanishads. But Krishnamurti, as mentioned earlier,
approaches the problems of philosophy from the standpoint of clear reason. His
approach, in this respect, is heterodox. Another common feature of contemporary
Indian thinking is that philosophy and religion are inter. twined. But, to
Krishnamurti, religion is of no value. Unlike the thinkers mentioned above, he
has presented his philosophy, not on the setting of religion but on right
thinking. The chief contribution of Krishnamurti to modern Indian culture lies
in his emphasis on the removal of the sense of duality which leads to evil,
pain and suffering. The problem of the Self is the greatest problem and its
solution lies in proper knowledge. Krishnamurti, as a seeker after right
knowledge of the Self, can well be ranked with the Jnanayogins of all ages and
climes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

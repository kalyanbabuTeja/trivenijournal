style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The word ‘Religion’ derived from Latin words, ‘Re’
and ‘Liegere’ or ‘Ligare,’ means bind back; that is to say, it means that which
binds human beings to each other in the bonds of love and sympathy and fellow
feelings in their mutual rights and duties; which themselves will bind back to
God, the Universal Soul. This power of binding together hearts of men in unison
with God has given birth to a particular religion to different people,
countries or nations. And really every new birth of a religion has given birth
to a new civilization in the world. Therefore the one purpose of religion is to
realize the self within ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In these days of strife and chaos and communal
feelings, it has become an incumbent duty for us to make a comparative study of
the religion, or rather the civilization, of the other sect or community,
which, as Max Muller says, ‘will teach us the divine education of the human
race’. It may be that we shall find many imperfections or obscurities in the
religions of other communities or countries, not to say of our own religion.
Max Muller in his book on the <i>Science of Religion </i>has given a suitable
reply: “God has not provided for the interest of men by a new counsel or late
compassion; He had instituted from the beginning for all men one and the same
path of Salvation…….Now what might be the explanation for the necessary
imperfections of the early religions of mankind?…A mother may indeed offer to
her infant a complete repast, but her infant cannot yet receive the food which
is meant for full-grown men. In the same manner God might indeed from the
beginning have offered to men the truth in its completeness, but man was unable
to receive it, for he was still a child.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Before going deeper into the subject matter, let me
refer here to two interesting stories (which will show that really there is no
diversity in different religions), one from Islamic books and the other from
the scriptures of the Hindus. Once upon a time an Arab, a Persian, a Rumi and a
Turk happen to travel on the same path of life. The path is surely long and
thorny, necessarily they become tired and hungry; now they require food which
will give them nourishment of strength and peace. They have their coins which
they place forward. But they do not know one another’s tongues. They begin
quarrelling among themselves asking in their own languages, the Arab, as
‘Enab,’ the Persian, as ‘Angur,’ the Rumi, as ‘Astafil’, the Turk, as ‘Uzam’.
In the meantime a well-informed fruit-seller passes by. He readily understands
their several languages of them and satisfies them by supplying the grapes
which they require. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The other story runs thus: Two persons are hotly
disputing as to the colour of chameleon: One say, “The chameleon the palm-tree
is of a beautiful red colour. The other contradicts him saying that the camel
is not red but blue. Being unable to come to a decision, they both go to a man
who lives under the tree and has watched the chameleon in all its phases of
colour. He satisfies them both by saying that they both are right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Muslims have their religion, which is called
‘Islam’. The word ‘Islam’, (derived from ‘Salama’, to surrender) means the calm
resignation and surrender of one’s own lower self to the higher Self or God. In
the same way the Hindus have their own religion which is called ‘Sanatan’ or
‘Vaidik’ Dharma, <i>i. e.,</i> the everlasting or the scientific religion. (The
word ‘Hindu” or ‘Hinduism,’ is really a misnomer, which has originated from the
word ‘Hind’ or ‘Sind’ or ‘Indus,’ <i>i.e., </i>the people living by the sides
of the river Indus, and consequently the people are called in English as
Indians). The word ‘Dharma’ (derived from ‘Dhri’, to hold and bind together)
means that by holding which one may attain the goal of life. And this is not
possible without surrendering one’s own lower self to God. The Sanatan or
Vaidik Dharma is only the everlasting or scientific principles for attaining
the Higher Universal Self,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Every religion has been described as the ‘Command
or Revelation of God’, which was presented to us by the Prophet, the Paigambar
(Messenger), or the Avatara (One who descends). We have our Quran revealed to
the Prophet Muhammad, the message-bearer, who received the commands of God sent
to him through the Holy Spirit. In the same way, we have our Krishna, the
Avatara, who descended to this world for the well being of men, and in the
inspired moment advised Arjuna–the words collected together have been named the
Gita. In the Hindu religion there are many other Avataras, or Great Souls who
presented their sacred words to the world–such as Upanishad, the sayings of
different ‘Rishis’–which is generally known as Vedanta, and Dhammapada, the
words of Buddha. In the same way the Muslims also had other prophets, such as
Abraham, Moses and Jesus. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>All the prophets have proclaimed the same truth of
the universality of their own religions. The Quran declares, “This that I am
now uttering unto you, the Holy Quran–is to be found in the ancient Seers’
writings too; for teachers have been sent to every race.” The Gita also utters
likewise, “The teaching I am giving you, was given by Vivaswat to Manu, by Manu
to Ikshvaku, and then by many rishis, age after age.” And Maulana Rumi in his <i>Masnavi</i>,
which has often been called the Quran in the Persian language, says, “By loving
wisdom does the soul know life; what has it got to do with the senseless strife
of the Hindus and Muslims?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We find that only the names differ, the thing meant
is always the same. Let us consider the different words for God and a human
being ‘Allah’ means all-powerful. ‘Bhagavan’ also means the same. Khuda means
One who comes himself (for our salvation). And ‘Hari’ means ‘One’ who attracts
(the hearts of others to Himself). Likewise the Arabic equivalent for man is
‘Insan; (from ‘ins, uns, sympathy) which means ‘the Friend of his kind,’ <i>i.e.,
</i>a good man; and the Sanskrit word ‘Arya’ (from r to go) means the person to
whom others go for relief, <i>i.e., </i>a good man or a gentleman. The words
‘manava’ and ‘admi’ mean also man,–which words have been originated from the
words Manu (one of the earliest Seers of the Vedic scriptures) and adam (the
first of the human race according to Muslim authority), respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>We have seen that religion stands for something,
which is the fundamental basis of life. Then what is the purpose of life?
According to Hinduism, it is ‘dharma’, ‘artha’, ‘kama’ and ‘moksha’ the first
three of which should be cultured in the first half of life and the second half
of life should be devoted to the achievement of the final goal ‘Moksha’ ‘najat’
or salvation, i.e., to be merged into God; the first three being used only for
the preparation of the fourth or last. ‘Dharma’ is equivalent to Diyanat,
signifying the laws and principles for making the life regulated, with the,
help of ‘Artha’, daulat or wealth. And taking these two as support, one is to
satisfy his desire or kama, or lazzatud-dunya (or sense-joy), as the Muslims
say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Ordinarily, the following are taken as essentials
of the religion of Islam: – (i) Belief in Allah, the all-powerful, and His
prophet Muhammad and the other prophets preceding him; belief in the Quran, as
the words of God and the Day of Judgement; (ii)‘Namaj’ or prayer; (iii) Zakat
or charity; and (iv) Hajj or pilgrimage. Likewise, the Hindus also have faith
in Bhagavan, the All-powerful, and His Avataras such as Rama, Krishna or Buddha
with their sacred words. They have also faith in the Judgement of Yama, the
King of Hell; Sandhya-Gayatri and Upasana (prayer and fasting), Dano (charity)
and Tirtha-yatra (pilgrimage).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the following are the main aspects of religion or the realization of the Higher
Self: – (a) Shari’cat; (b) ‘Tariqat.; (c) Haqiqat and M’arifat; <i>i.e., </i>(a)
the way of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>rites and ceremonials, in
other words, the way of actions performed selflessly; or the Karma-Yoga in
Vedic language; (b) the way of love and devotion for the Bhakti-Yoga; and (c)
the way of Truth and Knowledge or Jnana-Yoga. These are not really different
paths. These various methods are given only to suit the different tendencies of
individuals. And being developed they will find that these were meant only for
the preliminary progress in the path of realization; otherwise they all lead to
the same goal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

different systems. He has been described in the Quran, as ‘La ilah il Allah’,
(There is no God except He); in the same way the Upanishad says,
‘Ekamevadvitiyam, (one only without a second). God is not only the One alone,
but He is the only Reality; He is the All-pervading One and there is nothing
beside Him. The Quran declares, Allah surrounds and encloses all–His light

planes to reach the highest plane where perfection (kamalyat) is attained.
These are the five recognised ‘worlds’ of the Sufis: (a) ‘alam-i-nasut’ (the
world of humanity or this world of phenomena) (b) ‘alam-i-malakut’ (the world
of purity and angelic state, or the world of spirits and angels); (c)
‘alam-i-Jabrut’ ‘the world of power and splendour); (d) ‘alam-i-Lahut’ (The
world of Divinity, relatively visible and comprehensible); (e) ‘alam-i-hahut’
(the world of absolute existence which is invisible and incomprehensible).
Besides these five there are other two planes called Bahut and Rahut, which are
the worlds of attributes. As the Sufis speak of seven planes, so the Hindus say
of ‘Saptaloka,’ They are: Satya, Tapa, Jana, Maha Sva, Bhuva, and Bhu. Of
these, the description of Satya-Loka, Jana-Loka, Tapa-Loka, and Bhu-Loka has
much similarity with that of Hahut, Lahut, Jabrut and Nasut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is somewhat difficult and it would require much
space to show side by side all the similarities that can be pointed out between
these two systems. Therefore, I have tried to show only the most interesting
ones which may easily be comprehended by every one who cares for and thinks of
religion. Let me add here another point of the Sufistic writers. We have seen
that Persian poetry, which is in essence Sufistic, is full of ‘ishq’ and
‘muhabbat’ (love), and the “aashiq” and “mash-uq” (the lover and the beloved).
So in the books of the writings of the Vaishnavas (followers of Vishnu, one
name of God, who maintain that the ideal can be approached through love and
devotion), we find that they are full of ‘prem’ and ‘bhakti’ (love and
devotion); and ‘premiki’ and ‘premika’ (the Lover and the Beloved). And there
is no book of the Vaisnavites, which has not described the love of
Radha-krishna. In the same way we may say that there is no Sufistic poem which
has not referred to the love of Yusuf and Zulaikha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Let us consider here some general principles of
life. And let us see what the two systems say regarding these. The Quran
commands, “Slay none; God has forbidden it, except when justice
requires.....And avoid false words…..women and men who steal shall lose their
hands. Intoxications are Satan’s own device….They who avoid unlawfulness in sex
and watchfully and resolutely control their senses, alone achieve success.” In
the same way, Manu, the first law-giver of the Hindus, declares, “Ahimsa
(harmlessness), Satyam (truth), Asteyam (honesty), Saucham (cleanliness) and
Indriya-nigraham (control of passion), are the whole duties of men in brief.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Reverence for parents has been enjoined in both the
systems. The Quran says, “Bilwalidaini ihsana,” (serve and revere the parents).
The Veda also declares likewise, “…..pitrudevo bhava, matridevo bhava” (let
your parents be your god). About marriage the Quran orders us, “You may marry
two, three or four wives, but not more; but if you cannot deal equitably and
justly with all, you shall marry only one”. Manu also suggests in the same way,
“They (the husband and wife) shall perform all the duties of life together,
side by side, and be faithful to each other unto death and beyond.” About
courtesy and behaviour the Quran ordains, “Idfa’ b-illati he-ya ahsan.”
(Recompense evil, conquer it with good). In the same way Manu declares, “Don’t
be angry with those who are angry with you, with sweet words reply the harsh
words.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of God, for the weak in men, women and children,” and we find that he was
himself leader in the battles fought at his time. In the same way, we find
Krishna after giving so many precepts to Arjuna, in the Gita, says at last,
“Therefore fight (against the wrong-doer and oppressor).” And Krishna himself
fought so many battles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Thus we can show that the fundamentals of both the
religions are the same in spirit, and it must be such; now if there is any
difference, it is in the outer garb, by which is meant the formal rites and
ceremonials, wheal also we find that there are many resemblances: the Hindus
perform their initiations, the Muslims their Sunnat; both the systems use
rosary (mala or tasbih) for helping their concentration of mind and both of
them have special posture and movements of body and limbs at the time of
prayer; both have so many sects and sub-sects, though in Hinduism they are
innumerable, and in Islam, they are not more than thirty: (probably, it is for
the reason that Hinduism is so old, and the latter is so recent–and it is to be
wondered at that of these sects and sub-sects no reference is to be found in
the scriptures of their systems. Of the Hindu caste system, no doubt there is
reference to it in their scriptures, but the caste system of the Holy Books and
the caste system that is current in society are quite different). Both have
their priests–the Hindus have pujari and purohita; the Muslims have mulla,
mufti and mua’zzim: the Hindus have sadhu, bairagi and sannyasi; the Muslims
have faqir, darvesh and aulia: Both have monasteries; the Hindus have math and
akhra; the Muslims have dargah and khanqah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the outer garb. In such cases, we should always consider of the spirit; where
it is necessarily the same. Here we may refer to the story said by Maulana Rumi
in his Masnavi that Moses once rebuked a shepherd who prayed to God to appear
before him so that he might put a pair of shoes on His feet. The voice of God
came down and rebuked Moses, “We do not care for the language and word, we see
to the condition of the heart–we sent you to bring souls near to Me and not to
throw them away from Me.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

they are called, are not real Muslims if they have not sacrificed their lower
selves for the realization of the Higher Self or God; or have at least tried to
do the same. In the same way we cannot call a Hindu to be a true Hindu if he is
not really following the main principles of his Vedic Dharma. On the other
hand, if a person of the Hindu Community has performed all the duties of life,
and thus has realized the Universal Soul he is not only a true Hindu, but also
a true Muslim too. Indeed there are man and man–the godly-man and the
animal-man–of which the former should always be counted, and he is both a true
Muslim and a true Hindu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

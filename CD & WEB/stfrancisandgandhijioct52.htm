style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the fourth anniversary of the death of Mahatma Gandhi, a conference was held at
Perugia, in Central Italy, to initiate a world-wide movement based on
non-violence, love and service,–the cardinal virtues embodied in the lives of
both St. Francis of Assisi and of Gandhiji. The moving spirit behind this
gathering was Prof. Aldo Capitini,–a well-known writer on religion and
philosophy and a firm believer in Gandhiji’s non-violent methods as a means for
outlawing war and establishing peace and human fellowship. Perugia is only a
few miles away from Assisi, the home-town of St. Francis–a beautiful town on
the slopes of Monte Subasio–a town still alive and fragrant with the spirit of
that gentle saint who has influenced and inspired so many generations of
mankind, Christian and non-Christian alike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
gathering brings vividly and forcefully to mind the striking similarities (and
contrasts) between these two great personalities, who have proved by the
example of their own lives how much more powerful is the spirit of love and
sacrifice than physical force and might. And the power of this spirit is all
the more forcefully revealed because the age, the background and the
circumstances under which the two lived are so very different. St. Francis, who
lived from 1182 to 1226, was born in an age of<i> </i>heroes and wars and
romance,–an age of great passions and enthusiasms. Although it was an age when
men were crude and unlettered and cruel, they were simple and straightforward
like little children. And this directness and simplicity, albeit refined and
elevated, characterised St. Francis as a true product of his age. He is one of
the simplest and sincerest characters in European history. Gandhiji’s
background, even though in India, was typically 19th century ‘bourgeois’.
Superficially, no contrast could be greater–and yet the same fire of the spirit
moved them both. It is not improbable that, had St. Francis lived in an unfree
India with its vast social and political problems, he would have been less of a
mystic and more of a ‘social reformer’ and that Gandhiji, in the 13th century,
would have devoted himself exclusively to religious and spiritual experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Love
and sympathy for the lowest of God’s creation is not a sentiment unknown to
Indians. The unity of all life has been intuited by the most ancient of our
sages, and our whole philosophy of life is based on it. But St. Francis at
first lent himself to ridicule when he called the ass and the wolf his brothers
and addressed the birds as his sisters. So much at one was he with the whole of
creation, that he regarded the sun, the moon and even the fire as his brethren:
“Praised be Thou, Lord, for all Thy creatures and especially for my brother the
Sun which gives us the day, and by him Thou showest Thy light. He is beautiful,
shining with great splendour: and of Thee, O Most High, he is the symbol.” Such
wide pantheism was till then unknown in Christianity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:25.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
love for the underdog, for ‘the poor, the lowly, and the lost,’ was well-known.
“He had a great liking for people who had been put hopelessly in the
wrong”...“He listened to those to whom God Himself would not listen.” Gandhiji
was always more concerned about the one erring sheep than the ninety-nine whole
ones. Both had that trait which mystics and genuises possess and which seems so
ridiculous to ordinary people, a trait of not being able to distinguish between
‘small’ and ‘great’ things, ‘important’ and ‘unimportant’ ones. St. Francis
once went to Rome to interview the Emperor and to appeal to him to save the
lives of some little birds. He went with two companions to convert the whole
world of Islam to Christianity! Gandhiji never sought refuge in numbers nor was
he afraid to ‘walk alone’. He was prepared to, and did, disband organizations
and movements of millions of people, if one little detail went wrong somewhere
or if one man fell away from the ideals which inspired them all. St. Francis
based his life on vows and ideals which seemed rash and impracticable at first,
but which always turned out right. His life was a blend of an innate artistry
and a deep faith,–a faith in the Whole, not in the minor details that provoke
doubt. His whole life was a beautiful poem. Of Gandhiji it is said that he was
a very ordinary man who set himself impossible standards and lived by them. He
too had great faith and was an artist in action. All his acts breathed a pure
and simple beauty because they came from the heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>St.
Francis achieved in his person that which is rare anywhere,–a harmonious
mingling of a deep mysticism and a profound humanism. He was the world’s one
quite sincere democrat and a divine demagogue’, the ‘first hero of humanism’
and the precursor of the modern spirit,–of the spirit of the Renaisance an
anticipator of Wordsworth and Tolstoy. But he was not an ‘intellectual like
Tolstoy; it was not ideas that moved him but the men embodying these ideas.
“And as St. Francis did not love mankind but men, he did not love Christianity
but Christ.” With an utter child-like simplicity and a ‘personal passion’, he
loved and worshipped God as a Superior Person who was full of love and wisdom.
To him, “religion was not a theory or philosophy but a love affair.” Because he
loved God so passionately, he saw, loved and reverenced Him in all His
creatures. “He treated the whole mob of men as a mob of kings.” A leper was to
him more lovely and lovable than an average healthy man, for God would judge
his love for Himself by the way he served and loved the leper. Gandhiji always
found his home amongst those dubbed the lowest by society, for he considered
them, above all, the real ‘children of God’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lives of both St. Francis and Gandhiji have been the noblest fulfillment of the
Beatitude: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” In the
persons of these two, the meek, the gentle, the poor and the lowly of the world
have come into their own. One of the foremost of French writers today, Francois
Mauriac, has pointed out how the same fire, the same faith that guided St. Francis
driven out from the Christian Occident, has been “re-lit among the idols and
found a niche between the ribs of that old, indomitable ‘skeleton’–Gandhi”. He
calls it an all-powerful gentleness because it brooks no compromise with evil.
The faith of St. Francis was that of a fighter, not that of an ‘appeaser’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A great humility and personal modesty are the
hall-mark of the meekness of the strong. St. Francis said of himself: “His most
holy eyes have nowhere seen a greater, a more miserable, poorer sinner than I.
Because in the whole world He found no more wretched being to do the wonderful
work He wishes done, therefore He has chosen me, so as to put to shame the
noble and the great, strength and beauty and worldly wisdom; that all may know
that power and virtue come from Him alone, and not from any creature, and that
no one can exalt themselves before His face.” Gandhiji has said: “I must reduce
myself to zero. So long as man does not of his own free-will put himself last
among his fellow-creatures, there is no salvation for him. Ahimsa is the
farthest limit of humility.” Both Gandhiji and St. Francis were their own
harshest critics. They forgave themselves much less readily than they did
others. They willingly took upon themselves the burdens of others. It is said
of St. Francis that his whole life was a penance–“He was always clearing away
the rubbish in himself, and opening new windows through which the light of God
could stream in.” Gandhiji always attempted to ‘purify’ himself by fasts or by
other deprivations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>St.
Francis was wedded to the ‘Lady Poverty’ and known as ‘Il Poverello’ (the
Little Poor Man). His poverty was not a negative concept, but a positive
‘passion’. To quote G. K. Chesterton, “It was not a regimen or a stoical
simplicity of life. It was not self-denial merely in the sense of self-control.
It was as positive as a passion; it had all the air of being as positive as a
pleasure. He devoured fasting as a man devours food. He plunged after poverty
as men have dug madly for gold.” He knew the spiritual dangers of possessions,
for he was a rich man’s son and had enjoyed the material pleasures of life in
his early youth. St. Francis reduced his worldly necessities to a minimum and
his Third Order was known as the Order of Penance, to enable the average man to
take part in his mission without giving up his home and normal routine, for, to
St. Francis, “the crumbs were as precious as the loaves.” “He possessed
nothing, and having nothing, gathered all things to himself.” Gandhiji’s God
was the God of the poor–‘Daridranarayan.’ He identified himself with the
poorest and the most miserable of humanity and tried to alleviate their
sufferings. Neither of them believed in laying up for themselves treasures on
earth. Cheerfulness in asceticism and the joy of non-possession were common to
both. St. Francis had gone a long way from the gloomy severity of St. Paul. To
quote Chesterton again, “There was so much about him of the spirit of the
morning, so much that was curiously young and clean, that even what was bad in
him was good. As it was said of others that the light in their body was
darkness, so it may be said of this luminous spirit that the very shadows in
his soul were of light. Evil itself could not come to him save in the form of a
forbidden good; and he could only be tempted by a sacrament.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji
always called himself a ‘practical idealist’–not a theoretician. He did not
believe in ideas which he could not put into practice nor live in his own life.
Every truth had to be lived out. To St. Francis also, the spiritual life had to
be ‘lived,’ not just ‘believed in’. He was a man of action, not a dreamer. “To
and do something was one of the driving demands of his nature.” “His life was a
triumphant vindication of the truth of Christian ethics.” He put Christianity
into practice and by his shining example proved the reality and the truth of
the life of Jesus. He had a passion for martyrdom, not out of personal vanity,
but to come as near as possible to the example of Jesus. There is hardly a Christian
in this century who has lived so near to Christ or led a life so inspired and
guided by the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount as Gandhiji.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
both St. Francis and Gandhiji it may unhesitatingly be said that they left the
world a much better place than they found it,–the world is the richer for their
having lived. In moving prose, Chesterton describes how St. Francis changed the
whole aspect of nature with his beautiful presence: how the birds and the trees
and the flowers–the stars, water, and fire–returned to their primeval grace and
innocence. “All these things are as if newly created, awaiting new names, from
one who shall come to name them. They await a new reconciliation with man, but
they are already capable of being reconciled. Man has stripped from his soul
the last rag of the cult of nature and can now return to nature.” In no less
beautiful and noble words, Jawaharlal Nehru has paid this tribute to his
Master: “Great men and eminent men have monuments in marble set up for them,
but this man of divine fire managed in his life-time to become enmeshed in
millions and millions of hearts so that all of us became somewhat of the stuff
that he was made of, though to an infinitely lesser degree...In ages to come,
centuries and maybe millenniums after us, people will think of this generation
when this man of God trod the earth and will think of us who, however small,
could also follow his path and probably tread on that holy ground where his
feet had been.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>has a long foreword by
Prof. V. B. He tells us: “This new bunch of Polish tales forms a sequence to
the <i>Polish Short Stories </i>published last year; and though it includes the
names of five authors only, against eleven in the first volume, it brings us a
no less rich crop of realistic prose poetry, typical folk-lore, and recent history
in striking images.” I came across the name of Stefan Zeromski in the <i>Polish
Short Stories, </i>whose novel <i>Ashes </i>(translated by Stephen Garry) was
published in England during the Twenties, followed after a long interval by
another novel, <i>The Faithful River. </i>It was said of Zeromski that he
marked an epoch in Polish fiction. In characterization he is tender and
realistic, and his theme-motif, mainly, is human suffering. In the present
tales, the men and women brought together are intensely alive; they are creatures,
one feels, to be an integral part of the flora and fauna of the universe; and
those who cannot stand stark realism for long, will be compensated to find here
creative imagination soaring to memorable heights, and a lovely flowering of
poignant sensibility and poetic tenderness amid episodes of horror and hatred
and bravery. “Peasant Wedding” and “Contrasts” by Wadylaw Reymont, the Nobel
prize-winner in 1924, are two of the most impressive of the nine stories which
go to make this anthology. A reviewer of short fiction is more often tempted to
hurl a brick-bat (paper, of course, to escape the charge of grievous hurt or
culpable homicide) at the author; for this difficult literary form, today, is
caught despairing in the frivolous hands of the dilettante; here is a bouquet
(not paper) to Umadevi, the editor of <i>The Wintermaidens–</i>stories that
glow with life. But neither she nor Prof. V. B. who has written a rather heavy
introduction, trying to relieve the heaviness by an ineffectual stroke of wit
like–“Maryna is a girl’s name and has nothing to do with Madras’s beautiful
beach road”–has told us as to who is responsible for the fervour of rendering
these Polish tales into English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ramakrishnanda was a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and was the
first apostle of Sri Ramakrishna-Vivekananda to work in South India. The
epoch-making work of Swami Vivekananda and the concrete achievements of the
Ramakrishna Mission in the educational, social, and religious sphere are well
known. Sri Ramakrishnananda (1863-1911) had the supreme privilege of being the
personal attendant of the great Master during his last days, and was the
‘nucleus’ of the Ramakrishna Math before it was formally established. As
desired by Swami Vivekananda, Sri Ramakrishnanda moved down to Madras in 1897
and the ‘leaven’ began to work in a small way. The intellectual elite of Madras
welcomed the new gospel, as indeed they had the privilege and the pre-vision to
discover the great Swami Vivekananda in 1892 and help his heroic mission to
America to the Parliament of Religions. How the Ramakrishna Math and Mission
founded just over fifty years ago has grown and flourished and shed its
beneficent influence is a matter of history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of saints–particularly those who like the followers of Sri Ramakrishna lived in
the world and were of it, but with their minds fixed on the eternal values of
life–are a perennial source of inspiration. Sri Ramakrishnananda was a unique
personality and combined within himself the achievements of vigorous spiritual <i>sadhana,
</i>great gifts of teaching and exposition, organising ability of a high order,
added to amiable human virtues which enabled him in a far-off province to
establish himself in the hearts of people. The story of such a dedicated life,
which is a chapter of the religious renaissance in Modern India is told in this
volume. The narration is as interesting as it is authentic. Sri
Ramakrishnananda’s relationships with his great Master and his tireless
devotion to his relics and the shrine at Cossipore, Baranagore, and Alambazar,
how he held together the distinguished band headed by Swami Vivekananda and
tended them–these are moving passages in the book. The Swamiji’s life and work
are fully dealt with and make inspiring reading. The Publishers are entitled to
the grateful appreciation of the public for this Golden Jubilee publication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

book contains six chapters-originally contributed as articles to the weekly <i>Swatantra
</i>of Madras. Though presumably of only topical interest and value, their
collection in the form of this booklet is fully justified because of the fact
that the author who is a deep thinker and a persuasive writer has approached
the problems confronting us in a spirit of lofty idealism, and has brought to
bear on it what may be compendiously termed the Gandhian outlook. The author
feels that “free India has a definite message to give. The world in sorrow and
suffering today expects one from us.” He desires that the Central Executive
should be reconstituted and there should be thirty members of whom ten shall be
free from any portfolios. It is his profound conviction that good government
requires only one party. He fears that a third global war is looming on the
horizon but wants India to build up her moral and material strength quickly so
as to remain neutral. “Let us drop all our vague ecstasies and sentimental love
of Russia,” advises the author. Analysing our home problems, the author pleads
as Gandhiji did, for making a group of villages the “basic foundation of our
political and economic structure” and wishes the Draft Indian Constitution to
have begun with the villiage and proceeded upwards. The author is well aware of
our national defects and does not mince matters when analysing them and pleads
with fervour for a determined drive to renovate Indian life and character! The
chapter on the Draft Constitution and Our Ideals contains many
thought-provoking ideas and categorical suggestions which show that the author
is a practical idealist. Some of his suggestion are:– <o:p></o:p></span></p>

human being is nature’s fall from a state of innocency; but it is not a
decline, it is rather an ascent, in that a state of conscience is higher than a
state of innocence,” says Thomas Mann. Nature is explored but not realized.
Scientists interpret what could be known and harnessed for the knowledge and
benefit of man in nature. The songs of the mystics bear evidence to the fact
that nature finds in man its ascent and not decay. Those who perceive in wonder
and awe that supreme joy of a perfect construction and grace in all creation
are they, in whom, even beyond the state of conscience, a non-dual state is
reached. That is the abode of the mystic. He is beyond nature in that nature is
spiritualized in him. He is beyond man in that man is dissolved in him. He is
neither nature nor man, but a moving flame of pence that has neither birth nor
end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is more a land of the mystics than any other nation of the world though the poems
of Donne, Blake, and Francis Thompson have profundity of thought. Nations and
nationalities may differ from one another in ways of life and habits. The
mystics of the world have only one voice and one language. They know no
barriers; they care little for the wrath of those that rule over them, tyrant
or despot; they attach little importance to the study of books, they always
seek and suffer for getting a glimpse of that <i>Atman </i>who is the secret of
the Creative Sound. Life has a great meaning for them and is accepted by them

wisdom he acquired from his Master in whose guidance and personality he had
implicit faith. He realized that the secret of harmony is in one’s Self.
“Giving up all scriptural recitation, awake and behold the Beloved within thee!”
In short he echoes the fundamentals of the religions of the world. An ethical

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Kasturi has achieved a remarkable blend of delightful humour and wistful pathos
in his latest novel. Mahabala Rao’s reactions to his retirement from
officialdom form the main theme. A disciple of Gokhale, he has started life as
teacher under the auspices of the Servants of India Society. He has been lured
later by his parents into a submissive married life and a mechanical clerkly
career. After retirement, he takes up the thread of social service by becoming
manager and contributor to two newspapers holding contradictory views on almost
all subjects. This is in the best traditions of parliamentary democracy as well
as a popularising strategem. One of the dailies is edited by his son Nagaraj,
and the other by his old friend Rama Iyengar. As Special Correspondent in
Bombay for several Kannada newspapers, Nagaraj has disobliged his employers by
sending reports of sociological and cultural import, rather than items of
sensational news. However, he has soon been driven to pot-boiling. When his
uncle buys <i>Sankha-vadya </i>and appoints him as its quite independent
editor, he revitalizes this newspaper with his revived idealism. On the other
hand, Rama Iyengar has turned to journalism after seeing through the
pseudo-spirituality of his own life as a common sannyasi. The triple pattern of
initiation, apostasy, and re-conversion to humanitarianism which is worked out
in Mahabala Rao’s life is given definition and emphasis by the repetition on a
small scale in the lives of these two minor characters. Then, too, the novel is
mostly taken up with the several, at first futile efforts, to pass from the
second phase of this pattern to the third, to pursue again the visions of
youth. Hence the aptness of the title which is suggestive, in Kannada idiom, of
lamentations at once desolate and ludicrous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
amount of comment, in the absence of actual reading, can give a true indication
of the gusto of Mr. Kasturi’s writing, of the sparkling humour under which lie
such treasures of significance. It is no less abundant than spontaneous. The
novel opens with a most exquisite dialogue, Mahabala Rao has squeezed himself
into his old navy-blue wedding-suit in order to attend a farewell party in his
honour at the office; and his wife asks him to extricate himself from it. He
has, however, a special fondness for it as it symbolizes for him his vanished
youth, and when he starts life all over again as newspaper manager, it is this
suit that he hunts out. One chapter describes his disastrous effort to reduce
his fat by the practice of a <i>Yogasana, </i>and another gives an account of
the first meal after his retirement which he can at least take with the
slowness required for aesthetic enjoyment and critical judgment. Then there is
the delicious scene in the overcrowded compartment in which, travelling from
Bombay, Nagaraj rejoices on his uncomfortable perch to hear the exchange of
even indecent abuse down below, in his dear native Kannada. Except for a couple
of lapses into farce and an occasionally irritating habit of ungrammatically
twisting parts of words and well-worn sayings for satirical purposes, the novel
makes most delightful reading throughout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a general idea of the author and the art and craft of writing this is a useful
little publication. It discusses, among other things, the need for book-clubs

ago–a new-style book-club consisting of about a dozen members who speak out

and rendering them in gesture. As a result of the residue of <i>prarabdha, </i>he
falls in love with a harijan maiden who was also a servant of the Lord. She cut
fodder for the temple elephant. The God-intoxicated men are above the barriers
of caste and creed; and Varadaraja woos and wins the harijan girl for his
bride. He is discarded by the high-case men and disowned by the harijans. He
puts up a hut on the bank of the river Kaveri, away from the precincts of the
orthodox. Enshrining the Lord in his heart as a true bhakta, he lives his life
in the company of his harijan wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Man’s attitude to perfection has been anomalous and
in-consistent throughout the ages. When attained, even perfection becomes
monotonous and savourless. There is then a renewed quest for new modes of
perfection. The social reality in fact is only the residue left by ebbing
Utopias. We dream in terms of a living language, but wake up with all the
fretful confusion of a dead dialect. And accordingly our Utopias and our
Infernos, our Heavens and our Hells, change their aspect from to time.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Man’s
progress can be measured by a proper balancing of the Utopian accounts in
history of his failures and successes, his shortcomings and his noble
endeavours. While Utopias explain how society can be reconstructed in order to
make happiness universal and permanent, the anti-Utopias counsel caution and
patience and serene gradualism in human affairs. The Wellsian Utopia became
partially fulfilled in the Atomic Revolution; but when the World-State was just
round the corner, mankind missed it. The satirical pictures of Huxley and
Orwell narrate at length the story of the failure of Utopia. Political
revolutions, bitter competition among the different Utopian concepts and
designs, the progressive dilution of the Utopian ideal in practice, and the
speculative manipulation of power by vested interests, have all conspired to
enfeeble the community of humanism, compassion and tolerance. The Mustapha
Monds and the Big Brothers have played foul against the Ideal Commonwealth,
imposing their own respective formulae of social destiny on men. The majority
of English Utopians are extremely distrustful of sweeping generalisations and
express their faith in the balanced life, in parliamentary democracy, in the
sanctity of locality and personal relations, in a healthy orthodoxy towards all
moral questions. His belief in the liberal values of life, when dialectic goes
to the winds, with much political verbiage and polemical shouting, makes the </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Englishman
the most sensible and balanced of persons. The English Utopia faithfully reflects
the national genius for moderation and the search for balance and harmony, in
every sphere of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Plato
who was all for the supremacy of the Laws, deprived the individual of his real
importance. The individual, as he visualized, was to be a well-fitting part in
the mechanism of his Republic. He derives the meaning of justice in the
individual as that which in his department contributes to the strength and the
stability of the State. The State, then, was to be the measure of man. During
the Renaissance, man’s perfectibility was recognised and his degeneracy was
attributed to the corrupting interference of the States. The mediation of
society between Man and Nature created a lasting disharmony among men and it
was the aim of the Utopians to recover the equilibrium. More blamed society for
producing poverty, crime and war and imagined an ideal commonwealth in which
the individual could fully develop his personality. Bacon placed in the hands
of man the whole province of knowledge and wished him well. The Augustans
grasped a certain idea of perfection and hoped to obtain felicity in plenty
through the reasoned melodies of sound husbandry. The promising results of the
Industrial Revolution and Colonial expansion made the Victorians imagine that
their society was permanent and perfect. Victorian complacency was shaken by
the onslaught of new ideas. The vision that Morris had was of a human
fellowship, in which man would no more be a purely mechanical being, but was
the measure of the State, while the State itself withered away into a sort of
creative anarchy. There was after him, a schism between the State and the
individual in Utopia. Modern technology is a powerful weapon in the hands of
the political ordainers; and by practising mind-castration, mass-hypnopaedia
and conditioning, one man can acquire control of the whole world and, mould it
to his iron will. That is the present frightful climax of the struggle between
the shrill voice of individual conscience and the stern raucous blast of
conforming mass-hysteria. All the Utopians agree that the citizen of the future
has to be the product of a creative environment. Revolutions tend to corrupt
the State by power; and power corrupts the individuals as well. Our future
society should be based on an unconditional renunciation of violence and should
be the outcome of a natural evolution. There are, as Stevenson says, no cutting
the Gordian Knots; one has to smilingly unravel them. The Creative Man and the
Creative Society are the centres of the English Utopia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
citizen of the future would have struck the right balance between his beliefs
and actions. His education would be a drawing out of his creative sensibility
in every direction. The child in Utopia is nobody’s chattel or property. He
would not have to sign the ‘Charter of the Unborn’ as in <i>Erewhon, </i>nor is
he conditioned by reflexes to obey a mythical parent, the State, as in the <i>Brave
New World. </i>He is brought up in an atmosphere of freedom, a freedom free
from the taint of all inhibitions, phobias and complexes. Growing up without
fear or favour, he finds the world a fresh and safe place when he reaches
adolescence. And since his mind is not pale with the sickly cast of negative
thinking, he gives the ‘Yea’ to life in work as in play. When he becomes the future
citizen, he brings the same trusting and healthy outlook to bear on all the
issues of life. Worthy of his great heritage of freedom and fruitfulness, he
will be the image of true progressiveness, which is the measure of the success
of our Utopias.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Education
in Utopia is not meant for slavery, but for freedom. The young man would not be
an encyclopaedia of knowledge, a mere spectacled book-worm. There had been,
before Utopia became a reality, a vast process of unlearning after which an
infinitely fresh vista is opened up in the acquisition of knowledge. One is
taught the ways of learning by oneself through wise and happy and cheerful
teachers. There are no Colleges of Unreason, no Erewhonian Hypothetics for
study. Along with a scientific attitude of the mind, he develops an awareness
of the higher values of life. And education does not incapacitate him for
practical work; by the time he comes of age, he would have learnt a craft, and
perhaps an art, or at least a hobby. He faces the future with confidence and
hope and with eager anticipation. Utopian education is education through
freedom and it is imparted through perfectly natural and creative means. Its
chief aim is to encourage young men and women to find out and pursue the lines
of their several aptitudes until they attain a balanced life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Utopian
morality is based on the same principle of moderation, governed by the spirit
of natural freedom, without any cramping obstacles. There will be no taboos, no
prohibitions, no State-managed human stud-farms. State Eugenics is the pet idea
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

demonstrated with sad lucidity what a dangerous weapon it would </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be
in the hands of tyrants and oligarchs. Defective children will not be born in
Utopia, for they are born without shame or sense of guilt; The unwanted child
is unheard of as there are no secretive unions between men and women. Sexual
liberalism, however would not ruin family life. Blood relationships are
recognised as stronger than artificial affinities, and children would not be
deprived of the charming company of their own brothers and sisters. There are
no formal divorces, even as there are no strictly legal marriages. There is no
sort of discrimination in favour of any sex. Men and women are free to choose
what kind of work or occupation they will undertake, and the kind of life they
will lead. But women shall not be unwomanly, nor men be unmanly; and neither
shall be monsters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Personal
relations among individuals will be no longer guided by mercenary motives,
because there is neither money nor poverty in Utopia. And all the English
Utopians, except Wells and perhaps Bacon, agree that money should be abolished.
Small-holdings, like a house, a private garden, and a work of art, may be
permitted to be had as one’s personal possessions; but the old sense of
possessiveness in men and things would have gone. This moneyless and classless
State would be reached by no sanguinary upheaval or class-heroics, but through
the dynamism of an economic <i>laissez-faire, </i>as envisaged in Lord Samuel’s
Utopia. There will be no congested coketowns; no factory chimneys rear their
ugly heads like thorns in the heart of Utopia’s green and mellow land.
Decentralisation would have gone ahead, country invading city, and city
invading country, so that ultimately the population is more evenly distributed.
And the industrial centres, sprinkled everywhere throughout Utopia, would be
supplied power by the arterial veins of atomic energy. Machines have become
almost automatic and so there is no smoke or stench anywhere. And even
agriculture would be vastly mechanised, of course, without the danger of
impoverishing the good earth. Machines will be the perfect siaves, relieving
man of all kinds of drudgery. There will be enough scope for manual work:
tapestries, wall-papers, stained-glass, illuminated manuscripts, elaborately
carved furniture and highly-wrought designs will not cease to be produced by
hand. Useful work will be distinguished from useless toil. Idleness will not be
frowned upon as a disease; feverish activity, on the other hand, is viewed with
fearful concern. Holiday is<i> </i>no exceptional day in Utopia, for there is
always the time and the freedom to stand and stare. “There are no bank holidays
in Utopia,” says Ethel Mannin, “for the very good reason that there are no
banks. There are banks of violets and primroses and wild thyme, but no
unnatural banks of brick and stone and money.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Having
freed men from wasteful physical labour, science will now reconstruct the
picture of the universe on a more comprehensive, systematic and hopeful basis.
All the orthodox imbalances between belief and action would be eliminated. Men
will not profess in the name of Jehovah and practise the cult of Satan. Nor
would there be ignoble despair or pointless melancholy. The new scientific
philosophy would declare the adventure </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of evolution as
benevolent and purposive. Life is moving steadily towards higher forms: Life
and Mind came out of inert matter; </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and mind in its turn
will transcend itself and find a much nobler fulfillment in the Supermind. The
Utopian ends would be positive and the means not only good but also identical
with the ends themselves. A practical universal brotherhood would be
established, and the nightmare of frustration and anxiety would go. And since
the atmosphere of lasting fellowship has come to prevail, the vast expenditure
of the State would be eliminated in the natural course. Even the fools will not
contend for the forms of government, for there would be no State external to
the common union of hearts. Organisation will be minimum and no one would be
unwilling to help his fellowmen. The social consciousness would at every level
be identical with individual liberty, and the whole setup would be a creative
commonwealth. Men, women and children will move with spontaneous gaiety and
radiant health. There will be the silvern tinkle of hearty, robust laughter
everywhere, and fragrant-eyed enjoyment would blow like a free gale. The town
has become a splendid nose-gay of associations; in the day the whole country
looks like a garden of hyacinths in bloom, and at night an endless garland of
lights, and at all times a crowded holiday of joy and mirth. Utopia is a
glorious place–and in the heart of it the Creative Man. Such is the integral,
vision of the good life afforded by our Utopians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Utopian novel is a form of literature, which articulates </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
emotions of hope and despair, even as Tragedy handles pity and terror. Hope,
the element of approach, leads up to Utopias; </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and despair,
the element of retreat, gives rise to anti-Utopias or Infernos. Winston, the
hero in <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four, </i>is very much like the tragic hero in
Shakespeare–the individual soul weighed down by error and destiny. Huxley makes
Bernard-Marx speak the language of <i>Othello </i>in <i>Brave New World. </i>We
admire the tragic hero, not because his experience of evil makes him more
mature and responsive to the tasks of life, but because he becomes the object
of a feeling of sympathy, which we all entertain for one tormented, one who is
symbolic of forlorn individuality putting up a heroic fight against
providential misrule. The conflict in the anti-Utopias is between the tyrant
and the common man, the Inquisitor and the captive, the air-powerful and the
totally helpless, the ruthlessly efficient and the dumbly acquiescing. In these
works the play of evil is so exaggerated as to afford a Miserific vision, so
that the Utopia presented becomes the lowest of human hells. And when in the
end we recoil with horror and aversion from the vision of unmitigated evil, we
are a step nearer to the genuine Utopia, the third community. There is a tragic
<i>katharsis </i>underlying such books as the <i>Gulliver’s Travels, Nineteen
Eighty-Four </i>and <i>Ape and Essence, </i>through the operation of which one
is moved to remorse, and through the strength of a purified conscience to the
knowledge of the good. Hope, in these Utopias, is made to be the fruit of a
critical self- awareness, and not of pure aspiration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
these works, again Utopia is placed in an inaccessible nook of the world. The
moral they point to is obvious. If the follies of mankind were to continue at
the present, in the future, too, Utopia can exist only as a buried continent,
like Atlantis, or as a chance survival in its most degraded form, like Huxley’s
Los Angeles, or at best as the manifestation of Divine Grace, like the Valley
of the Blue Moon. As long as the disharmony between matter and spirit persists,
men cannot hope to have a full share either of their own individuality, or of a
fruitful social consciousness. Their only hope is to exist as oasis-builders,
like Winston and Julia in <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four, </i>or as the survivors of a
doomed race like the Savage and the Professor of Botany in </span><span

with all its imaginative complements </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of feeling and desire.
Swift, Shelley, Shaw and Huxley have all attempted to get rid of the body in
their eagerness to preserve the soul, to get man into a trance of pure Nirvana,
so that he might exist as pure intelligence, much like the Eldila of C. S.
Lewis. In the satirical worlds, man has no name, but only an amusing nick-name
that makes him the centre of a comedy of errors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, until we realise our will to create Utopia and plod our way towards
achieving it, we must have a vision of evil, so that in Utopia we shall not be
trouble-mongers by raising problems of crime and punishment, disease and
insanity, boredom and nervous breakdown. The human predicament on our planet
has for a long time been giving cause for anxiety. Wars, famines and diseases
have maimed humanity throughout history; and man, while breaking old chains,
has slipped into new designs of servility. New Jerusalem and Brave New World
are both simultaneously involved in the human situation. Let man have the
vision of both these mirror worlds and them make the choice. The modern English
Utopias tell in unmistakable terms how the angels and the enemies of promise
are fighting the final battle for the crown of man’s soul, that at present the
odds are in favour of the latter. We have inherited a diseased planet and
imperiled it further by our own pettiness and narrow-mindedness. Violent
revolution, total war and hypnotised happiness, brought about by unimpeded
technological advancement and increasing regimentation, do not solve our
problems; nor do they achieve any tangible gains for our many-sided
improvement. If we are to be saved, we must outgrow our own inhumanity through
a psychological revolution and a spiritual resurgence. Humanism, self-knowledge
and the realisation of the divine within ourselves are the only reliable guides
to true happiness. We are at the cross-roads of a difficult and uneasy choice,
not only for ourselves, but for the sake of future generations, too. The choice
is dramatised in the most poignant terms by the modern Utopias. And the
strength of vision needed for our guidance is afforded by these works in a

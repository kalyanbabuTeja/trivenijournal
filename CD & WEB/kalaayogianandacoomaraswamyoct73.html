Ananda Coomaraswamy is no bigoted decrier of Western civilization. His acrimony,
on the first acquaintance, is but a provocativeness resulting from his
reflections based on solid facts which have challenged him and must of
necessity challenge others. Rather he questions the complacency of the West in
its assumption of Eastern “backwardness” because of its lack of a concomitant
material development, and urges it to desist from its own “proselytizing fury.”

synonymity of culture and literacy, so fallaciously premised by the West in its
“civilizing mission,” is but one instance of such complacency which he delights
in flaying. True culture, he points out, if not necessarily associated with one’s
ability to read and write; but on the contrary, it has a long oral tradition in
the history of mankind. For this reason he deprecates the trend of Western
education which seeks, in the name of their preservation for posterity, to
relegate native arts and crafts to museums, where their spiritual significance
ceases to be a cogent force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is in just the same way that music is thrown away; folk songs are lost to the
people at the same time that they are collected and “put into a bag;” and in
the same way the “preservation” of a people’s art in folk museums becomes a
funeral rite, since preservatives are only necessary for the body when the
patient has already died. Nor must we suppose that “community singing” can take
the place of true folk song; its level will be no higher than that of the Basic
English in which our undergraduates have to be similarly drilled, if they are
to understand even the language of their elementary schools.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the matter of religion the same tendency to rationalize is even more patent in
the persistent attempt by Western missionaries there is but one true religion–Christianity.
Lack of adequate training in comparative religion accounts not only for the
self-deception but in actual fact precludes a better understanding between the
West and the East; the training of a missionary at best stresses his own
religion while dismissing others as mere superstitions. Consequently nothing
will do a greater disservice than an attempt to proselytize natives with such
an ill-equipped intellect and uncatholic spirit at the outset. To Ananda
Coomaraswamy all religions are in the words of Thomas Aquinas, “extrinsic
proofs of the same Divine Father”: that among all races only forms differ but
not essentials. In other words, they are as Anatole France propounds in his
book <i>The Monk’s Temptation, </i>different aspects of the same truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

herein also is the difference between Eastern wisdom and Western knowledge–the
former characterised by serenity and the latter <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

quotes Guenon: “It is the West that must take the initiative, but she must be
prepared really to go towards the East, not merely seeking to draw the East
towards herself as she has tried so far. There is no reason why the East should
take the initiative, and there would be still none, even the Western world were
not in such a state as to make any effort in this direction useless.......” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the study of modern anthropology which at the moment considers more closely the
social rather than the spiritual paternity of mankind. Such a trend, he
considers, is neither in the interest of science nor that of humanity, which
needs to be seen as a whole and not as an outlandish anomaly. Ananda
Coomaraswamy, in this book as in others, has done a great service to the world,
</span>particularly to the West, by advancing his arguments based, not on
personal animus, but scientific data and observations; for in reality, while
criticising the West, his aim is to unify rather than diversify the cosmos. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

benefits and advantages of the much-abused caste system. He divides his lecture
into two parts, viz., the religious basis of the forms of Indian Society and
the Religious basis of the forms of Indian Life. His views on the so-called
democracy of the West (“counting noses” as he facetiously describes universal
franchise) are <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>full </span>of

another “slating” and Sir George Birdwood knew India so <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>well </span>is quoted as saying that: Western civilization is secular,
joyless, insane, and self-destructive.” The hieratic system in India is held up
in contrast as a thing which still continues to function successfully in
competition with Western systems of social government and organisation.
Professor La Piana of Harvard describes American civilization as “a murderous
machine with no conscience and no ideals.” The disastrous effect of Western “civilization”
on the Marquesas Islanders is quoted as an example of its destructiveness.
Dinesh Chandra Sen describes the transition from the Hindu way of life to the
Western way as “a descent as great as from the Himalayas to the plains.”
British education is described as having destroyed the Indians’ “love of their
own literature” and “disgusted them with their homes, their parents, their
sisters, their very wives.” The method of education also has had a deeper
effect in that it has turned Indians into an incoherent blend of East and West.
There could be no better proof of all these things than is afforded by Jawaharlal
Nehru’s pathetic and yet modest confession that “I have become a queer mixture
of East and West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.” Western Oriental
scholarship, originally devised to attack and refute the “heathen doctrines” of
the Indians is now playing a more useful part in that it is being used to
compare the same ideas contained in Eastern and Western literature. He later
elaborates on the theme of not being impressed by Vice-President Wallace’s
promise that he would turn all of us into productive mechanics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of East and West, contrasting the regular way of life in the East with the
modern and irregular way of life now prevailing in the West. The Western idea
of progress at great speed towards some unknown destination is pointed out. The
“unprincipled man” is a product of the economic materialist trend in the West,
where vocation is now a “job”, and where quantity has replaced quality in
goods. The wars between the Christian races is pointed out and Japan is said to
have pursued westernisation so successfully that she herself became involved in
imperialist warfare. He expresses a desire for universal thought and discourse
as a solution of the world’s problems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and the replacement of the “law of the sharks” in the Western world: he points
out the differences between the Eastern and the modern Western life, which,
clearly defined by his analytical mind, show how irreconcilable the two are in
fact, although on the surface this is not always so evident. <i>His plea for a

Religious Basis of Indian Society</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>–that
</span>theologians should be competent to speak of other traditions with the
same knowledge with which they speak of their own–is one to which I adhere.
While this means a recognition of a vast body of truth common to all traditions
– so far as they are living and understood–it also means a very high degree of
respect for points of unresolved difference. That these may ultimately be resolved
in truth without loss of anything that has ever been truly known and understood
anywhere and at any time is clearly implied. While Ananda Coomaraswamy was
alive I believe that his work was principally directed to truth in the above
sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that we no longer have his directing presence I think there is danger of
partial enthusiasms dividing the body of truth against itself while all

is nothing but good. But there is one consequence I can hardly support which is
almost inevitable men being what they are–namely the revival of antagonism to

accident and that, so far as the “philosophia perennis” is concerned, a
communal plane for understanding and consequent reunion already exists. Unlike
the well-known wail “East is East and West is West and never the twain shall
meet,” his own vision bolds forth the hope that the twain can indeed meet–provided
the initiative is undertaken by the West in a spirit of true humility. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Understanding,
as he sees it, is at present obscured by the difference in values placed upon
human progress. In the matter <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>of<b> </b></span>art,
too, the East stresses the vital role of persuasion which it plays in seeking
to express truth effectively, while the West looks upon all art as something to
appeal to the senses alone. In the one it seeks comprehension of meaning; in
the other emotional experience for its own sake. Views as divergent as these
can find no possible ground for compromise–except in the “philosophia perennis”
pervading the religious life of both East and West. In short, the universality
of God in his multifarious forms of human acceptance alone can make for world
reunion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this reason Ananda Coomaraswamy envisages no gospel of hope in “scientific
humanism”, in which metaphysical reality is merely considered in relation to sense
perception. He urges a return to be pristine cultivation of what psychologists
call the illative sense, which, like love, sees not with the eyes but with the
mind. Nevertheless, it would be a fallacy to infer that, for a social
coalescence between the East and the West, the West must turn to the
traditional culture of the East and be carried away by its vortex. It would be
as great a mistake for the East to attempt to proselytize the West as it is for
the West to convert the East to its own way of thinking. To East however could
serve as an object less on, as a reminder to the West of its own traditional
culture from which it has wandered under the delusion of progress and upon which
alone a structure of reunion can be <i>successfully </i>made. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

civilization. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>He </span>accepts his
dicta that the modern world in the West is a world of “Epigone”, i.e.,
inheritors. These are the races which inherit rather than create positive

</span>governed by <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lusts </span>and

a civilization. Rather would he see <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Plato’s
</span>wish realized that <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>all </span>states

governing, by necessity <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>(<i>necessitas

not <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>sufficiently </span>powerful;

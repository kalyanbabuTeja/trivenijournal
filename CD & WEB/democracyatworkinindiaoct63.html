justify this confident language? It is the purpose of </span><span

democracy that our Constitution contemplates is nothing if not parliamentary.
The system of government that we have adopted, at the <span class=SpellE>Centre</span>

government. British <span class=SpellE>Parliamentarianism</span> in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a
translation and it is evident that in even the best translations the essential
meaning is apt to be lost. It is commonplace knowledge that democracy is a
government by discussion and <span class=GramE>parliamentary</span> democracy
presupposes freedom of speech and the spirit of tolerance. It follows that such
a system works only with certain political assumptions and constitutional
habits. The theory and practice of the British system shows that it rests on
four foundations, viz., the existence of well <span class=SpellE>organised</span>
national political parties; (ii) the principle of majority and the willingness
of the minority to accept the decision of majority at least for the time being;
(iii) free and fearless Press reflecting the true public opinion in the
country; and (iv) a large </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

parties having roots in the people. They have neither the resources nor the
strength of a British Political Party. Even the Congress has lost its spirit of
mission and the sense of direction. The average person in power in the Congress
today is a careerist aspiring for still better patronage. Democracy within the
party is on the decline. Hero-worship is the order of the day. The Congress has
become a huge whispering gallery of persons mechanically echoing the current
opinions of the High Command. Criticism is equated with disloyalty and
indiscipline. Inevitably it is being uprooted from the masses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

party with an ideology of its own. But it does not and cannot, by the very

ancient <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the Communists have four Vedas represented by the writings of Marx, Stalin,
Lenin and Mao. None of them have accepted the parliamentary democracy. Indeed
the very title of a chapter in Lenin’s collected works is abolition of <span

non-parliamentary methods such as strikes, <span class=SpellE>morchas</span>

has disobeyed the ruling of the Chair in the Parliament as well as in the State
Assemblies. Its idea of militancy is that its members should be carried out of
the Legislative Chamber on the shoulders of the Marshal. If the Socialist party
seriously proposes to persist in this as a matter of policy, they will have to
select before long a wrestler of the <span class=SpellE>calibre</span> of a
Kaiser-<span class=SpellE>i</span>-Hind as their next candidate for the

9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> In the ultimate analysis, the system that
we have adopted cannot succeed with such political habits. If political parties
throw their ideologies to the wind to secure a few seats in the Parliament or
if they resort to mass Satyagraha and general strikes, <span class=SpellE>morchas</span>
and hunger strikes to achieve political ends, the Parliament will cease to be
the <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of political gravity and the minority will
get the decisions of the majority changed by more effective
extra-constitutional methods for which there is another word in the dictionary–<i>coup-de-tat</i>.
A responsible opposition cannot, however, exist without a responsive ruling
party. The record of the Congress in this respect is far from being clean. The
Congress has, more often than not, conceded the legitimate and just demands
only after firing and bloodshed. Power has corrupted the Congress and the
tendency, too often, is to disregard and discard the opposition. The
inclination always is to equate the Government with the Congress. Hardly a
debate in the Parliament has changed the nature of policy or the course of the
events. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the <span class=SpellE>Norvic</span> Debate displaced Chamberlain. The O’Brien
affair substantially altered a pristine legislation. The Middle-Eastern policy
of the <span class=SpellE>Labour</span> Government was changed by a debate in
the House. Many a controversial bill has been withdrawn in deference to the
insistence of the opposition. No such instance has occurred in this country.
There is not a single occasion when a legislative measure has been so withdrawn
in the <span class=SpellE>Lok</span> <span class=SpellE>Sabha</span>. It
follows that unless the Congress party responds to the reasonable demands of
the opposition in Parliament, the minority will be driven to join issues it in
the streets.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:25.0pt;

Press. In this economics of newspapers, freedom of Press and speech becomes
meaningless. The Indian Press has been described as the “Jute Press”. It is
also a Juke-box Press. The man who puts the coin calls the tune. The public
opinion that it claims to reflect is frequently a public opinion manufactured

declining. The Law Commission has revealed that appointments to the highest
courts on the basis of regional, communal and political considerations are not
unknown. After all a Judge’s mind is not a legal slot-machine. If he owes his
appointment to such considerations, they are bound to be reflected in the
decisions that he gives. Add to this the dangerous tendency discernible in the
speeches of the highest in the land to ignore and ridicule the judiciary. In
such a state of affairs, the citizen is likely to lose his faith in the

The Indian people have matured remarkably. The three general elections show
that the average illiterate Indian has become politically conscious. He does
not regard parliamentary democracy as un-Indian nor does he pessimistically
assume that the Parliament is only a facade meant to conceal an authoritarian
dictatorship. The real question for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

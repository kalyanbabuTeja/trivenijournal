style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the time of writing this survey the news was published that full agreement on a
peace-settlement in Indo-China was reached in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City> where the debates and discussions on
the subject had been going on for nearly three months. It is however with mixed
feelings that one should look at this agreement. There may be some jubilation
that eight years of unnecessary war, with all the horrors and losses associated
with it, came to an end and peace is established in at least one area of the
world. But there is also bound to be sorrow at the fact that Communistic rule
has come to be established in one more tract of the world with the
possibilities of its being extended to a larger area in Indo-China and perhaps <st1:place
w:st="on">South-East Asia</st1:place>. And for all this the responsibility lies
in the main on the French and on the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
short-sightedness of both and their ill-liberalism are at the Source of this
addition of one more State to the list of Communist States, and the tragedy of
it lies in the fact that the purpose for which the United States proclaimed
that it was aiding France–the purpose of ‘containing’ Communism–received a
fatal blow here. What could have been averted by timely statesmanship was made inevitable
because of the blindness of American and French <span class=GramE>statesmen</span>.
The French might have had some excuse<i> </i>for their folly–because they were
called upon to give up something which they enjoyed with a sense of proprietary
right for more than a century–but the Americans had no such excuse. If only
they had from the start aided the cause of real democracy and freedom in
Vietnam and brought sufficient pressure on their French allies to withdraw from
the country, just as the British withdrew from India, and helped Ho Chi Min in
setting up a real nationalistic government in 1947-48, there would have been in
Indo-China as in Indonesia, Burma and Ceylon, a strong democratic government
serving as a real bastion against the onrush of Communism. The peace settlement
in Indo-China is a defeat for the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Will she learn a
lesson from it and utilise her vast resources and her status as a world power
in the cause of freedom instead of in the cause of reactionarism–colonialism,
feudalism and medievalism? It is only when power is combined with wisdom that
desirable results are produced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
should remember that in 1946-47 Ho Chi Min was for establishing a
broad-bottomed democratic State in Indo-China and that he was even prepared to
keep an independent Indo-China as a member of the French Union, which would
have meant a relationship like that of India in the Commonwealth. Promises on
lines like these were first made to him by the French but subsequently they
declined to fulfill them. It was this that drove him to a war against them; and
for obtaining victory in the war he was driven more and more into the
Communistic camp and enter into an alliance with the People’s Republic of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He had
to do this against his will and against the will of a large section of his countrymen.
History tells us that the Viet-Namese never cherished any feeling of
friendliness towards the Chinese under whose imperialistic domination they
suffered for more than a thousand years in the past, and against whom they kept
up continuously their spirit of rebellion and waged several wars of
independence. The American aid to <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
strengthened the alliance between him and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It will take a long time now
for him to sever his connection with Communist China, and his Republic will
have to remain a Chinese satellite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all were tired of this war in Indo-China–all with the exception of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> lost
more than a hundred thousand men in killed and wounded and the Vietnamese three
to four times that number. But the French were not nearer victory. The British
were averse to the continuance of the war because it produced unfavourable
reactions in Malaya and it also affected adversely the defence organisation in
Western Europe through the NATO, of which <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> was one of the principal members.
So long as the French were preoccupied with the Indo-Chinese campaign they
could not pay adequate attention to the problem of West European Defence. There
was also the danger that with the Chinese playing a more active part in the war
and with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sending more military aid to the French, the war might extend to a wider area
and become a global one. The British were also anxious to open trade with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> on a larger scale, as foreign trade was
more vital too her prosperity than in the case of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. All this explains why
Anthony Eden was so anxious to bring about a cease-fire in Indo-China at any
cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
all this an important role was played by our own Government. The policy of
non-alignment with either of the power <i>blocs, </i>to which <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> adhered during all these years, enabled
her to<b> </b>mediate between the Communist and the non-Communist members of
the Peace Conference at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City>.
For a variety of reasons <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
is much more interested in peace than any of these countries, and one aspect of
her policy is to extend the peace area in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place>
and in the rest of the world. She made it clear at a very early stage in the
sittings of the <st1:City w:st="on">Geneva</st1:City> Conference–although she
was not directly represented on it–that no peace in <st1:place w:st="on">South-East
 Asia</st1:place> would be possible unless it be through the goodwill and
co-operation of<i> </i>Asian States. At the Colombo Conference and subsequent
to it she laid the greatest stress on this aspect. There was a tendency in the
United States to ignore the force of<i> </i>this view, and that was the reason
why for some time she proceeded with, the idea of establishing a South-East
Asian Treaty Organisation like the NATO in Europe, to arrest the progress; of
Ho Chi Min in Indo-China and of Communism in general in South-East Asia. It was
the British however that demonstrated to the shapers of American policy that no
such organisation would work if it is opposed by Asian nations like <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. A
similar view was expressed by Casey, the Australian Minister for External
Affairs. And when at New Delhi Nehru and Chou-En-Lai met in conference and
issued a joint communique outlining the general policy according to which the
free nations of Asia should regulate their mutual relations, the Americans felt
that they would become completely isolated if they persisted in any line of
action which was looked at with, disfavour by India and other democratic
nations of South-East Asia. The conference between the Indian and the Chinese
Prime Ministers still further strengthened the British in pressing their point
of view before <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Commonwealth is a reality to them and they knew that without <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> the
Commonwealth would be nowhere. One item therefore that has to be registered as
an item of progress is the realisation on the part of<i> </i>European and
American Governments that in the settlement of Asian problems the voice of <st1:place
w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> cannot be ignored; and this realisation is to a
large extent the outcome of<i> </i>the lead given by Pandit Nehru.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
may now turn to the question of what has actually been settled in Indo-China.
The first point settled is that there should be a cease-fire in the country and
that the line of ceasefire should be so demarcated that Ho Chi Min’s armies
should confined to what may be called Northern Vietnam, and that Southern
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia should remain outside Ho’s jurisdiction. This
virtually means the partition of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It reproduces there the
situation as in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
To us here in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
it is not necessary to refer elaborately to what partition of a State implies
in point of<i> </i>human misery and suffering and the large number of economic
and other problems which it creates. Ho’s <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Viet</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Minh</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType>
will consist of a population of nearly thirteen millions with vast
agricultural, mineral and industrial resources; the rest of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> will
have a population of about nine millions. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Laos</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are comparatively small States with two and four millions of population
respectively. The Geneva Conference has therefore settled that there should be
a partition of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The second point it settled is that there should be free elections in the whole
of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region> not later than
the middle of 1956–i.e., before the lapse of two years–and the Assembly so
elected should be regarded as the Government for the whole of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This
implies that the partition should be temporary and that the country would
become united two years hence. A third point settled is that there should be a
supervisory commission consisting of India, Canada and Poland, with India as
the chairman, for seeing that the cease-fire and the subsequent armistice
agreements are strictly adhered to by the parties concerned and that timely
measures are taken for the holding of fair and free elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Three
points have to be noted with respect to this settlement. The elections referred
to are only in respect of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There is no reference to what would happen in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Laos</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
These two would remain separate States. The unification contemplated is not the
unification of the whole of Indo-China but only of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The settlement does not
say anything about <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
position in Indo-China in the years to come. It is not known whether she will
reconcile herself to peaceful withdrawal from <st1:country-region w:st="on">South
 Vietnam</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Laos</st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This is however a crucial problem. The struggle in Indo-China is basically one
between colonialism and nationalism. No Indo-Chinese will tolerate the presence
of the French in any shape or form. Unless complete independence is granted to
these areas a national struggle will break out and the peace now concluded will
be peace only in name. Those States interested in peace–India, Burma, Ceylon,
Indonesia, Britain, Australia, China etc., should see that colonial rule is
once for all put an end to. Any delay in this will mean civil war and the
strengthening of the forces of Communism. A third point to be noted is that
when elections are held in 1956 it looks as if <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> will be unified under a
Communist Government. This will be the natural outcome of the existence of a
larger population in Ho’s portion than in <st1:place w:st="on">Southern Vietnam</st1:place>.
The process of indoctrination, the suppression of all opposition and the
regimentation of the electorate, characteristic of the Communist system of
government, will be completed during these two years in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will continue to be an area–as it has been these seven years</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–ridden
by numerous political parties and factions unable to offer a united front
against the Communist Party. If Soviet Russia </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and Communist
China agreed to a cease-fire at the Geneva Conference, it is this prospect of
an easy electoral victory, over the whole of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1956 that influenced
them. The interval will give their Communist ally the time and opportunity to
consolidate his position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
was with great difficulty that the United States was persuaded to send a
top-ranking delegate of hers to the second and final stage of the Geneva
Conference. She feels that the French willingness to enter into peace on the
basis of the partition of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>Vietnam</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>is</span> nothing short of surrender to
force. This is of course true. It was the superior force of Ho that convinced
the French Prime Minister that all fighting was futile. But what else could he
do when the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
declined to help his country with men? Americans do not want to waste any of
their lives in an Asian war. This is the one lesson they learnt from the Korean
campaign. All that they were prepared to do was to send material To the French
their declining population was one of the greatest problems, and human life
became very precious in consequence. They could have trained an efficient
Vietnamese army during these seven years but they did not do this, and those
whom they trained had not the enthusiasm and will to fight for what they
considered to be the perpetuation of French rule. There was now and then some
complaint from the French that the Vietnamese could never be trained to fight,
but this was a lie. Ho had during these years been able to produce a very fine
army out of the Vietnamese. The idea therefore of the Americans that Asians
should be made to fight Asians in the crusade against Communism would not work.
The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
also tried to transform the Indo-China war into an international war under the
auspices, if possible, of the United Nations. This idea also she had to abandon
because the French were opposed to it and the British and other ‘free’ nations
were not prepared to send their youth to fight in a war like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the point of view of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United

is most unsatisfactory. The one question which troubles her is whether <st1:country-region

and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
can be prevented from becoming Communist. She is not quite sure. The point in
the Nehru-Chou-En-Lai communique, that they would respect the<i> </i>independence
and sovereignty of other Asian States and will not adopt a policy of aggression
towards any of them, does not appeal to her. Communist conquests are n</span><span

made always through military aggression and war. They are in several cases the
outcome of the revolutionary activities of native Communist Parties, secretly
helped by the world Communist organisation behind which are Soviet Russia and
Soviet China. There is nothing to prevent such activities in the non-Communist
part of Indo-China in the near future. The argument, that in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Burma</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> democratic Governments
were successful in putting down Communist activities, may not apply to these
weak States in Indo-China. This is the intriguing situation which causes worry
to the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> and to
some extent to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This is also perhaps the point of view of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Thailand</st1:country-region>
and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is because of this that the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> is anxious to organise the South–East
Asian Treaty Organisation. But will it be effective in preventing an internal
Communist <i>coup </i>in the States of Indo-China? This raises all those
complicated issues which are often discussed in this connection and for which
there can be no satisfactory answer–questions like (a) <span class=GramE>What</span>
if Communism spreads and new Communist States come into existence? (b) Why
should outsiders interfere if the Communists get into power through a coup?<i> </i>(c)
If under-developed areas of the world are to be prevented from becoming
Communist, what is the better way of accomplishing such an aim–is it through
military or economic aid or through both? There is also the other big issue.
What will be the effect of Communist expansionism on the future of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>? One
cannot separate this from the expansion of the power of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The two
are closely tied up and they will continue to be closely tied up for a fairly
long time to come. The Australians were terribly afraid of Japanese imperialism
in the past. It is a Chinese imperialism that will threaten them in future; and
the resources of <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> in
men and material are very many times larger than those of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
establishment of Communist Governments in Indo-China is not a matter about
which Australians can be indifferent. This only leads to the conclusion that
while peace in Indo-China is welcome to most people, it does not mean an
atmosphere of complete security. The answer to the question whether Communist
and non-Communist States can co-exist, and under what conditions they can do
so, is still to be discovered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that peace has been established in Indo-China the ‘great’ powers are turning
their attention to the solution of other problems. The setting up of an
organisation to maintain peace in South-East Asia and the role in it of the
United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the
Philippines, and Formosa on one side, and of States like India, Burma, Ceylon,
and Indonesia on the other, is one such problem. It was only four hundred years
ago that the process of Europeans immigrating into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other problem to which the ‘great’ powers will direct their attention now is
that of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It has been a cardinal principle of American policy of ‘containing’ Communism
to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation through the creation of a
powerful army in Western Europe, to serve as a bulwark against Soviet conquest
of countries to the west of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">East
  Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But no such strengthening is
possible unless proper use in made of the military potentialities of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
French, however, have always been opposed to German rearmament, and their
opposition is not less strong today than in the past. It was to allay their
legitimate fears that the EDC (European Defence Community) Treaty was entered
into, under which there would be no separate German army but a number of German
divisions incorporated into a European army, alongside of similar divisions
from other countries in <st1:place w:st="on">Western Europe</st1:place> which
are parties to the treaty. This was regarded as a fair compromise–the
initiative in regard to this came from the French themselves–but the treaty,
though ratified by the Parliaments of West Germany, Belgium, Holland etc., is
still awaiting ratification at the hands of the French National Assembly. The
French have been hesitating in the matter and one excuse for the hesitation has
all along been their pre-occupation with the Indo-China war. Now that peace has
been established the question cannot be postponed any longer. The Americans are
impatient. They want to know finally whether the French are for or against the
EDC. This was one of the questions that came up for discussion at the
conference held at <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
recently between President Eisenhower and Sir Winston Churchill. A sort of
ultimatum has now been issued to France by these two that, unless the EDC is
ratified at a very early date by the National Assembly, West Germany would be
recognised as a fully sovereign State, the allied armies of occupation would be
withdrawn, and the West German Government would be given complete freedom to
rearm to any extent it likes. It looks as if this will become an accomplished
fact by the end of the current year. It is true that there is a section in
Britain–especially in the Labour Party–which is as much opposed as <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
German rearmament. But the question is whether the British Government can
withstand American pressure in this matter. If for any reasons the NATO and the
EDC lose the value which Americans have been attaching to them these four or
five years, it is quite possible that they will enter into a separate treaty
with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">West Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
An American alliance with a rearmed <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>
in the East and with a rearmed <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the West seems to be in the process of making. Preparation for war has
always been one of the major industries of governments, and peace in Indo-China
will give greater stimulus to this. No one takes disarmament seriously. In a
world where the ‘great’ powers distrust and suspect each other in the way in
which Soviet Russia and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> are doing today, and where efforts at
collective security through the United Nations Organisation have ceased to be
fruitful, regional defence pacts and preparations for war have become
inevitable. “The brotherhood of man and the federation of the world” are
becoming empty dreams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few days ago Sir Winston Churchill announced in the course of Commons that the
time for the withdrawal of the British forces from the Suez Canal Zone has
come. This was a welcome announcement, coming as it did from a Conservative
Government. It is therefore unfortunate that, when the talks on the subject
were reopened, the parties could not settle their differences, even though
those differences related to matters which do not appear to be of great
significance except in one case. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
wants two years to complete the evacuation, while <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> wants it to be completed in
fifteen months. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
wants that the new agreement to be entered into in regard to the re-occupation
of the Canal Zone under certain circumstances should be in force for ten years,
while <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>
wants it for only seven years. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region>
insists that the Zone should be re-occupied by her forces when <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Turkey</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Iran</st1:country-region>
or any Arab country is attacked, but <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>
objects to the inclusion of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iran</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The first two are minor points and it will do well for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
yield on them. Even in regard to the third it is best for <st1:country-region

terms, as, when once friendly relations are established between the two

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> taking a
realistic view of the problem of Middle East Defence and becoming a party to
any Middle East Defence Organisation. The removal of this long-existing tension
between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> is

every ton of oil the Government will get over two pounds sterling and the
production is expected to be 13 million tons in the first year, 20 in the
second year and 27 in the third year. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will get a
compensation <span class=GramE>of about thirty million sterling</span>. It is
quite possible that extreme nationalists may resent the idea of foreigners
coming once again to work the oil mills of their country, but they will all
have to realise that foreign technical skill and capital are necessary for the
economic development of under-developed countries. What is needed is a strong
democratic Government in the country which will utilise the revenue from
royalties for the improvement of the condition of the masses, and the people

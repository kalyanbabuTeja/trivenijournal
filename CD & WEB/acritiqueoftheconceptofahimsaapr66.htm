style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
concept of <i>ahimsa </i>is a complex ethical virtue. It has figured
prominently and is given an enormous significance, in the religion of Jainism.
It has acquired special importance as a philosophy of life, and a technique of
action has grown around the concept, at the hands of Mahatma Gandhi, for over a
period of three decades. Further, the concept of <i>ahimsa </i>has great
significance for us today when we are insistently contemplating a new social
order which will outlaw war from our midst. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Manu
and the <i>Mahabharata </i>have declared that the cardinal virtues of Hinduism
are purity, self-control, detachment, truth and non-violence. Non-violence is
the law of love. The sacredness of life in all sentient creation is affirmed as
a cardinal truth. Offence to sentient creation in any form is violence, e.g.,
physical injury, killing, hurting the feelings, insulting them, destroying
their rights, or dignity of self-sense. Violation of any of these is named <i>himsa.
</i>Their observance is described as <i>ahimsa. </i>The Jains carried the
doctrine to incredible lengths. They were against killing in any form. They
held the opinion that neither should we kill, nor get the killing done through
an agent. The mere thought of killing is as much a moral evil, as the actual
act of killing. Any word expressing the desire to kill is also evil. The
principle of <i>ahimsa </i>involves purity of thought, word and deed in the
practice of universal love. It is described as a great vow (Mahavrata). The
Hindu ethical thinkers looked upon <i>ahimsa </i>as one of the <i>Sadharana
Dharmas. </i>But they did not insist on its unexceptionable application to all
defined and undefined eventualities. They made exceptions. In sacrifices they
held the opinion that, animals can be killed, because the killing is enjoined
by the Vedas. The sacrificial nature of the act purifies the agent and the
animal alike; hence it is not deemed unethical. Kings were allowed to kill forest
animals for sport. Vegetarianism was not deemed a violent act. The use of
violence was not completely ruled out in Hindu ethics. It was hedged in by a
number of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>restrictions. An unwarranted and arbitrary use
of it, for the mere, pleasure, in order to spite others, is condemned severely.
The use of violence is to be minimal in the case of the Brahmin and the hermit.
The ideal Brahmin is to use spiritual force against physical violence even for
self-protection. Though the Hindu emphasizes the supremacy of spiritual power,
he does not say that physical force .should not be used. There is a celebrated
verse in the <i>Mahabharata </i>which clinches the issues and formulates the
ideal “In the front the four Vedas; at the back the bow with arrows; on one
side the spirit achieving its object through the might of spirit, on the other
side military force achieving its ends.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Force
and violence are used to bring the anti-social and anti-ethical elements under
control. Non-violence is the highest principle to which we are exhorted to
approximate. Perfect <i>ahimsa </i>is an ideal. It<b> </b>is like the straight
line in geometry. Because we are not able to love our enemies and win them
over, we should not submit to injustice or acquiesce in the horrors done by
others. There should be no neutrality between good and bad, values and
disvalues. Manu declares that those who poison us, burn us, and kill us ought
to be killed. The use of violence is necessary to stay off and punish
anti-social and aggressive elements who hold the doctrine that Might is Right.
The Hindu Rajya Dharma makes a clear distinction between violence <i>(himsa) </i>and
pun1shment <i>(danda). </i>“The former causes injury to an innocent person; the
latter is legal restraint of guilt.” Force is not the law-giver but it is an
instrument that ministers to the need of Dharma. The theory of punishment is
ingrained and worked into the structure of the cosmos. None can escape the
consequences of his acts. No act of ours is private and none is unimportant.
The act in its trail brings the punishment like Fate. Sometimes the punishment
is realized here and now and at other times in the future life. The elaborate
description of hell and the torments there and the pleasures of paradise are
the means by which Hindu religion persuades men to do good and to keep away
from evil. The Hindu theory of punishment is retributive and deterrent in its
motive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<i>Bhagavad Gita </i>is regarded by many, with the exception of Sankara and
Gandhiji, as supporting and enjoining the use violence against an evil doer.<sup>1</sup>
The message of the Gita according to them is to fight the enemy and crush it.
Arjuna is a warrior (Kshatriya). Krishna tried all peaceful modes of bringing
peace between the two families; but, having failed, he advises Arjuna to fight
for the cause of justice and from a sense of duty, as an act of dedication to
the Lord, against the selfish and unrighteous foes. Krishna declared after the
unsuccessful ambassadorial mission, “Duryodhana was told what was truthful,
wholesome and beneficial; and the fool is not amenable. I consider therefore
chastisement by war, <i>danda, </i>the fourth expedient, as proper for the
sinner; by no other means can they be curbed.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has to be used to hold in check unruly elements. The Gita in modern political
parlance stands for the principle of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>collective security
and asks us to fight all unjust aggression. <i>Ahimsa </i>does rule out the use
of force. Perfect <i>ahimsa </i>belongs to the sage. Violence is neutral in its
ethical nature. Its value is determined by the use it is put to. A knife in the
hands of a murderer leads to crime. We cannot say that violence in i</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji’s
interpretation of the concept of <i>ahimsa </i>is a glorious chapter in the
history of Indian ethical thought and Hindu ethics. He regards violence as evil
in itself. He does not consider it as neutral. He is uncompromising in his
opposition to it. He wanted to build a world based on truth and non-violence;
and not on untruth and lovelessness. He believed that violence can bring no
good to man in any sphere. His doctrine is built on his conception of human
nature as essentially good. He believed that man is divine in his essence. He
also believed in the oneness of the Spirit that is behind all creation. It is
our false view that “We are so many separate floating islands,” that is
responsible for our violence. “There cannot be happiness for anyone of us until
it is won for all.” Fear is the cause of violence, according to the Gandhian
analysis. Fear is the most degrading human emotion. It destroys our mind and
corrupts our morals. This<i> </i>is the reason why on many occasions Gandhi
said that he “preferred violence to cowardice”. The moment we realise that we
are all parts of a single Spirit, there will be no violence, for the simple
reason that it hurts one’s own self. The <i>Brihadaranyaka </i>declares, “Fear
results only from a second principle.”<sup> 2</sup> Further, </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gandhiji
believed that men are perfectible and educable through persuasion and reason.
So, he declared that he would continue to preach non-violence till such time as
there was no one of the opposite view. “If blood is to be shed, let it be
mine.” He believed that good would ultimately triumph. He wanted not only
individuals to use non-violence but nations and groups. He did not admit that
what was ethically good for an individual could ever be politically
reprehensible for the nation. He did not divide politics and morals, nor ends
and means. He believed that an unjust means defeats any good end. In his
philosophy ends and means are convertible terms. The end can never justify the
means. Nor did he agree with the communist that the <i>ends are the means. </i>It
is wrong to think that non-violence is an impracticable utopia, it is the
urgent need of the age. The alarming nuclear developments, the inconclusiveness
of wars, and the damage that war does not only to the combatants but also to
the civilians and the future generations, is enough to regard non-violence as
the imperative need of the age. We have realised today that wars are
politically stupid, economically futile and ethically unjustifiable. If we do
not have faith in the divine nature of man, it is difficult for us to give up
violence. If we think that human cussedness and the principle of evil is part
and parcel of reality, as real as man’s goodness, It is difficult for us to
outlaw violence. It all depends ultimately on our faith and our conception of
man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further,
the psychology of violence is self-defeating. Every act of violence produces
defiance in the others whom we attack. Violence produces greater violence. The
greater violence is defeated by a much greater violence. The violence is not
stopped. It leads to<i> </i>a series of world-wars. What we need is to put an
end to violencing. This can be done by <i>ahimsa </i>or soul force. We should
not run away from the scene. We meet the enemy to give him an opportunity to
reflect on the wrong he has done. We seek to educate him and convert him not by
inflicting physical violence on him. It is a lateral approach. It seeks to
overcome the opposition by changing the mind of the opponent. All this is based
on the faith that man is essentially good. Any body whose faith falters in this
has no use for non-violence. Non-violence is not for the weak. The <i>Mahabharata
</i>declares, “The hard is overcome by the gentle; even the non-hard is
overcome by it; there </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(A SHORT SHORT STORY)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was feeling dreadfully sullen. There was not a copper in his pocket.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since morning his son was restless with hunger. The sobs of the motherless lad suffocated him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The city was all quiet. No riot, no epidemic, nothing of the evil……And that was exactly his trouble!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the rugged sign-board on his shop read:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Material required for Funerals is sold here.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hungry child cried, &quot;Father, give me at least a coin.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shop-keeper looked through the lane opposite.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Heavy laden faces were bustling in sad frenzy. A doctor was frequenting the big house, while blood-red waste-water was flowing through the gutters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Heaving a deep sigh, the father said, &quot;God willing, you may get a copper soon.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But these words had very little effect on the biting hunger of the lad’s stomach. Disappointed, the child retreated to the corner of the shop and began to weep.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four hours later there was an outburst of wild mourning in the lane.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Presently a group of four persons lifted the corpse of a young man. A young lady with two small children in her arms came beating her breast, and an old man fainted on the doorstep. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sight was unbearable–too cruel for human eyes. The shop-keeper turned his eyes inside.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His son was enjoying the sweets!</P>

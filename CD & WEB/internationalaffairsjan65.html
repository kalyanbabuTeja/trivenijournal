Congo, arrived too, but he <span class=GramE>Was</span> detained by the police
for Some hours and then sent home. Such treatment of the head of a <span

diplomatic usage, but there was no report that any of the dignitaries present
demurred. </p>

probably, to Dr. <span class=SpellE>Verwoerd</span>, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Tshombe</span>
is the best-hated man in <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. Though no
evidence has been produced, is accused of the murder of Patrice <span
class=SpellE>Lumumba</span>. But be retains support of his Province Katanga,
mainly because, while the rest of newly-freed Congo has dissolved into chaos,
Katanga has preserved internal peace, and the industry, upon which its
relatively high standard of life depends, has continued to work. He has been
enabled to keep things going in this way by employing foreign experts and
troops, and by conciliating the foreign companies; in short by what the
Communists denounce as “neo-<span class=GramE>colonialism</span>”. But while
several other African States do the same things without publicity, he has seen
no reason for concealment. In fact he stands out conspicuously against the hostility
to the West which now rules at least in the public pronouncements of the States
which so oddly call themselves non-aligned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 w:st="on">Cairo</st1:place></st1:City> conference sat for several days and
discussed general and specific questions. China was not represented, but her cause
was upheld by a strong group, mainly of dictators veering towards communism,
who successfully opposed India’s suggestion a delegation be sent to Peking to
urge the Government of China not to carry out its anticipated test of an
atom-bomb. The group also successfully blocked the proposal of the United Arab
Republic that the <st1:City w:st="on">Colombo</st1:City> group press <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> to accept
their compromise proposal on the Indian frontier dispute. The conference
finally produced an agreed statement on world affairs. This set forth a number
of principles intended to preserve peace, principles which have long been
familiar and would indeed preserve peace if they were observed. The Indian
Prime Minister, with the <st1:place w:st="on">Kashmir</st1:place> dispute in
mind, suggested that a paragraph be added declaring against application of
self-determination to a part of a country, but his proposal was rejected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In view of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s failure to obtain support
on these points, some commentators questioned the utility of participating in
the conference. There was no less justification for questioning its
non-alignment, and the advisability of signing a statement the political parts
of which were consistently pro-communist and on some matters directly opposed
to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
interests. Thus the statement condemned as a menace to peace. America’s
proposal to set up bases in the Indian Ocean which would defend India against
China, and Malaysia against Indonesia; it also by implication opposed America’s
support for South Vietnam, which is necessary for India’s security. Nor is it
clear what interest <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
has in demanding the immediate liberation of colonies which would fall into
chaos or become Communist outposts (no demand was made for the liberation of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tibet</st1:place></st1:country-region> or of any
Chinese or Russian colony). Likewise <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
has no interest in the withdrawal of the blockade of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region>,
the demand for which was made without mention of the provocation which led to
it, namely <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
attempts to overthrow <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> governments. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thus
the <st1:City w:st="on">Cairo</st1:City> conference brought sharply to
attention a clash between sentiment and interest: the sentiment of hostility to
the West which has largely inspired <span class=GramE>non-alignment,</span> and
the interest of in preserving world stability, national independence and free
institutions which urges <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
towards collaboration with and dependence on the West. This clash was felt
again shortly after, when the leader of the Soviet Government was suddenly
removed and when a nuclear explosion took place in China, and later when
European troops </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the 15th October the
Russian press announced that Mr. Khrushchev had resigned his positions as
Chairman of the Council of Ministers and First Secretary of the Communist
Party, and that Mr. A. N. <span class=SpellE>Kosygin</span> had replaced him in
the former capacity and Mr. L. I. <span class=SpellE>Brezhnev</span> in the
latter. Hardly any effort was made to keep up the initial pretence that the
resignation was due to his age and ill-health, but the causes and probable
consequences of the event </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>are still subjects of anxious speculation
abroad. Few countries are as anxious about them as <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and the secrecy in which
Communist affairs are conducted has seldom been so much deplored. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
best evidence available is that it was a group of party leaders, the
Secretariat members and some other members of the Presidium of the Party
Central Committee, who compelled Mr. Khrushchev to resign. They did so at a
time when he and many who might have supported him were away from the <span
class=SpellE>centre</span> of affairs. The Council of Ministers and the senior
commanders of the armed forces, except Marshal <span class=SpellE>Malinowski</span>,
had no part in the decision and were confronted with a <i>fait accompli. </i>His
deposition from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers took place in a
meeting which was short of a quorum. The Chinese party leaders had no hand in
the coup. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
of those who took action against him owed their positions to him, but the
statement in <i>Pravda </i>two days later, which spoke of hasty, unrealistic,
one-man decisions, and the like, shows that they had come to distrust his
methods of work. He had made himself almost as absolute a dictator as Stalin,
and his frequent and drastic changes of policy, organisation and personnel had
caused confusion in government affairs and kept his subordinates in
un-certainty as to their positions; but he had not protected himself by a
policy of terror as Stalin did. The conspicuous failures of his regime–the
retreat from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region> in 1962,
the dispute with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the poor performance of agriculture–no doubt counted against him, but it
does not appear that there are any great differences of policy between him and
his successors. Hitherto no very important changes in internal or foreign
policy have been made. It is expected, however, that the atmosphere of
all-round innovation which prevailed in his time will be replaced by one of
greater caution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The new leaders have
announced that they will adhere to peaceful coexistence. They seem to attach
the same meaning to this phrase as their predecessor did; that is, they feel
free to encourage armed rebellion, as in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Congo</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but they will be careful to
avoid major wars. Since they are less temperamental and impulsive than Mr.
Khrushchev, the danger of unintended nuclear war caused directly by Russian
action has probably diminished–it is apt to be forgotten that until the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> crisis in
October 1962, Mr. Khrushchev was regarded as a reckless firebrand who had
several times brought the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>world very near war. On the other hand,
the new leaders certainly desire to improve relations with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>, and if they do so to any substantial
extent, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
aggressiveness is likely to increase. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
though the language used in their interchanges has been more temperate,
relations with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
seem to have improved very little. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chou</span> En-<span
class=SpellE>lai</span> visited <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>
in November apparently without achieving any agreement. The conference of 26
important Communist Parties, which had been announced for December in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City>, has been
postponed to March. This is regarded as an admission by <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> that her control of the Communist Parties
has weakened, and thus as a victory for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In general the foreign
Communist Parties, and even those of Eastern Europe, whose Governments are
maintained in power by Russia, expressed themselves with unprecedented freedom
in criticism of the removal </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of Mr. Khrushchev. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
new Russian Government has made repeated statements to Indian leaders that the
policy in relation to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
remains unchanged, but in fact there have been indications of a change. In
November a meeting of the World Peace Council, one of the Communist “front” <span
class=SpellE>organisations</span>, was held in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>. The statements of the Russian
delegation at this meeting may be taken as authoritative expositions of policy.
Their resolution listed a number of conflicts and other developments as
dangerous to peace, but did not include under that head <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
acquisition of nuclear weapons. The Indian Communists present, who were of the
“right” or pro-Russia wing, urged that China’s nuclear weapons be named as a
danger to peace, but initially at least the Russians refused, saying merely
that the spread of nuclear weapons makes universal and complete disarmament
more urgent than ever. The resolution also failed to mention <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>’s invasion and occupation of Indian <span
class=GramE>territory</span> as a danger to peace, while it urged <st1:country-region
w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
to settle their dispute “in the spirit of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colombo</st1:place></st1:City> proposals”. <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> had already accepted this formula, but <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
insisting not only on the spirit but on the letter of the proposals, had
rejected it as inadequate. This resolution shows a greater inclination on the
part of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> to appease <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> than
prevailed under Mr. Khrushchev. On December 7 the Russian delegate in the
United Nations General Assembly supported <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s proposal for a conference
of all heads of States to decide upon complete nuclear disarmament. This is
support for <span class=SpellE>Chaina’s</span> completely unrealistic proposal,
designed merely for propaganda, as against <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s equally unrealistic but not
insincere plea for consideration by the nuclear powers of ways to protect the
non-nuclear powers against nuclear weapons. Thus the change in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>’s attitude towards <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

had been foreseen for some time that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

Some of them are influenced by “left” or pro-China Communists, and they appear
to be pleased because <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
possession of atomic weapons will help her campaign of expansion. Some
expressed pleasure because a “white” monopoly had been broken, and it has been
reported that two other non-white countries, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the U. A. R., plan
shortly to make nuclear bombs. Those countries however which are not Communist
or inclined towards Communism were dismayed by the <span class=GramE>event,</span>

make nuclear weapons in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
would violate a solemn undertaking of the former Prime Minister which has been
repeated by his successor. Those who would ignore this consideration have to
think mainly of the expense. From what is known to the public, it might not be
prohibitively costly to make a considerable number of bombs of the simpler
types, though if more “sophisticated” weapons are needed the cost is said to be
much higher. : But to make the bombing planes or rockets necessary to carry <span

would have to carry bombs at least two thousand miles, which would need much
bigger bombers or intermediate range ballistic missiles, both of which are
enormously costly. After persisting with it for some years, so rich a country
as <st1:country-region w:st="on">Britain</st1:country-region> abandoned as
prohibitively expensive the effort to maintain her independent manufacture of

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It would be possible to overcome this difficulty if
one of the nuclear powers were willing to supply weapons and suitable bombers
or rockets on “lend-lease” or similar terms, and to surrender their control to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Nobody,
however, has yet had the courage to suggest such a thing publicly, and no
country has yet surrendered control of any of its atomic weapons to another
country. Immediately after the war in 1945 America denied even her closest
allies any further access to her nuclear technology, and the American President
“keeps his finger on the trigger” of all the nuclear weapons in bases overseas.
Similarly <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> ceased to
aid <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
nuclear development four years before it fructified last October. However,
India’s is a unique case, of vital importance to the free countries, and a
solution of the problem on these lines is at least more likely than general
nuclear disarmament, which is unacceptable to the non-Communist countries, and probably
to the Communist countries, and must be regarded as unattainable in the
foreseeable future. </p>

the middle of October a general election took place in <st1:country-region

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>defeated
and the Labour Party won. Mr. Wilson became Prime Minister and formed a
Government. Almost his first decision was to impose a drastic all-round
reduction of imports, which will have adverse effects on <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, as on
other exporting countries. This was intended only to meet a crisis and probably

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> is
expected to be somewhat more liberal in regard to trade and aid to the
developing countries. However, the future of the Wilson Government is
uncertain. Its majority, of seats and of votes, is very narrow. Indeed the vote
for Labour was slightly below the figure at the previous election. The
Conservative Party vote fell by nearly two million, and the Liberal Party,
despite its lack of able leaders, gained more than two million and received
almost one-seventh of the total vote. Under proportional representation the
Liberals would occupy 80 seats and a position of great influence. This result
is interpreted as due to a desire to displace the Conservative Party after
thirteen years in office, combined with a persistent dislike of the socialist
tendency to impose irksome and inefficient state controls. In the West, aided
by the more profound analysis of the post-Keynesian economists, capitalism has
regained much ground and is now more successful and more popular than at any
time since the First World War. On the other hand, the economy of the socialist
countries has not been strikingly successful in recent years, and doubt is
growing as to the capacity of any socialist system to cope with the vast
complexity of its problem. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

soon after the liberation of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Congo</st1:place></st1:country-region>

orderly administration, and called for aid from the U. N. The aid was generally
successful but was expensive and had to be brought to an end on June 30, 1964.
Soon afterwards, a rebellion broke out in the far north-eastern corner of the

received a small amount of American aid, the Congo Government in <st1:place

In this crisis it asked Mr. <span class=SpellE>Tshombe</span> to take the lead,
and he has achieved some success. Strengthened by several hundred European
officers and men; the army began to progress against the rebels. In November,
the rebel forces, now in retreat, seized some thousands of Congo Government
officials and some hundreds of foreign business people, missionaries and
experts, including about 40 Indians, and threatened to kill them if the
Government forces did not withdraw. Negotiations under the auspices of the
Organisation of African Unity failed, and the rebels carried out their threat
in part and executed many of the hostages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

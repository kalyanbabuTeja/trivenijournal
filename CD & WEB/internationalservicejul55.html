ideal of service, is one of the principal objects of the Rotary. The importance
of this object is becoming increasingly evident from day to day in the present
context of world affairs. One of the signs of the present time is a widespread
demand for international protection of the rights of man. The common aspirations
in the First World War were freedom of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>seas, freedom of
trade, and right to national self-determination. The emphasis then was on the
rights of nations rather than of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>individuals. It was
then assumed that free National States would bring their citizens the blessings
of all freedoms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ideals of the recent global struggle are expressed in the Atlantic Charter and
in Roosevelt’s four freedoms. In the Atlantic Charter, while mentioning the
freedom of nations, emphasis is laid upon human rights, rights belonging to all
men. The Charter of the United Nations pledges its members to take joint and
separate action for the promotion of universal respect for, and observance of,
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all mankind without distinction of
race, sex, language or religion. There is now a new emphasis on positive social
rights such as those of freedom from fear and freedom from want. It is now
universally realised that the need for action in this regard is by
international means and agencies. Therefore, the expansion of the field of
positive rights and the demand for their support by international action, are
the two characteristics of our present aspirations. These aspirations have
their explanation in the realities of the present day society. A mere
declaration of human rights would not indeed take us far. It was done at the
time of the French Revolution. It was done at the time of the creation of the
United States of America, and it was then natural to do so. </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
remedy for the present ills in the field of human rights and human progress and
human freedoms will have to be found less in constitutional checks to
arbitrariness than in the refinement of the outlook of individual citizens and
in creating effective international systems. Without these life in the world
will be ruled by Power, in which there is no room for freedom and no room for
the proper fulfillment of human destiny. It is further observed that the
freedom of the individual in such conditions would not only be hard pressed but
would be frequently suspended in times of national or international conflicts.
Hence the survival of the individual depends first and foremost on a peaceful
international order, international understanding and international goodwill. It
cannot be ignored how men in the mass readily surrender their individual rights
when they are faced with peril to their collective national existence and
national freedom. The freedom of the individual can be sought within the State;
the freedom of the State, on which the freedom of the individual depends, can
be secured only under a system of international </span><span style='font-size:

conscious contact with the environment. Man is a bundle of contacts. He has
natural powers of apprehension. Contact has, therefore, to be established with
the various quasi-universal cultural and other systems, as otherwise they are
bound to become refuges and rallying shelters of all opposing forces. The world
should be secured against any reaction towards private monopolisation, romantic
nationalism, religious eccentricism and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

nourished people would not take to gluttony. Properly disciplined people are not
overwhelmed by sex or other considerations. With sound education of mind and
body and a rigorous protection from dishonourable impulses, it is possible to
give every human being such a liberty of movement and general behaviour as
would now seem incredible to the modern mind and to the modern world. By a
stern and thorough cleansing of human life we can live in freedom. The human
brain released from hunger, fear and other primary stresses of life, is very
easily amenable not only to creative and directive desires but also to kindly
and helpful impulses. The history of mankind is a story of ever increasing
communication and ever increasing interdependence. The material side of
individual freedom should be modified into co-operation with the community. The
individual should accept restrictions upon his freedom and aggressiveness, and
utilise every opportunity for human service and for development of higher
aspects of life. There should be a complete confluence of racial, social and
political destinies. There should be a stable confederation of mankind.
Exploitation for profit and strangulation for dominance should disappear.
Progressive enslavement of the race is an inseparable aspect of free
competition for profit. A new means of communication and a new economic life
which demands that the products of every zone and soil should be utilised for
the needs and purposes of humanity, envisages a re-organisation of human
affairs. There are only two courses open to mankind, either to arrange the
coalescence by rational arrangements to meet the new needs or to allow steadily
intensified mutual pressure to develop ultimately into a world conquest or
conflagration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

no philosophical or truly humanitarian education or understanding in the world.
There is no intelligent criticism of generalisations and general ideas. There
is no science of social processes. People are not trained to understand the
correlations of things for the most par. The industrialists, the financiers,
the political adventurers build up monstrous instruments of destruction and
impose them on the States for the time being in utter disregard of consequences.

international policy, but nevertheless it reaffirms at the same time that
Rotary Clubs should devote their energies towards informing individual
Rotarians and non-Rotarians on all important matters, viewing such activity in
the light of the fact that where freedom, justice, true sanctity of the pledged
word and respect for human rights do not exist, Rotary and the ideal for which
it stands cannot survive. We have a recent statement of policy on Rotary’s
participation in political affairs. The present policy is nothing more than a
summary of a series of declarations evoked in response to world crises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was in 1921, at the convention in Edinburgh, that Rotary adopted the nucleus of
the 4th object which has since been an integral part of the Rotary’s programme.
International service appealed deeply to men whose memories of the First World
War were fresh. Intimate groups of Rotarians were started in the Netherlands in
1930 to bring about further goodwill by personal contact, and these programmes
flourished in Europe through the Thirties. Rotary’s institutes of international
understanding were started in 1936.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

War II was declared in September 1939 and there were Rotarians in lands both
neutral and belligerent. A Committee was appointed in 1940-41 to undertake an
initial study and make recommendations with regard to what the Rotarians might
be doing for the ending of the war. In 1941-42, post-war Committees carried the
study further and drew up many statements as to how Rotarians could help
building an enduring peace and world order. These ideas resulted in a series of
programme outlines in 1942-43 which concluded with the setting up of a Central
World Organisation. In 1942-43 about 40 post-war articles were </span><span

1944, the Rotary International sent the text of Dumbarton Oak’s proposals to
all the clubs with suggestions for using them to create an informed public
opinion behind the efforts of the nations to save succeeding generations from
the scourge of war. Rotarians’ interest in the United Nations Organisation was
recognised by an invitation by the State Department of the United States of
America to send consultants to the United Nations Conference on International
Organisation which was convened at San Francisco on 25th April 1945. Eleven
Rotary International officers and Secretariat staff members took an informal
part in the session, and since that time the United Nations Charter Week is
being celebrated in Rotary Clubs from 11th to 17th of November. The Rotary
International is taking every necessary step towards world stability and for
making the international Organisation effective as a vehicle of world
co-operation. Several books were published emphasising the grave responsibility
of the free peoples themselves to put the United Nations Organisation to
effective uses. The observer for the Rotary International, who is an accredited
representative appointed by the President of the Rotary International, is
admitted into every session of the various Councils and agencies of the U.N.O.
and thus gets first-hand experience of the way the international organisations
function and the problems they face. This attendance and experience enable the
observer to report to the President of the Rotary International, for the
information of the Board itself and the Secretariat, his impressions and his
suggestions as to how Rotarians, can further the objectives sought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The United Nations Charter (Article 55) defines as
“conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and
friendly relations among nations”, the following: “Higher standards of living,
full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and
development; solutions of international economic, social, health, and related
problems; international cultural and educational co-operation; and universal
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all
without our distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.” The similarity between
these goals and those visualized by the Rotary under its Second, Third, and
Fourth Objects is startling. Small wonder, then, that the Board calls upon
Rotarians to “encourage, foster and support” the United Nations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are now in existence more than a thousand
international non-governmental organisations in world affairs, excluding
numerous other international business and commercial enterprises. Their
activities cover practically every aspect of man’s interests. These
organisations have made a significant impact on international life. Their
importance was recognised for the first time when the charter of the United
Nations was framed. Article 71 of the Charter provides specifically that the
Economic and Social Council may make arrangements for consultation with such
organisations. By 1951, 87 such organisations were accorded consultative
status, the Rotary International, of course, being one of them. It is now
universally recognised by all serious thinkers and observers that the world
must develop an international mind, fully appreciating inter-dependence of
nations, if the United Nations is to succeed. An enlightened world opinion is
an essential factor in the successful functioning of these organisations. These
international organisations should create international understanding between
peoples of various nationalities as moulders of public opinion and as “pressure
groups” both on the national as well as the international level. It is indeed
difficult to estimate accurately the achievements and influence of all these
organisations on the international level. These organisations began to gather
impetus from World War II. The international organisations we are referring to
in this context are non-profit organisations. These organisations are to be
found in the economic and social fields, in Agriculture, Science, Education,
Religion, Arts, Land, Communications and Sports. Pressure groups are formed by
way of Trade Unions, Chambers of Commerce, Banks and Churches. The
International Chamber of Commerce represents over 3 million firms. The
International Cooperative Alliance consists of 71 million members. The
International Federation of Trade Unions has on its rolls more than 20 million
members. The Rotary International has an income of over it million dollars a
year and nearly 400,000 members in about 89 countries. If these international
organisations increase in numbers and expand their membership and activities,
the future would appear to be assured.</p>

Republic Day celebrations this year marked the end of the post-partition era
and the opening of the era of reconstruction and regeneration. The Five Year Plan,
partly under way, symbolises this new outlook, and the President in his message
called for the full implementation of this programme of paramount importance.
Side by side with the spectacular gaieties of the capital, in the way of
parades, processions, public meetings, folk dance and song witnessed by the
thousands at the National Stadium, there was a note of serious resolve to work
for the ideal of a welfare State. As Sri Nehru put it. “Many of us have no idea
of the other parts of the country. India is bigger than any of us. The folk
dances and songs represent the spirit of the people.” Sarvodaya Day, 30th
January, was marked by mass spinning at Rajghat, wreaths laid, Gita read, and a
mass rally; forty thousand participated and a vast tableau of Mahatmaji’s life
was presented. The Centre has taken steps to increase the amenities of the
capital, as befitting its importance as an international centre; there is to be
flood-lighting of domes and temples, scenes and sights of historic importance,
with a revolving wheel of light over Parliament House, while in session; a
master plan for better housing in the city is being developed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
President made a tour of Madras State in the second half of February covering
an inspection of the Visakhapatnam shipyard, where 500 trainees gave a march
past, a visit to Bhavani Sagar, the latest reservoir in the South, a pilgrimage
to Madura and Rameswaram Temples, Setu <i>Snan, </i>addresses at Karaikudi and
Madras, a visit to Mahabalipuram–in all eleven days of strenuous tour, which
helped to reassure the extreme South of the country of its vital cultural
importance in the vast pabulum of India’s national consciousness. Meanwhile our
Prime Minister on 21 February switched on the first Power Unit of the Damodar
Valley Scheme; the first of the seven of the multi-purpose projects, the
Tilariya Dam in Bokara, Hazaribagh District in Bihar–a reservoir of twenty
square miles’ extent. The dam is of 94 ft. height and 510 ft. width. As he
opened the life-giving waters to irrigate one lakh acres of new land, Sri
Nehru’s eyes filled with the vision of the India of our dreams; he saw the New
India being born, with cheap electricity for cottage industries, with no need
to wait on, looking to the skies helplessly. The month of February was saddened
by the passing of the great servant of India N. Gopalaswami Aiyangar. In a
feeling reference both the Vice-President and the Prime Minister in Parliament
expressed the national loss “as a gap or a wound difficult to heal”. A life
full of devoted service, of sterling worth, of unmatched administrative
capacity came to an end on 10th February as the tired body dropped down. The
Prime Minister had come to lean more and more on the sagacious and ripe
experience of this veteran statesman and we sympathise with the Prime Minister
in his irreparable loss; and the nation is the poorer today of first-rate
administrative talent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
quarter under review has been a busy time for all legislatures, with opening
addresses and budget debates in all States and in the Centre. Sri Munshi has
set a new precedent by opening the U.P. Assembly with a Hindi speech. One
special feature has been the co-operation extended to Acharya Vinoba Bhave’s
Bhoodan Yajna by legislatures and State Governments. At the Centre a Committee
of Parliament with the Vice-President as Chairman has been constituted. Dr.
Radhakrishnan pointed out the effective social revolution aimed at by the
fundamentally peaceful approach of this unique movement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Nehru took a few days out of Parliamentary duties to go on a joint tour with
the Burmese Premier on the Indo-Burma border towards the end of March. The Naga
Chiefs of the Lushai Hills area gave tumultuous welcome to the two Premiers and
assured Sri Nehru that they would give up their head-hunting practices. The
proudest event of Sri Nehru’s border tour was the opening, in the heart of the
Lushai Hills, of a stretch of 121 miles of road built by voluntary labour.
April opened with the passing of Mr. Asaf Ali in Berne, Switzerland. His death
removes from the Indian scene a valued servant of the people, who was noted for
his breadth of outlook, and outstanding part in the freedom struggle. A week
later passed away one of the great architects of modern Indian industry,
Walchand Hirachand, the pioneer of ship-building, expert engineer and gifted
industrialist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Pradesh sets the pace for the country in nation building. The Community
Projects there are to be extended to a thousand more villages in May next; four
hundred workers are under training; the project is at work in 1500 villages in
9 districts already. The Chandraprabha Project reclaimed 16,500 acres with
convict labour; two lakhs were earned by the workers which they could send to
their relatives, setting an example of greater efficiency. As a special effort
for the Republic Day Week, eight lakh workers with voluntary labour made 800
miles of road, and repaired 700 miles of old road. Another step of great
significance is the proposal of the U.P. Government to grant lands to elementary
school teachers to supplement their income by cultivating them and raising food
crops for themselves–a most valuable proposal worth being tried in all the
States of the Indian Union. The U.P. Government propose to spend 2 crores and
20 lakhs on canals and tube wells; 21,000 maunds of improved seed are being
distributed; the Japanese method of rice cultivation is to be tried in 3
districts; 48 lakh acres will be used and production is expected to go up by
20%; the Universities and Colleges are organising refresher courses for young
farmers. Bengal is putting on hand anti-malaria measures on a large scale; they
are to spend two crores in 5 years on house to house spraying of D.D.T. The
Khargpur Institute of Technology is completing its process for manufacture of
synthetic petrol; it is in an advanced stage. Bengal has a 3.5 crore scheme for
Japanese method of rice cultivation. Seeds and water pumpsets are to be
supplied; production is expected to go up to 3500 lbs. per acre from the
present 800 lbs. Sensational developments of oil prospecting are expected;
large deposits of coal in Darjeeling District are suspected. The experimental
project for mining lignite in Madras State has been inaugurated. In an area of
100 square miles, 2000 million tons of high grade lignite is estimated to lie.
The third agreement for setting up a refinery near Visakhapatnam has been
completed. It is expected to go into operation in 1955; five thousand tons of
crude oil a year will be available. Indian investment up to twenty five per
cent is provided for. Thus there will be three refineries on the whole engaging
fifty crores of foreign capital. One hundred <i>Bhoodan </i>workers at the
bedside of Acharya Vinoba Bhave at Chandil have planned the campaign to reach
the target of twenty-five lakh acres, of which six and a half lakhs have been
already obtained. There has been a phenomenal growth of co-operative societies;
two lakh members control a capital of 10.5 crores. Rice procurement has touched
all-time record, The Food Minister is confident that the total requirement can
be procured internally; foreign purchase will be limited to build up emergency
reserves. The Minister for Agriculture inaugurated on 16th March a nation-wide
campaign for the Japanese method of<i> </i>rice cultivation. Even if two per
cent of the cultivators adopted this method, production will be increased by 14
lakh tons. The Success of this method will solve the food problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

speech in Parliament by Sri Nehru on Stalin’s passing gave Moscow papers banner
headlines. The handsome tribute paid by India’s Prime Minister evoked
sympathetic chords in many hearts–‘end of a certain era in history’, ‘great in
peace and war’, ‘builder of a great nation’, ‘no single figure in history,
played such a large part in history’–phrases of sincere appeal which woke the
world to Stalin’s achievements. The visit of top-ranking medical experts
sponsored by the World Health Organisation is an event of significance. They
spent four weeks in interchange of scientific Information, delivered lectures,
granted radio interviews, conducted operations and paid a great compliment to
medical advance in India. Two Nobel Prizemen were among the team. Two
operational agreements with the U.S.A. have been concluded involving two million
dollars for technical aid for river valley projects and agricultural
implements. Norway is raising 67 lakhs to help in improved fisheries in
Travancore-Cochin–a stretch of ten square miles will be scientifically utilised
by mechanised fishing boats. Out of the forty projects of W.H.O., eighteen are
working in India including the D.D.T. factory at Delhi and the Penicillin
factory near poona. Forty Indian doctors are under training abroad. India is to
give training facilities for South-East Asian countries under the Colombo Plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

event of great significance. Chief Justice Rajamannar is the Chairman. It is
meant to be the first of three Academies; the other two will be the Academies
of Letters and Arts. Maulana Azad presided over the ‘Golden Jubilee of the

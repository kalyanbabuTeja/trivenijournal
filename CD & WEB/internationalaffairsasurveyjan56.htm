style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
is now asking the question whether the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City>
spirit is still alive or dead. Most people attached exaggerated importance to
the ‘Summit Conference’ held last July at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City>
and ignored in their wishful thinking the limitations to the efficacy of the
spirit displayed on the occasion. What the Conference did was to register a new
view of the international situation which dawned on the minds of statesmen in the
two leading States of the world and of those who were their responsible
advisers in the organisation of defence. The piling of atom and hydrogen bombs
had been going on for some time, but statesmen began to ask themselves what the
consequences would be if in a global war between the East and the West actual
use was made of such bombs. It became clear that it would destroy large areas
of the world, including those of the belligerents, and that such a war would be
suicidal. Enlightened self-interest showed that it would be madness to fight
such a war. It was this realisation that made the leaders of Soviet Russia and
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
speak the language of goodwill and peaceful co-existence and it was to this
view that the Summit Conference gave expression. There was not much in the
deliberations of that Conference to show that this dislike of nuclear war would
automatically lead to the disappearance of all causes of tension between the
two blocks and to the immediate solution of all the complicated problems which
kept them divided in the post-war period. Optimists as usual read too much into
the deliberations of the Conference and have felt disappointed when, in the
October-November meeting of the four Foreign Ministers at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City>, the cold atmosphere of the past made
its appearance as usual in all its bitterness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
meeting was expected to find a solution for three problems–the unification of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
disarmament, and increasing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the friendly and peaceful contacts
between the East and the West. The first was the toughest of the three
problems. It was not the first time that the delegates of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>, Soviet Russia, </span><st1:country-region
w:st="on"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region> tried to
find a solution for it. It is now fashionable to swear by the principles of
Pancha Shila and one of these principles is non-interference in the internal
affairs of other States. The putting of this principle into practice would mean
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
withdrawal immediately of all foreign troops from both Western and <st1:place
w:st="on">Eastern Germany</st1:place>, leaving the Germans to settle their
affairs in whatever way they consider best. Neither block, however, is prepared
to do this. That a Conference of four outside powers should go on discussing
among themselves as to what should happen to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, without any German
representative being present at their meeting, is a clear proof of the wide
disparity that exists between principles and practice. The so-called great
powers have in reality arrogated to themselves the position of being arbiters
of the fate of lesser nations, and this has as little justification as the
claim of propertied people to settle the affairs of their poorer neighbours. We
usually forget that in the international world the conflict is not so much
between Capitalism and Socialism as between two power blocks. The sooner the
world realises this the better it will be. It is true that Marxism is against
concentration of wealth, but at the same time it is the worst advocate of
concentration of power and it is this that is at the root of the tension
between the East and the West.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stalemate at <st1:City w:st="on">Geneva</st1:City> was due to the fact that
neither the East nor the West cared much for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> or German unification. Each
wanted to safeguard its own interests and looked at German unification from the
point of view of its own security. There is nothing unnatural in this. This has
been the way of the world all through; and it is bound to be the way–whether
good or bad from the ethical standpoint-in the future, until a real United
Nations Organisation capable of providing collective security for all States comes
into existence. Historians have pointed out that Russia has been invaded again
and again from the West in modem times–by Napoleon, by Wilhelm II of Germany,
by Poland and by Hitler, and the one great problem for her is how to secure her
western frontier from similar attacks in future. It was this that made her
ruthless in adding, in the period of the second World War and in the years that
immediately followed it, twenty, four million European people by annexing
Estonia, Latvia, Ruthenia, Lithuania, East Poland, Bessarabia, Northern
Bukovina, parts of Finland and part of East Prussia, and in establishing her
political and military control over another eighty-seven millions in Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Albania. It was only an
accident that prevented her from establishing similar control over <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Yugoslavia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
When critics of Soviet Russia speak of her as a colonial power it is this that
they have in mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

united <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
allied with the West is from her point of view a source of danger to her

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>why at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Geneva</st1:place></st1:City> she was opposed to
German unity based on “Free” elections. “Free” elections would mean freedom for
all political parties</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to contest the
elections by putting up their own candidates and carrying on propaganda on
their behalf. In the controversies about German unity this has all along been a
crucial issue. The West always pressed for it because it gave to the West the
hope of a non-Communist Government being established in Germany. Such a
Government would, it was hoped, opt for an alliance with the West and for
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>an
Organisation which, in the eyes of the United States, Britain and France, was
fundamental to providing for their security. Soviet Russia agreed to free
elections at the Geneva Summit Conference but she subsequently changed her view
and fought against them at the October-November meeting. She was not prepared
for such elections in East Germany, her satellite, as such a course would
deprive her of the prospects of security and control over the industrial
products of that area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
that there was less danger of an atomic war, she felt that she could afford to
wait. Dr. Adenauer, the Chancellor of West Germany and a sincere ally of the
West, was growing old and was bound to disappear in a few years, and there was
the possibility of lesser men succeeding him which would make it easy for
Soviet Russia to get from them the terms she wanted. Waiting therefore was sure
to bring considerable dividends in the form of a new “Rapallo Treaty” or a new
“Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact”. Now that she had her own ambassador at Bonn with a
West German ambassador at Moscow, direct negotiations would be easy. Germany
united under a Communist Government is what Soviet Russia will welcome most.
The next best thing from her point of view is a neutralised Germany just like
the neutralised Austria. The West is not yet prepared for such a contingency
and the Geneva meeting consequently broke down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Naturally
the question is being asked if this failure at Geneva would bring about the
continuance of the cold war. It looks like </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that to a great
extent. There is not the least idea of either party abandoning the Hydrogen
bomb tests. There was something sardonic in the two distinguished Soviet
visitors to India giving the largest amount of publicity to the explosion of a
new Hydrogen bomb in Siberia</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the most powerful of
its kind. This was followed by the British announcement that there was no
question of their discontinuing the tests which they were contemplating about.
There is also the latest announcement by the United States that early in the
year she would explode in the Pacific the most powerful H. Bomb so far known to
the world. It has also been announced that research is being carried on by
Soviet Russia in the manufacture of “inter-continental ballistic missiles”
capable of travelling from Moscow to Washington or <i>vice versa </i>within
thirty minutes and at fantastic heights; and the United States does not want to
be left behind in this matter. What is happening now is not a suspension of the
cold war but the adoption of a new strategy in carrying it on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is Soviet Russia that has taken the initiative in devising this new strategy.
It has taken three forms. One is to intensify the propaganda against. “Western
Colonialism” and Western<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>system of
military pacts and alliances, to which there is a large amount of opposition in
India and in many of the countries of Asia and Africa. The purpose of this propaganda
is to alienate these countries from the Western bloc and to keep them neutral
in the cold war. The propaganda has been able to achieve much success, because
India and other Asian and African countries know only about the colonialism of
the West under which they suffered for a long time, and know little of Soviet
colonialism in Central and Eastern Europe or in Central Asia. If colonialism
means the domination of one country by another, Soviet Russia should today be
ranked among the great colonial powers. Moreover while Western colonialism is
on the decline Soviet colonialism is on the ascendancy. During the last ten
years the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia, Palestine and
Indo-China, which were previously subject to the West, secured freedom and
became independent sovereign States. Sudan has also become independent a few
days ago. Negotiations are being carried on to give self-government to Malaya,
to the Gold Coast and to several other British dependencies in Africa. It is not
be long before the French colonies in North Africa become free. Western
colonialism is on its retreat and it is the Soviet Communistic empire that is
expanding. Peoples of Asia and Africa have not yet been taught to notice these
happenings and it is no wonder that they have become victims to Soviet
propaganda. Unfortunately the United States has contributed in her own way to
the strengthening of Soviet propaganda, partly by her taking up the cause of
colonial powers like France and Portugal, and by the diplomatic blunders
committed by her leaders like John Foster Dulles, whose statement on Goa did
more than all that Soviet propaganda could have done to alienate India from
her. The day will have to arrive when Asians and Africans can clearly see that
Soviet Russia is as much a “colonial” power as the countries of the West were
till recently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
in respect of the military alliances like the SEATO, the Baghdad Pact etc., the
situation is being exploited by Soviet propagandists. Asians</span><span

alliances as they give opportunities to the Western powers like the United
States to interfere in Asian politics, and may ultimately lead to the
re-establishment of Western colonialism in a new form. It was a great
diplomatic blunder that the United States committed when she organised these
alliances and pacts in the face of the opposition of leading countries like
India. She must have waited till opinion in these countries had time to settle
itself and take a more objective view of the general international situation.
As it is, the governments and peoples of most of these countries have not yet
seen that these military alliances are a reaction to the far more significant
alliance between Soviet Russia and Communist China which is in a position to
mobilise more than eight hundred millions of people in any future war with a
single stroke of the pen. The SEATO and the Baghdad Pact are pygmies when
compared with the Sino-Soviet pact. Moreover these regional pacts are the
outcome of the failure of the United Nations Organisation to provide for
collective security and to realise the other aims and objectives of the
Charter. The primary duty of every nation is to defend itself against
aggression; and it has to devise some means for the purpose</span><span

organisation to which it can effectively appeal when attacked by a hostile
State. It will take time for Asian opinion to realise that military alliances
formed by the United States and Britain are replies to the Sino-Soviet alliance
and that all such alliances should disappear if there is to be real peace.
Meanwhile Soviet propaganda is able to exploit the emotional attitude of the
Asian peoples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second feature of the new Soviet strategy is to supply arms to the countries in
the Middle East and other under-developed areas of the world and establish
closer relations with them. She has supplied arms to Egypt and to some other
Arab States. She has promised to supply them to Afghanistan, Burma etc. This
has been responsible for the tense situation in the Middle East today. Here
again the purpose is to weaken the influence of the West in this area and
strengthen her own influence. It will also lead to a war between Israel on one
side and some of the Arab States on the other. The Arabs have not yet
reconciled themselves to the establishment of this infant Jewish State in their
midst, and Russian arms will enable them to fight out the issue once for all.
Events in Jordan and other places in this area show that the tension there is
between those who have received arms from the United States and Britain on one
side, and from Soviet Russia and her satellites on the other. It may be noted
in this connection that, though the great powers are afraid of a nuclear war, they
are not against small local wars like the Korean war, the Indo-China war etc.,
if such wars have a prospect of serving their interests. It is quite possible
that a war between Egypt and Israel might be of use in establishing Soviet
influence in the Middle East and in securing for her a place in that area equal
to that hitherto occupied by Britain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third feature of the new Soviet strategy is the grant of economic aid to the
backward Asian and African countries. In the past it was the United States that
came forward with such aid. Now Soviet Russia has also entered the field in the
name of what has come to be called “Competitive Co-existence”. It is often
asked by Westerners whether Soviet Russia is in a position to extend such aid
when her own citizens are lacking in a sufficient supply of consumer goods. But
there doesn’t seem to be much doubt about it, as the aid which she will extend
to these countries will be in the form of either capital goods like machinery
and tools or of technologists of which she has a surplus. Investments in heavy
industries have been made on a large scale in Russia and there is need for
finding a market for her surplus machines. After a certain stage every
industrialised country</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>has to find an outside
market for her goods and this is the position of Soviet Russia today. One
incidental advantage that she will secure is the employment of large numbers of
her technicians, without whose help neither her arms nor her machines can be
effectively used by the backward countries. This will bring her numerous
political advantages also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this new strategy of Soviet Russia has created an alarm in the minds of the
American and the British statesmen. Just as they reacted to the Soviet
explosion of H. Bomb in November by arranging for a more powerful H. Bomb
explosion in the coming months, they are trying to counteract the effects of
Soviet economic aid by extending still further their own aid to Asian
countries. This is the crux of the new policy announced by President
Eisenhower. American statesmen now feel that, whatever justification they had
for forming military pacts in Asia, their consequences have been very much
different from what they expected and that they have only contributed to the
decline of their influence in these countries. Anti-Americanism has become a
strong force in several of them. They have therefore decided in changing their
policy. They are now resolved on substituting large-scale and continuous
systematic economic aid for military aid. Whether this policy will be more of a
success remains to be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
again there are two or three things that have to be kept in mind by the Asian
public in appreciating the nature of this aid, whether it is offered by Soviet
Russia or by the United. States. The first is that the aid is not always a free
gift. If Russia supplies arms to Egypt or some other goods to India, it is
always in return for some commodities exported from these countries. This is
true of much of the aid from the United States also. If any free gifts are
made, the United States is in a better position to do it than Soviet Russia.
The second thing is that even in granting economic aid to Asian countries it is
best for the United States to take into her confidence countries like India.
Otherwise the traditional suspicion that the West wants some-how to
re-establish her domination will remain. Thirdly there are countries which feel<i>
</i>that taking any aid from abroad is detrimental to their self-respect and it
should therefore be clearly understood that no strings should be attached to
any aid that is granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fact of the matter is that a new balance of power has come into existence in
the world today. It is the outcome of the position that Asia has come to occupy
in world affairs. There is no prospect of any policy succeeding</span><span

it has the willing co-operation of Asian countries. And among these countries
India has come to occupy a leading place. Her stature has grown immensely under
the lead of her Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru. Almost every country in South
Asia looks to her for guidance and leadership. American statesmen should
realise that, unless she co-operates with them, even the policy of economic aid
may not be a success. And they will be blundering fatally if, while the Soviet
leaders even go out of their way to flatter Indians and their achievements,
they unnecessarily irritate Indians’ susceptibilities as Secretary of State
Dulles did in his uncalled-for statement on Goa. The great problem for American
statesmen is not so much how to counteract the influence of Soviet Russia in
Asia but how to secure the confidence and the willing co-operation of India. On
this hangs the future not only of Asia but also of the whole world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sixteen new members to the United Nations Organisation through what has come to
be known as the “package deal”. There were sixty members in the U. N. O. by
1949. Some States applied for membership before 1949, and some others after it.
The Charter has laid down only two qualifications for membership. One is that
the applicant must be an independent Sovereign State, and the other that it
must be peace-loving and be able to discharge the obligations of membership.
Because of the outbreak of the cold war the applications were not considered on
their merits. States which were non-Communist had to face the veto of Soviet
Russia, and those which were Communist, the veto of the United States and other
Western powers. No State could be admitted a member unless its application was
recommended to the General assembly by seven out eleven members of the Security
Council, and among these seven must be the representatives of the five great
powers</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

situation became so silly that in the last session of the General Assembly,
Canada introduced a resolution recommending the admission of all the eighteen
applicants. It was passed, but no action could be taken unless in accordance
with the rules of the Charter the recommendation came from the Security
Council. The problem was whether the great powers would pay heed to the
resolution of the Assembly. As usual the Council showed its petty-mindedness
when China (represented farcically by Chiang’s nominee) vetoed the admission of
one Communist State, followed by Soviet veto on the admission of several
non-Communist States. It was then that Pandit Nehru used his influence with the

a dramatic turn. Soviet Russia agreed to the admission of sixteen States. She
vetoed the admission of Japan, simply because the admission of her satellite,
outer Mangolia, was vetoed by China. It would have been more magnanimous if
Russia had agreed to the admission of Japan also, as there is no comparison
whatever between Outer Mongolia and Japan. The world has however to be thankful
for “small” mercies. The admission or sixteen new members to U. N. O. has given
it the character of universality to a great extent. It is sure to produce other
effects. Most of the new members belong to the Asia-Arab group neutralist and
anti-colonial. This will lessen the influence</span><span style='font-size:

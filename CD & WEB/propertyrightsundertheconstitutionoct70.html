style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the outset an oft-quoted doctrine requires to be clarified. It is stated in two
propositions: (1) Nothing can be subject to property which is not recognised by
law to be such; (2) When law withdraws such recognition a thing ceases to have
the attributes of property. These propositions mean that right to property
lasts so long as law gives to a particular item the status of property and if
law withdraws that status it ceases to be property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
legal position introduces economic instability, as the valuable rights of a
person to property would be at the mercy of the transitory majorities of
legislatures. At the same time the socio-economic conditions of the country may
require the regulation of the said right in public interest. This problem was
solved by the Constitution by conferring a right to property on a citizen
subject to the laws of social control. In this context property under the
Constitution means all things and rights recognised by law–statutory, customary
and common law–as property before the Constitution came into force. The right
to property in all such things and rights has been guaranteed in the manner
prescribed by the Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
originally absolute individual ownership of property was impressed only with
moral obligations, now it is controlled and governed by legal obligations in
public interest. In short the institution of private law has been transformed
to that of public law. The real problem facing modern India is not so much to
preserve the unlimited right to property but while maintaining the substraction
of individual right and its stability to regulate the use of it in public
interest. If undue attachment to acquisition of property is bad, revolutionary
zeal to dislocate the structure of property is worse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
illustrative definitions of property, one from Anglo-American Jurisprudence the
other from Russian Jurisprudence, may help </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to appreciate the
scope of the right to property and the meaning of the expression “Property”
under the Indian Constitution. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States of America read: “No person shall be deprived
of life or property without the due process of law.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
following wide definition of property is generally accepted in that country.
“Property” in its broader sense is not the physical thing which may be subject
to ownership but is the right of dominion, possession and power of
dispossession which may be acquired over it: and the right of property
preserved by the Constitution is the right not only to possess and enjoy it but
also to acquire it in any lawful mode or by following any lawful pursuit which
the citizen in the exercise of the liberty guaranteed may choose to adopt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
will be seen from the said definition that the right to property consists of
three elements (1) to acquire (2) to own and possess and (3) to dispose of the
same. This apparently unrestricted right to property is subject to the laws of
social control reflected in the State’s right of “taxation”, its “police power”
and its power of “eminent domain”. The absolute doctrine of the freedom of
property propounded by Locke, the makers of French and American Revolutions,
Benthem, Spencer, Kant, Regel and others do no longer hold the field. That
absolute doctrine had its origin when labour and property was united and the
increasing dissociation of the two makes it no longer valid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

economic foundation of the U.S.S.R. is the socialistic system of economy and
the socialistic ownership of the instruments and means of production firmly
established as a result of the liquidation of the capitalistic system of
economy, the abolition of private ownership of the instruments and means of

5. The socialistic property in the U.S.S.R. exists either in the form of

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“In
political economy there is a current confusion between two very different kinds
of private property one of which is based upon the producer’s own labour while
the other is based upon the exploitation of the labour of others. The Russian
Constitution therefore rejects private ownership of the instruments of
production but admits only to a limited extent of private ownership based upon
the producer’s own labour.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is some misapprehension on the scope of the right to property conferred under
our Constitution. An assumption by constant repetition has become a conviction
in some minds that the right to property has been so entrenched in our
Constitution that it is not possible without amendment to enforce the directive
principles. A scrutiny of the relevant provisions of the Indian Constitution as
they stood on 26-1-1950 will dispel this assumption. They are Articles 14,
19(1) (f), 19(5), 31, 32, 39 (b) d (c), 226 and 265. The gist of the said
provisions may be briefly stated thus: Every citizen has the individual right
to acquire, to hold and dispose of property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A duty is implicit in this right namely that it
should be so reasonably exercised as not to interfere with similar rights of
other citizens. The exercise of it therefore should be reasonable and in
accordance with public interest. The directive principles of State Policy lay
down the fundamental principles for the governance of the country and under the
relevant principles the State is directed to secure that the ownership and
control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best
to subserve the common good and that the operation of the economic system does
not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common
detriment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Indeed the State in exercising the power to enforce
this principle does in fact enforce the duty implicit in the exercise of the
fundamental right. The conflict between the citizen’s right and the State’s
power to implement the said principles is reconciled by putting limitation both
on the right and the power. The said fundamental right is not absolute. It is
subject to the law of reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general
public. The State’s power is also subject to the condition that the law made by
it in so far it infringes the said fundamental right should stand the double
test of reasonableness and public interest. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
State also has the power to acquire land of a citizen for a public purpose
after paying compensation. It has the further power to impose taxation on a
person in respect of his property. All the laws made in exercise of the said
powers are governed by the doctrine of equality subject to the principle of
classification. But, the question of the validity of the said laws of social
control and taxation and acquisition is a justiciable issue. Shortly stated
under the said provisions the right to property is subject to justiciable laws
of social control. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Articles place the concept of the right to property in a right perspective. They
definitely reject the Russian theory but accept the doctrine of individual
right to property subject to the laws of social control. The right to property
was conditioned by the social responsibility. The higher judiciary was made the
arbiter to maintain the just balance between private rights and public
interests. The social order visualized by the Constitution was expected to be
brought about smoothly by a process of gradual judicial adjustment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fundamental assumption of the Constitution was that every party that was
elected to power should be bound by the provisions of the Constitution and
should strive to bring about the new social and economic structure of the
country in the manner prescribed therein. Under the Constitution both the means
and the end were equally important to the evolution of a new society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

State has control through its legislative power over the property rights of the

of this ideological debate and dialectics, jurists, research scholars and

compensation relevant to the social and economic conditions of our country. The
broad principles of compensation were well-settled by the Privy Council in <i>Chemudu

market value was considered to be the value to the owner in its actual
condition at the date of the notification under section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act with its then existing advantages and disadvantages and defects
and with all its future possibilities. Different modes of valuation to arrive
at the market value were also accepted by the court depending upon the nature
of the property and the availability of evidence. Comparable sales,
capitalisation of rent, expert valuation are some of the modes. Further
potentialities, special adaptability and the loss<i> </i>caused by injurious
affection to the other properties of the owner of the land acquired have to be
valued. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

In such cases the owner has to be re-instated in some other suitable area.
Under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act of 1919 solatium
of compulsory acquisition and value for potentialities were excluded. There is
also the Norwegian socially justifiable compensation doctrine. All this I have
stated only<i> </i>to show that the valuation of property is not an exact
science. The last word is not said on the subject. There is every scope for
evolving new principle, based on reason, equity and the economic and social
conditions of a particular society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is another problem which is not finally solved but requires further
elucidation. Can the fundamental right to property be waived? The Supreme Court
in Basheshwarnath’s case held by majority that a fundamental right flowing from
Article 14 could not be waived by a citizen or other person who is benefited by
reason of the said provision. As regards the right to property: two judges held
it cannot be waived; two did not express any view but one judge held that it
could be waived. The main reason given for holding it could be waived is that
the right to property is solely for the benefit of the individual and therefore
it could be waived. In my view, none of the fundamental rights could be waived.
There is no scope for making a distinction on the analogy drawn from American
decisions that some rights were conferred for individual benefit and some were
conceived in public interest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
entire part III has been introduced in public interest. The Constitution
attempted to preserve to the people their fundamental rights against
infringement by the institutions created by it. The said rights and their
limitations were crystallized and embodied in the Constitution. It does not
permit importation of any further limitation on the said rights, other than
those contained in Part II by any extraneous doctrines. It is suggested that
Articles 19 (f) and 31 which deal with property are specially connected with
the interest of the individual and the interests of the public do not come into
the picture and therefore they can be waived. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is an underlying fallacy in this suggestion. The right to acquire property; the
right not to be deprived of property except by law and the right to one’s
property not to be compulsorily acquired except for a public purpose and on
payment of compensation are given in the interest of the public. They are
Constitutional safeguards against expropriation or interference with the
property of a citizen in exercise of arbitrary power. The said rights are
conceived in the interest of the security and the stability of the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

relevant provisions are based on the assumption that stability in property
rights is for the good of society. Though there may be scope for different
scales in the matter of the laws of social control depending upon the nature of
the right sought to be controlled there is none in the matter of the
application of the doctrine of waiver. It was said with some plausibility that
if the doctrine of waiver could not apply to the fundamental right to property,
it would lead to the anomalous result that no person could give up the right to
his property to the State. This is based upon a misapprehension of the scope of
the doctrine of waiver. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

means an unilateral agreement not to enforce one’s rights. While a person
cannot waive his right to property, he can certainly enter into bilateral
agreements with the State in respect of his property in accordance with law. A
person therefore cannot waive any of his fundamental rights including the right
to property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sum up, thus, the Constitution conferred individual right to property and to do
business on citizens subject to justiciable laws of social control. The said
constitutional ideology was sought to be substituted by amendment by
totalitarian philosophy in that the said amendments enabled the State in the
exercise of its arbitrary power to confiscate property directly or indirectly
or nationalise any business carried on by a citizen. What was more, they
supported the release of arbitrary power from judicial checks in that regard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>No doubt the Supreme Court, by construction imposed
certain limitations on that power, but they may not prove effective against
determined exercise of arbitrary power. What the Constituent Assembly
apprehended and provided against has actually happened. The makers of the
Constitution and some of them were of the highest calibre and character the Nation
could produce visualized the situation that arbitrary power even benevolent
might destroy property rights among others honestly believing it was for the
good of the country though in fact it was not. </p>

also knew that in modern democracies the executive controlled the majority of
the Parliament, and it could push through any law it liked. They knew further
that in India for a long time to come there would not be enlightened public
opinion. They therefore provided for judicial check on both executive and
legislative action. But it has proved unavailing against the strong majority of
a single party continuously in power for two decades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

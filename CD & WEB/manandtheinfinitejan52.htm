the universe around us and inclusive of ourselves no more than a casual welter
of blind forces, with no intelligent aim or significance, or has it a meaning
and a value for us? The question was provoked by an article by Dr. W. T. Stace
entitled “Man Against Darkness” in the <i>Atlantic Monthly </i>for September
1948, and was discussed in a symposium in the November issue of that journal by
(1) B. I. Bell asking “Is it Really That Dark?, (2) C. F. Hibbard confirming
“the Principle of God”, (3) E.H. Edwards querying “How can we Deny God?”, and
(4) J. C. Perkins directing attention to “the Quest for Basic Values”. This
article seeks to set out a Hindu's view of the points raised in the discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Universe, as all can see, is a miscellany of
beings and not a single unitary entity. Its purposes–if any–may therefore
possibly be as numerous and diverse as are minds or intelligences in it. It is
also possible that the intelligences of its several creatures are in several
stages of evolution–from complete dormancy to rational awareness–so that it is
impossible that the entire Universe can produce any single and precise
statement of purpose as being fully and finally its own at any specified
moment. Further, if we would grant that the Universe is a thing created, it
should follow that the quarter to which we have to turn for light as to its
purpose, if there be any, is its Creator. How should a mere creature know the
mind of its mysterious parent?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
as to its Maker: When we postulate the existence of a Creator, we admit by
implication that He possesses a mind or an intelligence as the active principle
of His workmanship. The neuter pronoun ‘IT’ (Sanskrit <i>Tat) </i>is perhaps
more accurate in our reference to the Creator than either the more usual ‘<i>He</i>’<i>
</i>or the less usual ‘<i>She</i>’<i>. </i>If there be a Creator, IT must be
deemed to be an Absolute Power,–under no obligation to any one. If IT has a
purpose or design in view, IT is not bound to disclose that motive to anybody.
IT may have no purpose at all. What purpose has a child in view when it is
playing,–other than the purpose of enjoying the fun of the play itself? Indeed,
it is the nature of the child in the cradle, when it is awake, to be active
with its little eyes and tiny hands and legs. What plot or plan can it possibly
contemplate? The principle of intelligence within it must express itself. That
is all the truth of the child’s activity. The little one cannot simply bottle
up its energy, and must exude it for sheer self-relief. Analogous to it may be
the activity of the Creator,–the mere process of self-expression, the mere joy <i>(lila)
</i>of self-articulation. An ancient Vedic sage said: “World-activity is the <i>nature
</i>of God. It is His self-existent characteristic. He does not seek anything
from it. What could <i>He </i>want who has in Himself <i>all </i>powers and <i>all
</i>means of satisfying <i>all </i>wants,-He whose wish is no sooner formed
than fulfilled?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>God
may have not one purpose, but many purposes. For each separate being in the
Universe, there may be a different purpose set; and that purpose may be changed
for each from moment to moment. What is needful for each man then is to find
out what exactly the purpose in relation to him may be. On a vast playground
where many elevens are engaged in the game, it is more important that each
individual player understands his position and part than that he should hear
about what is happening in remote parts of the field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
let us think of the third party to the question,-the Questioner. No single
questioner is the whole Universe. No body of questioners, however large and
however well-informed, can count themselves the whole of it. How should a mere
part know the secret of the whole? The whole is an Infinity; the questioner is
a finite speck of it. How should he know the purpose of what is so far larger than
himself? Secondly, why should he know,–more than that he is just a ripple on
the bosom of the ocean of the Infinite?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
very fact that Dr. Stace and his critics are both alike worried about the
existence of a purpose in creation–the scepticism of the first as well as
affirmation of the second–is some ground for holding that the idea of a purpose
or an object is not foreign to the mind behind the universe or the will of the
Creator. A great deal of what science has discovered for us is the reign of
order and system and law in the life of the universe. Without laws making for
regularity and sequence in natural phenomena, life must be impossible. What
makes life worthwhile and planable for man is that which the scientist is able
to glean from the workings of the elements of nature. But if life should be
lived to good purpose, we should see it in its relation to Reality or pure and
perfect principle of being,–life against the background of absolute <i>esse</i>.<i>
</i>Now the point to note is that Reality or the realm of <i>esse </i>comprehends
within itself not only the visible universe, but also an inmeasurable beyond.
What our physical senses can perceive is not the <i>whole of what is. </i>There
are unimaginable stores of energy and power lying hidden here, there and
everywhere, inaccessible to the microscope and the test-tube of the scientist.
The Creator–the Power that manifests itself as the analysable and calculable
universe–does however not exhaust itself in that act. The Vedic seers have it
that “the beings of the universe make up just a fourth part of God, the
All-Pervasive Being; three parts of IT are invisibly lodged in immortality,–in
Heaven.” What exists really is thus, in its fullness, a mixture of the manifest
and the unmanifest, the measurable actual and the immeasurable potential. If we
would understand the significance of life in all its bearings, we have to
reckon with the metaphysical as well as with the physical, with the
transcendental as well as with the material. The scientist thus undoubtedly has
a function to perform in the economy of our life; but he cannot hope to fill
the whole of it. There are offices in it which he must be willing to let others
fill. Among these others are poets, philosophers and practitioners of the
disciplines of the soul, which is the central life-principle in each one among
us,–the principle that designates itself as ‘I’ in every living being.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dr.
Stace is apparently an impatient man. He is in a hurry to hear the verdict of
science on the ultimate problems of being. But science has still a long race to
run to arrive anywhere near the post. Great scientists have, without doubt,
covered large tracts of what once was <i>terra incognita </i>in the realm of
Nature and garnered much precious knowledge for us. But every one of them has
at last found himself brought up against an impenetrable iron curtain. His
telescopes and microscopes and arc-lamps and X-ray apparatuses have proved of
no avail there. But, is that enough reason for us to conclude that the search
is over and in vain? Is it not possible that there are instruments of other
kinds to be tried? It is in that other direction that the scientist has to look
for light to glimpse that region which his accustomed instruments have not
helped him to penetrate. In sober truth, the methods and the instruments of the
scientist are objective. But what Professor Stace asks to see is a vision not
susceptible of objectification. Nor is that vision exclusively a matter of
subjective speculation. It can be attained only by means of a subject-object
continuum,–that is, through the integration of the sense of ego and the
non-ego, through the abolition of all distinctions of ‘mine’ and ‘not-mine’, In
other words, it is the commingling of the individual with the universal,–the
mergence of the creature in the Creator <i>via </i>the Creation. This
realization of man’s oneness with ALL that there is, is not a process of simple
ratiocination and intellectual apprehension, as are the concepts of
mathematics. It is to be acquired through hard and long continued disciplines
of the soul. It calls for a training of emotions and an enlarging of fields of
self-sacrifice. It is passing beyond the notions of dualism like good and evil,
beautiful and ugly, sweet and bitter, and reaching such a state of
mind-intellect-fusion in which one is able to feel as though one were verily
the inner pervasive spirit of the whole universe and could contemplate the play
<i>(lila) </i>of life-forces, unruffled and calm, as if one were a distant and
disinterested spectator, desiring nothing for himself, because there is no
‘self’ to count as his own, apart from the Infinite Being at play around him.
To experience this is the highest of felicities. It comes as the fruit of the
sublimation of all human faculties. Words are vague and inefficient to depict
it in its fullness. For each man that has known it, it is an individual
possession of his own. No communism and no socialism are possible in the pure
realms of the spirit. The value of all social and institutional life is merely
as part of a course of discipline for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

multiplicity comes the illusion (<i>Maya</i>) that divides creature from

between them. To get back from these contradictions of the universe to the

helps no one to dismiss the Hindu view as Pantheism. That is a word having
varieties of meaning. It is better to study a view or an idea before attaching
a label to it. The core of the Vedic philosophy is the faith that the universe,
including its observer, is the embodiment–but not the exhaustive embodiment–of
the Supreme Being or God. But we the worldlings do not see it as God. A great
deal which makes the creation of God seem a home of the ungodlike and a
battlefield of blind forces–a great deal that makes God look either powerless
or reckless–prevents our seeing Him in His handiwork. These other-than-God and
anti-God aspects of the universe are but appearances; and it is the appearances
that constitute the play–the masque that turns being into acting–Into
play-acting. The multifariousness of the universe–the separateness of bodies
and minds, the distinctness of life-centres, the diversity of
individualities–creates the illusion of division in existence, narrowing down
the realm of each soul to the walls of the body and giving rise to egoism and
conflict. <i>Maya </i>or the<i> </i>mask of illusion which is part of Nature’s
handiwork engages its own progenitor in a game of blind-man’s buff. It is the
Creator’s own self-amusement <i>(lila). </i>It is the sport of good and evil

from the changeful to the changeless, is the supreme purpose for man; and to
serve as a school for it is the implied purpose of the universe. It is the
Mayic world that quickens man’s hungers and calls up his ego. It stirs a
hundred passions in his breast; it coaxes him and teases him; it foils his

equanimity and peace. The passing shows of the world then cease to disturb him.
The soul within and without is then the only reality to him. All else is worn out
and melts away like mists after sunrise. Such a tranquil, passionless mind,–not
tinged by thoughts of ‘mine’ and ‘thine’–is the instrument that can enable man

science of the stars or of the earth. There is an inner eye in man which needs
education for metaphysics, just as there is an outer eye that needs education

that he does not understand noumena. Nature is both kindly and cruel. She feeds
only to kill. She attracts only to mock at. But, is that not what makes the
play? It is a challenge to man’s sensibility. Can he look beneath the surface?
Has he learnt to comprehend the spiritual substratum of life? Has he a scale of
values for the world based upon the truth behind the world? Does he care for
morality? Has he put himself to the trouble of searching for the foundations of
morality?</p>

pole of a formula or an argument so that, by one neat leap taken with it, they
could land themselves at the centre of life’s mystery. But life is more than
intellect. It is at its core a spiritual fact. The sages of India, therefore,
ask for the training of all the faculties and the regulation of all the
impulses of man. Effort of the intellect is by no means counted superfluous. It
is indeed insisted upon. But it is by itself held to be insufficient. It must
be supplemented by efforts of the will and the imagination,–the will to tear
down the bright silken prison-screens of the petty individual self, and the
imagination to see and feel your own self as one with the limitless expanse of
life around. All this means daily and hourly <i>conduct</i>. It is the <i>practice
</i>of Philosophy in living. Such a unified effort of intellect and will and
imagination ca be possible only with certain inhibitions of sense-hungers and
their reactions. Life has a physical basis and that basis must first be put in
order if the mind-intelligence faculties should function as they should. Hence
the value of ascetic abstinences. Hence the insistence of non-greed and

the presence of misfortune and adversity. All is the Lord’s and nothing is
yours. You are but a trustee in relation to what it pleases Him to put in your
hands. If such be one’s attitude, is it possible one will ever be in a hurry to
rush to war? It is the practice of moral self-discipline that can give the eye

second point of difference between the Hindu and his brother of the West is in
that, while the latter habitually seeks God outside of himself, the former is
taught to see the ray of God’s light in his own being. God is to the Hindu the
all-pervasive life-principle. He therefore has no need of an external witness
to the workings of God. His own existence is a witness, and what could be more
indubitable or more convincing? God’s voice is in your very heart-beats. God is
an inescapable Presence. It is an ever-potent Immanence discernible by men with
cultivated souls. Every soul is a centre of an endless succession of circles of
living. The Vedic word for God <i>(Brahman) </i>means literally ‘the Great
Being’–the one Reality which is greater than everything man can know or think
of–which therefore holds within its womb everything existent–which at the same
time is so subtle that it resides within the womb of the minutest thing in the
universe. To prompt and persuade and teach and enable man to sense this Truth
of truths is the purpose of the lovely-frightful, half-responsive and

world is the soul’s gymnasium. Attracting and thwarting, challenging and
evading, cajoling and defying, a bait in one hand and a hook in the other,
Mother Nature plays with man. Bringing into the field an infinity of resources,
she calls up the infinity of his hidden resistances. He strives awhile and then
slackens; he sees success within reach and falls down dazed when stretching out
the arm to grasp it. Now he seems to prevail and now he retreats. Never wholly
winning and never fleeing from the battle, he carries on the wrestling play
with the universe from day to day and from hour to hour, ceaselessly,
eternally. “For whose good” would ask Prof. Stace. To the player’s own good. To
the onlooker’s good too. Are we not glad to live, even as we ask whether life
has a purpose? Making new adventures and meeting new trials, Man the
infinite-phased develops his own soul’s muscle and sinew, so to say: he goes on
so building up his inner strength that one day the challenge of the world will
be to him no trail at all. That strength is his new scale of values,–a new
focal point for his eye. He has come to realize that the great mighty play of
universal forces is after all a play: that comedy and tragedy are mixed in it
so that the play may be of interest: that there are limits to the significance
of the parts assumed in a stage-play: that to take things too seriously is to
invite misery to oneself,–which again would be an extension of the
play-illusion. The experienced actor, creates illusions for others and is
himself not subject to them. So is the man who, having observed </span><span

passed beyond the barriers erected by the sense of <i>Self. </i>No more hate

an invisible forest-grove. We catch the fragrance of flowers wafted by the wind
and think it a miracle and a mystery because the trees and the creepers are not
accessible to our eye. Love and life-hunger and the impulse for knowledge are
master-mysteries in the perennial mystery of life; and the science which can
give us the key to them is not physics or physiology, but the science of
soul-culture. It is the constant practice of the identification of oneself with
the All. It is the personal realization of the oneness of individual life with
life universal. This is subjective ethic, not objective logic. Let him, who

great change in Telugu Poetry which was not even suspected by a thousand years
of history has been noticed in the past twenty-five years, i.e., the
post-independence period. In fact the face of the world has been metamorphosed
in this twentieth century and our country followed suit. Various literatures of
the world welcomed the change and ours is no exception. Time was a tortoise in
the ages gone by but now a swift rodent it is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

harbinger of the Modern Age in Andhra, Veeresalingam, blew the trumpet of
reformation and the Andhra race rose from its stupor and stood in tune with the
spirit of the age. Another herald of the times, Gurazada, paved the way for a
new outlook. Gidugu, a staunch advocate of the popular Telugu language
movement, appeared on the scene and a few young nightingales came out of their
aviaries in quick succession, lisped behind the leaves and muttered the
melodies of the dawn. ‘Totas’ and ‘Minas’ are unrythmic in their utterances but
sweet and sound in their voices. The twin poets, Tirupati Venkata Kavulu,
adepts in the varied facets of literature, poured some new wine in the old
bottles and created in the people a wish and relish for new recipes in poetry.
The potentialities of the age are such that Viswanatha Satyanarayana, a monitor
of their school and the recent Jnanpith awardee, who is acclaimed to be the
Hercules of traditionalism, displayed new exhibits of his own in the museum of
antiques. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Romantics of the West waged war against traditions and had an impact on our
young collegians of the day. Rayaprolu and Devulapalli pioneered the Romantic
movement in Telugu. A still more novel approach and a process with a more
serious purpose were already in the offing when two valiant knights of the
progressive movement, Sri Sri and Narayanababu, drew their swords and tried to </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>smash
the shackles or the age-long traditions. Sri Sri made experiments with word and
phrase, metre and diction, poetic conventions and concepts with a spirit of
socialism and purposeful realism. Sri Sri and Narayanababu in their craze for
the new, even went to the extent of embracing surrealism. The two along with
Pathabhi offered a few samples of brilliant prose-poetry in spoken Telugu. All
this forms a prelude to the modern Telugu poetry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1947 we achieved independence. The Romantic trend was already on its wane.
Surrealism and other anarchic trends were nipped in the bud. Tradition is alive
and progress blossoms. Yes, these two are the two distinct features of the
poetic muse in Telugu now. A harmonious blend of the two is also discernible.
The equipment of any poet naturally comprises his own experience, imagination,
observation, information, taste, temperament and outlook. But today the poet’s
outlook is in the front ranks of his elements, becoming responsible for
differences and disputes amongst poets. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
seem to be three facets in the present traditionalism in poetry. In some poets
it is almost another name for a morbid fastidiousness. In some it beams with
its pristine purity, while blooming with modern techniques and novel
approaches; and in others it woos the progressive school which is wedded to
socialism and combats the old order in the society. The <i>Lingo </i>and the <i>Kurma
</i>puranas of Molugu Chandramouli Sastry, the <i>Mahabhagavata </i>of Sri Rami
Narasimha Murty Kavulu, the <i>Harivamsa </i>of Viswanatha Narasimham, the <i>Sri
Krishnatimanusha tatvam </i>of Divi Rangacharvulu, the <i>Bharata, </i>the <i>Bhagavata
</i>and the <i>Ramavana </i>of Bulusu Venkateswarlu and the <i>Aswatha Bharatam
</i>may be cited as examples for the first category. At times the splendour of
classical tradition is eclipsed in their work by mere traditionalism and
obscurantism. Rarely do we come across a touch of originality in these works.
In works like the <i>Sankara Vijaya </i>of Vemparala, the <i>Andhra Purana </i>of
Madhunapuntula, the <i>Ramayana Kalpavriksha </i>of Viswanatha, the <i>Mahatma
Katha </i>of Tummala, the <i>Bhuvana Vijaya </i>and the <i>Bhargava Romayana </i>of
Anantapantula, the <i>potana Charitra </i>of Vanamamalai and in the works of
Jashuva, Etukuri, Jandhyala, Indraganti, Katuri and Marupuri and the like, the
traditional and the modern outlook are complementary to each other. Past
masters of the traditional school, Viswanatha and others with their brilliant
strokes of pen made them conducive to each other and flourish in harmony.
Amongst the composers belonging to the third category, some entered the new
realm of thought with all sincerity, some as a matter of fancy and fashion,
some unwittingly and some with desire and hope to win appreciation from all
corners. All these are harmless folk and may be styled as truce-makers between
the crusaders, Dasarathi, Narayana Reddy, Sampat, Vidwan Viswam, G. Seshendra
Sarma, Boyi Bheemanna, Mukurala Rama Reddy, B. V. Narasimha Rao, of the
juvenile literature fame, and the poets of the “Chetanavartam” school are some
or the kind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may not be out of place if we mention here a few things about our universities
in this regard. Many poets with promise ceased to compose after they got into
the universities. Pingali, Ganti, Rallapalli, Nidadavolu, Divakarla, K. V. R.,
Kerlapati, Ramakoti Sastry, etc., stand witnesses to the statement. But
Narayana Reddy, Suprasanna, M. Ranga Rao, etc., are a few exceptions. The
universities are for them nests but not cages. Pursuits in poetic research in
the universities mostly pertain to the ancient classics. The books prescribed
there by the Boards of Studies under the name of modern poetry are modern only
in name but not in spirit. Some of their authors exist in the present but
wallow in the styx of the past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
is tradition and where is it? It lies in the consciousness of the poets, in
their thought process and patterns, concepts and conceptions and in their
outlook revealed through the poem. The nature of their themes, language,
metres, poetic conventions and techniques and laws and standards, aims and
objects naturally fall in line with the urge of their inner being. Broadly
speaking, most of the themes of the traditional poems belong to the ancient
times but not in all cases. Viswanatha, no doubt, husbands the Traditional Muse
today, but his themes in poems like the <i>Kinnerasani Patalu, Varalakshmi
Trisati, Girikumaruni Premageetalu, </i>etc., are quite modern in their spirit
and set-up. The medium of most of the traditionalists is Classical Telugu but
it differs much from Nannaya’s or Tikkana’s. Some in fact wrote in spoken
Telugu. All their metres too are not old fashioned and outmoded. Viswanatha’s <i>Kinnerasani
Patalu </i>and <i>Kokilamma Pelli </i>are fine poems in the modern lyrical
modes. Jandhyala and others composed prose-poetry too. Tikkana was a giant
amongst the architects of poetry in Telugu in the past. So also was Surana. But
Viswanatha’s techniques are different from their’s, although he is a devout
traditionalist. The poetic conventions and attitudes of poets like Rayaprolu,
Tallavajjhala and Devulapalii are like new beats on antique drums. Rayaprolu in
his testament of modern poetry called <i>Ramyalokam </i>asks us whether it is a
matter of impossibility for the Parsi songs to be tuned on Saraswati’s Veena
and for the roses to blossom in the Rishis’ ‘Neevara’ fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of the poets of the traditional school aspire for a heavenly reward (Punya)
through their composition. It is a matter of blind faith. Some believe in the
olden adage–<i>“Viswa sreysh kavyam” </i>(i.e., poetry stands for the universal
well-being). It is progressive outlook. Mere okaying that everything old is
true and good should not be the spirit of tradition. <i>“Puraanamityeva na
saadhu sarvam na chaapi kaavyam navamityavadyam,” </i>(i.e., Everything, simply
because it happens to be old, is not good; if a Kavya happens to be novel is
not bad on that account) said Kalidasa with wise consideration. Somerset
Maugham expressed in his “The Summing Up” respect for tradition but thought
that it should be a guide but not a jailor to our progress. Tradition is that
which makes a whole race but not a few individuals hold the head high for
generations, which paints the achievement of the past on the canvas of the
present and which makes the men look forward with hope for a bright future. It
is the presentness or the past as T. S. Eliot rightly put it. It is certainly
welcome if only it is conducive for our progress. If it is a hindrance, it
should be treated with the contempt it deserves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
us now see what progress does mean to us. The modern age since its dawn has
been responsible for a political consciousness and social enlightenment in the
community. The individual and the society at large are subjected to a series or
changes, some of which resulted in a positive development. The progressive
writers tried to embrace the change in literature. They thought that mere
reflection of things is not enough and deemed it necessary to think of positive
solutions to problems and that taking refuge in socialism is the only way left
open to realise the purpose. People should be roused and awakened, social evils
should be wiped out, an ever new social order must come into being and all this
should be a superstructure on the foundation of a sound ideology–this is their
determination number one. Literature has a role to play in the shaping of the
society, and in its turn it should be shaped in such a way as to suit the urge
of the hour and the need of the common man–this is their determination number
two. Accordingly its themes should reflect the realities of the present, its
form and medium should be well within the reach of the common man, i.e., spoken
dialect and lyric and prose are preferred to the classical language </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
metres. All other poetic conventions should match the portrayal of the modern
set-up. This, in short, is the crux of their literary philosophy. The
foundation for this movement was laid down by Sri Sri who for a time paced and
raced in the footsteps of Gurazada. He considered tradition a hindrance,
principle a fetter, and faced them with clenched fists. Tradition strengthens
further, the robust poet and his poem. Principle keeps the tradition alive. But
Sri Sri having seen in our country the speedy spread of the plagues of
meanness, injustice and exploitation has become the angry Jove, spilling not
tears, but fire from his eyes. In moments when over-powered by spite and
emotion, he forgets to think and loses all temper and modesty too. But as
Coleridge puts it, poetry requires </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that emotion should be
recollected in tranquillity when the poet’s imagination is about to assume a
lasting shape. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rajasekhara
is also of the same opinion as can be gathered </span><span style='font-size:

a Sloka, compose the whole of Ramayana as thus? Not at all. Emotion is
something like a lightning and sudden sprouting of the heart. Recollection is
like butter in its core and is the essence of the poet’s mind. Nevertheless,
Sri Sri changed the role and the costume of the Telugu Muse with a sincere wish
and serious hope to suit the urge of the times. The storm created by that great
rebel made the rocks shiver and the gravels fly. Some of the songs of his <i>Mahaprasthanam
</i>were composed long ago but the book such was published for the first time
in the early years of our i</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>f the Telangana was in full swing and the
strength of the people facing the formidable foe, the Nizam, was in its
element, some young poets having been flabbergasted rose in one voice following
the example of Sri Sri. Anisetti composed his <i>Agni Veena, </i>Dasarathi his <i>Rudra
Veena </i>and <i>Agni Dhaara, </i>Somasundar <i>Vajraayudham, </i>Rentala <i>Sangarshana,
</i>Arudra <i>Tvamevahom </i>and so on. All<i> </i>these works kindled in the
people time consciousness and a new vigour of thought and aspiration and thus
paved the way for the spread of progressive literature. Every progressive
writer has a searching eye for the bitter realities of the world<i>. </i>But
there is yet another typical class of poets amidst them who peep deep into the
crevices of the inner consciousness of the man and try to translate thoughts
into a sort of tele</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pathic language in a mood of
self-introspection. Dr. Madiraju </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ranga Rao seems to be
an eminent artist who patented this type. All his works, for instance, <i>Melkonna
Aakaasam, Kirmeeraalu </i>have a mystic touch of their own. Kesava Rao, Gopala
Chakravarti, Durganand, Aripirala Viswam, Vegunta Mohan Prasad are some of the
advocates and solicitors of the school. Their imagery is at times clumsy and
far-fetched. Most of their expressions are echoes of distant voices. Some of them
in the beginnings of their poetic career wrote in classical and modern lyrical
metres but of late there is a marked shift in their poetry from the rococo to
the baroque. Prose-poetry has become rather a feverish pursuit nowadays on
account of these poets. Past masters of this art are Kundurti and Tilak.
Tilak’s <i>Amrutam Kurisina Raatri </i>tops the list of progressive poems in
poetic genius and in the power of expression. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

more exasperating and breath-taking change unrivalled and unknown in the
history of Telugu literature came into being in early 1965 under the name of
the Digambara movement. The poets of the movement are the Telugu counterparts
of the Beatles and the angry youngmen of the West who hovered as vultures on a
society putrified on account of the countless kinds of atrocities and
exploitation of the privileged people and who wanted to shake the foundations
of the society where the ghost of the past still lingers. The pen names of the
Digambara poets seem symbolic, typical and characteristic. They are
Jwaalaamukhi, Nagnamuni, Nikhileswar, Chera bandaraaju, Mahaaswapna and

literary anarchist, Allen Ginsberg. Their movement is almost the foster child
of the Naxalite movement and their howls and brawls are nothing but amplified
cries of the great rebel. Sri Sri, who announced to the world long ago that <i>“Himsana
chana dhvamsa rachana” </i>(i.e., destruction by violence) is his intention and
revolution is his philosophy, was waiting for an opportunity and in 1970 on the
eve his “Shashtipoorti”, his dreams were realised when he joined hands with the
heirs of his philosophy, the Digambara poets and established the “Viplava
Rachayitala Sangham”, i.e., Revolutionary Poetry Association. On that
red-letter day in his poetic career, he was audacious enough in branding his
own erstwhile sergents-at-arms the progressive writers, as traitors on the
pretext that they were supporting the democracy in the country. He intends to
steer the revolution in a novel manner. He wishes to wield the pen as sword and
the words as blows. He firmly believes that “the younger generation
unconditionally invites the revolution.” Evidently he is our “Literary Mao.”
Perhaps he takes pride in the epithet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Arudra gives us his own blueprint of the Digambaras as
follows: “Digambaras work with vengeance against the society…their writings are
not progressive. They preach the philosophy of destruction for the sake of
awakening. The present set-up in their eyes is something like a state of
leprosy. They entertain more animosity than pity on the helpless clutched in
the set-up. As such, emotional outbursts and indecent expressions overcome the
element of good poetry in them.” There are people who join with Arudra in his
deliberations. Yes, the Digambaras are more aggressive than progressive.
Curiously enough some of them were arrested by the Andhra Pradesh Government
last year. It was really an unprecedented event in our literary history. </p>

have already made my position clear that essentially there are only two highways
in Telugu literature at present–the Traditional School and the Progressive
School. The Poetic Muse paces on one and races on the other. The influence of
each is felt on the other, even if the parties wishfully do not like it or do
not admit with self-conceit. One can infer by this reciprocation that the
spirit is alive in both the schools. Viswanatha is the godfather of the
Traditional School, whereas Sri Sri is the ring-master of the other. These two
are the only poets in Telugu who can be styled as thinkers. Both parties
expressly admit that the present society is stinking. Both invite major changes
in its set-up and wish a state of well-being for all mankind. Their end is one
and the same. Only their means differ. It is yet to be seen which way leads us
to the destination. Time is the best judge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the name of tradition was already pervading or literature. Confusion in the
name of progress was already rampant. But tradition saved the society from a
complete doom and pandemonium. The Telugu Muse has had last year a great day of
honour when Viswanatba’s <i>Ramayana Kalpavriksha, his magnum opus </i>and a
masterpiece in Telugu literature, was awarded the Jnanpith prize. The
progressive movement was chiefly responsible for the spread of a good measure
of literary consciousness in<i> </i>the people. It has stirred the society with
agitation. It is<i> </i>derisive and offensive in its policies and approaches,
unlike its counterpart which has to be always defensive even for the sake of
its existence. It has changed the course of the poetic stream, sponsored new
“ghaats” and brought the distant shores nearer. It has exhibited a wonderful
novelty and variety in theme, form, medium, technique and purpose. The </span><span

with vision and understanding sincerely opine that mere ideologies and slogans
do not make poetry. But it can exist in any school and can be a vehicle for any
kind of thought, feeling or idea. It is something else and distinct from all
these things. Poetry in my consideration is something which through its
melodious medium translates a pretty thought or feeling into a kindred
experience. Variety in its various aspects gives it a colourful demeanour and
alluring effect. “Variety is beauty” is a thoughtful utterance of a kindred
soul. Variety is a<i> </i>fundamental law of nature. <i>“Loko bhinna ruchih” </i>is
a perpetual truth. It is for the Sahridaya to give due consideration to all
these things just to enable himself and others to enjoy poetry, first as an art
and then as a vehicle for other things. Mere enjoyment may not be misunderstood
as inept hedonism. Poetic enjoyment, even if it is devoid of any instruction
and offers no message, is capable of making a man ‘rasajna’ and thus if the
horizons of his aesthetic experience, vision and values are broadened, the
strength of the brute in him gets dwindled or vanished and so he loses the
ability to do anything bad, is able to behold beauty in and around him, comes
out of his shell and reacts and responds to things and thus is very near to his
own self and to the humanity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all, both the above schools are only rivals. A lasting compromise is possible
even between fast enemies. Let each school follow and propagate its own
ideology and live in peaceful co-existence with the other as a neighbour in the
abode of the Poetic Muse. It is gratifying to note here that today there is no
longer a tussle between the Pandits’ poetry and the folk poetry and that there
are people who can recognise the muse in any guise, appreciate and assess her
beauty and nature. Let it be the lame case with these two schools.</span><span

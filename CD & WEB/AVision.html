<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">It was the hushed hour of midnight,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All living creatures had gone to sleep and restful repose,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Save one traveller on a mountain road.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The faint moon lightened his fair brow,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Soft breeze rippled over his wavy hair;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Of a sudden he heard a sweet voice,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And a wondrous fragrance wafted o’er to him;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He looked up and beheld a glory of light</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Which nearer and nearer came</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And revealed itself in the form of a woman.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Never in dream nor in life</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Had he beheld a woman so beautifully divine:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"Who art thou", quoth he,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"What want'st thou of me?"–</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"Knowest me not?" –said she,</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="CENTER">"</FONT>And that my path spreads across and over thy heart?"</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Her voice was like a song</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That never was nor could ever be.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thus the traveller’s soul was filled with a peace</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That never was nor could ever be.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Verily ’twas the Spirit of the Earth</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who came and spake to him that loved Earth so:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The brimming life that was in all her living beings</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She it is that made all life grow–</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Fuller and richer at every instant of eternity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Suddenly the traveller felt an unaccountable thirst,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And she, divining his desire,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Beckoned him to a spot</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Where, from the heart of a bare rock,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gushed forth a spring of bubbling crystal clear water:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He drank and instantly all the thirst of his life</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Was quenched by the water that was sweeter than life itself:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"Wilt thou not ever again come to me?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"To appease my thirst", –then he gently asked:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"But", she said, "I am never away or far from thee,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"Thou dost see me in the dust of thy path,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"Hear my voice in the song of birds,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"Behold my face in the blossoming of flowers,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"In the dance of the sunlight on tree-tops,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">"In all manifestations of growing life."</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She then put her two lovely, gentle hands on his brow:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Her touch was like a benediction.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">An exquisite rapture filled his soul:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He closed his eyes and when opened them again,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She was gone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Only the fragrance of her touch</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Lingered in the hushed silence of the dying night,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And a peace deep as the unfathomable depths of the human heart</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Flowed over the path of the waning moon:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The stars quivered and lighted the path</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Of the lonely traveller</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Towards the journey’s end.</P>

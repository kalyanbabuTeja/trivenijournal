I had prepared to leave this Jullunder camp by tomorrow’s plane, I was looking
forward cheerfully to going home, meeting Kanan, my brother’s wife, taking
sunshine and laughter into her dreary life, making her talk and laugh, and
telling her that God wasn’t blind, her love must be rewarded, and Dileep must
return. And today morning, when I was full of these rose-coloured dreams, I had
learnt from a Sikh officer who had newly come to Jullunder that my brother had
died five years ago, there wasn’t a shadow of doubt about it. This Sikh officer
too had been in the Rani of Jhansi Regiment along with my brother. They had both
been wounded when Rangoon had fallen into the hands of the British on the 4th
May 1945. They had both been removed to the hospital where he had seen with his
own eyes my brother’s dead body taken away…. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

almost cancelled my leave and decided not to go home. I hadn’t the heart to be
the bearer of this tragic news to Kanan. But other thoughts had curbed my
desperation. It wasn’t necessary to break the news, I thought. I could keep it
to myself. Kanan would be happy to meet me. She loved me so. Yes, that would be
for the best, I decided...Yet I cursed the perversity of chance that had
brought me convincing </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

hand, and stood before the mirror. And then, as I looked at myself in the

bloom, I knew, away in Srinagar beyond the mountain pass; spreading its riot<i>

glory. As though Spring had traversed this land on its way across the
snowcapped peaks, and left its footprints behind. The evening breeze softly
rustled as it fanned the sun-scorched earth. The silver of the moon touched the
massive Chinars and the tall slender Safetas. There were islands of willows and
thickets of Piyach grass in the distance on both sides of our road. The air
smelt of the Panjeena and Khatai blooms, and, when a whiff of Yosman scent

backwards with heavy steps, and digging out the ruins of the past...as though
to ask, “Do you remember this? This? And this?...”</p>

first met Kanan at a party given by the Principal of our college in honour of
the cricket team of which we brothers were both members. As we sat in the
drawing-room, before dinner, mixing with the other guests and talking chiefly
cricket, the Principal brought an elderly gentleman towards me. “Meet my friend
Mr. Premnath, Executive Engineer,” he said to me, “He was keen on meeting you.”
I bowed and shook hands. “Very pleased,” I murmured, and then, wanting to
compliment him on his fine health, I said, “You must have played quite a lot of
cricket in your young days, Sir.” He grinned. “You<i> </i>bet I did,” he said.
But I wasn’t looking at hin. Another face had caught my eye–the face of a young
girl behind him. “Come, up,” I heard </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

her, “What’s keeping yon back?” And then turning to me he said, “she was even
more keen than her father on meeting you.” She stepped forward. I should have
folded my hands and said “Namaste”. But an impulse made me decide against this
respectful aloofness. “How do You do?” I said, and offered my hand. Was she
surprised? Perhaps. But then a sweet smile flickered round her lips, and the
next instant I felt the softness of her fingers...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

let a week pass, and went to her house. She seemed Surprised on seeing me.
“You’ve come alone?” she murmured. Her voice puzzled me. I couldn’t decide
whether she was disappointed not to find my brother with me, or thought it
improper of me to go alone to a girl. I had never before run after any girl. We
brothers were known–or rather notorious–for our lack of romance and had been
nicknamed ‘The Frigidaire Brothers’. My desire to visit Kanan had surprised me,
and I had fought with it for a whole week. I hadn’t even disclosed to Dileep
that I was paying her a visit, fearing he would make fun of me...And now she
asked me, “You’ve come alone?” I thought of running away. But she had closed
the door behind me. “I’m glad You’ve come,” she was saying. She moved towards a
window, dragging her ‘Chappals’ on the carpet. I followed her. Her little white
feet looked very pretty under the dark border of her red ‘Sari’.’ There was
grace in her movement. Her stem-like neck which matched her height was </span><span

invitation made me happy. But I could also see in it the threat that I would
have to discuss poetry every time I called on her. This made me nervous. She
would soon discover my utter ignorance of literature, I thought, and I should
be clean bowled. I had better stop going to her, and preserve my
self-respect–unless there was some way out of this queer situation...And there

was amazed to see me develop a sudden enthusiasm for literature. He was,
however, glad to encourage and nurse my interest. I got from him endless
tit-bits and latest news concerning writers and poets and their books. My stock
with Kanan soared up. I became a frequent and welcome visitor. It wasn’t
possible to keep Dileep out of the picture for long. So I began taking him
along with me occasionally. Kanan’s face beamed with a special delight whenever
Dileep came. “You must come oftener,” she said to him, and there was eagerness
in her voice. But Dileep avoided accompanying me. “I’m sorry, but I’ve some
work to do in the laboratory,” he used to tell me, “You go alone.” Perhaps he

world-war broke out. Men like us were needed, and military service held a lure

hated to think that we would be far away from her-and away in a place where our

thanked God for the short leave we got before leaving India. I went home and
met Kanan. I didn’t wish to precipitate our wedding, but I wanted w know for

“I’m impatient for the day when we three will come together, and talk and laugh

I knew that I was holding out a false hope. There was no sign of the end of the
war. On the contrary the news which we heard soon after my return to the front
indicated that if the war ended soon it would end in a defeat for the Allies.
The Japanese smashed Pearl Harbour on the 7th December in 1942. And Guam, Wake
Island, Hongkong, Manila, Penang, Singapore fell in rapid succession before the
whirlwind onslaught of the Japanese forces. The news of the fall of Rangoon
made me very uneasy. Because I knew that my brother was stationed there. The
British, we learnt, fled from Rangoon, leaving the Indian soldiers to their
fate. These soldiers fought valiantly, but couldn’t succeed in defending
Rangoon. They fell in Japanese hands as prisoners of </span><span

from Kanan, asking me to give news of Dileep. But what could I tell her when I
was myself in total darkness? Months dragged on, and my efforts to get news of
Dileep amounted to nothing. But at last news began to trickle in. We heard that
the Indian soldiers who had fallen in Japanese hands had been recognised as a
free army. That thousands of new recruits from Java, Sumatra, Borneo had joined
the newly-formed Azad Hind Fouj. That Subhas Chandra Bose had gone from Germany
to Tokyo and entered into a pact of friendship with the Japanese Government.
And that at last he had gone to Singapore and officially assumed the leadership
of the Indian Army. Of course we didn’t read these things in the papers. But
rumours have a way of filtering into the barracks and the mess-rooms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

however, I came home on leave in November 1943, Kanan showed me two letters
which she had received from Dileep. He had managed to smuggle them with a
Burmese refugee coming to India. It appeared from these letters that my brother
was now a Brigadier in the Azad Hind Fouj. He had described in these letters
the boundless enthusiasm of his army, and the phenomenal popularity of Subhas
Bose. Hundreds of men came every day, he wrote, to flock under Bose’s banner,
and thousands of rupees were poured at his feet. Addressing a monster meeting
in Malaya Subhas had said, “I want ten crores of rupees from you.” And people
had given him ten crores. The Islands of Andamans and Nicobar had been handed
Over by Japan to Netaji Bose. They were now called Shahid and Surad, and the
flag of Free India waved over them. “...I know how impatient you must be to

to retreat with the same lightning speed which had marked their advance. The
Allies pushed on from place to place. General MacArthur moved with amazing
swiftness. The Japanese fled from Rangoon leaving the Indian Army in the lurch.
Netaji Bose’s Fouj fought bravely. But Rangoon fell. Brigadiar Louder looted
the Azad Hind Bank. He first made a promise that the Indian soldiers would be
free to return to India, but later changed his mind. All the men of the Rani of
Jhansi Regiment became war prisoners in British hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rumoured, went underground. After a few months the Government decided to hold a
trial of the, leading men of the Fouj. My brother’s name wasn’t on the list. We
couldn’t trace his whereabouts. At last Netaji died in a plane crash, and the
curtain came down finally on a stirring drama which had begun years ago with
his daring escape from his home in Calcutta. Soon afterwards India became free,
and the public forgot everything about the brave soldiers of Netaji’s army.</p>

to India? So we hoped that Dileep too was living and hiding somewhere, and that
he must return some day soon. Kanan clung to this hope. We nursed her hope and

turned towards the staircase–but I had the feeling that I wasn’t awake, that I
was doing all these things in my sleep...It was nearly two years since I last
saw Kanan. Even then I had suspected despair in her talk, as though the springs
of hope in her heart had dried up. And even then consumption had overtaken the
loveliness of her body. She had looked at me so pathetically when I had taken
leave. I received a few brief letters from her, but then she stopped writing to
me. She had lost all her enthusiasm, I could see that. And although I wrote
long letters, filling them with cheer and hope, I wasn’t sure she read them.
Her father’s letters had followed a set pattern. “We are doing our best...”
Sometimes he wrote: “The doctors are hopeful. But we have lost all heart. You
had better lose no time in coming...” It was terrible to read this–to look at
the picture of Kanan which it brought before my eyes–Kanan waiting and waiting
for her husband, and clinging to life just to have a last look at him.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It was dusk outside, and the curtains were drawn, and I had to strain my eyes

in the corner away from where I stood. Where is she, I thought. But the next instant
I noticed her dark hair on the white pillow. Her long illness had reduced her
to the size of a small child...I suddenly remembered the first time I had met
her when I had experienced the venturesomeness of young love and sought the

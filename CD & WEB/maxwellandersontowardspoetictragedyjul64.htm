<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Writing
in his well known work, <i>Principles of Criticism, </i>Dr. I. A. Richards
gives expression to the idea that Tragedy avoids the suppressions and subterfuges
by which human beings are tempted to avoid bewildering issues: “Suppressions
and sublimations alike are devices by which we <span class=SpellE>endeavour</span>
to avoid issues which might bewilder us. The essence of Tragedy is that it
forces us to live for a moment without them.” When faced with crucial issues
the human mind is ever wandering in search of what Dr. Richards terms
‘compensatory heaven.’ It follows hence that true tragedy is possible only when
the ‘hero’ faces the test and, in so doing, he achieves a transfiguration, or
he feels a ‘sense of repose’ in the midst of suffering and agony. This is what
Maxwell Anderson meant when he explained that the tragic personality “must
learn through suffering” and “in a tragedy he suffers death itself as a
consequence of his fault or his attempt to correct it, but before he dies he
has <span class=GramE>become</span> a nobler person, because of his recognition
of his fault, and the consequent alteration of his course of action.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
other words, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Anderson</st1:place></st1:City>
sought in Tragedy, a definite type of ‘affirmation’, that man experiences a
spiritual awakening in the midst of his struggle with the forces which beset
him. But Charles I. <span class=SpellE>Glicksberg</span>, writing in his
stimulating book, <i>The Tragic Vision in Twentieth Century </i>feels that
“Maxwell Anderson, fails to show us how this idealistic imperative can be
incorporated within the dialectic of the tragic vision, which portrays the
battle man wages, al he pushes ahead towards the goal of self-transcendence
against nameless, enigmatic powers in a chaotic cosmos that has no concern for
his destiny.” Faith in some ultimate goal or revelation does not animate, most
probably, the tragic hero in his actions. Rather he feels within himself a new
response to the situation undreamt of, the surprising revelation of hidden
resources,–spiritual, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mental and physical. Therefore there
cannot be any search for faith, for the ‘absurd’ in the <span class=SpellE>Kierkegaardian</span>
sense. That is to say, the suffering of the tragic hero is to <span
class=SpellE>fulfil</span> some unknown purpose of God, as in the case of Job.
But we in India are brought up in this sense of the’ absurd’, “that the Eternal
Truth has come into being in time, that God has come into being,<i> </i>has
been born, has grown up, and so forth…..” The tragic hero suitable to the
conditions of the modern world is not born in the Greek sense, the sense that
‘if your name is <span class=SpellE>Antigone</span>, you know what fate awaits
you.’ He is in Hemingway’s direct statement, a person who has had no time to
learn the rules of the game: “You did not know what it was about. You never had
time to learn. They threw you in and told you the rules and the first time they
caught on that. Stay around and they would kill you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Against
this ‘affirmation’ there is the argument put forward by Prof. George Steiner
that in the modern world, there is the ‘death of Tragedy’, the inability to
achieve a tragic vision and the equal inability to get it embodied in an
artistic <span class=GramE>form.</span> “Since Shakespeare and Racine, the
tragic voice in drama is blurred or still”,–this seems to be the conviction of
most critics, let alone Prof. Steiner, those who argued against the attempts to
create a poetic drama for the modern world. Most modern writers of poetic drama
unfortunately took refuge in the world of old myths to discover a satisfactory
vehicle for presenting the pattern of human suffering. But the reality in
Tragedy is that the hero </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cannot fall back on any established
pattern of experience when he is confronted by disaster. Maxwell Anderson
caught this idea and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he has not gone back to any basic myth.
He evolved his own formula of poetic tragedy consisting of three steps–‘victory
in defeat’, ‘recognition of his fault’ by the tragic hero, and ‘affirmation’ of
the moral values underlying existence: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>)
‘Victory’–“The theme of tragedy has always been victory in defeat, a man’s
conquest of himself in the face of annihilation, a spiritual awakening or
regeneration of the hero….”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ii) ‘Recognition’–“In
a tragedy he (the hero) suffers death itself as a consequence of his fault or
his attempt to correct it, but before he dies he has become a nobler person
because of his recognition of his fault and the consequent alteration of his
course of action….”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>iii)
‘Affirmation’–“….The theatre at its best is a religious affirmation, an age-old
rite restating and reassuring man’s belief in his own destiny and his ultimate
hope.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Anderson</st1:place></st1:City>’s
conception of Tragedy, it is a drama offering ‘a kind of religious affirmation
of the ideals of the human race.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Strangely
enough, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Anderson</st1:place></st1:City>’s
approach to Tragedy is nearer to that of Albert <span class=SpellE>Camus</span>
in the sense that he <span class=SpellE>recognises</span> the human being as
the only reality, particularly in his fight to establish better values. Of
course, he did not say categorically as <span class=SpellE>Camus</span> did
that ‘a great modern form of the tragic must and will be born.’ There is this
difference between <span class=SpellE>Camus</span> and Anderson that the former
was more concerned with, in the words of Raymond Williams, ‘the general
condition of a people reducing or destroying itself because it is not conscious
of its true condition’, whereas Anderson, with the discovery, by the
individual, of hidden reserves of moral power. Anderson contributed his own
share to the growth of a poetic tragedy of ‘affirmation’, as against the
tragedy of creeping despair bred by mere adoption of ‘archetypal patterns’ of
suffering from the Greeks and the Hebrews, and that based on the ‘<span
class=SpellE>absurdist</span>’ approach of the Existentialists. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
when he was concerned with historical themes, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Anderson</st1:place></st1:City> kept his ‘<span class=SpellE>affirmist</span>’
view that the human being, faced with disaster, makes the discovery of some
hidden resource, which enables him to triumph, though outwardly annihilated.
From the twenties he was seized with the problems which face the individual,
especially social injustice. Even in the war-play, <i>What Price Glory?, </i>the
Shavian trend in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Anderson</st1:place></st1:City>
is in the forefront, debunking the glory of war. He has not much respect for<i>
</i>those who manage the affairs on earth, whether the politics of peace or
that of war. In <i>Gods of Lightning </i>(1928), <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Anderson</st1:place></st1:City> has given us a representative
character–<span class=SpellE>Suvorin</span> who expresses the cynicism which

reached the most convincing expression for his tragic view in a play which is
not set in historical situations but in the conditions of the thirties in <i>Winterset</i>
(1935). Even for a play of contemporary significance, Anderson preferred verse
as the vehicle, because he held the view that “prose is the language of
information and poetry the language of emotion” and that ‘the best prose in the
world is inferior on the stage to the poetry in the theatre.’ He had arrived at
certain ethical conclusions which he found were contrary to contemporary
practices as, for example, the view that men who are fed by their government
will soon be driven down to the status of slaves or just cattle. Like all other
serious dramatists, he also believed that ‘the theatre is a serious religious
institution devoted entirely to the exaltation of the spirit of man.’ </span><span

his attention to contemporary themes in the great tragedies, <i>Winterset </i>and
<i>Key Largo, </i>the former dealing with the sensational <span class=SpellE>Sacco-Vanzetti</span>
gangster-cum-political trial of the twenties. His view of the play was not that
it should be built round a contemporary problem, the naturalist formula of a
slice of life, but as Prof. J. W. <span class=SpellE>Krutch</span> has
commented, it should “reveal what the ordinary experiences of life leave
hidden, to bring within the charmed circle of poetry and tragedy, aspects of
human existence which had remained mere prose until the poet had treated them.”

modern crusader for Poetic Drama, T. S. Eliot, desired that poetry should be
‘brought into the world in which the audience lives and to which it returns
when it leaves the theatre.’ In a way that has been the aim of Anderson, though
not stated with that clarity which Eliot commands. This is the reason why, at
the same time, he does not feel any dislike of the Shavian purpose of ‘the
exaltation of man’, though he has a pronounced passion for poetic tragedy: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

idea of verse in poetic drama need not be all ‘third voice’–“each prominent
character speaking in an individualized rhythm or manner, the verse adapted to
his personality.” In Anderson’s poetical plays dealing with contemporary
themes–<i>Winterset </i>and <i>Key Largo</i>–the<i> </i>characters speak more
animatedly than their origins indicate. But characters who face unusual
situations in life are to speak in such a manner that their tragic vision is
expressed adequately: “A play is almost always”, Anderson avowed, “an attempt
to recapture a vision for the stage.” Prof. <span class=SpellE>Krutch</span>
has answered those critics who argued from the naturalist standpoint that
characters in a play should speak and behave as they do in real life: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Winterset, the young man Mio has a burden laid on him, because his father <span

been executed, for no crime of his, but only to cover up that of <span
class=SpellE>Trock</span> <span class=SpellE>Estrella</span> and his gang, more
to satisfy the animosity towards a left-wing agitator. So the young lad has
seen the terrible death of his father and the subsequent demise of his mother
and has been leading the life of a road-boy nursing the anger and shame in his
heart. After perusing the records of the trial and the criticism of it offered
by a college professor, Mio decides on the fatal quest for the truth and tracks
down the real criminals. Mio has behind him the faint shadow of the Prince of
Denmark in the motive of his life,–revenge for a father wronged and murdered.
His search brings him to the very nest where hides Garth <span class=SpellE>Esdras</span>
the false witness and the gangster Track <span class=SpellE>Estrella</span>.
But when he comes near to exposing the truth, he is in love with <span

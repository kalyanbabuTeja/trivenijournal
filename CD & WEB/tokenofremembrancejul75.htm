It was not easy to do, as the drawer was stuffed to its limit with old papers

of the diaries with my own notes inside for looking at what I had written
there. As I casually turned the pages, my eyes got <span class=SpellE>rivetted</span>

class=SpellE>Somasundaram</span>–was an advocate with a fairly large practice
in the High Court. He was known as an able lawyer with a powerful voice to
argue his cases before judges. He could be diligent in his preparations in
court and show <span class=GramE>himself</span> much helpful so as to invite
the confidence of the presiding judge in his statements. Both the English and
Indian members of the Bench of those days held him in respect. He too retained
dignity and hardly resorted to seek <span class=SpellE>favours</span> of judges

himself secure</span> against his snarling <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>,
and <span class=SpellE>Somu</span> was alert always to avoid any unseemly
situation in his court. On the other hand, <span class=SpellE>Somu</span> did even
receive uniformly a fair treatment at his hands. Evidently he should have
impressed the judge of his freedom from identification with his clients or of
any obsequious <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> in court. The Bar equally

my devoted attention in tending my three-year old daughter. Whenever he met me

concern, of my domestic life as well as of how I have been spending my leisure
hours. Though I had no desire to take advantage to come closer to him, still
with a restraint in my familiarity with him and at the same time with no visible
sense of avoidance of his frequent efforts at meeting or talking to me on many

slight disturbance of mind. Mrs. Harley it was who spoke to me: “Mr. <span

at our residence after 5 p.m.?” I had no choice except to agree to the request.

She then observed, “Beg your pardon, if the judge does not receive you himself.
<span class=GramE>For it is I that really am in need of your help now.</span>
Perhaps, you are not ware of my taste for fine ornaments; I am fond of the <span

your country women wear on their necks. You have to, oblige me by finding out a

that has attracted Barbara, and she has been pressing me day and night to get
one like it for her. We have information that a Banquet followed by a Ball at
the Government House will be taking place towards the end of next month. She
very much wants to be wearing that necklace when she has to be present at the
forthcoming occasion. I agreed to her request, but added: ‘What is the purpose
of my trying to please you; maybe Mr. <span class=SpellE>Somasundaram</span>
could be of help in the matter; we can just seek him and make enquiry of the
availability of jewel-makers of the place.’ At once she had phoned to you.” Nevertheless,
he himself was not against having such a jewel, for said later: “I too am
fascinated particularly by the <span class=SpellE><i>addigai</i></span><i> </i>among
your country’s artistically fashioned jewelry.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=GramE>hasten</span> to assure me: “Please don’t worry about the money.
Charlie has given me more than what you have mentioned as the figure and has permitted
any expense in that behalf. Only one little further condition is to be noted as
important. Whoever is the maker, he should see to the delivery of the jewel
before the middle of next month, as the invitation for the Ball has notified

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>his work </span>showed progress, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>slowly </span>I <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>relaxed in my </span>anxiety for <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>its
completion in time. </span>My work <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in co</span>urts
was <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>also </span>somewhat heavy and
hardly allowed me leisure for other interests. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Just </span>at a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>week’s time </span>before
the Government House function, phone calls began to be received from the judge’s
house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
was sure of the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>completion </span>of
the <span class=SpellE><i>addigai</i></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'> </span>and, imagining <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>it
would </span>be getting <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>polished </span>about
the time, I tried to peep <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in the <span
class=SpellE>Aasari’s</span> workshop on my </span>way back from the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>High </span>Court. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Finding </span>the workshop <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>closed
</span>and <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>locked o</span>utside, I was
a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>bit </span>startled. On enquiry at
the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>neighbouring</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>shops, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>it </span>was revealed to me that the <span class=SpellE>Aasari</span>
had <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>high </span>temperature running
for the past two or three days and that the work <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>in </span>the factory had stopped for want of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>his </span>personal supervision. At once I drove to the <span
class=SpellE>Aasari’s</span> house and found <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>him </span>down <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with high </span>fever
<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>with little </span>signs of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>its </span>abatement <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>in </span>a day or two. It was evident to me that he <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>could </span>not <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>complete </span>the jewel within the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Harley, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>the meantime, had
sent messengers to fetch me. I went to her to suggest a way out of the

</span>an incarnation of despair <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in </span>her
seat. On seeing me, she pathetically burst <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>First,
Mrs. Harley <span class=GramE>wavered</span> a bit to agree to the suggestion, as
if she would have to consult her husband in accepting it. But gradually she
looked prevailed upon by my words. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On
the morning of the banquet, I drove to the judge’s house with the diamond
necklace in my hand. Mr. Harley was standing in the front verandah and appeared
to be making ready for going out. I felt that I could hand the velvet case to Mrs.
Harley after the judge had left his residence. But strangely enough, his penetrating
eye detected the thing in my hand and he asked “May I have an idea what is the
thing which you so carefully screen from my sight? Ah, I see; ...has the
necklace been made ready? Let me have a look at it before my wife wears it for
the occasion; let me just feel it with my hand.” He extended his hand also to receive
it from me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

could not further remain quiet without handing it to him. He seemed slightly
intrigued on seeing the velvet case looking old and so taking out the <span

could not restrain his surprise, saying: “What is this! It is not polished
even. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Somasundaram</span>, I need enlightenment a bit.
Please tell me, why both the jewel and the case are alike lacking freshness.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mrs.
<span class=GramE>Harley</span> who had by now been trying to interpose, said breathlessly,
“My dear, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Somasundaram</span> is a very resourceful gentleman.
He has kept his word to us by bringing me his surprise, wife’s <span
class=SpellE><i>addigai</i></span><i>, </i>as the <span class=SpellE>Aasari</span>
has been laid up with fever and not able to finish the work. If I have agreed
to this arrangement, it is because you would yourself not be much happy to have
me with you with a bare neck, at the grand reception in the Government House.”
But before she could finish her sentence, seeing the change of <span
class=SpellE>colour</span> on Mr. Harley’s face, she was a bit taken aback. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

followed her by adding: “True, it would be rank betrayal of confidence if a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I
noticed the sudden change on Mr. Harley’s countenance. He assumed <span
class=GramE>a seriousness</span> combined with a sternness of look which to
those appearing before him in court was a familiar sight on occasions when he
was determined to decide against the person arguing. I felt much disturbed at
this unwelcome change in him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He
did not wait much to address his wife thus: “Why did you not hesitate to give
your consent to this arrangement, darling? Should you like to wear a thing worn
by his dear wife<span class=GramE>?...</span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Somasundaram</span>,
I know, must be cherishing greatly her memory after her passing away. Is it not
to keep her ever in his heart that he has not thought of marrying again anyone!
Could he really reconcile himself to any other woman adorning the same jewel
which his dear wife had been wearing? Just think of it. May be he will not feel
it so disagreeable if his own daughter wears this when she is grown up. Not
only you happen to be another’s wife, but are a foreigner too. It is a very
objectionable thing for you to have it on your neck. Much rather stop away from
attending the banquet at the Government House than appear there with this jewel
on you.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Decision
was pronounced in his voice. Mrs. Harley did not utter a word afterwards. I
returned home with the necklace. Yes, I became deeply remorseful within, that
having kept my wife’s memory so much unpolluted all these years by never
thinking of any other woman, I should have so callously thought of parting with
a thing so much belonging to her. What an utter folly to which my mind gave
way! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

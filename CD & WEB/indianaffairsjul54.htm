is not the place where decisions are taken, and that too not certainly as a
result of any discussion in this august–and also, out-worn–body. Here in India,
we have deliberately adopted the<i> </i>‘parliamentary system based on the
English model’, and here also we have to expect a change into ‘parliamentary
bureaucracy’, unless we <span class=SpellE>realise</span> the danger and take
steps to stop the rot, because for one thing we do not want to make our costly
institution of a Parliament to become a stale ornament. But there are many
competitors to it and they are becoming more and more powerful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a time when real discussion–real in the sense that it could effectively
sway the minds of the members and hence their votes–took place there; but today
in a party-controlled House, none of those acrobatics are possible. So also
there was a day when important announcements regarding policy and decisions were
first made in the House, but today, public meetings and Press conferences and
the radio have appropriated that privilege; in fact, Ministers are more frank
outside the House, and these pronouncements are made outside, <i>even </i>when
the House is in session! So also answers to the questions. More are answered
outside than inside, where there is no Speaker to stop the questioner or the<i>
</i>Minister under the strict rules of the House. Then there are other
agencies. For instance there is the Planning Commission whose constitutional
position is still an enigma to me–though I have nothing but praise for the work
it is doing. But here I am concerned with the other Commissions; we can </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>find
at least half a dozen of them functioning at any time of the year. Just now the<i>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Committee
and the Jute Committee have concluded their <span class=SpellE>labours</span>,
besides those that are now in active existence on an All-India level–the
Taxation Enquiry Commission, the Slates <span class=SpellE>Reorganisation</span>
Commission, the Railway corruption Enquiry Commission, the Backward Classes
Enquiry Commission and so on. And then there are the Conferences: those of
Ministers, of the Speakers, their Secretaries, and so on, at various levels and
for various purposes. And all these in addition to the various conferences and
Committee meetings, like that of the All-India Women’s Conference, or that of
the Federation of the Indian Chambers, which have a profound influence on the
Government of the day. There are also the political conferences, especially the
AICC and the Working Committee of the Congress ranking as a class by
themselves, in view of their close connection with the Government of the day.
All<i> </i>these enable discussion to take place at all levels and on all
matters, but their influence on the status and function of the legislature is
very profound; and we cannot ignore it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
find facts for themselves, in the constituencies, what is the role of the
Members of Parliament, not to speak of the reports of the officers themselves?
Why should we elect our representatives? Can the Minister find for himself any
hidden facts in his hurricane tour which the local representative cannot and
would not? And it would be very embarrassing to the concerned legislators if
the facts discovered by the Minister are at variance with his own facts, and
especially if the two belong to two different parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

intricacies of their job. There seems to be somewhere a notion that a Minister
ought to know the technical aspect of the problem as well as the public opinion
on it. Thus it is that a Health Minister should know how the malaria germ
spreads or polio should be controlled. I have still copies of the statements of
the Health and Agriculture Ministers at the Centre on polio and rice
cultivation according to the Japanese method, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

control, ministerial functions and the actual business of the experts of the
departments, so that there will be no fall in the efficiency of administration
due to overlapping; especially the time and energy of the Minister should not
be wasted in personal fact-finding and propaganda. Fact-finding should be left
to the legislators and officers, propaganda should be left to the party machine

the Commissions that are at work, let us take at random the work of the Taxation
Enquiry Commission and <span class=SpellE>analyse</span> the position. It is
asked to investigate into a number of points connected with our public finance,
whose investigation has been a badly felt need for a long time. But the
question <span class=GramE>is,</span> what is their status and what is their
function? Are they a body of experts who will do some research by eliciting
some facts and public opinion and make a report? The membership of that
Committee–its quality is <span class=GramE>of a very high order–warrants</span>
such an inference. But their function is such that it requires an assessment of
public opinion, because, as public finance has a <span class=SpellE>socia</span>-economic
purpose today, what order of society we should have in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is not a
matter for experts to <span class=GramE>advise</span>, but for the public to
decide through the ballot-paper. Or take the <span class=SpellE>Shroff</span>
Committee Report on the finances of the private sector. It is an excellent
Report by a team of experts compiled within a short space of eight months. It
was appointed by the Reserve Bank of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> which is slowly becoming
another fact-finding body on a large scale. This committee has made a number of
observations and recommendations which are worth the consideration of the
authorities concerned. But there is one point in the Report which is directly
at variance with the point of view of the Planning Commission. The <span
class=SpellE>Shroff</span> Committee is unable to substantiate the view of the
Planning Commission that finance was by no means a major limiting factor to
private industrial investment so far which of these views are we to believe?
There is another conclusion of the Report that deserves the attention of all,
that “while some progress has been registered in regard to investment in new
capital it has not been commensurate with the expectations; and, in order to
reach the planned targets, annual investment in new capital will have to be
raised to about double that in the period 1951-53.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>CONTROL OF THE FINANCES</h1>

the private sector has complained of lack of capital formation, and the
Government have responded with the format</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ion of two other
finance corporations to help the private sector, the story with the
Government’s departments is the other way; it is money remaining unspent. While
we need not exaggerate the implications of only about 52 <span class=SpellE>crores</span>
remaining unspent, we cannot ignore the causes that have led to this; and this
is what has caused another storm in the tea-cup at the Centre, of the Finance
Minister offering his resignation. We have had three Finance Ministers since <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Independence</st1:place></st1:City>; two of them
resigned and went out of office, and the third has offered his resignation
twice so far. While the towering personality of the Prime Minister has avoided
on all the occasions the storm spreading beyond the tea-cup, we must ask
ourselves if this matter cannot be <span class=SpellE>regularised</span> for
all time to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Long ago <span class=SpellE>Kautilya</span> observed
that ‘all undertakings depend upon <span class=GramE>finance’,</span> and this
is always remembered by <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>–that
nation of shop-keepers whose religion consists of Sunday church and five per
cent dividends, as <span class=SpellE>Gunther</span> put it. The British spread
this idea to their colonies and dependencies where they invested large sums of
money; and hence they gave ‘credit and financial stability’ equal importance
with ‘law and order’–people in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are familiar with the ‘special responsibilities’ of the Governor-General. But it
was true only in the days when the State was on the gold standard and it had,
therefore, no control over the amount of money in circulation, with a constant
threat of withdrawal of short-term deposits from the Central Bank which <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
experienced in 1930-31 for the last time. Under such circumstances, therefore,
the Finance Minister had a strong responsibility to keep the ship of the
country’s finances on an even keel, and this required a close liaison with the
country’s Central Bank and a close watch on the spending of the other
departments of the State; thus the policies and programmes of the other
ministries depended on the money made available by the finance department. But
circumstances have changed now in the second half of the 20th century. With a
free hand to regulate the issue of the currency, independent of the gold
reserves and their flow, and with the Central Bank <span class=SpellE>nationalised</span>,
finance becomes a handmaid of policy, instead of its mistress; and this is <span
class=SpellE>realised</span> more by the Finance Minister himself than by
anybody else with his strong and bold policy of deficit-financing. Therefore
one might feel that greater freedom might be given to the spending
departments–they are, after all, what make the ‘welfare state’–than is in vogue
till now. But strangely enough the feeling in the Finance Department is just in
the opposite direction. A country running a planned economy on controlled money
requires a far greater control <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>and
guidance from the finance department than in a <i>laissez-faire </i>state. And
this necessity has become all the greater because the Finance Minister is an
important member of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission plans, the
Reserve Bank creates the necessary atmosphere, and the Finance Department
supplies the life-blood of money. The Finance Minister has a grip on all the
three departments, and it is no wonder that the other departments feel that
they have become mere administrative departments, acting according to the
dictates of the Finance Department. The Constitution envisages the leadership
of the Prime Minister, but not that of the Finance Minister. One way out of the
difficulty is for the Prime Minister to assume the portfolio of Finance
himself, or at least create <span class=GramE>a make</span>-believe as in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> where
the Prime Minister is the First lord of the Treasury. But even then the problem
will be only partly solved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The real point to be grasped all is that the
country’s economy is one and indivisible, and there must be one policy to be
decided by the Cabinet as a whole, while the details will be worked out by the
various ministries to aid which the Finance Ministry has to function. That is
the meaning of collective responsibility in a welfare state, that all will act
in <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> of a single economic policy, but not
the barren legal injunction that all the Ministers stand or fall together. The
major question to ask ourselves now is: Is there a unified economic policy
followed by the Cabinet as a whole, and does the Cabinet make it? Are all our
efforts and the activities of the departments and men directed towards the
single purpose set out by the Plan, whatever that <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>might be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>All this should not drive the reader to conclude
that ours is a house divided against <span class=GramE>itself, that</span> we
are all pulling in opposite directions and heading towards something akin to
disaster. Far from it; we are right on the correct way of recovery. We have
definitely turned the corner and are almost out of the wood. Our industrial
production has increased by a third, taking 1946 as the base. Our agricultural
production has not lagged behind: the index of production stands today at 119,
taking 1936–39 as the base. Everything promises to be all right this year, and
every State reports a good crop and even surplus; and the Central Ministry of
Food and Agriculture, it seems, is now worried about the fall in the price of
wheat. With our industrial achievements in <span class=SpellE>Chittaranjan</span>

full meaning of the oft-made remark that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> is an agricultural country
has been revealed to us, and it should give a lesson to the Planning
Commission. With an increase of agricultural production, it means that the
people of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have an increased purchasing power to the extent of 20% of what it was in
1947-48 (when also the index stood at about 100). And what a change it produces
in our economy! The first effect is on our foreign trade and the balance of
payments. A <span class=SpellE>favourable</span> balance of trade with reduced
imports of <span class=SpellE>foodgrains</span>, and a <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
balance of payments especially with the Dollar area which even the professional
optimists have not been expecting, and an increase in our sterling
resources–this is the picture of our foreign trade. Inside the country, it has
slightly upset the worst fears of the <span class=SpellE>Cassandras</span> that
food production in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could never cope with the rise in population. It amounts to a rise of about 10
per cent, an article in “The Eastern Economist” tells us, and this is without
taking account of the major irrigation projects yet to come. And so, the
article concludes, “it seems unlikely that over a period of the next ten years
Indian food production will not rise at a rate of 1.25 per Cent per year which
is the average rate of population growth.” This is something new to think
about, especially for those who are unduly alarmed about <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s
population problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that is not the question now. How are we going to meet the demand for more
consumer goods that this growth in the purchasing power of rural <st1:country-region

One way is to import more, and that is what the Government <span class=GramE>seem</span>
to think about. The other way is to keep the imports constant and allow the
local manufactures to expand. And there are several Indian factories, as in the
Cycle industry, where maximum producing capacity is yet to be reached; and that
is the view-point of the manu</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, called ‘Imports
and Industrial Development’, it has been pointed out how it is possible that
about 60 per cent or <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 650 <span class=SpellE>crores</span>
worth of goods can be produced in India; and the Report pleads for an
investigation into the causes for the gap between installed capacity and actual
production. Will import control help it? But here is the view-point of the
consumer. With our experience with sugar, the importer does not want to pin his
faith in the industrialist at home, though ‘<span class=SpellE>Swadeshi</span>’
might move him, and he might even approve of an act similar to the Buy American
Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is another way to mop up this surplus purchasing power. We can induce the rural
population and lower middle class as well as the urban worker to save for the
Nation; and the appeal made by the Nation’s hero has had its effect and more
than 150 <span class=SpellE>crores</span> have been subscribed. If this money
is really coming from the ‘small man’ or ‘the common man’, it means there is
scope neither for more imports of consumer goods <span class=GramE>nor</span>
internal industrial expansion. And here is the question that has to be
answered: whether such a saving at the expense of further consumption and
higher standard of life is desirable for a nation where consumption levels are
low and demand is starving. Of course, there is a school in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> which
says that there cannot be planning without tears, and to them starving the
consumer for a few days is both desirable and inevitable. But there is another
way of looking at it. If we allow the rural demand to increase, it will give a
fillip to internal industrial expansion and thus will result a cumulative
effect on industrial cum agricultural expansion of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

is the lesson I want to draw; increase the purchasing power of the masses, and
everything will be all right provided we prevent undue imports of consumer
goods and undue rise in the price of internally produced goods. In other words,
improve agriculture and village industries, and allow industry to expand itself;
and we come back to our old story. There is a section in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> that
thinks that the problem of agriculture is one of tenure only, and they talk of
abolition of middlemen as well as putting a ceiling on land-holdings. They
forget that agriculture is also an industry and that it requires good
management and capital investment and that, in the present circumstances, the
village peasant, whom they want to make a sovereign, has </span><span

the equipment nor the money nor the business ability to tackle this aspect of

middle-class leadership and money could be wedded to the actual sense of
ownership by the cultivator? None of the schemes so far suggested take this
aspect of the problem of putting agriculture on the footing of an industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one of my suggestions to the Planning Commission, I put forward a plea for

The experience of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shows that such land will be deserted rather than cultivated<sup>1</sup>; and

suggestion was from the realistic view-point. The middle-class owner has
invested money in purchasing land, and what he wants is a fair return for it;
and what the cultivator wants is that he should be given some permanent
interest in the land he cultivates. The remedy now is to combine them and start
a Joint-Stock Agricultural Company which will comprise (compulsorily) two or
three villages, all coming <span class=GramE>under</span> one irrigation
project. The capital of this company is comprised of shares owned by the
middle-class owners whose present interest is converted in terms of such
shares. The cultivators will now be settled permanently on the land ‘during
good <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>’ with the right of the sons to inherit
the same rights. The company can borrow money, and it can start other
industries, and so on. The middle-class owner is not deprived of his ownership
and he still gets a share; agriculture becomes a business managed by the local
Board of Directors consisting of actual agriculturists and middle-class leadership;
actual and existing cultivators are not disturbed from their holdings and they
get a sense of ownership therein without paying anything; the State need not
find money to pay compensation, as ownership is converted into shares; and,
above all, the Government can abolish their land records and land revenue
departments, because the company now owns the land and pays agricultural
income-tax to the Government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

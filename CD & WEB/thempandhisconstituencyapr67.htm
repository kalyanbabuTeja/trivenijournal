literal sense democracy means government by the people. But now it has undergone
a change of scale. “Its dimensions are enlarged, its horizons expanded.
Departing from the polis it embraced the nation. It exchanged Lilliput for
Leviathan.”<sup>1</sup> Under the changed circumstances democracy which was
confined to the microcosm has to be made applicable to the macrocosm. “The
solution to this problem was to bring to the capital those who were prominent
in their localities on the assumption that they spoke for the remainder of the
population and in the hope that they could commit the folks back home to
decisions taken at the centre. In an indirect democracy the legislature is
supposed to represent </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

qua non </i>of democracy. As it is humorously remarked: “M. Ps must keep in
mind the fact of the dissolution of parliament just as members of certain
monastic orders keep their coffin by their side to remember that one day they
must die.”<sup>2</sup> In all modern democracies the importance of the
legislature is accepted. But the role of the elected representative has not
been uniform, for there is no rigid pattern to which he has to conform himself.

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>parliamentary
and some others are non-parliamentary; some are unitary and others are federal.
These variations are reflected in the relations that exist between a M. P. and
his constituency. In a federal state the freedom of expression of members in
the second chamber is restricted in the sense that they are expected to voice
the opinion of the States which they represent. Herein lies the theoretical
justification of giving equal representation in the Senate in the U. S. A. to
all the States, irrespective of their size and economic progress. The principle
that the primary duty of members of the second chamber is to represent their
respective constituencies explains Article 249 in the Indian Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

every modern state the impact of political parties on the working of democratic
machinery has become most significant. The relations between the M. P. and his
constituency are determined today not so much by the system of government as by
the party system. In countries like the U. S. A. where party cohesion is low, a
member of the legislature cares more for his constituency than for his party.
In Britain which has highly cohesive parties, the M. P’s legislative behaviour
is on party lines. In India the existence of a centralised party system has
left little freedom for the M. P. to use his discretion. But in recent years
the growth of regionalism and groupism in the Congress party is making the M.
P. consider himself more as a constituency-man than as a party-man. Today the
Indian M. P. in his relations with his constituency can be said to stand midway
between the M. P. of Britain and the Congressman of the U. S. A. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Empirical
studies in the U. S. A. have shown a linkage between mass political opinions and
governmental policy-making. This linkage can be illustrated from the
Congressional roll call votes on Civil Rights legislation.<sup>3</sup>
Considerable policy agreement is found between Congressional roll call votes
and the attitudes of the individual Congressman’s constituency. The studies
made on the above subject have led to the following conclusions: (1)
Constituencies elect representatives whose views may be independent of those of
the constituency. (2) But Congressmen vote in accordance with the attitudes of
the constituency (as they perceive them) with a mind to the next election. (3)
Both the Congressman’s perceptions and his attitudes have direct effects on his
roll call votes, though the former is more powerful than the latter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
delegate theory of representation is adopted by several of the Communist states
in Europe. In U. S. S. R., Albania, Czechoslovakia, Rumania and Yugoslavia,
“the member is bound to carry out the mandate given him by the electorate.”<sup>4</sup>
According to law, members have “to give a regular account to their constituents
of how they have fulfilled their mandate.”<sup>5</sup> In Switzerland also the
legislative behaviour of a member of the Federal Assembly is determined by the
constituency attitudes. According to Article 19 of the Swiss Constitution the
members of the legislature shall vote without instructions from their political
parties. That is, the members vote in the legislature not by party mandate but
according to the constituency opinion. In fact, nothing in the Swiss political
system is more instructive to the student of modern democracy than the kind of
direct democracy that functions in that country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
Western democracies, of which Britain is a typical example, there is evidence
of their (parliaments of those states) intention in the fact that the
imperative mandate has no validity and that there is no machinery by which a
member can be unseated by his constituents or the party which put him up for
election.”<sup>6</sup> Proliferation of governmental activity in a modern state
calls for greater administrative discretion and so the M. P. has to carry out
not the mandate of his constituency but the advice given by the experts. As the
Royal Commission of 1932 in Britain observed, “the function of the
representative chamber should be to utilise our technical knowledge for the
general welfare and harmonize particular interests through some notion of the
common good.”<sup>7</sup> In Britain the M. P. considers himself as
representative of the nation as a whole and not an agent of his constituency.
“The British representative is not expected to trim his legislative votes to
the wishes of local interests…He can afford much more readily than his American
counterpart to support his party even if it means overriding the particular
desires of his constituents. The British custom is such that he need hardly
fear strictly local reprisals against his subsequent candidacy.”<sup>8</sup>
The British tradition about the role of the M. P. is partly due to the
country’s party system.” The member is the obedient servant of the party
machine.”<sup> 9</sup> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The British view
of the M. P.’s relation with his constituency is well expressed by H. J. Laski:
“He is elected to do the best he can in the light of his intelligence and his
conscience. Were he mainly a delegate instructed by a local caucus, he would
cease to have either morals or personality.”<sup> 10</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

American and the British systems seem to represent two divergent principles
regarding the relations between the M. P. and his constituency. This does not
mean, however, that in Britain there is no link between the elected member and
his constituents. Nor does the party mandate completely prevent him from
voicing the views of his constituency. The debates and the question periods
afford opportunities for the M. Ps to express their own opinions and to air the
grievances of their constituents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
India the M. P. in his relations with his constituency behaves with a dubious
personality. The illiteracy and ignorance of the electorate leave the M. P.
free to play contradictory roles. Sometimes he behaves like his British
counterpart and at other times like the American Congressman. The parliamentary
system of government and the existence of disciplined parties necessitate the
M. P. to voice the party opinion and not the constituency opinion. However, he
keeps close contact with his constituency. A unique feature in the life of some
Indian M. Ps is that they spend much of their time in their constituencies and
no day passes without the constituents meeting them for some favour or other.<i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
federal system and regionalism which is inherent in Indian life, are developing
a tendency towards establishing a correspondent between the parliamentary
behaviour of a M.P. and the attitude of his constituency. During the last
fifteen years there were several significant instances to illustrate this fact.
The reslgoation of Mr. C. D. Deshmukh from the cabinet was due to the stand
taken by the members of his own constituency over the inclusion of Bombay in
the proposed Maharashtra State. The resignations tendered by Mr. C. Subrahmanyam
and Mr. O. V. Alagesan of their posts as ministers were only in response to the
opinion of their constituents on the language issue. The questions raised in
parliament by M. Ps of the Southern States on the location of the fifth steel
plant reveal the impact of the constituents on the M. Ps. While a number of
Andhra M. Ps both of the Congress and opposition parties demanded a categorical
statement from the Prime Minister on the location of the steel plant at
Visakhapatnam, some Andhra M. Ps of the Communist party resigned their seats in
the Lok Sabha. Mr. Rajaram and Mr. Kandappan, D. M. K. members from Madras,
asked whether any decision had been taken about the Salem plant. Mr. Basappa
(Congress) of Mysore raised the question of a plant at Hospet, while Mr.
Joachim Alwa (Congress) expressed his anxiety about Goa being neglected. A
member from Madhya Pradesh shouted, “what about Bailadilla?”<sup> 11</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
instances cited above are in fact problems agitating the entire country and not
a few constituencies. A close study of parliamentary debates and discussions
indicates that the linkage between constituency attitude and M. P’s
parliamentary behaviour is very slight. Even on the problem of the steel plant
at Visakhapatnam a prominent M. P. from Andhra Pradesh is said to have
remarked: “We always look at every problem from our viewpoint. The centre has
responsibility for all the States. There are equal claims from Hospet, Salem
and Bailadilla.”<sup> 12</sup> The absence of close linkage between the M. P.
and his constituents is due to the ignorance of the latter. The constituents
are too ignorant to guide their representatives and they hardly know what to
ask and what they ought not to ask the elected representative to do. It is not
uncommon for constituents to approach the M. Ps for help and assistance on
matters like good roads, takkavi loans, schools, bridges and licences for
starting sugar and rice mills. Such demands made on the M. P. are indicative of
the ignorance of the people of the distinction between federal and State
subjects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
fascinating feature in the relationship that exists between a M. P. in India
and his constituency is the wide variance in the attitudes of the two. A sample
survey conducted in India in 1962 on about a thousand people and one hundred M.
Ps to find out their <i>priorities </i>in legislation, showed little
coincidence in the attitudes of the constituents and their elected
representatives. The ladder survey, as it is called, indicated that while the
common people gave top priority to subjects of their daily life and to public
utility services, the M. Ps gave top priority to national and international
affairs. For example, a M. P. like Mr. Nath Pai is found particularly
interested in discussions on foreign policy, while his constituents are least
concerned with it. This kind of discontinuity in the attitudes of the elected
representatives and the common people is due to lack of national awareness
among the people. However, the national upsurge that could be noticed on an
occasion like the Chinese aggression over India in 1962 and Pakistani attack in
1965 show that people are not unaware of national problems. Even some poor men
in the Southern States like Andhra Pradesh and Mysore which are far away from
the area of fighting, contributed to the Defence Fund. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Empirical
studies on the linkage between the M. P. and his constituency have shown the
gap that exists between the two, a gap between modernism and traditionalism.
The debates on the floor of the House and in parliamentary committees are
conducted in the modern idiom which is at variance from the traditional
language of the common people. While the M. P. uses the modern idiom in
discussions over public health and medicine, the common man uses traditional
language. While the constituents speak of Ayurvedic treatment and nature cure,
the M. Ps use the Western idiom and speak of X-Ray plants and Radium treatment.
Similarly while the latter speak of power projects, the former speak in the
traditional style of the village well and the tank. No doubt the M. L. As
present a different picture, for “the members of, the State Legislative
Assemblies are drawn from layers much closer to those of traditional politics.
No one can visit the lobbies of a State Assembly without realising quite
vividly that the Member of a (State) Assembly (M. L. A.) is in touch with his
constituents. The M. L. A. is one of the great gap-closers in Indian politics.”<sup>
13</sup> This cannot be said of the M. Ps in India though a few of the leaders
at the national level like Mr. Chavan, Mr. Kamaraj and Mr. N. G. Ranga operate
in both the languages, modern and traditional. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
M. P. in his relations with his constituency plays a useful role in serving as
an intermediary between his constituents and the departments in the capital. A
person may feel that a rule was applied harshly in his case, that he has rights
which were overlooked and that he is being pushed around by bureaucrats. The M.
P. does not hesitate to take up all such matters. In fact in all countries the
M. Ps. act as intermediaries between the Government and the people. But the M.
Ps. in India go a step further and act as intermediaries between the Government
or even non-governmental departments and the people in matters which are really
not their concern. They play multiple roles in their dealings with their
constituents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

diversity of peoples in India and the backwardness of the people do not permit
the presentation of a uniform picture of the relations between the M. Ps. and
their constituents. A sample survey conducted in the Lok Sabha revealed the
diversity in the relations between the M. Ps. and their constituencies.<sup>14</sup>
Out of the 178 respondents 82 were found to have linkage with their
constituents who may be called ‘interacting M. Ps.’ Of the 82 M. Ps. 37 were
active both in the Parliament and in their constituencies while 45 were active
in their constituencies only. The rest of the 96 M. Ps. were found to have very
little linkage with their constituents and may be called ‘non-interacting M.
Ps.’ Of them 26 were found active in Parliament but not in their constituencies
and may be described as Delhi M.Ps. The remaining 70 are undistinguished and do
little work either in the Lok Sabha or in their constituencies. This data can
be presented in a tabular form as given below. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

non-interacting M. Ps. come from two types of classes, (1) those who have a
traditional hold over their constituencies like the Maharajah’s of the old
Native States and Zamindars and those leaders who earned a name by their role
in the freedom struggle. Sentiment and tradition are so deep-rooted among the
common people that they support members of the old ruling classes and the
leaders of the freedom struggle with blind veneration. The 26 Delhi M. Ps.
maintain very little linkage with their constituents; they spend much of their
time in the capital itself and rarely visit their constituencies or take up the
cause of their constituents. Moreover, they are typical of the cleavage that
exists between modernism and traditionalism. The 26 Delhi M. Ps. are
westernised and they hardly understand the language of their constituents. (2)
The second class of non-interacting M. Ps. consists of those who are not highly
educated. They also constitute the non-influential section of the M. Ps. Such
non-interacting and non-influential M. Ps. largely occupy the Reserved Seats.
Among the Link-members also can be noticed two categories, men of talk and men
of action. The former are active only through talking and participation in
parliamentary debates and the latter actively work through their party
organization and also through non-party organisations like trade unions and
school boards. It is further revealing to note that a larger number of members
of the opposition parties than of the Congress party serve as Linkmen. Out of
the 37 Link-members in the above sample 15 belong to the Congress party and 22
belong to the opposition parties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
federal Constitution of India puts the M. P. at a disadvantage in maintaining
close contacts with his constituency. This is partly due to the distance to
which he is taken away from his constituency and largely due to the type of
problems with which he deals, problems which do not touch the day to day life
of people. There is a feeling among the M. Ps. that their election to
parliament loosens their hold over the people. So the M. Ps. maintain their
linkage with their constituents through different channels of communication.
Unlike the USA where television and radio are the chief channels of
communication, in India such mass media are not accessible for several of the
M. Ps. The M. P. in India depends largely on personal contacts and on
correspondence through letters. Both during his stay in the capital and more so
during his stay in his constituency the M. P. is kept busy by visitors. His
weekly mail also is fairly heavy. Some M. Ps. utilize non-political
organizations like trade unions, P. T. Association, Rice Millers’ Associations
and Bankers’ Associations as channels of communication. With the widening
sphere of public enterprise, the contacts between the M. P. and his
constituency are growing in significance. Besides private citizens, State
Governments also do a lot of lobbying to getting licences and financial aid for
industries and other projects. The purposes for which the constituents utilise
the M. Ps. reveal the secular nature of Indian democracy. Empirical studies have
pointed out that till now, with the exception of the Sikh community, no other
community used the M. P. as a channel of communication between the Government
and the people on matters of religion. However, the recent agitation for
anti-cow slaughter legislation indicates that as parties like the Jan Sangh
gain strength, the M. Ps. will have to play new roles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

above study lends the following generalisations over the linkage between the M.
P. and his constituency in India. (1) The prevalence of both traditionalism and
modernism in Indian politics is revealed in the relations between the M. P. and
his constituents. M. Ps. who come from tradition bound constituencies establish
little </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>linkage while those elected by politically
advanced constituents keep touch with their constituencies. (2) Unlike the M.
Ps. in </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Western democracies some of the M. Ps. in India
play multiple roles and even do certain functions which are not legitimately
theirs. Nurturing one’s own constituency is a feature noticeable in the case of
certain M. Ps. (3) The steady disintegration of the Congress party, the growth
of groupism in all parties and the advance of regionalism are all making the M.
P. care more and more for his constituency. (4) In the USA on the question of
racism, the representatives of all the Southern States remain united and this
becomes explicit by the phrase, the ‘Solid South.’ In a similar way, on an
issue agitating any one state in the Indian Union, M. Ps. of that state,
irrespective of the party to which they belong, voice the will of their
constituents. However, the electorate in India is too ignorant and backward to
make the M. P. act according to its will. So normally the constituency opinion
has little bearing on the parliamentary behaviour of a large majority of the M.
Ps. But several of the M. Ps. are not indifferent to their constituents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dinner was served rather late. We had not the
faintest idea that the time had rolled on towards midnight. We were in the

to the altitude of high philosophy and landed us in trouble. </p>

had a hearty dinner, and a hearty Indian meal meant an extra heavy load. The

and it was six miles away. No </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

hour. Still I hoped against hope and managed to come to the famous crossing
where stray taxi </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cabs waited for notorious night <span
class=GramE>roamers</span>. I had come to a desperate mood which made me shout
at the top of my voice–I meant to be heard. The echo of my own voice in the
ghostly silence was all the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>response I got. I did not know what to do
next. At this moment I </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>heard the bell of a rickshaw ringing at a
distance. I <span class=GramE>Waited</span> impatiently to see what was in my
luck. It was good. The rickshaw was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>empty. Apparently, my
loud voice must have caught the ears of the puller. It was a lonely vehicle
approaching towards me with an unusual speed hardly justifiable in the absence
of competition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
faint hope that gave the <span class=GramE>relief,</span> disappeared no sooner
than it came. The man who was pulling the rickshaw was a tiny little creature,
hardly half my size: I was reluctant to take the rickshaw of violating the law
of gravitation. But he was a shrewd businessman, he knew how to persuade. I was
overwhelmed by his art. Confidence being restored, I settled down on my perch.
I was seated on the soft cushioned seat provided for respectable persons. It
afforded all the comforts that could be had of a worn-out rol</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ling
perambulator. Everything being properly adjusted, I lighted a new cigar. I
needed it very badly after the strain I was </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>subjected to.
Strangely enough, the rickshaw-puller did not attempt to bargain for a double
fare, which was most moderate at this hour. Probably it was a wrong calculation
due to an over-dose of toddy, or might be, his heart melted at seeing my pitiable
condition. However, I was rescued from being stranded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
started on our journey. It was not long after the wheels began to roll that the
rickshaw puller began to curse the level of the tarred road at regular
intervals. A little attention revealed that the cursing he indulged in was an
elementary expression of the source of energy which kept him going. It had
little to do with the road. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
pleasant breeze and the sound of the bell in that peculiar environment had a
lulling effect on me. I was engulfed in drowsiness, and while I was in this
stage, we arrived at the foot of a bridge. We had covered a pretty good
distance. I then felt the rickshaw was not moving. I<i> </i>sat up and
discovered that I was not dreaming either. The rickshaw-puller was leaning against
the parallel rods of his vehicle. Chanting of his <span class=SpellE>favourite</span>
hymns had stopped. I was under the impression that he was going to have a good
pull on my thrown away cigar. Nothing doing He was just leaning. An enquiry was
found necessary. When questioned he answered in a feeble voice that we were
very near our destination. I looked round and found that he was not true.
Taking rest by dodging the truth was most annoying at this late hour. I
registered my strong displeasure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
strong man’s displeasure had the desired effect on the weak. He was frightened
and was ready to start again. He gave several <span class=GramE>jerks,</span>
the perambulator rolled a little and then stopped again. His movements made me
suspicious. I noticed his steps were <span class=GramE>melt</span> steady. It
did not indicate that he was tight. On the contrary he was more sober than I
was. The condition I had been placed in gave sufficient room to apprehend
danger. I expressed my desire to get down. I believe in the theory of safety
first. My objective was conveyed with sympathy charged with the dignified air
of the pay master. But he would not allow me to get down. I wanted to know why
he begged of me to stay where I was. The reply came, “Once I take rest, I would
be done for the day.” I had to give in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was now ready. He pulled his vehicle with all the strength he had at his
disposal. For all his exertion, the perambulator refused to move upwards. While
the effort went on to drag the vehicle up, I had to keep myself engaged in
maintaining my own balance. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My heart began to palpitate. There was
every possibility of the vehicle turning upside down. I had never <span

for an indefinite period of time became an irritable job. I was compelled to
make him understand that I was not used to being disobeyed, and if he did not
listen </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

will power expressed with emphasis was a vital blow on his senses. </span><span

rickshaw-puller now got his vehicle free of<i> </i>the load he was expressed to
carry, but the change did not make any appreciable difference. The slope of the
bridge was the scene of a regular tog of war between man power and the law of
gravitation. The struggle continued for sometime. I looked at my watch. It was
1 O’clock. The time was fleeting fast towards morning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was taxed, which made me offer my assistance. To my misfortune, the offer was
readily accepted and I had to keep up to the word of a gentleman. I harnessed
myself to the task I was pledged to. I started pushing from behind. Our joint
efforts proved to be successful and we managed to pull the vehicle up to the
top of the bridge. Fatigued as I was, I could not follow it down slope, because
the wheels began to develop speed. They were left to accumulate automatic power
until the motion was exhausted and the vehicle came to a standstill. The <span

a doubt that the present case was designed for a mischievous end. I went near
him quite prepared to teach a lesson, but closer scrutiny revealed a different
thing altogether. I noticed he was wiping his mouth by the towel he carried on
his shoulder. Good Heavens! He was actually removing clots of blood. I felt
sorry for the poor man and asked why he had not told me that he was ill. The
rickshaw-puller made no </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>effort to smile. A stream of tears seemed
to flow. He paused for a while and said with great exertion, “If I told you,
Sir, you would not have engaged me. My hungry children are waiting for me and I
have to give them food. They need it very badly.” I could well imagine he had a
long tale to tell, but he could not continue further. His voice was getting
choked. I could see his agony. His legs were trembling, his hold on the
rickshaw was getting slackened, and he was on the point of swooning. He would
have dropped unconscious on the road had not my ready support been available. I
allowed him to sit down on the road slowly while I held the rickshaw by my
hand. I was lost in bewilderment and sought help but none was to be had in the
lonely path, whereas the man was in immediate need of medical attendance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

gave me the strength to proceed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

made up my mind to take the rickshaw-puller in his own vehicle to the doctor.
The resolution was strong, but to put it into action was not very easy. More
than a quarter of an hour passed before I could finally decide to take the
place of the rickshaw-puller and drag his vehicle through the public road. I
never knew that vanity had such a tremendous hold on my personal movements. For
the first time I <span class=SpellE>realised</span> that I was nothing better
than a slave manufactured by my society. I had no freedom to do what pleased
me, and false ideas of respectability crippled my emotions. I lived to submit.
Deeper insight into the illusion of vanity made me eventually bold enough to
act as I had resolved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Exhaustion began to creep over my nerves within the space of a few yards. I
stuck on, only to <span class=SpellE>realise</span> that I had plunged into an
impossible feat. I was on the point of giving up my solemn resolution, but an
unaccountable force pulled me up and helped mo to draw the vehicle until I

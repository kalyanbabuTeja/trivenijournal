community projects programme has by now become familiar to the Indian
population as a gigantic programme for the development of rural areas in the
country. Though initially this programme was more or less restricted to schemes
for<i> </i>better agriculture and ‘grow more food’, there has been a gradual
transformation of it into what it was mainly intended to be–a programme of
total attack on rural under-<span class=SpellE>developedness</span> and for
comprehensive development of rural areas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what has happened so far it is becoming increasingly evident that community
projects and their off-shoot, the national extension blocks, are only parts of
a continuing process’ of development of India’s rural areas, which has actually
been in operation almost always and which will have to go on, because there can
be no finality about, or end to, progress as such. This is a concept of basic
importance, which has to be borne in mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the broad ideal of rural community welfare or methods to be followed in that
regard there is no divergence of opinion. Subject to variations in conditions
in different parts of the country and in the problems confronting the rural
population in different States, its broad aspects are more<i> </i>or less
identical. But whatever the variations in the programmes, the fundamental fact
is that it is the people and not merely programmes, that if is personal
participation of individuals and not merely the impersonal interest of unintelligent
groups that are the objects of attention in them. The difference between the
earlier schemes in this respect and the present one<i> </i>consists in the
extensiveness of the area and the large masses of people that are to be covered
in the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

projects scheme do not seem to have achieved the </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>maximum results.
The advisory committees in project areas did not prove effective for the
purpose for which they were constituted and the measure of administrative
co-ordination, the pivot of the scheme, had not been commensurate with the
basic need implicit in it for a comprehensive attack on village problems. The
impact of earlier and pre-project experience, when un-coordinated departmental
activity was more or less the rule, had to be countered and some uniform
practices had to be evolved, which would be applicable to various project areas
and at the same time allow for local variations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

composition is impeccable but probably such that not much could be got out of
them. While their advice and co-operation are to be welcomed, in a number of
States their approach to their task lacked and still lacks helpfulness. In the
interests of expeditious execution of project work, sometimes they have had to
be by-passed and the need for consultation overlooked by project officers. That
may be regrettable but is inevitable; but these committees will make themselves
effective in the measure in which their members exhibit a predilection to
appreciate that community projects are a process in national regeneration into
which political animosities should not be interposed. It is a matter for
consideration, what should be done, when political or personal equations </span><span

unprejudiced counsel to project officers on the part of </span><span

problem of ensuring administrative co-ordination is resolving itself through
internal adjustment, because State Governments <span class=SpellE>realise</span>
that community projects and rural development work are top priority activities.
Nevertheless there was in the initial stages the deadweight tradition of
un-coordinated and un-integrated departmental efforts that had to be broken.
Here, as the Evaluation <span class=SpellE>Organisation’s</span> Report rightly
states, the personal equation dominates and the personality, capacity and, more
than all, the seniority and authority of individual development commissioners
are important factors in engendering the assistance of other departmental
heads. While administrative co-ordination at the top level is being rapidly
provided, at the lower levels–district and village-difficulties are probably
not completely eliminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Evaluation Organisation has no ready-made answer to this ticklish problem: but
what would probably produce results </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is <span class=SpellE>centralising</span>
control at the district level in the collector or deputy commissioner and
making project officers <span class=SpellE>realise</span> that what they should
strive for is integration of the work of departmental staffs, so far as project
areas are involved, with that of project staffs and not exercise of control
over them. While programmes can be <span class=SpellE>finalised</span> with
comparative ease in project executive committees at the district level, at
which district officials of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>different departments are present, their
actual execution might be impeded if subordinate departmental officials have in
practice to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>answer two masters, or if village level workers
do not get their wholehearted support. Just as, at the top, the development commissioner’s
personal authority and seniority counts, <span class=GramE>the</span> capacity
of project officers to evoke co-operation counts for much at the project and
village level. The suggestion in the report that project officers should be
drawn from different departments and, wherever possible, even from outside the
ranks of the regular </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>services, is valuable and calls for
serious consideration from State Governments. Altogether the position in this
respect is steadily </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>improving and we hear less complaint than
in the earlier stages of project work on the score of lack of administrative
co-ordination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we reach down to the village level, the position calls for continuous vigilance
and improvement as it is here that co-ordination in a very real sense has to be
demonstrated. The village level worker occupies the <span class=SpellE>centre</span>
of attention here. If he has to discharge a multi-purpose responsibility, it
will be essential, firstly, to have a better type of worker than is generally
available at present, and secondly, that he should be one who can inspire

these conditions had existed or exist, whatever be the other impediments and
drawbacks, the active interest of the concerned villagers and their purposeful

as under the impetus of the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> movement they
had been <span class=SpellE>recognised</span> as imperative needs, their
implementation and techniques have now been adapted to equate to the demands of
community welfare on a comprehensive scale. Long accustomed to talks and
sermons on rural welfare and inured to unfulfilled assurances about potential
improvement of their conditions, villagers in some States are prone to be <span
class=SpellE>sceptical</span> about this latest manifestation of solicitous
interest. But, by and large, this attitude stems from the fact that serious and
sincere attempts to instruct them in the virtues and methods of
self-improvement and of individual and group participation in welfare <span
class=GramE>work,</span> had been few and unsystematic. The community projects
scheme has revealed that such instruction and its follow-up by concrete instances
of official anxiety and effort to help in every possible way, would evoke
gratifying response from the rural population.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
measure of this response is undoubtedly not uniform throughout the country.
India is not, however, a small country nor are administrative standards or
development of people’s consciousness of the value of self-improving activity
uniform throughout. But once the villagers are impressed by the genuineness and
the sincerity of official efforts, they readily accept advice and follow the
lead given. This, as the Evaluation Report clearly shows, is more or less true
of all States and particularly true of schemes which satisfy the essential
needs of the rural population, such as improved seed, improved implements,
supply of fertilizers etc. The establishment of a village school or the
construction of an approach road has in a vast number of cases evoked ready and
enthusiastic response, and contributions in honey or <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
are ungrudgingly made. A phenomenon of immense social and economic
significance, this can be <span class=SpellE>utilised</span> to advantage in
future programmes. Social education organizers should prove their usefulness in
an increasing measure in harnessing this newly-generated incentive to
constructive effort for all kinds of community welfare work. Furthermore,
schemes for improvement in agricultural methods, spread of education, provision
of hospitals and maternity aid, etc., accepted by villagers in earlier stages
should be followed by a steady flow of extension activities through personal
contacts and regular visits to villages by extension staffs, a steady flow of
literature, pamphlets etc., on how to follow up the results achieved, and by
the use of visual aids and other methods. This is what justifies the
observation in the beginning, that rural community welfare is a continuous
process and not an <i>ad hoc </i>programme for which there is a point of
commencement and a point of termination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
about the future of community development programmes? This question has
reference to the continuance of work in the projects and the national extension
service blocks at the end of the first Five Year Plan period, and also to the
extension of the programme into new and uncovered areas. During the first two
years period, 1952-53 and 1953-54, the development programme is intended to
embrace 48,750 villages and 38 millions of India’s rural population, but the
target decided upon is that it should cover 120,000 villages or nearly
one-fourth of India’s rural area and about 80 million people by 1956.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
this connection, the Evaluation Organisation has thrown out a few commendable
thoughts which should provide guidance for the future. Noting the diversities
in the pace of progress in different areas and the relatively slow progress
registered in some areas in comparison with others, its report points out that
these are due in part to the selection of the first set of projects in a
somewhat haphazard manner without, in all cases, adequate or satisfactory
preliminary surveys, and on the basis of not very well defined principles of
uniform applicability. An understandable anxiety to get into stride the new
scheme outpaced systematic and careful planning of work or ascertainment of
needs. Caution is, therefore, advised in the further extension of the scheme and
against bringing within its orbit areas where essential preliminary
investigations and surveys of local needs and requirements, resources of
man-power and potential financial contribution, and so on, have not been
undertaken. “The tasks involved in survey planning, phasing of programmes,
organisation, popularization and implementation,” says the Report, “had to be
more specifically weighed than was possible in the initial stages.” It adds
that, while the mistakes of the past should be avoided, it is correct to say
that “with every effort to make up the leeway in these matters, it would not be
possible to complete the first stage of development within the prescribed
period of three years. A total period of from five to six years would appear to
be necessary to allow a project to work under moral conditions.” This
caution-cum-counsel seems desiderated, and in rural welfare work, in which
villages and villagers at different levels of progress and of different mental
ranges, in many cases hidebound by long-established customs and traditions,
caste, family and other regulations have to be tackled, “hasten slowly” is a
counsel of wisdom. Consolidation before extension should be the guiding factor,
though the urgencies and demands of our rural needs are such that extension
cannot always wait on consolidation. We cannot in any case afford to risk
failure by rushing ahead in haste, even as we cannot afford to soft-pedal
progress by a waiting on events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

vital question is how and to what extent activities initiated in various
spheres in the community projects would be continued at the end of the
scheduled three year period. Serious thought undoubtedly needs to be devoted to
this issue from now onwards and State Governments, local boards and other local
<span class=SpellE>organisations</span> intimately associated with the
execution of the programmes have to be alerted regarding the responsibilities
and obligations, financial, administrative, supervisory and so on, that will
devolve on them. There is particular need to ensure adequate financial support
for the programmes, when foreign financial and technical aid, under the
India-U. S. Technical Aid Agreement, may diminish considerably or even stopped
altogether. During the first Five Year Plan period, financial outlay on the
community development and national extension programmes is expected to be of
the order of <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 101 <span class=SpellE>crores</span>
for the 3 years of the plan period, and expenditure of <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>.
46 <span class=SpellE>crores</span> (excluding the N. E. S. programme) has
already been budgeted for, of which <span class=SpellE>Rs</span>. 5 <span

problems that demand attention in the immediate future, because of their

are the training of personnel, particularly village level and extension workers
and social education <span class=SpellE>organisers</span>, and the grooming of
local <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>, to which supervision of welfare
activities and of various-institutions started under the impetus of the scheme
could be entrusted. The Five Year Plan envisages that, at the end of the Plan
period, about 120,000 villages covering a population of 75 million persons
should share the benefits of the programmes and in the second Plan there will
be a further extension of the programmes to cover the entire rural area. The personnel-requirements
for operating programmes of this magnitude are stupendous, not only because of
the numbers involved but also because of the time and <span class=SpellE>labour</span>
required for training them. Technically trained and equipped workers of proper <span

the next two years of some 82,000 of them for various job responsibilities,
ranging from village level workers to social education <span class=SpellE>organisers</span>,
involves a formidable problem of providing training facilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

But the problem is one not merely of putting through a six weeks to a six

jobs, but also of recruiting the right kind of personnel, namely, those who are
technically qualified and capable of undertaking the multi-purpose duties in
villages. They should be competent to benefit from the training and imbued with
the proper spirit of service and willingness to work among and with the
villagers. It would seem that the Community Projects Administration can
advantageously enlist in this sphere the co-operation and assistance of <span

village welfare work is to be carried-on on a more intensive scale, as it will
be under the second Five Year Plan, job opportunities will correspondingly
increase, and along with it employment potentialities in the rural areas. Are
our young men willing to exploit these opportunities, is a question, on the
answer to which depends at least a partial solution of the menacing unemployment
problem, The Community Projects Administration proceeds on the basic assumption
that village development work must be multi-purpose in its scope, from which
follows the conclusion that those employed in it should be essentially
multi-purpose personnel, who know something of everything about villagers’
needs and demands and can act as their friends, guides, and philosophers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

need for advance determination of measures for continuance of project
activities after 1956, is as important as the training of personnel. The
psychology for betterment engendered among India’s rural population generally
and the concrete schemes for local and community welfare undertaken or executed
in various projects and development <i>blocs, </i>and even more than that, the
spirit of emulative competition created among villagers in formulating and
implementing local welfare works and the growing demand for extension of the
area of the schemes, into which </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>so much of effort and
money at different levels has gone–all these postulate that the good work
accomplished should be continuously extended. By far the best thing that should
happen is that development and welfare activities started and carried on during
the Plan period should move forward towards greater fulfillment through their
own momentum. The enthusiasm generated in the villagers by reason of the fact
that essential felt needs of their areas are being met through their own
efforts, <span class=SpellE>labour</span> and contribution, is a dynamic
incentive to action. But then enthusiasm without leadership to channel it into
beneficent paths will result in diffusion of efforts and dissipation of
resources. It is in providing such leadership that village <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>
like co-operative societies, <span class=SpellE>panchayats</span>, welfare
institutions and representative <span class=SpellE>organisations</span> of
villagers like ‘gram <span class=SpellE>sanghas</span>’, ‘gram <span

play the leading role. They are the training grounds for village leadership,

place of co-operatives in rural Welfare requires precise definition and
adequate emphasis. Rural development through the co-operative movement has been
a long understood idea in this country. The Position accorded to co-operative
organisation in the community projects scheme is a tribute to the inherent

some States, largely due to the drawbacks of co-operators themselves, is a
warning against a repetition of mistakes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

community welfare idea in the present rural welfare scheme has a spiritual
affinity with the basic principles of the co-operative movement, and what is
wanted is a more effective dovetailing of the two. It would serve a useful
purpose if this objective is systematically encouraged in community project
areas in States like Madras and Bombay, where co-operation has made
comparatively better progress than in others. A vigilant supervision of their
working should eliminate the evils of self-seeking and other un-cooperative
practices on the part of co-operators that had brought co-operation into
disrepute. The ideal of a Co-operative Commonwealth will come within easy reach
if the rural welfare scheme makes greater and purposeful use of co-operatives
to serve both multi-purpose ends and the needs of different groups of villagers
like agriculturists, artisans, weavers and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

achievement of targets prescribed, there is throughout the country today a
renovated hope that the problems of the rural people will not be just tinkered
with, but that in fact top priority is accorded to them, both in planning and
action. Example is always a more powerful stimulant to activity than precept,
and what is happening is the villages covered by the community projects and

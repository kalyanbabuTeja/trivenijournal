was the year Dundubhi, 944 of the Saka Era. Kamarasa, founder of the Hoysala
line of kings, was ruling in Molanur. On the fifth day of the bright fortnight
in Pushya, there was music in the yard of a fairly big house in one of the
streets of the capital. Ladies, young and old, of the neighbouring households
were coming into the house or leaving it with presents and sharing in the joy
of a domestic celebration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

house was the house of Joga, a commander in the employ of King Kama. The house
was celebrating the seventh month of the pregnancy of Joga’s young wife. This
house was to the young woman not only her husband’s house, but her mother also
lived there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Joga stood near the doorway of his room on one side, of the hall, looking with
eager joy at the beauty of his young wife as she was seated on the festal seat.
Vasanti, half shy and other half proud that her husband should be looking at
her in the presence of so many people, was flushing red and receiving the
blessings of elders, pretending to be unaware of his presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

friend of Vasanti observed Joga for a moment and said something to the young
wife and smiled a little. Vasanti also smiled and, as she did so, bent her head

sound was a summons to the troops of the Hoysala king. The drummer had started
to proclaim to the men of the army that the king desired them to gather
together in the parade ground that evening. Within a few minutes a special
messenger from the palace came to Joga and communicated to him in person the

joy of the festival ebbed visibly. Those who had assembled brought the
ceremonies to a conclusion somehow. Desiring not to frighten the wife more than
was inevitable, Joga tried to talk and move about as usual. But that wife
seemed to be cast down by a new anxiety adding to the fatigue of the morning
ceremonies and the fact that she was carrying a child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kadamba king of Banavasi was overlord to the Hoysala. Enemies of Banavasi were
moving from the ghat boundary in a hostile expedition towards the Hoysala
boundary. The commander of the boundary guards had sent word of the move both
to Banavasi and to Molanur. Nripakama decided immediately to do his duty as
feudatory and sent the drum summons over his territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it comes to fighting, no soldier who knows the taste of fighting and is not
forgetful of his duty hesitates to go. To cause injury and receive injury, to
see others die and to be ready to die oneself, is not pleasant nor exactly
sport. But to stay behind is no pleasure and definitely not sport. When honour
summons to the fight, to stay behind is shame.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one has a home and friends and for once, for some special reason, some of these
may desire that one should not go to the fight. Joga’s mother and his
mother-in-law arranged through a friend to bring to the notice of the king that
the commander’s wife was with child seven months. Both the women had sacrificed
their husbands in fights and had brought up Joga as the one boy who represented
both the families. There was no other male in the household and the young wife
was with child. It would be a gracious thing if the king should exempt the
commander from duty on this occasion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it by staying in the capital. Supposing I stay in the town and there in the
course of the fight a hair of that head comes to harm from the enemy, the food
I eat would that moment be poison to me. My ancestors would fall low from high

</FONT><P>I was sailing little paper-boats on the river of life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You loaded them with the rich merchandise of your mind.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You put them on the high seas and made much of what was little.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dived deep in these springs of your being;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And the deeper I dived, the deeper was the spring.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the sandy desert of life yours was the only stream.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like a lone red flower blossoming by the ocean-marge</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You stood unshrinking beneath the burning sun.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And gazed back at him as effulgent as he.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know not whether I am the fruit of that flower.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sun ripens it; the flower bears the fruit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where would be the fruit without the agony of the flower?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have piped a few ditties; you gave me the organ voice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have flitted on the fringe of life; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You led me to its innermost shrine.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have taken beauty to be the hem of her garment. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You made her suckle and fondle me like a child.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have led me to a country where there are no horizons.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have thrown open a casement that commands the seas and the sky. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And you have filled the hollows of my brain with the light of all the stars.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Like a <I>gandharva</I> in exile sojourning the earth</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have ushered in heaven into many a hearth and home </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And touched to heavenly issues the hearts that hailed you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world is at grips with you for you are unsettling the world.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The philistines dread you for you are shattering their idols.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh! <I>gandharva</I> in exile! if you thus bear the cross</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world will know some day that you were a son of God.</P></DIR>

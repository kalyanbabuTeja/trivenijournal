am referring to my state-wide tour of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City>,
six summers back. Whenever I read about the temples of <span class=SpellE>Somnathpur</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Belur</span> and <span class=SpellE>Halebid</span>, I felt a
burning desire to visit these shrines of sculpture. Also, for a long time, I
was mad about capturing in my camera, these splendid symphonies in stone.
Naturally, as I set out on my tour, I was wild with joy. I am not going to
lecture to you here, all about my journey, but will tell you of what happened
in a village I stayed on my way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was somewhere around nine o’clock in the night when I reached <span

walking behind. I thought of breaking my journey for the night, in that
village. I asked the cart-man if I could find some place to stay for the night.
He mentioned <span class=SpellE>Kariyappa’s</span> name and told me that he
would take the message to him, if I so desired. I was also promised of a
comfortable stay in his house. I nodded in assent. After a few yards we reached
<span class=SpellE>Kariyappa’s</span> house. I stood near the cart while the
cart-man brought <span class=SpellE>Kariyappa</span> and introduced him to me.
He drew near me and with folded hands requested me, in all humility, to feel
quite at home in his place. I greeted him in turn and muttered that I was
causing him a lot of inconvenience. He didn’t seem to take notice of what I
said, but thanked me for the generosity with which I had condescended to be his
guest. He said he was indeed blessed to have a guest like me. He asked the
cart-man to carry my things and led me to his house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a room to a side on the <span class=SpellE><i>pyol</i></span><i>. </i>One
of the servants swept the room clean, spread a mat and placed a hurricane-lamp.
The cart-man placed all my things there. I paid him off. The master asked me to
wash up and have a change. I went to the room and came out in my shirt and
dhoti. By then, someone had placed a <span class=SpellE>potful</span> of hot
water in my room. I had a wash. My host and I finished our supper, came out to
the <span class=SpellE><i>pyol</i></span><i> </i>and sat there relaxing over a
plate of <i>pan-<span class=SpellE>supari</span>, </i>I explained to him all
about my tour. He was highly pleased with my stay there. This was evident in
every gesture of his. During our talk, I gathered a few details about him. He
was quite well-to-do, paying <span class=GramE>a land</span> revenue of four
hundred rupees. There were many servants and several head of cattle. His was
the biggest house in the village. His innate humility deeply impressed me. That
must have come quite natural to such village folk, I thought. I was confident
that I would be treated with great care and love. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with a cup of milk for me. They were not used to coffee. I was not used to a
cup of milk in the morning! However, I couldn’t refuse something that was
offered with such love. I showed him all my photographs, explaining everything

leisure on my tour, I never failed to write to her. Most of my letters carried
descriptions of the temples I had visited and my experiences on my journey.
Almost every second I was possessed of her thoughts. Many a time I regretted
for not having brought her with me. The thrill would be all the more in her
company. I wrote all about my sojourn at <span class=SpellE>Nagavalli</span>,
the hospitality of my host, his people, my programme to visit the nearby temple
the next day, and wound up the letter with a reference to some of our personal
private affairs. There was no post-office in the village. I had, of course,
learnt that there was a post-box there, and that the letters were collected by
a post-man from <span class=SpellE>Belur</span>, twice or thrice a week. I
thought of sending the letter through a servant of the house and came out of my
room. Right across my room, I saw a buxom girl in her teens, squatting,
reclining against a pillar on the <span class=SpellE><i>pyol</i></span><i>. </i>I
thought her to be the master’s daughter. I stood for a while not knowing what
to do. Sensing my helplessness, she came to me and asked me if I wanted
something. I felt pleased at her <span class=SpellE>naivete</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

slept for a while, after the midday meal. It was four by the time I got up. I
came to the <span class=SpellE><i>pyol</i></span><i>, </i>as I felt like having
a wash. There she was, <span class=SpellE>Chenni</span>, in the same place, I
had seen her earlier–at the pillar. Seeing me, she pulled in her legs and began
chewing the border of her sari as if lost in her own thoughts. There wasn’t
anyone else there, that I could ask water of. As I had already talked with her
once before, I felt a little free with her and told her that I wanted some
water. She coyly nodded assent and went in with enthusiasm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

must have been born with a radiant smile on her lips, I thought! Ever-smiling,
there was something naive, soft and soothing about her face. What a contrast, I
thought, to the smile of a sophisticated city girl! The curve of smile on <span
class=SpellE>Chenni’s</span> face reminded me of a refreshing cool breeze
floating across, caressing tender shoots and flowers, sucking in their delicate
fragrance, and touching soft ripples in your heart! As I was thus musing over
her, she brought a bucketful of water. By the time I washed up and went in, she
shot into my room with something for me to eat, a cup of milk, and disappeared.
After this light snack, I left my room with my flute and camera for a casual
stroll. As I came out, there she was, at the same pillar! I walked a few yards,
but couldn’t decide where to go. I had learnt that they had a garden, somewhere
nearby. But I didn’t know the route. I turned towards her, enquiring of her
about the garden. She rose at once, took me a few yards behind the house and
pointed towards the narrow path ahead leading to the garden. I took the path
and I had moved hardly a few yards, when tossed by the wind, the edge of my
upper cloth got entangled in a thorny fence. I turned back to extricate it. She
was still there–<span class=SpellE>Chenni</span>–where she had stood when I had
left her a few seconds earlier. I thought, she must have stood there watching
me take the right path and to throw a hint or two in case I took the wrong
route.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What with the luxuriant creepers and flowers around
me, the cool caressing breeze, and the air rich with the birds singing in
full-throated ease, for sometime I felt transported to heights of ecstasy. I
was tempted to play on my flute. A single shrill note filled the whole air with
resonance. For sometime, I played a few tunes on my flute and then began softly
humming a song. Fully aware that I was all alone by myself there, I started
singing loudly. A few seconds later, I abruptly wheeled round as I heard some
vague sounds emanating from the water below. It was <span class=SpellE>Chenni</span>
who had immersed her copper pot in the water! She kept looking at me. I felt
awfully ashamed of my <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>–this sophisticated
gentleman playing his flute like a cowherd and ‘singing’ so loudly in the
presence of a village girl! As I had my back turned to the flight of steps I
hadn’t noticed <span class=SpellE>Chenni’s</span> coming there. Being lost in
singing, I hadn’t heard either the jingle of her bangles. </p>

tried to console myself that nothing untoward had happened. Somehow, I couldn’t
regain my composure. I picked up my camera and kept looking at it trying to
conceal my embarrassment. I felt that <span class=SpellE>Chenni</span> was
slowly coming up. The sound of her footsteps ceased. I didn’t like this
intrusion on my privacy. Her bracelets tinkled. I felt ashamed of sheepishly
turning back and looking at her again; but I couldn’t resist the temptation.
She had placed the two pots of water on the parapet. She appeared to be still
smiling at my earlier singing. I felt awkward. I turned back and started to
move on. Right then I heard her speak something. I was in no mood to make out
clearly what she was saying. However it would be rude, I thought, not to
respond. I turned towards her and asked her what she was saying. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

did you so abruptly stop singing, master?” she asked. Fumbling for an answer, I
managed to mutter that I had stopped because the song was done. Though her
question appeared to be taunting me, I didn’t get wild. I knew it was a stupid
act on my part–that singing!’ I tried to forget all about this, picked up my
camera and the flute and started ahead. Soon, she called me again. I stopped.
She was seen lifting one of the pots on to her head while the other was on the
parapet. She asked me, in an apologetic tone, if I would lift up to her waist,
the pot on the parapet. I</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

seemed to have pleasantly </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

started homeward. It was a luxurious sight–watching this girl, bathed in the
evening gold, rhythmically moving ahead, swinging and swaying under the weight
of those copper pots of water. I felt like taking a snap of hers in that
posture. Ready with my camera, not bothering to know how she would react, I
called her: “<span class=SpellE>Chennamma</span>”. She looked back, turned
round and asked me: “Did you call me, master?” I moved towards her and said:
“Will you please remain, as you are, for a second?” That must have surprised
her a bit. It could be clearly read in her face. I clicked and told her that
she might go. With a curious look, she asked me, “What is it, you did, master?”
Not knowing how to explain to her the principles of a camera and all about
photography, I promised to tell her everything the next day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

browsing through some novel. Hardly ten minutes had passed, when I heard some
vague sound at my door outside. I thought it to be the wind and continued
reading. I heard the sound again; this time it was a gentle knock on the door!
“Who is it?” I asked. No answer. Sitting up in my bed, I asked a little louder,
“Who is it?” The sound of tinkling bangles, followed by <span class=SpellE>Chenni’s</span>
reply in a whisper. I was rather surprised, wondering what business she had in
my room at that dark hour! However, I checked the flow of my thoughts, opened
the door a little, craned my neck and asked her what she wanted. The lamp in my
room had dimly lit her figure. She was holding a plate with a few plantains, a
little sugar and a cup of milk. To my question, </span><span style='font-size:

plate from her and moved towards my bed. She followed me into the room! I
placed the plate near the bed, turned to her and told her that I didn’t need
anything else and that she might go. She began smiling and asked me if I didn’t
feel like eating in her presence. I told her, “What if you are here! I shall be
certainly pleased to eat in your presence. But... you see, right now I don’t
want anything. That apart...well...at this odd hour all alone by yourself….”
She closed the door and bolted it even before I managed to complete my
sentence! I shuddered at this, perspiring all over. Moving towards the door in
an attempt to open it, I stammered out, “<span class=SpellE>Wh</span>…why
did...you bolt it?” She was more agile than I. She had already sprung to the
door and stood there smiling, barring the doorway. I felt the earth beneath me
sinking. I clearly realized her intent, felt it almost hammered into my heart.

while, twisting the bit of her sari, evidently possessed of something. She
looked at me and there were already faint traces of agitation on her face. My
eyes glistened with pity at the lot of this unfortunate girl. She must have
felt slightly uneasy on seeing my tears and moved towards me. I didn’t feel
like sliding away from her as I had done earlier. I had fully realized that she
wasn’t sinning of her own accord. It was merely her body that was sin-stained,
while her soul was pure as a pearl of water on a lotus leaf. I gently took her
hand. My heart bumped a bit. I held her hand still, softly caressing her
fingers. My feelings about her must have purred their way into her heart She
drew nearer and almost whispered, “Yes, my Lord”, without lifting up her face.
It was evident that she was not her earlier self. Something seemed to be
troubling her mind. I began, “Look here <span class=SpellE>Chennamma</span>,
you have told me just now that I am your God?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

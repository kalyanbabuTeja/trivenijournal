<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is a great <span class=SpellE>honour</span> to be called upon to deliver the
Commemoration Address on this occasion. Sri K. <span class=SpellE>Balasubrahmania</span>
Aiyar was not merely kind, but exceedingly generous and affectionate, in
extending the invitation to one who had never met his distinguished father. In
previous years, I used to sit here and listen with the utmost eagerness while
friends or associates of V. Krishnaswami Aiyar spoke of his life and
achievement. But today, I can only show you things through the wrong end of the
telescope, and describe the impression created in the young minds of a
generation that was at school or college when he passed away, and, especially,
how<i> </i>that memory <span class=SpellE>moulded</span> the thought and <span
class=SpellE>coloured</span> the outlook on life of an aspiring lad of twelve
or thirteen, who lived in a far-away little town in one of the northern
districts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
me in those days, Krishnaswami Aiyar was an able and immensely rich lawyer,–one
of the band of <span class=SpellE>Mylapore</span> lawyers whose fabled
magnificence seemed to rival the glories <span class=GramE>of</span> <span
class=SpellE>Haroun-Al-Raschid</span> of the <i>Arabian Nights, </i>or of <span
class=SpellE>Yudhishtira</span> at <span class=SpellE>Indraprastha</span>, as
narrated in the gorgeous prose and verse of <span class=SpellE>Nannaya</span>
in the ‘<span class=SpellE>Sabha</span> <span class=SpellE>Parva</span>’ of the
Telugu <i>Mahabharata. </i>Well, thought I, if my father, who <span
class=SpellE>practises</span> in a mere <span class=SpellE>Munsiff’s</span>
court right opposite my house and makes only two or three hundred a month, is
considered rich, and if, as a result, I can wear fine clothes and a lace cap
and go about like a little prince amongst my school-fellows, surely
Krishnaswami Aiyar, who <span class=SpellE>practises</span> in the High Court
at Madras and earns ten thousand a month, must be infinitely richer, and, his
sons, of course, must have finer clothes and many more lace caps! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

class=GramE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>But to this impression of wealth and luxury succeeded
another.</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'> News of the great <span class=SpellE>Arbuthnot</span>
crash travelled into my little world, and people spoke of the famous <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> lawyer whose heart
was pierced by the cry of destitute widows and orphans all over the land. And
they said, “This Krishnaswami Aiyar never took a pie!” So, this man who knew
how to earn, knew also when to refrain from earning. There was something in
that. I longed to know more of him. Almost as if in answer, there floated into
my young life the beneficent influence of a deeply loved friend–who is now no
more–<span class=SpellE>Chavali</span> <span class=SpellE>Venkata</span> <span
class=SpellE>Krishnaiya</span>, a student of the F.A. class in the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Madras</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Christian</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. He was my senior
by three or four years; but when you are young, that makes a great difference. <span
class=SpellE>Krishnaiya</span> was tall </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and handsome,
intensely affectionate by<i> </i>nature, and an eloquent </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>speaker.
During the vacations, he used to gather round him the youngsters in our
home-town, and give us vivid glimpses of the great </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>world
of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City>. He
spoke of his Professors, Skinner and Russell and <span class=SpellE>Macphail</span>,
of the debating societies at College, and of the big men whom he, as Secretary,
invited to speak at important functions. He was full of admiration for gifted
speakers of English like T. M. <span class=SpellE>Nair</span>, C. R. Reddy and
L. A. <span class=SpellE>Govindaraghava</span> Aiyar. But the name that was
oftenest on his lips was that of V. Krishnaswami Aiyar. “There is none like
him,” he used to say. Some years later he recited to us with gusto whole
passages from Krishnaswami <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span> memorable. <span
class=GramE>Convocation Address, particularly the one about “the mighty stream
of master-minds.”</span> That revealed to me another side of Krishnaswami
Aiyar; he was a scholar and a patriot who <span class=SpellE>realised</span>
the glory that was <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Ind</span></st1:place></st1:State> and dreamed of her noble
mission in the future. And he was a statesman too, for, at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Surat</span></st1:place></st1:City> when the
Congress broke up in confusion, it was he that suggested to the President, Dr.
Rash <span class=SpellE>Behari</span> <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Ghose</span></span><span
class=GramE>, that</span> they ought to call an informal Convention and save
the Congress from virtual extinction. “And, do you know,” said <span
class=SpellE>Krishnaiya</span>, “the learned Doctor Rash <span class=SpellE>Behari</span>
was overjoyed. He actually enfolded Krishnaswami Aiyar in a warm embrace and
exclaimed, ‘We too have studied history and constitutional law; but what is the
use? Now, you are a genius’.” Thus the legend of Krishnaswami Aiyar grew into
my consciousness and prepared me for all that was to follow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

little later I passed into a new atmosphere, that of <span class=SpellE>Masulipatam</span>,
the stronghold of Nationalist ‘agitation’ in Andhra of those days. Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Pattabhi</span> <span class=SpellE>Sitaramayya</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Mutnuri</span> Krishna Rao of the <i>Krishna <span class=SpellE>Patrika</span>,
</i>and above all, <span class=SpellE>Kopalle</span> <span class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span>
Rao, evoked in me an admiration which bordered on worship. The Andhra <span
class=SpellE>Jateeya</span> Kalasala was inaugurated while I was a student of
the Intermediate class in the local <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Noble</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Those were
stirring times. We boys were all for Tilak and his band of self-sacrificing
heroes. The Congress, we were sure, was no longer a national institution; and
Krishnaswami <span class=GramE>Aiyar</span> who had accepted a High Court
Judgeship, and then an Executive Councillorship, was not a genuine patriot. He
was a back number, who owed allegiance to the Moderate Congress. And yet, this
same Krishnaswami Aiyar was the first important person in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> to befriend <span class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span>
Rao and to encourage him to proceed with his noble work for the Kalasala. <span
class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span> Rao was an M.A. and. a B.L. He was born to
affluence. But the impulse to serve was strong in him, and more than a decade
prior to the Non-co-operation Movement of Gandhiji, he gave up his practice at
the Bar and spent himself in the service of a renascent Indian nationalism. I
have heard Dr. <span class=SpellE>Pattabhi</span> relate the meeting of the two
great dreamers of <st1:place w:st="on">South India</st1:place>. <span
class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span> Rao was modest as a bride, while Krishnaswami
Aiyar was vehement and aggressive. But deep called unto deep, and after the
first few meetings, “Krishnaswami Aiyar took <span class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span>
Rao to his bosom. He let his shy but persistent visitor unfold his plans for a
new <span class=SpellE>centre</span> of art, literature and handicrafts, his
dreams of a renaissance of Indian culture, and his vision of an <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> freed
from the shackles on her spirit. And then he burst out: “Look here, you are
right. Now take this <span class=SpellE>cheque</span>,”–it ran into four
figures–“spend it, and come back for more!” To <span class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span>
Rao in his loneliness and weariness of spirit, these words came as a breath of
spring, and the memory of it all must have sustained him in many difficult
moments. He survived Krishnaswami Aiyar for ten years, and nurtured the
Kalasala which, after him, I too served in a humble way. And always, this dear
institution is to me a symbol of the affection which Krishnaswami Aiyar and <span
class=SpellE>Hanumantha</span> Rao bore each other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Presidency</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. But, by bits and
in snatches, from new friends like K. S. <span class=SpellE>Venkataramani</span>
and V. S. <span class=SpellE>Venkataraman</span>, I learnt more of Krishnaswami
Aiyar. I saw the institutions he had founded and the men who managed those
institutions with devoted zeal. The details of the picture, however, were
filled in several years later when <i>Triveni </i>brought me into touch with
the ‘<span class=SpellE>Ashrama</span>’ and with <span class=SpellE>Chandrasekharan</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Krishnaiya</span>, the friend of my boyhood and companion of
my youth, inaugurated <i>Triveni </i>Madras at my request in December, 1927,
but, alas, within a few months he was snatched away. <span class=SpellE>Chandrasekharan</span>
seemed to step into my life to fill the gaping void. During, moonlit nights, on
the silver-white sands of the Marina, with the music of the sea in our ears, <span
class=SpellE>Chandrasekharan</span> related to me many moving passages out of
Krishnaswami <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span> life,</span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>child
when death parted his father from him. They were precious moments; they
revealed the essential nobility of Krishnaswami <span class=SpellE>Aiyar’s</span>
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

cherished for the memory of the father whom he had lost all too early in life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
shall not weary you with more of what might appear ‘sentimental effusions’.
But, then, it is sentiment that accounts for my presence here. Else, how should
a man of many failures feel a kinship of spirit with Krishnaswami Aiyar who was
supremely successful in all he undertook? It is the love of culture, of Indian
culture especially, that constitutes the kinship between us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

India has given birth to eminent lawyers and statesmen, great scholars and
founders of institutions, noble philanthropists and friends of humanity. But
there was something distinctive about Krishnaswami Aiyar. I shall try to
evaluate the ‘something’ that was like an upsurge from within,</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>–</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
life-giving stream that <span class=SpellE>fertilised</span> the entire domain
of his life, and gave it a meaning and a purpose. In one word, Krishnaswami
Aiyar had ‘vision’. He came at a crisis in our nation’s history, when old
values were being questioned, and the foundations of Indian life were being <span
class=SpellE>underminded</span>. As he grew up, he sensed the new life that men
like Sri Ramakrishna and <span class=SpellE>Vivekananda</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Naoroji</span> and <span class=SpellE>Ranade</span>, poured forth
in abundance. He saw a new India in the making, and himself, contributed to
that making. That new India was, doubtless, to be free politically, but
political freedom was but an outward, tangible expression of that inner freedom
of the mind and the spirit, which could not be won until we grasped the
significance of the long ages of Indian culture and achievement, in art and
literature, in social organisation and religious quest. A whole generation, or
even two, had been cut off from this fount of life; and so, in the process of
raising the edifice of a new India, the revival and re-interpretation of
ancient Indian culture in varied domains was an essential need. If Krishnaswami
Aiyar was a friend of <span class=SpellE>Vivekananda</span> and Baba Bharati,
if he looked upon <span class=SpellE>Malaviya</span> and. <span class=SpellE>Gokhale</span>
as his own brothers, if he welcomed <span class=SpellE>Subrahmania</span>
Bharati, the poet, and <span class=SpellE>Sambanda</span> <span class=SpellE>Mudaliar</span>,
the playwright, if he edited the <span class=SpellE><i>Arya</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Charitam</span> </i>and encouraged the recitation of the <i>Gita, </i>it
was entirely because he perceived, not just in a momentary flash but in the
effulgence of his intuition, that all this was an offering at the feet of the
Mother, who after a temporary eclipse was becoming ever more real to a whole people.
His fundamental faith was that the custodians of this great culture–the Vedic
scholars, the masters of the <span class=SpellE>Sastras</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Kavyas</span>, must be sought out and provision made for the
continuity of the stream of national culture. Thus he founded this Sanskrit College.
Thus too he founded the sister institutions, the <span class=SpellE>Ayurvedic</span>
College and the <span class=SpellE>Venkataramana</span> Dispensary, for the
preservation and growth of the science of healing which the <span class=SpellE>Rishis</span>
left us as a precious legacy. And then, having the gifts of a statesman, he was
resolved, for the <span class=SpellE>honour</span> of India, to prove that
Indians could shape high policy and administer Departments of State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

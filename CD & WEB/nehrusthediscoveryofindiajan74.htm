rich and graceful personality. It gives us glimpses into the manifold aspects
of this great man symbolised for many years the youth of our rejuvenated race
awakened after long slumber. What was the essential self of Pandit Nehru? He
was a politician by accident as he himself confessed, a thinker and a humanist
by instinct, a patriot who fought without rest or respite for freedom till it
was realised. He was not an erudite scholar, yet his versatile genius had much
to teach professional historians, sociologists and economists. He had no
literary ambitions, yet he displays in all his writings rare literary merits
and flavour. It is this many-sided and rich personality of Pandit Nehru, one of
India’s greatest men, that we discover in <i>The Discovery of India. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

of historical facts, philosophical speculations and reflective essays on
divergent themes couched in pleasant prose often rising to poetic heights. It
is a thesis on Indian culture and history by the catholic and cosmopolitan mind
of Nehru. He approaches India like a “friendly foreigner”, appreciates her
wisdom, condemns her follies and studies her past to make it a spring-board of
action, to push and direct the current of history in creative future <i>channels.
</i>But it is impossible to count it entirely as a book of history or culture,
for what interests us more in <i>The Discovery </i>is its intimate
autobiographical tone, its lucid style and literary graces, above all, its
expression of the ideas and opinions, tastes and temperament, refined
sentiments and noble passions of<i> </i>our beloved leader and the chief
disciple of Mahatma Gandhi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Considered
as a book of history <i>The Discovery </i>has many merits, but also a few
failings. It can be understood and appreciated as an introduction to the
cultural history of India, as a study of the various phases in the gradual
development of the national mind from the early dawn of civilization to the
feverish, twentieth century when British India stood at the threshold of
liberty and light. It is only a general introduction meant for the general
reader. Nehru is not an academic historian, and his aim is not to narrate the
facts of history with meticulous care. He is rather a philosopher of history,
and his aim is to make constructive suggestions on the basis of historical
knowledge. To a philosopher of history the future counts; the past only
provides light and experience for the skilful shaping of the future events. But
his knowledge of the past must be sound, and his attitude to it dispassionate;
he may omit minute details, but he should not misunderstand the main facts of
history, for otherwise all his futurist conclusions may be falsified. Nehru is
well-qualified for such a task–the task of the narration and interpretation of
history. His reading is vast and versatile; his approach is sane, sympathetic
and objective; his account of the national events is sincere and faithful; his
judgment is sound, and his suggestions are progressive. Only here and there we
feel that he is driven by certain innate prejudices and dominated by pragmatic
considerations. For example, he paints the British India as the darkest period
of Indian history. Here the prejudices of a patriot fighting the British empire
mar the sound judgment and objectivity of a historian. The British were a
democratic people, and despite our exploitation by them, they have done us much
good. Is it not significant that India was awakened into modernity and largely
freed from the self-forged shackles of slavery and superstitions in the British
times only? In the Moslem period to keep the lamp of culture ever burning, the
pandits of the Northern India had to migrate to the South. Yet they could not
save from the sweeping destruction all that ought to be saved. Under the
Afghans fearless thought and expression became impossible for such a long
period that the lack of inquisitiveness which Nehru so much deplores became a
permanent nature of Indian people, and the cultural life came to a standstill.
The stupor broke under the British, India recovered her lost confidence and
stirred up to new activities in all directions. Cultural renaissance and
political movement for freedom started. Yet Nehru is less sympathetic to the
British than to the Afghan rulers of India. Why? Subtle dislike for the British
is patent in the chapters delineating and discussing the British India. Such
prejudice, however slight, is undesirable in a historian or a philosopher of
history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nehru
says that Afghans after being settled in India were Indianised. The fact is
they never were. They did not, of course, like the British drag away India’s wealth
into a foreign country. But they lived in a conquered country like the robbers
who also ruled. Ruling over India from Delhi does not Indianise them. They
considered themselves the Moslem masters of Hindu population. They identified
themselves with the wandering tribes of Arabia, and hated the culture of India.
The Afghan period in the history of India is the darkest period, the period of
chaos where might passed as right, where brutal bloodshed of kafirs who refused
to be converted was the only ideal. What does jajia tax signify? Hindus for
being what they were had to pay taxes and pay heavily. Afghans physically lived
in India, but their spiritual home was abroad. Their descendents continued to
cherish the same mentality till India was divided and Pakistan came into
existence. The roots of Pakistan were deep in the minds of Indian Moslems, and
after the division of India nobody will agree with Nehru in maintaining that
Afghans, their descendents, their convert followers were ever Indianised. Nehru
reaches the extremity of naivete and wishful vision when he describes lusty
Allauddin Khilji’s forced marriage with the kidnapped queen of Karna Dev
Vaghela of Gujarat, and his son’s similar marriage with her daughter, as a sign
of synthesis between Afghans and Indians. Can Nehru really be so naive? I do
not think so. Here is a plain distortion of facts and blatantly wrong
interpretation of history. It was perhaps because he was over-anxious to prove
that all foreign invaders including Afghans succumbed to the fascination of
Indian civilization and her absorbing power, even when they did not, perhaps
because the Hindu-Moslem problem at the time <i>The Discovery </i>was written
had become very acute. The pragmatic politician in Nehru perhaps feared that
his frank and fearless treatment of Moslem period in India might aggravate the
tension which already existed, for he knew that the Moslems identified
themselves with their invader ancestors like Ghoris and Khiljies, and their
criticism by him may embitter them against him. The pragmatic consideration has
dominated Nehru here. But what may be pragmatically right cannot be justified
in an honest historian. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
such instances are rare where a historian’s objectivity in Nehru suffers. He
has never had scholastic claims on history. Besides, we do not read <i>The
Discovery </i>for the historical information it contains. We read it precisely
for the savour which his pleasant personal touches add to it. His mystic love
for India often gushes forth disturbing his detachment which nonetheless he
manages to keep up. His humane patriotism while defensive of India is never
offensive to others. Objective sympathy is elevated into positive favour for
India against the attacks on her. But generally it does not seriously injure or
distort the facts of history, for with him sentiments are always guided and
restrained by reason. Often he condemns in harsh words the follies and pitfalls
of India. But one who loves has also the right to be harsh and critical. Nehru
has achieved mystic identification with India, and through him it seems as it
were she is becoming self-conscious, introspective and critical of herself. All
this makes <i>The Discovery</i> much more than mere cultural history. Whether
it is really a discovery of India or not it is for the specialised scholars of
history and culture to decide. To us, to a general reader, it is really the
discovery of Nehru’s large, comprehensive and catholic self–the self that has
read widely, thought deeply and lost itself through love in the lives of the
oppressed millions of India. It has power and appeal which are literary in
character, and it evokes emotional response from us. Therefore it ought to be
considered as a book of literature also, and judged accordingly from its
criteria. Prof. C. D. Narasimhaiah rightly observes: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

never presumed that he was writing literature. His purpose in <i>The Discovery </i>was
to discover India for himself, and he tries to achieve it with all his power
and penetration. But while at the work of writing, the unconscious artist in
him possesses all his other faculties so completely that he instinctively
displays literary excellences. <i>The Discovery </i>cannot be classed into one
particular branch of literature. It is a formless piece written with no
literary intentions. The students of literature study it<i> </i>just as they
study Ruskin’s <i>Unto the Last </i>or Gibbon’s <i>Decline and Fall of Roman
Empire </i>or Russell’s<i> </i>or Radhakrishnan’s philosophical works, all of
which have literary appeal but are not composed with literary intentions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the articulate utterance of her vaguely felt dreams and aspirations. Only the
first half of the autobiography deals with the facts and events of his personal
life. The second half turns into the chronicle of the times and deals with the
national events and freedom struggle. It is because his individual existence
merges into the collective existence of his poverty-struck fellow-creatures
reeling under the foreign yoke. He had nothing to say about his own life. He
had much to say about the life of India. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>The Discovery </i>we find the further developing and deepening of the same
self of Nehru. Here he travels into the past to arrive at the roots of his
existence, his India, and writes what he finds from the twilight past stretched
up to the complete dark of antiquity. It is in a way an extension and
continuation of his autobiography. Only it is a more mature and more
comprehensive work than the earlier one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

first three chapters of the book are an outright autobiography. Nehru is
imprisoned in the Ahmadnagar Fort while the country is struck with famine and
the world is torn in war. In leisurely mood he rambles into the past of India
and her present, reflects on life’s philosophy and the future of democracy, and
begins writing. In the second chapter he narrates the events of his life after
his term of imprisonment at Almora in 1935, the illness and death of his wife,
his journey to Switzerland and back from there. “The Quest” the third chapter
is the real beginning of the discovery of India. Still, even here he is busy
clearing his approach of India, her appeal to him, and lapsing once more into
the stray reflections on nationalism and internationalism, his journeys and
general elections. The first three chapters thus have distinctly
autobiographical content and flavour. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
afterwards Nehru continues to be the centre and the style autobiographical. The
only unity which the book has is the unity imparted by his personality
pervading all throughout. We see his </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>vision and learn his views.
There is never a straightway developing and to the point method in Nehru’s
writings. He frequently digresses and forgets the main thread. He narrates the
past, but </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>leaps back to present drawn by a remotely
relevant thought current. He considers India, but in slow and pleasant
digression would retreat into himself and go on thinking aloud as if talking to
himself. He freely rambles now in past, now in present and dreams of the
future. He is not bothered by the sense of a unified mode of writing and therefore
does not care to avoid the irrelevant. He is aware that h</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>e
himself is more interesting to his readers than the merits of his writing.
Consequently every felt thought and emotion of Nehru finds expression in
thousand threads loosely kept together. We feel that Nehru is talking out to us
in confidence all that he knows and all that he feels. Except in the first
three chapters <i>The Discovery </i>does not relate the events of Nehru’s life.
Yet it is autobiographical for it reveals his inner existence and clears many
facets of his personality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Truth
as ultimate reality, if such there is, must be eternal, imperishable and
unchanging. But that infinite, eternal, unchanging truth cannot be apprehended
in its fullness by the finite mind of man which can only grasp, at most, some
small aspect of it limited by time and space, and by the state of development
of that mind and the prevailing ideology of the period. As the mind develops
and enlarges its scope, as ideologies change and new symbols are used to
express that truth, new aspects of it come to light though the core of it may
yet be the same. And so, truth has ever to be sought and renewed, reshaped and
developed, so that, as understood by man, it might keep in line with the growth
of his thought and the development of human life. Only then does it become a
living truth for humanity, supplying the essential need for which it craves,
and offering guidance in the present and for the future.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ignored the ultimate purposes and looked at fact alone. It made the world jump
forward with a leap, built up a glittering civilization, opened up innumerable
avenues for the growth of knowledge, and added to the power of man to such an
extent that for the first time it was possible to conceive that man could
triumph over and shape his physical environment. Yet…..there was some essential
lack and some vital element was missing. There was no knowledge of ultimate
purposes and not even an understanding of the immediate purpose, for science
had told us nothing about any purpose in life.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

simply and delightfully he is writing! Such essays have depth, but no jarring

are essays on social and economic themes too. He had thoroughly understood the
defective social set up of India and her deplorably backward economy. He had
also discovered the causes of such defects, and was anxious to change society
and advance its economy. <i>The Theory and Practice of Caste </i>is a
sociological essay, well-informed and well-studied. Here he considers the
origin and development of caste system in India from mere vocational divisions
into rigid walls dividing man from man, joint family with all its advantages
and disadvantages. <i>The Destruction of India’s Industry and the Decay of Her
Agriculture, The Economic Backwardness of India, India becomes for the First
Time a Political and Economic Appendage to Another Country, </i>etc., are the
essays on Economics. They are as technical as they are interesting, and they
display Nehru’s sound study and understanding of Indian economy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

on the lotus flower, calm and impassive, above passion and desire, beyond the
storm and strife of this world, so far away he seems, out of reach,
unattainable. Yet again we look and behind those still, unmoving features there
is a passion and an emotion, strange and more powerful than the passions and
emotions we have known. His eyes are closed, but some power of the spirit looks
out of them and a vital energy feels the frame. </span><span style='font-size:

stream of life goes on in spite of famine and war, full of its inherent
contradictions, and finding sustenance even in those contradictions and the
disasters that follow in their train. Nature renews itself and covers
yesterday’s battlefield with flowers and green grass, and the blood that was
shed feeds the soil and gives strength and colour to new life. Human beings
with their unique quality of possessing memory live on in their storied and
remembered pasts and seldom catch up to the present in ‘The worlde that neweth
every daie.” And that present slips into the past before we are hardly aware of
it……Winged victory ends in a welter of blood and mud, and out of the heavy
trials of seeming defeat the spirit emerges with new strength and wider vision.
The weak in spirit yield and are eliminated, but others carry the torch forward
and hand it to the standard bearers of tomorrow.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

same passage cast into suitable verse would have been a soft and good lyric.
But if metre is no necessity of lyric, this certainly is one. There are
innumerable such passages in <i>The Discovery </i>where sentiments mingle with
ideas and essays turn into poetry. Death in famine for example is described as
“a slow creeping thing of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>horror with nothing to redeem it, life,
merging and fading into death, with death looking out of the shrunken eyes and
withered frame while life still lingered for a while.” (ibid, P. 2) The moon is
“a reminder of the loveliness of this world, of the waxing and waning of life,
of light following darkness, of death and resurrection following each other in
interminable succession.” <span style='mso-tab-count:2'>                </span>(ibid,

<i>The Discovery </i>facts, thoughts and feelings co-exist and create a sort of
artistic harmony. Honeyed muse makes whatever Nehru writes pleasant and
interesting. He writes English with exceptional mastery, grace and ease.
Although he is a lover of words, his style does not suffer from verbosity. It
is always limpid, lucid and unaffected. Words are at his command, and he
employs them to present his sincere thought and experience in the clearest
language. He never aims at artificial glow or forced beauty of words, and is as
simple and unassuming in writing as he was in life. The famous dictum “style is
the man” is true at least in the case of Nehru. Let me sum up now in the same
note with which I started: the style together with the content makes <i>The
Discovery of India </i>in fact the discovery of Nehru’s rich and graceful
personality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

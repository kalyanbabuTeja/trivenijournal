book on Rajaji is bound to interest a host of readers, especially in view of
his great personality as well as his unbelievably alert intellect till the
last. His natural keenness of observation of both peoples and problems without
anything to cloud his vision, had all along been an asset in public life of
this country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Here,
we have from the pen of an ardent associate of his during the hectic days of
Rajaji’s Governorship of West Bengal and later his Governor-Generalship of
India, some important aspects of Rajaji’s behaviour as well as his unquenchable
interest in all life around. As a Military Secretary, the author, instead of
being merely an official aid to him, has had the advantage of becoming almost a
household member of his during his stay at the Raj Bhavan and the Rashtrapati
Bhavan in succession. Rajaji had a capacity of making anyone near him to become
normal and sensible of right behaviour under any circumstances. If author had
many occasions to enter into conversation with Rajaji and know not only his
mind but, in his turn, interpret it with a clear understanding of the inner
workings of it, the entire credit may not go so much to his own perception as
also due to Rajaji’s ready help to put the other at ease as well as engage him
in ever so many undertakings on his behalf which could have provided opportunities
for an intelligent person to draw his own inferences of his disposition and
behaviour in such circumstance. Hence, even as we start perusing this volume,
we begin to expect much of intellectual food from the rich sources of Rajaji’s
unfailing wit and humour. The author possesses an adequate readable style and
in combination with what he could jot down of Rajaji’s own words, the narrative
easily whets our appetite for more of such healthy fare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

show how meticulously Rajaji had observed the rules of right conduct and never
sought any loophole for indulging his privileges in any position he had
occupied, we have the following anecdote: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I was retiring as Governor-General some of my friends suggested that I should
ask the Government for a bigger pension; but that would have been wrong again.”

March of 1973 a symposium was held under the auspices of the Sahitya Akademi,
when the twenty languages of India were represented for the purpose of taking
stock of the quantum of literary productions in their respective languages
after the birth of Independence. The meeting was held in Bombay and papers were
read by notable writers contributing their own assessments of the quality of
the respective literatures. It is a matter for satisfaction also, that within a
year, the papers submitted at the Symposium have been printed and made
available to people interested in the results of the symposium. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar, the Vice-President of the Akademi, has prepared a

Dogri, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi,
Oriya, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu

of the writers have just started referring to the previous state of the
development in the literary output and then narrated the subsequent
achievements since Independence. Natural for some of them in their rapid survey
to have been guilty of omissions of names or authors but as one could judge
from what has been done in the literature known to him, there must be the same
fair amount of consideration of significant creative efforts mentioned in the
course of the narration of other literatures as well. Unlike some of the major
languages in which a long tradition dating from before the Christian era has
been responsible for later developments, there are infant literatures like
Dogri, Maithili and Manipuri which have been included here because of their
recognition as the main languages of Bharat during the recent decades after the
Independence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Due
weight is given to the ‘coadunating’ capacity of Bradley’s imagination which
could take an over-all view of a play without missing any detail about
characters or scenes or events dispersed in all its subordinate parts. But even
he was severely mauled by historical critics on charges that he was not aware
of the conditions of the Elizabethan theatre, the conventions followed by
dramatists and the social, political, philosophical and religious ideas of
Elizabethan age, and his detailed delineation of character became the common
ground for combined head-hunting of symbolists and historical critics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Among
Shakespearian tragedies <i>Antony and Cleopatra </i>has sex slant. Happy
valiancy of this style is said to make up for the inferiority of the theme. The
main features of this valiancy are broadly diction, syntax and different styles
of address. The major styles referred to are categorised into Roman and
Egyptian. The one is understood to be precise and scientific without over or
undertones and the other, evocative. This particularisation is far-fetched when
such modes of speech are common in any literary work where wit and sober
thought play their roles. After all diction is a part and a part is made to
explain the whole. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is
considered a tragedy of imagination and character. This play is a standing
proof that tragedy is not mere action issuing out characters. Supernatural
powers affect our lives and actions. In the case of this unhappy protagonist
vaulting ambition inspired by the witches undoes him. The promise or a crown
transforms him into a criminal. To attribute to imagination his deeper
involvement in crime is to make a mountain of a molehill. On the other hand,
imagination conjuring up horrors of the macabre deed acts as a disinfectant.
The nomenclature ‘Tragedy of Imagination’ does not hold water. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>according
to Bradley, is ‘less symbolic.’ The question, in this connection, is not less
or more symbolism. In any play or drama characters or personae are so many
symbols. Every individual for that matter represents something unique and
thereby stands for a symbol. Symbolism is omnipresent. No particular
signification attaches to it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

author advances the view that “feeling of separation is inextricably mingled

Arnold and an interpretation by Tagore of Kalidasa’s <i>Meghaduta. </i>This
concept is irrational. For instance, Savitri and Satyavan are one “continent
but not two islands in the sea of life.” There is no ‘incommonicability’ in perfect
love. Ideal love is identity. It is like self merging in Brahman. ‘Inaccessible
Banks’ of his or her ‘Manasasarovar’ are myths. Bernard Shaw’s <i>Candida </i>comes

doubt there is a sort of symbiosis between macrocosm and microcosm. Semantic
variations of nature are made much of. The whole agony of Lear arises out of
disloyal and vitiated offspring. Vices, not virtues, are limned. Exemplary
human relationships as in ‘Ramayana’ are not depicted for the exaltation of the
audience (but for Cordelia). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to Cordelia (page 122) the author states “The sense of duty or order may arise
spontaneously, but it arises after the awakening of self-regarding instincts.”
This sounds incompatible. While Rama was leaving for the forests, no ‘self-regarding
instincts’ vitiated his resolve. It is impulsive loyalty and filial love that
steeled him to face any consequence in following his father’s word given to
Kaikeyi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as ‘oblique meaning’ and Rasa, as enjoyment of a particular mental state
(Bhava) induced by a Vibhava. And it is stated that this relishing is richer
and more beautiful in that it has got contact with the human world and is
derived from the contemplation of persons and things in real life. But such
contemplation of reality shows its sordid and filthy side, and a vision of life
nobler, ideal and seamless, is denied. What poetry unfolds is not revolting
reality but ideal Vibhavas and ideal Bhavas. These have nothing to do with the
human world, they are distanced and universalized. Their apartness lies in
soothing ‘distinction’ and seeming ‘similarity’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

necessary basic thought for his <i>magnum opus </i>to expand upon. Of course
scholars are not quite sanguine yet that the Kural completely can be of an
original source and can possibly be traced to earlier influences at least.
There is a growing enthusiasm in Tamil scholars, particularly to refute all
early influences from any other source for any of the classics of which they
feel proud. Hence it may be futile controversy to go in for more and more
investigations as to the nature or origins of great works in literature, when a

James, from <i>Roderick Hudson </i>to <i>The Golden Bowl. </i>These chapters
are roughly co-extensive with the well-known three periods of James’s career.
The central chapters (2-5) which carry the burden of Krishna Rao’s thesis is to
demonstrate his thorough knowledge of the James canon, but they suffer,
unfortunately, from the weight of plot summaries which occupy nearly eighty or
the one hundred and eight pages of this book. The transitions from one novel to
another are, of course, marked by a few comments. James was not only a prolific
writer, but a novelist’s novelist. One has to sympathise with the difficulties
of an Indian doctoral candidate who has undertaken such an ambitious task. One
would wish that the author had chosen fewer novels and probed them more
intensively to the advantage of his main argument which is indeed a fascinating

reflexes of presumptuous sinfulness” (p. 2). The author’s preference for sound
occasionally shows as alliteration: “Marriage to the regenerate refined self,

volume under review seeks to present a world-view acceptable to theology and
science. In pursuing this end, it compromises with neither. The author convicts
the theological view as having failed, because its supernatural concept of God
fails to be objectively demonstrable and verifiable in experience. The author
is also critical of the scientific approach, and describes it as a failure. The
failure is attributed to the frustrations of man. The author seeks to remedy
the defects of the two approaches and erects philosophy of “Natural physical
Needs, and develops a physical world-view wherein the basic needs are connected
with a physical agency and the regulative properties thereof.” The work as a whole
differs from traditional philosophy. It is a bold attempt at the construction
of an elaborate metaphysics that seeks to reconcile human needs and scientific
findings. The considerable therapeutic value of the work lies in the simple
intellectual realisation that dualistic thinking destroys our last self-centered
refuge. (p. 94) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Cowasjee is currently engaged in writing a book on Mulk Raj Anand’s fiction.
And the opening story, “His Father’s Medals”, reveals the influence of Mulk Raj
Anand; Ramu the scavenger-boy appears as the blue print of the portrait of
Bakha in Anand’s <i>Untouchable. </i>“Another Train to Pakistan” affords in few
suggestive terms a much more vivid picture of the India-Pakistan Partition
atmosphere than Kushwant Singh’s <i>In Train to Pakistan</i>. “The Sentry” is a
story of two brothers: Sergeant Randhir Singh of <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>the<i> </i></span>Indian Army, on duty as sentry in the night,
confronts his spying brother Kuldip Singh who joined the Indian National Army
of Subhas Chandra Bose; in a moment of hesitation torn between loyalty and affection,
he is shot dead by his brother. In “The General Secretary”, Vasu Dev is the
Secretary of the workers’ union of a cotton mill, who finally realizes–‘Thinking
of you and your children, I had almost forgotten my own’–and steps down. “Staff
Only” presents the atmosphere of university staff, and resolves the quarrel
between Professor Hank and his wife Judy over having a long holiday in
Amsterdam. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sketches portray the Western world in a pleasant manner. In “Sunday on a
Soapbox”, Dr Cowasjee gives a delightful picture of the Sunday Hyde Park Corner
of London and “the people (who) assemble there for the sake of amusement,” “A
Day in Dublin” and “Dublin, Farewell” project a picture of ‘the intrinsic
poverty at the core of Dublin’s superficial gaiety’. Finally we are given a
picture of the fashionable French in “Boarding a French Vessel.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
total impression afforded by these stories and sketches is indeed satisfying.
Born and educated in India, Dr Cowasjee left for England to do his Ph. D. under
Professor Wilson Knight on “Sean O’Casey”, visited the Continent, returned to
India, and finally settled in Canada as Professor of English, which is a full
cycle. The book affords a vision of the whole vista of humanity–from the
untouchable scavengers up to the university professors and their desire-images.
Irony and humour, tragedy and comedy, pervade the stories and sketches. The
book deserves to be kept in every library for extensive reading. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

learned author dived deep into the unfathomable ocean of Sanskrit literature,
discovered a few precious gems and presented them to us in this volume which is
a collection of essays and reviews numbering seventeen in all. The book is
divided into four parts and they are entitled: (1) Hinduism and Sociology (2)
Occult Concepts in Hinduism (3) Hinduism and other disciplines and (4) The
Vedanta. The first essay brings to limelight the distinguishing features of
Hindu eugenics. The fifth and sixth essays on <i>Panchikarana </i>and Evolution
and concept <i>Pranava </i>are super excellent. The analysis of <i>Pranava </i>into
seven elements, viz., Santa, Sakti, Bindu, Bija, M. U. A. and their relation to
the seven stages of existence, <i>Bhu Bhuvar, </i>etc., and Sankaracharya’s key
for Lava Yoga with the help of Pranava are described in the fifth essay. In
addition to a historical and comparative study of the conception of <i>Pranava </i>as
found in the Upanishads, Ontological import of “Om”, and “Om” as a means of
contemplation of the Supreme Being, as a means of the knowledge of the identity
of the individual soul with the Supreme Being, and as the basis of the theory
of Sphota are also explained herein and these two essays deserve a keen study. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lies in the denial of the Reality of the external world and in the assertion of
pure idealism. But the independent ground work of the Vedanta lies in its
absolute idealism. The value of this volume is much more enhanced by Prof. G. V.

words: “He has many Names and Forms. “Referring to Sri Aurobindo, the Mother
spoke these words to somebody. They were repeated to me, almost casually by a
friend, a brother disciple, and at once they began to vibrate in my heart like
the potent words of a Mantra. They stirred me to the depths. I meditated day
after day on her words. Then, with a sudden unexpectedness these words in
conjunction with others began to form themselves into lines of rhythmic measure
and a desire arose in me to put them down in writing. In this way the first
poem came to be written– ‘O Lord of many Names and Forms!’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

book begins with a fascinating prologue, the interview of the author with Jung
and ends with an equally fascinating epilogue where she describes her Darshan
of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. In between, the pages carry a comparative
study of the philosophies of Sri Aurobindo and the German thinker Heidegger.
Both share one central concern: man’s search for being and the revelation of
that being <i>in this world</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>. </span>Both
see mankind at some major cross road and so they speak with so much urgency.
Both return to the Ancients to reinterpret and retranslate the knowledge that
has been handed down to humanity before they could move ahead on a new
knowledge and consciousness, Heidegger talks of freedom as a central necessity
for man’s life task “a participation in the revealment of what-is-as-such.” The
author says that Sri Aurobindo is even more radical in his thinking. For him
freedom is integration, wholeness, an evolutionary development which harmonizes
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual human being. The Supramental is only
the immediate goal; it brings new freedom and leads to more. The author
concludes that Sri Aurobindo does appear to have a more optimistic trend of
thought on the whole, than Heidegger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

or the praise of the great Mantra known as <i>Panchadasi, </i>is a poem of 32
verses in mellifluous Sanskrit. It describes in brief the efficacy and
greatness of that Mantra and the Goddess that it represents. Methods of contemplation
are also suggested herein. These verses are translated into and commented upon
in English. The introduction justifies the title of the book , in that it
beautifully sums up the quintessence of Srividyaa in a short compass of 26 pages.
The goal of the Saadhana of Srividya, it is stated hereint “is self-realisation.
The deity adored is the Divine Mother, Aditi of the Vedas. The Tantra conceives
the Supreme as Effulgence <i>Prakaasa. </i>When it is self-moved to manifest
something of itself there is a deliberation <i>Vimarsa </i>on itself. This
deliberation which is the precursor of all manifestation is the Supreme Goddess.....”
The Mantra, it is stated is the deity itself. “The devotee contemplates on the
Light Spiritual emanating from the feet of the Mother, the Light that courses
around him and has its play descending from high above his head.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

kind among the Indian languages, goes to him. The Andhra pradesh Sahitya

Desoddharaka, Kalaprapoorna” Kasinathuni Nageswara Rao Pantulu has been an
illustrious figure of the Telugu Renaissance. This slender but beautiful volume
is the collection of the three lectures delivered by Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry,
Sri Krovvidi Lingaraju and Sri Arudra in connection with the centenary
celebrations of the above scholar-patriot. Sri Nageswara Rao’s humanism,
patriotism, and his services to literature and arts form the themes of these
lectures respectively. Well-conceived and lucidly written these lectures bring
out the soulful, undying and eternal personality of Sri Nageswara Rao. It will
be very nice indeed if the academic bodies could make use of such lectures as
study material at the appropriate levels if only for their edification, liveliness,
force and perspecuity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sir
Edwin Arnold (1832-1904), British poet, scholar, and journalist, was born on
June 10, 1832, and educated at King’s School, Rochester; King’s College,
London; and University College; Oxford, where in 1852 he gained the Newdigate
Prize for a poem on Belshazzar’s Feast. After graduation he took to the
profession of a teacher and in 1856 he came to India as the Principal of the
Government Sanskrit College at Poona. He continued in his post for five years,
and during these years he made studies in Sanskrit language and literature and
gained first-hand knowledge of India’s life which proved so valuable when he
composed his memorable poem, ‘The Light of Asia’. In 1861 he went back to
England and joined the staff of the ‘Daily Telegraph’, with which he continued
to be associated for more than forty years. He was a brilliant journalist and
was distinguished by his range of ideas and enthusiasm for his work. But he was
best known as the poet of ‘The Light of Asia’, or ‘The Great Renunciation’
(which was first published in 1879) an Indian epic. The poem became very
popular and both lay readers and learned critics acclaimed it as a great poem.
It went through several editions in a year or two, both in England and America.
It was Sir Edwin who first brought to the people of the West the great and
colourful life of Gautama Buddha. ‘The Light of Asia’, as soon as it was
published, aroused profound interest in Buddha and Buddhism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the people of the West came to know of Lord
Buddha and his life, they were struck by the wonderful analogy between Buddha
and Christ. Perhaps this analogy, which must have been also obvious to Sir
Edwin Arnold, inspired him to write another narrative poem of which the central
figure should be Christ, as Buddha had been of the earlier. But ‘The Light of
the World’ (1891), in which this idea took shape, failed to repeat the success
attained by ‘The Light of Asia’. In his later years Arnold resided for some
time in Japan, and his third wife was a Japanese lady. In ‘Seas and Lands’
(1891) and ‘Japonica’ (1892), he gives interesting study of Japan and her life.
Arnold’s other works include ‘The Book of Good Counsels’ (1861) based on the
Sanskrit book ‘Hitopadesha’, ‘The Indian Song of Songs’ (1875) on Jayadeva’s
‘Gita Govinda’, ‘Indian Idylls’ (1883) on the ‘Mahabharata’, and also ‘The Song
Celestial’ on the ‘Bhagavadgita’. A prolific writer, a brilliant journalist and
a great poet, Arnold was awarded the title of C. S. I. in 1877 and of K.C.I.E.
in 1888. He died at the age of 72 on March 24, 1904.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>‘The Light of Asia’ is an epic on the life of Lord
Gautama Buddha. It is the first attempt of an European to understand Buddha’s
life and message and interpret the same to Western readers. And in this attempt
the poet was eminently successful. When Sir Edwin Arnold came to India as the
Principal of the Government Sanskrit College at Poona, he made extensive
studies in Sanskrit language and literature and acquired considerable
experience of India’s life and its rich heritage of ancient lore and culture.
This stood him in good stead when he interpreted the message of Love, Peace and
Truth, preached by Lord Buddha about the Middle of the 6th Century B. C. As a
poet he was pre-occupied with the life of the Great Master and realised the
very essence of Buddhism, which probably escaped the notice of the philosophers
and religious doctrinaires in their attempts at explaining and interpreting
Buddhism. Sir Edwin’s profound interest in Buddha and Buddhism was part and
parcel of his wider interest in the life of Ancient India, and, this explains
his wonderful success in revealing Buddha, the Mah, and Buddha, the Prophet,
where greater scholars and erudite historians have failed. It may be pointed
out that when the poem was first published in 1879, Oriental scholars
complained that it gave a false impression of Buddhist doctrine; and, on the
other hand, the suggested analogy between Buddha and Christ offended the taste
of some devout Christians of the West. Arnold might not have been absolutely
accurate in the details of Buddha’s Life and Doctrine but it does not take away
from the excellence of the poem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>‘The Light of Asia’, as a narrative poem, is a class
by itself,’ There are better poems, epic and narrative, in English Literature,
Milton’s epic, ‘Paradise Lost’, is more heroic in its conception and execution;
Matthew Arnold’s ‘Sohrab and Rustum’ is more powerful as a narrative poem in
its poignancy and range; but in its own sphere ‘The Light of Asia’ stands
unrivalled. The wonderful grace of diction appropriate to the serenity and
compassion of Lord Buddha, the poise and balance of life in Ancient India, with
its colourful contrast between raging warriors and meditating saints, Lave been
revealed with the unerring instinct of a poet and the unswerving sense of a
mystic. One learned critic has very aptly estimated this achievement:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“In
spite of the learned writings of Western savants, so erudite and so
painstaking, to a Buddhist there is but one book that describes his faith as he
feels </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>it, and that book is a poem and not a learned
professor’s masterpiece of research. It is to Edwin Arnold’s </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>poem,
‘The Light of Asia’, that the Buddhist turns as the only book in a Western
tongue that fittingly describes the Buddhism that he knows, not that of dry
sacred scriptures in a dead language, but the real, living Buddhism of today.
It is because Edwin Arnold imagines himself a Buddhist and with his poetic
fancy enters into a Buddhist atmosphere, that in his poem the Buddha is the
central figure, and so his work is to Buddhists a satisfactory exposition of
Buddhism.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
excellence of ‘The Light of Asia’ as a poem is two-fold. Firstly, the poet
realises in it the very Spirit of Buddha–His compassion, His love, His search
for truth–and expresses them in the course of his narration in the most
convincing and magnificent poetic style; secondly, the workmanship, the
technique, through which he builds up the wonderful mansion of the life and
message of Buddha. The art is conscious and deliberate; the conception is noble
and inspiring; equally befitting is the execution and unfolding of the great
them. In it, the life and teachings of Buddha are expounded with great wealth
of local colour and unsurpassed felicity of versification. The verses roll down
in great splendour and the cadences are varied with the variation of the theme
of his poetry, The substance and the form of poetry become one, and this is the
high water-mark of all great poetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mostly it is written in blank verse; only in the eighth book, where Buddha
delivers His Message, it is in quatrains, ‘Blank verse is a verse of 10

must not be supposed that the strength of the blank verse depends upon its
rigid regularity; very often the reverse is the case. The poet may take endless
liberties to vary his rhythm and metre to suit the theme of his poetry. Such
variations are very frequent in ‘The Light of Asia’ as in any other epic of
fame. Then there is another device by which the poet makes for continuity of
thought in blank verse. Every verse need not necessarily pause at the end of
the length syllable of the 5th foot; it may run on to the next verse with
agility and vigour. Cases of this kind of continuity by the device of run-on
verses are also frequent in ‘The Light of Asia’ and constitute great strength
and show great skill in the versification of his poem. Here is one instance from
the poem:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

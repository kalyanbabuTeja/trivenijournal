Satyanarayana, the Poet Laureate of Andhra Pradesh and winner of Jnan Pith
Award, is undoubtedly one of the greatest scholar-poets of Andhra. An
octogenerian with continuous and untiring literary activity extending over six
decades, Viswanatha Satyanarayana has had the good fortune of living with and
excelling writers of three generations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

first generation of elders are his seniors in age at least by 20 years. They
include his Gurus also. The second generation consists of contemporaries mostly
of his age with a few others. The third generation consists of writers who are
juniors to him by 20 to 40 years. These three generations represent writers of
Puranic and Prabandhic style, moderns who wrote in the same style and those of
the Bhavakavita school of poetry, and all the rest who tried to improve upon it
or revolt against it. All these writers, whether they agree or disagree with
Viswanatha, respect his unquestioned authority. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

scholarship and learning he can be classed with ancient scholar-poets. In
tradition he is in line with Nannaya, Tikkana and Srinatha, the great masters
of Telugu poetry. The ideal of his poetry is the nearest approximation to the
prayer “Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantu.” I may also add that it does not
confine itself only to man but includes all living creatures. It reminds us of
the Sanskrit benediction, “Samno astu dwipade sam tuahpade.” It can be stated
without exaggeration that he tried very literary form and excelled in it in a
unique fashion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in 1895 at Nandamuru in Krishna District, Viswanatha had his primary education
in his native place and nearby villages. He came over to Machilipatnam, the
centre of literary activity in those days, for collegiate education and became
a disciple of the great Chellapilla Venkata Sastri. Pingali and Katuri, the
twins, were senior to him by one year. He too had his own poet companion in Kodali
Anjaneyulu and some of the earlier compositions came out with the two in one
name “Satyanjaneyakavulu” and the pen-name ‘Girikumara.’ He composed ‘Andhra
paurushamu’ in 1916. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1920 Viswanatha’s fame began to take wings and gradually spread all over Andhra.
During the Non-Co-operation Movement, Viswanatha Satyanarayana gave up his
studies. He later joined the staff of the National College, Machilipatnam, and
worked there during 1921-1926. He was also closely connected with Sahiti
Samiti. Most of his lyrical works, patriotic poems and dramas, i.e., <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kinnerasani Patalu, Girikumaruni
Premagitalu, Kokilamma Pendli, Sringara Veethi, Andhra Prasasti, Nartanasala,
Anarkali </i>were composed during this period and Viswanatha by this time

his stay at Machilipatnam he came under the influence of Swami Vimalananda
Bharati and steeped himself in the study of ancient Indian learning and
tradition. He also joined hands with the late K. Ramakotiswara Rau in starting
“Triveni” in English and he himself started “Jayanti” in Telugu. He completed
his B. A. in 1927. He served for an year in the Hindu College, Machilipatnam,
and two years at Guntur in the A. C. College. During his stay at Guntur he had
an opportunity to study important Vedantic works under Swami Kalyanananda
Bharati. He also acquainted himself with some foreign literature. In 1932 he
lost his wife and job too. The agony and pain made him delve into the depths of
his own self and he became an introvert. As a consequence he recouped all his
talents and powers and surged forth as one committed to the art of sacred
poetry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

“Kavisamraat” was conferred on him. It was during 1938 that he settled in

with that scores of novels, radio plays and features critical and inflammatory
speeches that he delivered wherever invited, roused jealousy as well as
admiration in the Telugu literary world. His “Nannayagari Prasanna Katha
Kalitartha Yukti” struck a new path in the realm of literary criticism. By this
time Ayodhyakanda was also completed. As a result he stood aloft as a pillar of
traditional poetry. Many writers, young and old, earnestly solicited his
opinion on and forewords to their much-Cherished literary compositions. The
opinions he expressed and the forewords he wrote stand out as masterpieces of
criticism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

were published. In 1956, his Shashtipurti was celebrated. In 1958 he became a
member of the A. P. Legislative Council. He served as the Principal of the
Karimnagar College during 1959-’61. During 1960-’62 he not only completed
Yuddhakanda but also composed ten Satakas in a rare metre, Madhyakkara. He
wrote a dozen novels in the series “Puranavaira Granthamala” and many more
critical appreciations like “Allasanivani allika jigibigi”, etc. During
1960-’62 a storm broke out vehemently criticising his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

1970 and the Central Sahitya Akademi honoured him with a fellowship. By the
translation of his “Veyipadagalu” into Hindi by Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, the
Indian literary world was able to get a real glimpse of this literary giant. In
1971 his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ramayana Kalpavrikshamu </i>won
the Jnan Pith Award and during the tame year the Andhra Pradesh Government
appointed him Poet Laureate. Some of the works which he wrote during this

Bharati for Upanishad Bhashyas, Swami Vimalananda Bharati for Vedanta
Pancadasi, Sanskrit Kavyas and dramas, Jandhyala Subrahmanya Sastri for
Dhvanyaloka and other rhetorical works. He also studied the Vedas under Kuppa
Lakshmaavadhani. Under such eminent preceptors and teachers he learnt the
ancient Indian lore and realised his brilliant self which formed the bedrock for

thought created in him a new outlook of socialism with a deep and devout faith

almost shaken to its foundations as a result of the onslaught of Western ideas

Satyanarayana who left his mortal coil on Oct. 18, 1977, has immortalised
Telugu literature by his mighty contribution in all its vibrant branches. It is
very difficult to assess his output and achievements qualitatively and
quantitatively in a brief essay like this. Any literary critic gets wrapped in
awe and amazement to find that the mastermind poet and great writer Viswanatha
could bequeath such vast literature in one span of life which is beyond the
comprehension of many a calculated critic of pure academics. It seems

Tough yet delicate, stiff yet mellifluous, artistic and replete with Rasa and
Dhwani, this Mahakavya is a rare work of art not only in Telugu but also in
many languages. It will last as long as mountains stand and rivers flow. And it
will last as long as there are enlightened elite who can comprehend and rejoice
the grandeur of a language and the highlights in its poetry. As the poet
himself has said, “It is full of ambrosial pourings with many an artistic trend
of story-telling, fragrant with pious and aesthetic thoughts. It is a piece of
art that rubbed my heart with Srirama and Siva.” This Mahakavya alone is
suffice to place Viswanatha among the galaxy of world poets and it has already
served for the attainment of his salvation. This was the chosen path for great
poets like Tikkana and Potana for the attainment of their salvation also. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

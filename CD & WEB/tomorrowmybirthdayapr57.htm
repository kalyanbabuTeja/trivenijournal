far back into the cushions of his luxurious car, ‘Paramita’ looked at the tree
tops that were flying backwards, the sky slit into fragments by those tree tops
and the bits of white cloud deep inside the sky that moved motionlessly along
with his car. It was not exactly them he was looking at. He was trying to probe
into them to locate some formless forms, whose contours had almost disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was a time when he fought shy of the name ‘Paramita’, a name by which his
disciples referred to him both on the platform and in the press, in those days
when he started interpreting the mind and the teachings of the Great Buddha,
having drunk deep at the fountain of that wisdom. He thought that pen-names
were a little pompous and in bad taste. But the name was associated with his
achievements and his fame during a whole decade and when he published his
essays in a book form he put down the name of the author as ‘Paramita’. His
disciples were pleasantly surprised and even a little intrigued. Some of them
motivated by mischievous curiosity asked him why he accepted that name. He
replied, with a benevolent smile that however great a man was, he had to bow
down before the weight of public opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

among the bits of white cloud, there emerged a form, rare and fascinating, and
stood before his mind’s eye. It was the form of his cousin Ramadevi, when she
was young and full of vitality. The golden yellow complexion of the ripe betel
leaf, the hair parted above her left eyebrow where the tender hair curled into
a spiral like a small whirlpool, the plaited hair with the dark blue sheen
reaching almost her knees and lifted by the ample curve beneath the small of
her back, the large innocent looking eyes with the dark eyebrows and the lovely
squint, all were there as clearly as if she were there in flesh and blood. He
felt he could touch her if he stretched his hand. She had a knack of smiling
with the squint of her eyes, and you felt as if you were enveloped in a cool
bracing summer shower. But it was difficult to know for whom the shower was
meant on account of the squint. He had a suspicion that even at that early age,
she realised the possibilities of that squint and that she deliberately made
use of it purely for fun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was now in her early fifties. She had five or six children. Her hair turned
grey. Even the eyebrows were spotted with grey. Now she parted her hair in the
middle. But the permanent curl above the left eyebrow was still there, as
though it symbolised some unchanging trait in her character. The squint also
was there, lovely but confusing as of old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grand scale. He once again had to bow down before the weight of public opinion
and accept the invitation. He would be seated on a pedestal, like the duplicate
image of God used on ceremonial occasions, and there would be long speeches in
his praise, full of meaningless commonplaces. He closed his eyes in acute
discomfort at the thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

always did what he was told to do, and never asked for any explanations. That
was why, he struck to Chenchiah for over twenty years. Servants were replaced,
cooks were replaced. Even friends did not endure long. The unmitigated monotony
of constancy tired him. He could not stand even his own house, not to mention
his own village for any length of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you never loved any one? Why were you not married?–a disciple had asked him
once. I would have gone mad looking at the same face day in and day out for so
many years–he had replied. His disciples felt free to put him any question they
liked, he put them so much at their ease and there was nothing formal in his
relationship with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so, he never thought of replacing Chenchiah. Whatever you told him, Chenchiah’s
face never showed any reaction. He merely did what he was told to do. Chenchiah
knew many of his secrets. Many foolish things had happened in this back seat of
the car. There were occasions when he made an utter fool of himself over others
and others made themselves fools over him. But Chenchiah never gave an
indication even by a look that he knew those things happened. But Chenchiah was
neither dull witted nor stupid. His was the immobility of a sharp and
intelligent mind. There was something in Chenchiah that was akin to the essence
of Buddhism–the ‘Paramita’–a state of being which knows all, but transcending,
knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I will be completing sixty years. I have not lived in vain. I have given so
much to the world. I have cut my heart into bits and presented them to the world
in the form of my writings; I have suffered, that the world might be happy. I
have borne the burden of the world’s sorrows and its unfulfilled desires, that
the world might live a fuller life. I know the world, but the world does not
know me. It only knows my name and it raises memorials to that name. It does
not know there is ‘me’, apart from the name. That other ‘I’ is crushed and
sapped dry under the weight of the world’s miseries. It is out of untold
suffering that all art emerges, but it gives the world only happiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and her husband were in the back seat of the car happily discussing
commonplaces, hurling childish jokes at each other. Yes. People who live by
money-lending never grow up with their age. Rama’s temperament was also that of
a money-lender. When he read his poems to her, she always laughed. She liked
good food, good clothing, and glittering jewels. The land of the Moon and the
garden of Indra simply did not exist for her. In a way, she was happily
married. Her husband also had similar tastes and temperament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

could not find a satisfactory answer to that question till Rama was married to
her present husband. Strange, that Rama, who knew about this unanswered
question, never even casually referred to it when they were alone. Had she so
much as set the ball rolling, he would have laid bare his heart to her. But she
merely sat on the roof beside him crunching tamarinds and salt under her teeth.
On the day of the marriage he suffered agonies, and, till the last moment, was
hoping that some miracle would stop the marriage. That night he had many
dreams, all about the marriage being stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would have sat at the moneylender’s table, making elaborate calculations, would

present to the world the ‘Prajna Paramita’? Who would be there to become the
teacher of this huge land of disciples? Art demands the unqualified surrender
of its devotee. It accepts the sacrifice of his all or nothing. The artist
annihilates himself and gives the world eternal happiness. A thousand Ramas
cannot equal a poem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

people like to travel often. I too like travelling; but is it enough to possess
the liking alone? Possibilities should also be there–and I lack only such
possibilities. But who on earth is worried about my possibilities? A Postcard
or an invitation comes to my house. I may not be having money at hand, casual
leave won’t be here, or some one in the family would not be well–all these
difficulties of mine will not serve as genuine causes for them. Whatever might
be the conditions, some bus or train should be emboarded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The train which should
reach the Central Station exactly by daybreak was late by two hours that day. I
got down from the train at eight O’clock. I never knew the fact before I got
down in the central, that Madras has not seen either sunrise or sunset for four
or five days. The sky was awfully dark. I waited for a while with the hope that
the drizzling would stop. But soon, it turned to be a heavy downpour. To the
vocal music of the rain, the zinc sheets of the roof over my head provided the
instrumental. The buses on the road never ceased to run. But how to imagine
them to be buses? They were reminding the submarines. To go and stand at the
bus-stop, the rain should give way. There was utterly no sign of such a
possibility. I got into a taxi and told ‘Rayapuram.’ The taxi moved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In Madras, rain has many
postures. It falls beautifully over mansions; fearfully over huts,
threateningly over workshops and rhythmically in streets. Only Madras rain can
have all those styles. On the way the taxi driver asked, “Tell me exactly Sir,
is it Rayapuram or Royapettah?” I told “Rayapuram” after verifying that the
slip of paper in my pocket agreed with my memory. Taxis in Madras are but the
hunting dogs or a forest in identifying your destination! Yet the taxi in which
I sat, could not escape some difficulty in spotting my destination.
‘North-Eastern Shrine Garden’ is a new name for the people of that locality. It
was familiar there, only as the ‘obsequies garden.’ When we reached there, the
watchman told, “People come here only for obsequies rites, but for all other
purposes like food, etc., they arrange in that choultry.” He directed us to the
choultry away in the third or fourth street. I reached the choultry in the same
taxi. As their house could not provide enough space for all, my relatives have
arranged in the choultry. Soon they all started in batches to the ‘obsequies
garden’ telling that by the time they come back, the food would be ready to be
served. By the time they finished all the rites of the obsequies by invoking
the name of the departed soul it was nearly two O’clock in the afternoon. By
half past three, the food was served in the choultry. After finishing my meal,
I went outside, as there was heavy noise in the choultry. When I returned, to
my surprise, I found the choultry empty! I could see only the servant who was
watching the building “Babu, all the relatives have gone. Only this bag is left
here. Please see whether it is yours” he said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I liked very much the
courtesy of my relatives. They relieved me from the trouble of getting their
permission and other formalities for my departure. I am now my own master, and
the city of Madras anyhow is there. Very rarely it happens to me to go over to
a city like this. Why should I make the return journey immediately? I can stay
and go only tomorrow. Are there not pavements? Can’t I get a bench in a park?
Are there no theatres? Even if the theatres are closed, won’t the railway stations
be awake? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

my thoughts. The damp weather with the mild sunshine was quite enjoyable. The
people of Madras were making their vehicles, roads and shops to the maximum use
as they could see sunlight after four or five days. I don’t know<i> </i>precisely
how much I walked aimlessly. It was getting dark. My legs were also paining. I
felt like taking rest somewhere. I stood on the pavement near a hotel looking
at the old books spread for sale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

too such a big gentleman! His hair was quite long and curly. In a dark long
coat he appeared as the French Governor, Dupleix. From a black pipe in between
his lips, he was leaving smoke in a gentle manner. Leaning on a nearby long
car, he was standing in an august way. How can I believe that such a gentleman
would call me? But when I could hear and see with my own ears and eyes how can
I be without believing? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The broad streets in Madras, and the huge mass of
population floating up and down furnished a feast to my eyes. It appears that
the people here are well-trained to deceive the villagers who once in a way
make visits. My thoughts were like the horses, let-off. The detective stories
full of murders, plots and counterplots came to my mind. What I could not
understand is, why he should wait for twenty-five long years exactly for a man
like me? What for I am discovered by him today? The Arabian Nights’ story in
which Aladin was caught by the magician appeared before my eyes. I thought a
while ‘to go or not to go?’ </p>

twelve or thirteen in age. More than indigenous, western features were
strikingly visible in them. The middle-aged lady who sat in the centre of them,
called “Jacob, Jacob” raising her voice. A dark-complexioned boy appeared in
response, in the verandah, but suddenly disappeared into the house. Within
minutes a bit light was put on, at the top of the house. A window in the first

so overwhelmed at the formalities of my host that I have forgotten even to
observe well the room where we sat. I noticed few shelves close to the walls

slowly-burning scented sticks filled the room with sweet smell. Mr. A. J.
Devabandhu who appeared to me as Count of Monte Christo, was sitting on the

leading their lives without even the proper oil-lamps. Till recently the

polled only nine votes in his own ward! The scales of values are tilted. No one

sternly before me and appeared as the incarnation of truth. Holding his breath,

came to this Madras, and how I faced the difficulties in the streets of this
city–all that I don’t want to tell you now. To reach the top of the tree was my
aim. I could attempt to climb with the help of<i> </i>a rope. But the rope was
cut off. If I fall, I will break my bones. I have decided to crawl downwards

my mind went towards the change of religion. Conversion is a peculiar thing.
The body<i> </i>is not converted by this; nor the soul. All that we do is to shed
one particular society and try to live in a different society. In mental and
physical features, no great differences arc found between the two. Only in the
outward practices we find certain differences in the modes of life. What did I
lose if I develop new modes and customs of life? I was thoroughly prepared for
it. The new society provided me with enough means to study. Within five or six
years, I got my degree. I was not satisfied with it. During my childhood days,
Hari Rao used to tell a poem, “An intelligent man is like a rubber ball. Even
if you hit the ball down, it will rise up, a dullard is like a mass of mud.
Once you hit it down, it will cling to the ground only.” Am I a ball or a mass
of mud? I never wanted to rest till I succeeded in testing myself. I could get
a scholarship donated by a big educational institution. I went to England. I
studied there, and also worked. Before I completed eight years of service, I
got married. Margaret, my wife, is much devoted. I am blessed with children and
they are all well. The British rule was then still in our country. When I
returned, a big post was waiting for me and I spent nearly twenty years in
North India. When I attained the age of retirement, I have decided to live the
rest of my days in this city which showed me the light to the path of<i> </i>my
life. This house is mine. The one you have seen in the lawn is my family and
this which I narrate and end is my life history.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sitting on the cot after waking up in the open yard at Chintalapalli. But in
their view now, I am a run-out, idli-seller or a bus-stand cooly. Yet my soul
goes away often to roam about in Chintalapalli and its surroundings. The swing
tied to the huge stone pillars in front of Virupaksha temple, the gauva fruits
in the garden of Dalavayi Narasanna, the sugarcane in Veera Reddy’s field, the
lotus flowers in the Anantaraya tank–all these come to my memory. I feel as if
all those people move before my eyes. In whatever I travel, wherever I go, my
looks appear to be searching for somebody. Why so much, Rajasekharam! Today
when I saw you, I could see the features of Seshadri in you. I thought the same
Seshadri stood before me! I held big positions, I travelled widely and earned a
lot. To tell you in short, I have enjoyed all the happiness that life could
provide. But in the heart of hearts I have a great desire–the only desire. Do
you know what it is, Rajasekharam!…..Before I close my voyage of this life...to
come to Chintalapalli once, to make a small pond in the river Chintaleru and to
drink away its water to my heart’s content. This is the only desire I have.…I
don’t know whether this will be fulfilled or not…..” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

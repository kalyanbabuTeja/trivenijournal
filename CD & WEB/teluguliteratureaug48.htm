mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>IT was on the banks of the Godavari and at the
Court of the East Chalukyan monarch Raja Raja or Raja-Mahendra that the first
great classic in Telugu–the <i>Andhra Mahabharatamu </i>of Nannaya
Bhattaraka–was composed. That was a thousand years ago. By a strange destiny,
the modern age in Telugu literature began at the same dear spot in the eighties
of the last century, with Viresalingam, Lakshminarasimham, and Vasuraya Kavi.
The light they then lighted at Rajahmundry, today illumines the farthest
corners of Andhradesa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The age produced other giants like Vedam
Venkataraya Sastri of Nellore, the twin poets Tirupati Sastri and Venkata
Sastri of Masulipatam, and Gurazada Appa Rao of Vizianagaram. These heralded
the dawn of a new era. Viresalingam shaped modern Telugu prose and wrote the
earliest novels, critical essays, and biographies. He paved the way for
Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham, Komarraju Lakshmana Rao, Chilukuri Virabhadra
Rao, Vunnava Lakshminarayana, and Mallampalli Somasekhara Sarma. Gurazada Appa
Rao was the forerunner of the great song writers of our day,–Basavaraju Appa
Rao who is no more, Nanduri Subba Rao, and Adivi Bapiraju. Tirupati Venkata
Kavulu rescued Telugu poetry from the decadent classicism of the early
nineteenth century; they brought the Muse from out of the courts of chieftains
and the coteries of pandits to the newly awakened population of Andhra. And
they made possible the lyrical outburst of Battiprolu Subba Rao, D. V. Krishna
Sastri, Visvanatha Satyanarayana. Pingali Lakshmikantam, and Katuri
Venkateswara Rao. The last two are twin-souls and twin-poets like their gurus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The impact of the nationalist movement of 1905 and,
with it, the influence of Bengali literature as represented by Bankim Chandra
and Rabindranath, was felt much earlier by the Telugus than by the other
peoples of South India. While the earlier generation of Viresalingam was
brought up on the English literature of the 17th to the 19th centuries and
occasionally turned to the Sanskrit classics for inspiration, the generation of
Rayaprolu Subba Rao was profoundly influenced by European literature of the
19th and early 20th centuries and by the outstanding achievements of the
Bengali writers. The younger generation of Srirangam Srinivasa Rao and
Rukmininadha Sastri turned to the post-war literature of Russia and the current
movements of impressionism and surrealism. But the remarkable fact about all
the writers of all these generations is their scholarship in Sanskrit and
Telugu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The young men who were at college during the first
world war produced their best work between 1912 and 1932. These two decades in
our literary history may be likened to the age of Pericles in Athens, of
Elizabeth in England, and of Bhoja and Krishnadevaraya in India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I shall endeavour to justify this claim by
referring to different branches of creative literary effort like lyrical
poetry, romantic song, the novel, the short story, and the drama. All these are
comparatively recent developments in Telugu as in other Indian literatures. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The outpouring of devotion to the Lord by the
Bhaktas of the epics and of the Satakas (centuries of verse), indicates the
nearest approach to subjective poetry. But the personality of the poet rarely
obtrudes on the reader’s attention in classic Indian poetry, whether in
Sanskrit or in the other Indian languages. An expression of the poet’s joys and
sorrows, and of his personal reactions to the movements of thought and emotion
around him, represents a new phase in our literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The quest of a human Beloved, who is at once the
perfection of loveliness and the guiding star of the lonely pilgrim to the
shrine of Love, was the main pre-occupation of these new poets. To them, woman
is an ethereal being; she is akin to a streak of lightning, the dewy dawn, or
the white foam dancing on the waves of the ocean. By their idealisation of the
object of love, and their haunting descriptions of the graces of her mind and
soul more than the charms of the fleshy frame, they raised Telugu poetry to
sublime heights. Platonic love is the theme of Rayaprolu Subba Rao’s <i>Trinakankanam
</i>and <i>Swapna Kumaram</i>. The intense longing for a supremely fair denizen
of heaven on the part of a lowly earth-born lover, and the agony born of
despair, form the dominant note of Krishna Sastri’s <i>Urvasi </i>and other
lyrics. The desire for a union of kindred minds and kindred souls is reflected
in Sivasankara Sastri’s Hridayeswari. In <i>Deepavali</i>, Vedula Satyanarayana
Sastri makes a grim resolve to pursue to the uttermost ‘this pilgrimage across
the ocean of love.’ Nayani Subba Rao fears that his frail bark might go to
pieces in midstream; but then, the planks will serve for his funeral pyre.
Almost alone of this group of lover-poets, Nayani ends on a note of triumph.
His love is fulfilled, and at long last, he succeeds in ‘linking heaven and
earth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Rayaprolu Subba Rao was the leader of this group of
poets. But it was Sivasankara Sastri, the founder of the Sahiti Samiti, who
drew these and many more into a literary fellowship, like the later Ravi Kiran
mandal of Maharashtra and the Geleyara Gumpu of Karnataka. Scholar in Sanskrit
and a keen student of contemporary English literature and the literatures of
three or four Indian languages, Sivasankara sastri became the ‘Anna Garu’–elder
brother–of the poets, short story writers, and literary essayists of Andhra.
The movement in favour of the spoken Telugu as the medium of literary
expression was sponsored by Gidugu Ramamurti Pantulu, but the Sahiti Samiti
brought success to the movement by their adoption of this newly forged
instrument. Whatever of enduring worth was produced in verse, song, and prose
for a quarter of a century preceding the second world war must be set down to
the credit of these gifted members of the samiti and their admirers and
followers. You cannot brush them aside as ‘escapists’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Then there were those who could write verse, but
preferred song. It seems but as yesterday–in sober fact, it was over thirty
years ago–that the cousins Basavaraju Appa Rao and Nanduri Subba Rao were in
the Law College and the Christian College in Madras. They were madly in love
with the songs of Gurazada Appa Rao, and sang them with feeling. They soon
started singing their own songs to small groups of eager fellow-students, and
moved them to tears. The <i>Selayeti Gaanamu </i>(Song of the Rill) of Appa Rao
and the <i>Yenki Paatalu </i>of Subba Rao took the public by storm. Today these
songs are on everybody’s lips. Appa Rao urged that one should pass through
sorrow so that ‘the heart might become tender’ and ‘the sense of ego wiped
out.’ Subba Rao’s rural lovers, Yenki and Naidu Bava, are as soft and gentle,
or as passionate and devoted as any hero and heroine of princely romances. For,
when the lover accosts her with the simple query, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

latterly won distinction through his short stories and novels. He was
influenced not by Gurazada Appa Rao but by Oswald Couldrey, Principal of the
Government College at Rajahmundry. The companionship of this cultured
Englishman who himself painted and wrote verse and short story, was a
beneficent influence in the lives of Bapiraju, Kavikondala Venkata Rao, Damerla
Rama Rao, the artist, and other youths of that period Mr. Couldrey is to modern
Andhra what C. P. Brown of the Civil Service was to the Andhradesa of a hundred
years ago. While Bapiraju’s genius is versatile, his characteristic mode of
expression is the song, vibrant with emotion and lifting the listener to high
altitudes, even like the river Godavari which, in a song of his, ‘shoots up to
the skies.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Viswanatha Satyanarayana in his <i>Kokilamma Pendli
</i>(the Bridal of the Koil) and <i>Kinnara Sani </i>made song the vehicle of
romantic and descriptive tales of nature in her tender moods, as Duvvuri Rami
Reddi employed elegant verse. Among the makers of the renaissance in Andhra,
Viswanatha takes a lofty place. He has experimented nearly every form of
literary expression,–classical verse, romantic song, the drama, the novel, the
short story, and the literary essay. In everyone of these forms he has achieved
eminence, and he is now writing an epic with the story of Rama for his theme.
There is richness and vigour allied to ruggedness in his writing which entitles
him to a place apart. Bapiraju and Satyanarayana have run a close race in the
affections of the Andhras, and, curiously enough, even the Andhra University
had to split a prize for a novel between Satyanarayana’s <i>Veyi Padagalu </i>(The
Thousand Hoods) and Bapiraju’s <i>Narayana Rao</i>. Within recent years, these
two are the outstanding novelists, coming in direct succession after Vunnava
Lakshmi Narayana whose <i>Malapalli </i>is the classic of the Gandhian

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The short story in Telugu, in its modern form of a
portrayal of contemporary life, owes its origin to Gurazada Appa Rao, but its
development in recent years is due to a band of writers headed by Chinta
Dikshitulu. His stories, in their sympathetic interpretation of common men and
women, and their gentle humour, are very much like those of Masti Venkatesa
Iyengar of Karnataka. Munimanikyam Narasimha Rao is a master of the simple
story which depicts domestic life in middle class families. Gudipati
Venkatachalam writes with great power about the indignity suffered by woman. He
is a believer in stark realism, particularly in his treatment of sex. He
sometimes mistakes actualism for realism, and fills his stories with details
which mar the artistic effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

But, so far, we have not had a play comparable to Gurazada Appa Rao’s <i>Kanya

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In the period of fifteen years since 1933, there
has been a perceptible swing to Leftism in Telugu literature. Srirangam
Srinivasa Rao led a revolt against the Romantic Movement, which commenced with
Rayaprolu Subba Rao. A new world is in the making, according to Srinivasa
Rao,–a world in which blood and toil must lead to the vindication of the rights
of the worker in field and factory. There is no sense in celebrating the glory
of the Taj Mahal; think rather of the sweated labour that made the Taj
possible. Soft sentiment and the enraptured worship of nature in her beautiful
moods can no longer form the theme of literature. The new group is influenced
in a large measure by the impressionists and surrealists of the West, and seeks
to break away from conventional verse-forms, including the <i>gita </i>metre
employed by the romantics. Free-verse is their favourite medium, and oftentimes
prose just run mad. In the short story, the one-act play, and literary
journalism, the emphasis is on propaganda for leftist thought. The prevailing
economic discontent, and the disillusionment following on the emergence of
political freedom, are to be canalized for the class-war that is ahead of us.
But alongside of these are others like Mallavarapu Visveswara Rao and Pilaka
Ganapati Sastri who are wedded to the Rayaprolu-Krishna Sastri tradition. Buchi
Sundara Rama Sastri, author of <i>Panchavati</i>, is a direct disciple of Sri
Venkata Sastri and a poet of devotion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The literature of knowledge, as distinguished from
the literature of power, has made great headway in Telugu. Books on politics
science, sociology, economics and history, have attained a high standard. The
works on history, especially those of Bhavaraju Krishna Rao and Somasekhara
Sarma, deserve to rank as literature. The autobiography of Sri Prakasam is a
moving human document,–the revelation of a great personality. The style is
simple, vigorous, and arresting. High-class journalism has been a great source
of encouragement to aspiring writers in Telugu. Several periodicals have
published creative writing, which later appeared as volumes of verse, story,
and song. The greatest of Andhra journalists, the late Sri Mutnuri Krishna Rao
of the <i>Krishna Patrika</i>, wrote splendid prose. His essays on literature,
philosophy, and art are collected in <i>Samiksha</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Telugu is a great and growing literature. The
perfect blending of Sanskrit with the native Telugu words invests it with the
sweetness and beauty which made Tyagaraja’s songs world-famous. When the
history of the literatures of the principal Indian languages, through many
centuries of striving and achievement, comes to be written, Telugu will
assuredly hold a high place. The continuity of literary tradition from the age
of Nannaya to our own has not been broken. One other Indian literuture which is
twin to Telugu is Kannada.</p>

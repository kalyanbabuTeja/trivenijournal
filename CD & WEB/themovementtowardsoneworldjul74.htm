in the context, means the world as a geophysical unit and also the people in
the world. Though physically it is one unit, the people divided it into many
sub-units and called them nations. The compound word “one-world” therefore
means the reunion of the nations into one unit and the recognition that all the
people, the occupants of the world, are one. Indeed the emphasis in the said
concept is more on the unity of the people than on the oneness of the physical
world, as it is factually one. Oneness does not necessarily mean a unitary
State. The expression takes in unitary State, federation, confederation and
other variations of the said concepts. It may even comprehend, as a necessary
step towards a closer union, any relationship under bilateral or multilateral
conventions or agreements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a social animal. By instinct and intuition he moves towards unity. History
records the direction of the movement through different stages of social
environment–family, tribe, state, nation and world. The destination and
direction are clear, though there were ups and downs, and though sometimes
there was a temporary retracing of the steps only to go forward again. The
great seer Sri Aurobindo has described this inexorable forward direction thus:
“Nature moves forward always, in the midst of all tumblings and secures her
aims in the end, more often in spite of man’s imperfect mentality than its means.”

parochialism, nationalism, power politics, religious and racial differences,
economic inequalities, conflicting ideologies, unwillingness of the States to
give up even a little of their sovereignty to international organs are some of
the obstacles to progress towards world union. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Notwithstanding
such obstacles, in the wake of the termination of the First World War, an
international clearing house, in the shape of the League of Nations, with its
concomitant judicial and executive institutions was established, but because of
the recalcitrant attitude of some of its influential members, it ended in a
failure. After the Second World War with a stronger determination to make it a
success, engendered by the compelling needs of the holocaust of war, the United
Nations came into being. It was organised under the United Nations Charter. The
three-fold purpose of the United Nations Charter was to maintain peace in the
world, to preserve, protect and promote human rights and to help the social and
economic development of the backward Countries. The Charter created a number of
institutions–the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Secretariat headed
by the Secretary-General, the International Court of Justice. In addition the
United Nations created other institutions–The Economic and Social Council, The
Trusteeship Council, the Commission on Human Rights, etc. The purpose of the
Economic and Social Council is to implement the recommendations of the Assembly
on Economic, Social and other humanitarian questions and also to submit recommendations
on its own initiative. It is also empowered to enter into agreement with the
specialised agencies of the United Nations. In its turn it set up a number of
functional commissions. The important <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>ones<i>
</i></span>are 1. Economic Commission for Europe 2. Economic Commission for
Asia and Far East 3. International Commodity Trade Market and 4. International
Labour Organisation. The Commission on Human Rights prepared a draft of the
universal declaration of the Human Rights on December 10, 1948. The United
Nations adopted the same as a common standard of achievement for all the people
and for all the nations. After 20 years of wrangling between the two power
blocks the Commission produced two international covenants on Human Rights–one
for civil and political rights and the other for social and economic rights.
Even these covenants have not evolved any effective machinery for enforcing the
said rights. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Broadly
stated the United Nations General Assembly corresponds to the Legislature, the
Security Council to the Executive, the Department of the Secretary-General to
the Secretariat and the International Council of Justice to the Judiciary of a
national State. The approximation is only in name and not in substance, though
the potentiality for evolution is there. In practice the General Assembly
operates by and large as a debating society. Every nation big or small, rich or
poor can have its say. Sometimes the deliberations are embarrassing to the
great powers. It helps not only to air their differences, not only to focus on
the great injustices of the world, but also to create international public
opinion. The Security Council has become a divided house. The exercise of the
veto by the great powers reduced it to the position that, if great powers
agreed, it could interfere to restore peace, If they differed, it could not
move in the matter. So the exercise of veto power shifted the responsibility to
the great powers to maintain peace throughout the world. This has replaced
objective appraisal by power politics. The recent induction of Communist China
into United Nations has now introduced a new dimension to the conflict of great
powers. Even so, the Security Council prevented millions of wars <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>and<i> </i></span>restored peace in Korea,
Congo, Greece, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But
in economic and social sphere, it has done very good work. The United Nations
agencies have been helping the developing and backward nations considerably in
the field of economic growth, social regeneration and health amelioration. To
say all these is not to deny or decry the work of the United Nations. It has
great potentialities. It may in fullness of time evolve into a world
Government. But the time is not ripe to such an eventuality. I shudder to think
of a World Government at present; one can imagine such a Government being headed
by perverted personalities like Hitler or Stalin or such others. With the aid
of the modern science and technology he may condition the mind of the people
and make the world a great prison. One-world, at present, may turn out to be
one prison. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
long and sustained preparation is a necessary condition for a World Government.
During that period, a concerted attempt shall be made to change the quality of
man. Man shall acquire the perspective of a world citizen. This can be achieved
by the acceptance and inculcation of three concepts–1. Universality of Science;
2. Universality of Religion and 3. Universality of Freedoms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
over-emphasis on materialism has already created in developed countries not
only a permissive society, but also ecological problems. With co-operation and
sense of humanism, there is a reasonable prospect of science and technology
overtaking the backward and developing countries and helping them towards the
pursuit of scientific materialism. Though this development is necessary for
raising the material standards of the world population, unless it is tempered
by spiritualism, there is a danger of lopsided development. Scientific
materialism satisfied human desires. The satisfaction of human desires creates
further desires which in their turn demand further satisfaction. This is a
never-ending process which ultimately leads to discontent and demoralization.
So, though the concept of universality of science is a meritorious and much
desirable one, it shall be tempered by spiritualism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
second concept is the universality of the religion. Universality of religion
does not mean one universal religion. It means not only tolerance of religious
diversity but mutual respect to each others religion. This attitude towards
religion in <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>the Indian context may be
described in popular parlance as “secularism.” Religion is a faith in God or
some divine principle governing </span>universe. It is a faith in reality
experienced by great prophets and disclosed in different scriptures. A study of
the different scriptures will indicate that the fundamental principles of all
religions are the same or similar and that they differ only in ritualistic
garbs in which they are clothed or the practices they follow, having regard to
the environmental conditions in which they function. Briefly stated all
religions believe in God or some universal principle; all religions believe in
salvation, which is given different names, such as heaven, Mukti, Nirvana,
etc., all religions lay down the pathway or Sadhana to achieve salvation; all
religions prescribe rules of ethical conduct to purify the mind in order to
pursue the pathway laid down; all religions place before their votaries high
values of life. All religions therefore emphasise on the self-realisation of
man through various connected disciplines. But unfortunately fanaticism,
obscurantism, ignorance and politicalization of religion are separating the
religions, and creating conflicts between them. All the religious leaders
should realise their common enemy is atheism engendered by materialistic
philosophy. United they will survive divided they will succumb. It is therefore
high time for all religious leaders to make a concerted attempt to rationalise
their respective religions and maintain a continuous dialogue among themselves
to ward off the common danger. This must be done at various levels–home,
school, college, religious conferences and media of public opinion. At all
these focus points, a sincere and sustained attempt shall be made to inculcate
the principles of various religions with an emphasis on the fundamental unity
underlying all the religions and on the concept of the tolerance of religious
diversity. Secularism, in my view, really means the spirit of tolerance or
cosmopolitanism; it means spiritualism, neither fanaticism, nor atheism; it
means that every man has the freedom of conscience–personal and corporate; it
means not only tolerance of religious diversity but mutual respect. This
doctrine if seriously implemented, will not only change the quality of life but
will spiritualise the material activities; it affords a moral background to man
in his pursuit of worldly affairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
cannot be one world if several grades of freedom prevail in different parts of
the world ranging from near slavery to absolute freedom. It is therefore
necessary that freedom should be secured to the citizens of every State before
one could think of a one-world or one World Government. Broadly stated, the
expression freedom means freedom for every individual to live like a human
being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Freedom’s are described
as human rights. They are not the rights of a rich man but the rights of a man
wherever he lives. It is the right of a man to live, to dream and to develop
his personality physically, intellectually and spirituality. As freedom is the
right of all people, the concept of equality is implicit in it. If all people
are free, all are equally free. The laws of social control are nothing more
than maintaining the balance between the freedoms of different people. To put
it in other words, they reconcile the two doctrines, liberty and equality. All
should equally enjoy the freedoms. Universality of freedom, therefore, may be
defined as the right of man, irrespective of his race, religion, language,
habitation, etc., to life, liberty, equality, property, justice and generally
to human happiness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Different jurists
categorise the said freedoms in different terminology, though their effect is
the same–political, social and economic; physical, intellectual and spiritual;
liberty, equality and security; fundamental rights and directive principles;
rights and duties; means and ends; fundamental freedoms. Howsoever they are
described, whatever different terminology may have been used, they convey the
idea that a man is a unit of value and not a slave of the State and that the
State exists for the man and not the man for the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The realisation of the
universal value of this concept is the justification for its incorporation in
the United Nations Charter, International Declaration of Human Rights,
international covenants and in almost all the written constitutions of the
democratic world. Indeed the said rights find a place in the Communist
Constitution and even in the Russian Constitution proclaimed during the Stalin
purges. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

their non-implementation or ineffective implementation are briefly as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1. There is no effective
machinery for enforcing the said rights declared in the United Nations
international convenants and in many national constitutions. Though some
constitutions have provided for an effective machinery for their preservation
and enforcement, the men who came into power either diluted the machinery by
amendment or evolved unhealthy conventions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

represents the oppressed. Many States, through their representatives in the
international organisations, fight for the preservation of the freedoms of the
people in other countries and cynically suppress them in their States. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the sovereign States, both democratic as well as totalitarian, to give up a
little of their sovereignty to the international bodies in order to preserve
and protect such freedoms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Because of these and
such other reasons, the talk of freedoms has become only a platitudinous
slogan. Except in a few highly developed democracies in other countries, both
under democratic and totalitarian forms of Government, fundamental freedoms or
human rights do not exist and even if they exist in law, they are largely
suppressed in fact. Unless therefore the concept of<i> </i>freedom is
effectively implemented in all the States, one world will continue to be an
idle talk and a distant mirage. Briefly stated, the remedies for making the
concept of freedom a reality are as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Human Rights shall be binding on all the States, that is to say, they shall
be binding on municipal courts of all the States, whether the municipal law
recognises the freedoms or even negatives them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rights, i.e., Civil and Political rights, should be declared positive rights by
the law of each State and made enforceable through an impartial judicial
machinery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the land should be entrusted with the power to resolve the conflict between
different categories of sights and harmonise them. The process of evolution is
through judicial adjustment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

courts should be established separately by democratic and totalitarian blocs.
An appeal from the State Court may lie to the Regional Court on a certificate
issued by the effect the appeal involves an important question of infringement
of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the covenants
approved by the United Nations. Both the individual aggrieved and a State can
prefer an appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Court of Human Rights may be established with compulsory jurisdiction over an
the constituent States. An appeal may lie from a Regional Court to the said
Court at the instance of an aggrieved party or a State on a certificate granted
by the said Court or by a special leave given by it. Where there is no Regional
Court and where there is also no State Court to enforce the basic rights of the
citizens, an original petition may lie to the International Court of Human
Rights at the instance of an aggrieved party or a State. Where there is a State
Court but no Regional Court, an appeal may lie from the State Court to the International
Court on a certificate issued by the State Court or special leave granted by
the International Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

harmonising the said three concepts, viz., universality of science, religion
and freedom and by implementing them, we can accelerate the pace of the
movement towards one World Government. It is no doubt a distant vision and its
contours are not yet clear and at present even hazy. Still one thing is clear,
that the society is moving towards it. I hope and trust that the men, who
occupy the seats of power in different parts of the world, will do their best
in this regard. But the more important is, that the intelligentsia must create
public opinion, national and international, for the evolution of the aforesaid
three concepts through implementation. The creation of a universal man is the
only way to accelerate the pace towards ‘one-world.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

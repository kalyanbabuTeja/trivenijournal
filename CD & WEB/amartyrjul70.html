Kolavennu Ramakotiswara Rau is no more. After being confined to bed for long
months, he passed away. In his death, a great journalist, an eminent lover of
art, a kind-hearted and a pure soul is removed from our midst. He was a great
gentleman and he became a martyr in the cause of his own <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Triveni</i>, of which he was the founder, editor-in-chief all these
years, since its inception in 1927. He became known to many lovers of
literature in all parts of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by his editorship of Triveni and he staked his all–his property, his health,
his time–to keep Triveni running. Therefore, I called him a martyr. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was privileged to be his student in the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span>
Kalasala, <span class=SpellE>Machilipatnam</span>, in 1923-24. He was teaching
Indian History. He was a very good teacher of History and made the classes very
interesting. Since then I had been devoted to him through all his trials and
triumphs. He was fond of me right through and he paid me high compliments in
the columns of Triveni when I became a Minister in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> in July, 1937. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

from the beginning of Non-Cooperation, he became a member of the Congress and
till he died, he remained so. He used to put on very fine <span class=SpellE>Khadi</span>
in those days and being of an artistic temperament, he always used to don the <span
class=SpellE>Chicacole</span> <span class=SpellE>Khadi</span>. I felt it my
duty to tour in his constituency when he was fighting a bye-election in 1939 to
the Madras Legislative Assembly. I took the permission of the Chief Minister,
Sri <span class=SpellE>Rajagopalachari</span>, and went into his <span
class=SpellE>Narasaraopet</span> constituency. I addressed quite a large number
of meetings and he won the election by a comfortable majority. He suffered
imprisonment too in the cause of independence of the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>honoured</span> him by making him a fellow of the Academy. Due

M. <span class=SpellE>Panikkar</span>. He joined the Andhra <span class=SpellE>Jateeya</span>
Kalasala in 1923 and, later, became its Principal, but his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>magnum opus</i> was his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Triveni</i>.
He lived for it and <span class=GramE>I can say, he died for it</span>. I was
present at the inaugural function during the Congress Session at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madras</st1:place></st1:City> in December 1927.
He came in contact with a large number of writers and invited them to write for
the Triveni or to translate some poems or short stories from various Indian
languages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we are talking very much about emotional integration. I can safely say that Sri
Ramakotiswara Rau was a pioneer in this movement and great many pages of

them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was because of Triveni that many literary people came to know more about
Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, etc.
Translations and articles on other Indian languages became a special feature of
Triveni. It created a better understanding among the writers and formed a
fraternity of Indian writers. He fully represented in his outlook and in his
temperament the entire renaissance movement in Indian languages. He came in
personal contact with all the writers in Telugu country, <span class=SpellE>Tamilnadu</span>,
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mysore</st1:place></st1:City> and had

he wanted <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Andhra</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType

class=GramE>or</span> done anything to spoil the good relations between the
Telugus and the <span class=SpellE>Tamilians</span>. In those days we did not
know our linguistic <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span>, their background,
their folklore, their poetry, their literary trends, fiction, etc. All these
were unknown to the average student of literature and he broke through these
narrow barriers and opened up windows where free exchange of thought could take
place. He gave encouragement to young writers and I never heard him saying
anything bad about any other person, even if he entertained a poor opinion
about him. He showered real affection all around him. He went through great
many financial difficulties but with great determination, he faced them and
continued his work. He was a devoted soul and dedicated himself to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Triveni</i>, the journal of Indian
Renaissance. He could not suffer uncouthness or ugliness and he always kept his
surroundings in simple but elegant manner. He was endowed with a sense of
beauty. I saw him last in his sick bed when I went on an election tour in Sri <span
class=SpellE>Brahmananda</span> Reddy’s constituency in <span class=SpellE>Narasaraopet</span>
in January, 1967. He was greatly happy to receive me and he was as affectionate
as ever. Though I was his student for a year–and then I left for <span
class=SpellE>Santiniketan</span>–I always kept up my loyalty to him as a
student. Whether as a State Minister, or Chief Minister or a Central Minister,
I maintained the same relations with him, for there were some sterling
qualities in him to which I was drawn. He had his own principles and
convictions, but he never made them a conflict with anybody. He was never
dogmatic, nor self-assertive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he was in jail and also in the Assembly for a short while, he could not

decadence. Before long it will die out. The fountain of song has dried up now.
The soil that fed it has become sterile. The mighty tree is withering at the
root. Poetry is undergoing a process of disintegration. The fond hope,
cherished by many, of its revival may never be fulfilled. The conditions that
inspired the muse and favoured its growth through centuries are no more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The primitive mind created poetry and art. The
modern culture-creating mind is occupied in banishing poetry from our world.
With the advance of civilisation, there is taking place in our natures, perhaps
without our knowing, a change that is more or less fundamental. The impact of
science on our world has precipitated a revolution, changing the whole face of
the earth for us. Psychologists, who hold that the fundamental psychic
structure of the primitive and the cultured man is one and unchangeable,
testify to “a change of attitude on our part.”<sup>1</sup> The main focus of
our attention is transferred wholly to material reality. We have turned away
our interest from the subjective to the objective, from creating art and myth
to discriminating objects,–emphasising the importance of material things at the
expense of things of spirit, such as art, myth, and religion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Poetry was born out of wonder and mystery. The
primitive caveman, dizzy with a sense of rapture, conceived the best poetry;
the Vedic poet, viewing the wonders of the great creation with the eyes of the
child, poured out a series of incantations. The sense of the ‘numinous,’ that
dim sense of something tremendous in the world about us, something awful and
majestic–‘mysterious Tremendum’ is the very basis of poetry. The primitive man
had a child’s mind, with a child’s wonder. He was constantly in a state of
astonishment and awe as he faced the mysteries of nature. The naive man of
antiquity saw in everything living presences. The Sun was a god; Dawn a young
and a beautiful maiden on a golden chariot;<sup>2</sup> the Earth the ‘ancient
mother.’ Living, as he did, perpetually under the thrill of the mysterious, the
primitive created art, myth, and religion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The primitive loved fantasies. The world of
reality, the processes of nature, were to him cold and lifeless; they had no
warmth and glow. Consequently myth was welcomed. He peopled his world with
fairies and spirits. He lived in a subjective, fantastical universe of his own
creation. “He grasped the world by intuition and expressed it by fantasy,”<sup>3</sup>
the energy and interest which today we put into science and technique, the man
of antiquity gave in part to mythology. This myth making of the primitive gave
birth to the richest poetry. “This fantastical activity of the ancient mind
created artistically <i>par excellence</i>,”<sup>4</sup> <i>e.g. </i>the
richness and immense power of life of Grecian mythology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Poetry is the visionary attitude of the mind. It is
distinct from the faculty that produced the sciences.<sup>5</sup> Poetic
thought is associative, involuntary, and effortless. It is a thinking in
images, akin to dreaming or fantasy-thinking. The primitive mentality had a
dislike of reasoning, of voluntary or purposive thought. Directed thinking was
a tiresome pursuit, an ordeal. Hence it turned naturally to fantasy, to the
attractive dreamy world of myths and fairy-tales. The primitive, like the
child, was uncritical and undiscriminating. He thought for the most part in
images, and hence lived in the imagination. He swallowed fantastic tales and
offered mythical explanations of natural phenomena. To him poetry and science
were one; they were contained in the myth. He had no concept of a law-regulated
nature. The affairs of the world were carried on by supernatural powers; nature
was governed by occult forces.<sup> 6</sup> The primitive lived in a world that
had a richer content than ours. It was a magic mystical world. “The antique
spirit created not science but mythology.”<sup> 7</sup> Mythology
interpenetrated the life of the primitive, whereas the modern man spends his
time mainly in voluntary thought. “Directed thinking is a modern acquisition,
the manifest instrument of culture.”<sup>8</sup> Science is its expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Science is an obstacle to imagination. The rising
on the sun causes us no astonishment,–we know that it happens necessarily. The
analysing scientific mind has stripped Nature of its mystery. Wordsworth
presented the activities of the ‘meddling intellect’ which ‘murders to dissect’
and ‘botanizes on its mother’s grave.’ The advent of rational consciousness, the
latest and the greatest achievement of man, marked the end of the
‘mythologising’ era. Myth or fantasy is the projection of the psyche into the
world of objects. It is a subjective emotional attitude, in which the subject
and the object interpenetrate one another. In the undifferentiated world of the
primitive, dream and reality mingled, “the psychic and the objective coalesced
in the external world.” Even the things the primitive dreamed about seemed to
him real. “The modern culture-creating mind is incessantly occupied in
stripping off all subjectivity from experience.”<sup>9</sup> We have learned to
distinguish what is subjective and psychic from what is objective and
‘natural,’ to keep our emotions from colouring our perceptions.<sup> 10</sup>
Science has bred abstract thinking; it is working the gradual
‘depersonification of myth;’<sup>11</sup> concrete image is replaced by a set
of abstract symbols. “Directed thinking has taken the place of fantastic
thinking, which, however, remains as a survival.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Poetry has its roots in a deep unconscious source.
It is ‘above and beyond consciousness.’ It is the record of the unconscious. In
the realm of poetry, “the confines of the waking world blend with those of the
world of dreams.” “The true poet dreams while being awake. Poetry is a sort of
dream world. Goethe, Blake, Coleridge, De Quincey were all great dreamers.
Poetry and dreams are the product of the same imaginative operation.”
Coleridge’s imaginations were dream-like; <i>Kubla Khan </i>is a dream vision.<sup>12</sup>
Poetry had its origin in the primitive dream-like way of thinking. In poetry,
as in dream, we have a reversion to a more primitive type of experience. The
poet is a highly developed mind working in a primitive way. The dream-like
imagination of the primitive constantly produced myths.” Myth is the dream of a
people; dream is the myth of an individual.<sup>13</sup> Myth is the product of
fantasy. “Myths are dreams and they are poetry.”<sup>14</sup> Myth-making or
imaginative creation is the essence of the poetic substance. Poets and savages
belong to the same brotherhood. They are the children of imagination. Poetry
thus is the outcome of the processes of the unconscious. It proceeds from that
‘misty realm, that vast unknown.’ In poetry, as in dream, the unconscious wells
up from the deep buried sources; the gulf between the superficial limited
conscious mind and the vast unconscious is bridged. The function of poetry is
to withdraw the consciousness from the perceptual world into the world of
fantasy, “to hold the mind suspended in the state of trance, in which the mind,
liberated from the pressure of the will, is unfolded in symbols.” Poetic
experience consists in a temporary return to the unconscious. Conscious
activities suspended, the senses held in abeyance, the ‘inner vision’ becomes
alert, ‘with a, flash’ revealing ‘the invisible world’; the human spirit is
back in the paradise of the unconscious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One of the dubious gifts of civilisation is the
growth of consciousness. Civilisation, with the complex problems it presents to
the human mind, brings the possibility’” of a widening of consciousness.
Problems force us to greater consciousness and separate us from the paradise of
the unconscious childhood. The psychic life of the civilised man is made up of
doubts, reflections, experiments–all of which are almost foreign to the
unconscious, instinctive mind of primitive man. We are saying good-bye to
childlike unconsciousness and trust in Nature. The primitive lived natural,
instinctive life. Instinct is nature, unconsciousness; culture is
consciousness. The primitive has not progressed as far in consciousness as the
cultured man; he has not lost contact with his unconscious to anything like the
extent that civilised man has lost it.<sup>15</sup> Our culture consist in our
turning away from instinct, our opposing ourselves to instinct,–that creates
consciousness. We are drifting farther away from our unconscious, tearing
ourselves loose from it.<sup>16</sup> “The Biblical fall of man presents the
dawn of consciousness as a curse.”<sup>17</sup> We are enjoying the fruits of
knowledge “at the sacrifice of the natural mar, the unconscious, ingenuous
being” in us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Consciousness is fatal to poetic creation. It is a
sign of artistry. Poems written consciously, and deliberately are not real
poetry, but only wit, satire, or philosophy, e.g. Pope, because the mystery is
not there. “The artificial is the conscious, mechanical; the natural is the
unconscious, dynamical. Unconsciousness is the sign of creation; consciousness
at best that of manufacture.”<sup> 18</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>With primitives, poetry was part of their
natures–not a fine art merely! Art was something that came natural to them,
into which their lives were inseparably woven. For them art and life were not
separate but one. To the primitive mind, consciousness was a strain. Their
minds turned naturally to art and myth-making. The primitive orgy and dancing
ceremonies afforded them relief by throwing them back into the subconscious
world of fantasy. When he performed rites, ceremonies of drinking and worship
the savage was seized with the ‘religious thrill.’ His limited consciousness,
attained by so much effort and privation, disappeared. “In the wild transport
of the mimetic dance, the savages lost consciousness of the external world and
plunged into the subconsciouss, inner world of fantasy.” Primitive poetry
sprang spontaneously from life. Nature was its inspiration. To the primitive,
poetry was not an art, acquired and cultivated, but a habit of the mind. He
lived naturally in it. The primitives were all poets to some extent; their
common speech was poetical, their conversation tending at every step to twist
into poetry. Ancient poetry was never composed like ours with pen, paper, and
deliberation. It was improvised, poured out in a gush, ‘a spontaneous overflow
of feelings.’ Rig-Veda was a mighty improvisation. Its poets conceived it in a
trance. With us, poetry is seldom, if ever, improvised. It is a matter of pen
and paper. Our poetry is a written art, more difficult than common speech,
demanding a higher degree of conscious deliberation. “It is no affair of
inaspiration but only of intellectual masonry.” Poetry has moved away from us,
has lost its intimate relation to our lives; it is a fine art, a luxury, the
special talent of a gifted few.<sup> 19</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>To the primitive peoples religion and poetry were
born one. Poetry merged with religion. Poetry has grown out of religion. The
Rig-Vedic hymns are invocations and adoration of gods. They are “a simple
out-pouring of the heart, a prayer to the eternal, an invitation to them to
accept favourably the gift, reverently consecrated.” Religion is the matrix of
poetry. It was the religious thrill that inspired the best poetry in the world.
True poetry, like religion, strikes the devotional chord in our hearts and
satisfies the universal neurotic longing of humanity for the Father: God.<sup>20</sup>
Tagore’s <i>Gitanjali </i>is deeply and profoundly religious at the core. In it
religion and poetry fuse and become one. Its very religiousness is its poetic
element. The Poet’s spirit of self-dedication and self-surrender has inspired
the sublimest utterances–self-surrender to the eternal Master, the cry of the
soul for union with its Father: God. If the core of truth in a religion is
man’s intuition of dependence, the same sense of dependence, with a powerful
yearning to wipe out one’s identity and merge in the infinite universe, in a
holy communion with the eternal spirit, is what imparts to poetry the depth and
ecstasy that belong to it. The poet and the mystic experience it in their
profoundest moods. Poetry that prides itself upon man’s supremacy or exults in
his conquests must, of necessity, be, like Kipling’s <i>Marching Measures </i>and
patriotic poems, shallow, and lack the quality of mystery. Poetry is an
emotional attitude towards the world. That our ancients produced the greatest
poetry is purely the result of their mystical and emotional outlook. A sort of
emotional halo encircled the ways of our forefathers. This emotional basis,
again, arose from their helplessness, their sense of insecurity and dependence
upon supernatural powers. Science has given us a sense of security and taught
us self-confidence; the work of civilisation has <i>rid our minds of weakness
and helplessness</i>. Culture is enabling man to get over the ‘neurotic phase’.<sup>21</sup>
Religion is dying, leaving a great vacuum in the life of man. The sea of Faith
is retreating; we hear its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“With consciousness appears individuality.”<sup> 22</sup>
Individuality is a limitation, even a sin, in the realm of art. “The secret of
artistic creation is to be found in a return to the state of ‘participation
Mystique,’ to that level of experience at which it is man who lives and not the
individual.”<sup>23</sup> True poetry is a reflection of the common,
unconscious psychic life of mankind. Every step towards a fuller consciousness
removes us farther from our ‘participation Mystique’ with the mass of men, from
the common unconsciousness. Modern poetry is highly individualised, the work of
a highly individualised society, while primitive poetry was the product of a
whole community.<sup>24</sup> Labour songs, popular ballads, peasant tunes,
express the aspirations of the community; they took their origin in the
primitive substance of the human consciousness. Poetry and song, in the
primitive societies, were composed to celebrate the realisation of communal
desires. To the primitives, poetry was a necessity; it subserved a vital social
function. It was needed to direct the instinctive energy of the tribe into
trains of collective actions. The group-festival freed the stores of emotion
and canalised them in a collective channel.<sup>25</sup> Thus poetry was part
and parcel of the communal life of the people. Poetic thought is the product of
the common mind. The poet in his poetic moments retires into a subconscious
world, less individualised than his waking conscious life, and expresses that which
is common to him and his fellowmen. Arnold insisted on ‘elementary feelings’,
the great primary human affections. Wordsworth went to rustic life for poetic
themes, because in that condition of life “our elementary feelings co-exist in
a state of greater simplicity.” Modern poetry is tending to become eccentric;
individual idiosyncrasies find a prominent place in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“Primitivity is an early stage of development, a
racial childhood.”<sup>26</sup> The human race is passing from a stage in which
in man’s life emotion and intuition play a large role, and in which the world
of imagination is the world of reality, to a stage in which reasoning becomes a
natural and an almost continuous occupation of the human mind. As the race
evolves, human intellect succeeds in gaining primacy over the instincts. Each
modern child also passes through this stage of dreams and fantasies on his way
to the world of real objects and ideas. In this, the child is recapitulating
the development of the race.<sup>27</sup> The child begins with poetry. Its
mind, like the savage’s, is imaginative and constantly producing myths; its
perception is emotional. When the child, on seeing dew on the grass, exlaims,
“the grass is crying”, its expression is poetical. The child and the poet
partake of the same nature; in fact in poetry we have a reversion to the mental
state of the child. “The poets are men who still see with the eyes of
childhood.” The poet is an imaginative child, “who has retained the spirit of
infancy even into the era of manhood.” But the child has soon to learn prose.
As the practical and social life develops, as the adaptation to reality
proceeds, imaginative vision gives way to ratiocination. In the grown man, it
is relegated to a second place and held rigorously in check. In infancy the
inner vision, imagination, is uppermost; in manhood, it is subjected to
external sense.<sup> 28</sup> In the <i>Ode on Immortality</i>, Wordsworth
speaks of the gradual deterioration of the mind from its early ideals–the
progress of life from birth to manhood and the gradual fading of the ‘clouds of
glory’–the passing away of the visionary ideal charm of childhood into ‘the
light of common day’. What is true of the individual human child is true of the
race. Poetry is the fine flower of the racial childhood of man. “As civilisation
advances, poetry, almost necessarily declines.” Milton complained that he was
born in an age too late. The modern poet has to “struggle against the spirit of
the age.” That is why the age of Elizabeth was so prolific, why the romantic
writers turned to the Middle Ages, why modern poets go back to the Greeks, the
golden age of imagination, for material and inspiration. Primitive poetry was
the best poetry. In the folk-lore, peasant songs, popular ballads, poetry
survives in something like its primitive natural simplicity. The best poetry is
unwritten, it lives on the lips of the people. While the ‘Kathas’ (epic songs)
of Andhra are specimens of genuineness and simplicity, its best poems are not
free form the taint of sophistication. We are in the age of science. We can no

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In my school-days I read <i>The Home and the World </i>by
Tagore and spent sleepless nights brooding over “the pity of it, O! the pity of
it!” A year ago, I read it again and preserved my presence of mind. The scenes
of a tragic picture I had seen haunted me day and night. But now I have
developed a distaste for poetry and for all ‘sentimental’ literature. The
‘tragedies’ do not move me.<sup> 29 </sup>Shaw is my hero. No grandeur now in
‘nature that is ours’. It move us not. “We have lost that intimate emotional
relation with nature. Aesthetic admiration has taken the place of mystic
participation with nature in which the classic ancients lived. We see in nature
something merely pretty or something scientifically interesting. Our modern
view of nature is anaemic. We have lost the heart-and-soul relation with
nature.”<sup>30</sup> Poetry also is losing its appeal. The primitive poets and
primitive audiences were childlike and naive. As the Homeric minstrel recited,
the audience was weeping,–lost in rapture. The female devotees of Dionysus
under the influence of music had hysterical seizures.<sup>31</sup> When we read
a poem, we may be deeply moved but we are seldom ‘carried away’. For the
primitives a lapse into the unconscious was natural and easy. Whereas for us,
the demands of the world are so constant upon our attention that it becomes
hard to withdraw ourselves into fantasy when we wish, or for any length of
time. We have lost the capacity for ‘psychic dissociation’. Our sceptical minds
never feel at home in the world of make-believe, in which the primitives lived
naturally. We never surrender to illusion readily or whole-heartedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Modern English poetry is showing sure signs of
disintegration. This is an age of prose; poetry is not popular with the average
reader today. All early literature was made up exclusively of poetry, and this
gradually grew into literature made up for the most part of prose. Prose best
expresses the genius of the modern age. Poetry, today, draws its inspiration
from civilisation, not from nature. Poets have developed a craze for novelty.
The eternal poetic concepts of Life, Death, Soul, Immortality, are rejected as
outworn; and low life, slang, aeroplanes, locomotives, gasometers are welcome
as poetic themes. The heavy thud of bus traffic, the creaking of tramcars, the
rattling noise of the railway trains,–all these find an echo in our poetry.
Much of modern poetry is trivial,<sup> 32</sup> of only an emphemeral value.
The new modernist poetry is obscure, recondite, esoteric, and unintelligible. <i>The
Waste Land</i>, the epic of the twentieth century is an intellectual puzzle.
Poetry has traveled far away from Wordsworth’s ideal of simplicity. Our poets
take account of intellectual perceptions rather than of romantic fancy or
feeling. Emotional themes are deliberately eschewed. Modern poetry is an
exaltation of the scientific spirit of the modern world. “The material of much
recent contemporary poetry is barren and boring; a thin whimper has displaced
both the song of joy and the strong cry of agony.”<sup>33</sup> The modern poet
has turned a politician and a propagandist and lost sight of the eternities.
Poetry now sets itself to solve the problems of civilisation, to preach
political and socio-economic doctrines. But poetry cannot hope to thrive long
on economics and dialectical materialism. It will wither in a day. This is a
desert, a ‘waste land’. The hope of a revival is a delusion; the prospect of a
return of the spirit which produced Virgil and Shakespeare–a mirage! The Great
Song may never return again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A German author, a biographical historian, Emil
Ludwig, has written the life of Jesus under the heading, <i>The Son of Man</i>.
An English author, a literary critic, Middleton Murry, has written a work, <i>The
Son of Woman </i>and also another volume, <i>The Life of Jesus</i>. At first
thought, it seems paradoxical that one should have styled the male the Son of
Man, the Other the Son of Woman, as if the son were not of both man and woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The “Son of Man” is the reverential biblical name
for Jesus, which he himself used, if I recollect aright, for the first time in
his saying, “The son of Man hath not where to lay his head.” But Jesus was
previously hinted at as the son of God, by the voice from Heaven, after his
baptism and before the temptation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Woman” is the name Murry has chosen for delineating D. H. Lawrence’s character,
and the last sentence of the preface to the reader, lest we should judge
Lawrence, reads: “He alone could judge Lawrence, and he also spoke the words,
‘Judge not that ye be not judged,” of course, meaning Jesus. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Why these paradoxical definitions should have risen
in the West and not in the East, has led me to ponder over it. The biblical
story of us being born of a virgin, by the visitation of the Holy Ghost, is
very peculiar and characteristically not the way, which the Hindu mind
conceived the <i>avatars </i>of God. Even Sri Krishna, the <i>purna </i>(full) <i>avatar</i>,
he is called, was born of man and woman, for the Hindu considers that God
Himself is subject to the natural laws of the Universe, and it was in
accordance with nature that the Lord should be born of man and woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Like Jesus, it is said that Krishna too exercised
after his birth his miraculous powers, which enabled the child to break the jail
and be taken across the Jamuna, whose floods were made to subside. It may be
that persons interested in the welfare of Vasudeva’s children might have given
dope to the sentinels and that the Jamuna’s floods subsided by accident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The legend of the birth of Jesus of a virgin itself
proclaims to the East that Christianity has felt, even from its origins, that
sex is a sin, as the story in the <i>Genesis </i>describes the fall of man from
Heaven by the temptation of woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>These thoughts passed through my mind, because
Hilton Brown of <i>The Punch </i>(late of the Indian Civil Service), who has
known India better than Miss Mayo and persons of that ilk, has said in a
private letter, “So much awful rubbish has been written about the sex aspect of
Hinduism that we cannot have enough exponents of what I, for one, am quite
convinced is the real state of affairs. Give us some more of this………<i>i.e., </i>“the
delineation of the elusive delicate relationship, at once humdrum and sublime,
implied in the Hindu marriage.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I however, just now propose, as a Hindu imbued with
somewhat of the Hindu culture, despite western education, to refer to some of
the taboos, as the westerner would put it, namely, to some of the rules of the
conduct of life of the Hindu, under which normally the human personality of the
male is not broken up by fierce conflicts of the soul, as in the case of D. H.
Lawrence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Murry’s subject had never been able to resolve his
Oedipus complex, <i>i.e., </i>the love of the son for the mother, which has its
physical beginnings in the suckling of the babe at the woman’s breast.
(Sophocles’ play of Oedipus the King gave rise to the use of this word). The
complex requires sublimation at the adolescent age, when the love is
transferred to another woman somewhat younger than the male, who later finds
joy in the companionship of marriage. As Murry puts it, in describing the
illness of Paul in his sixteenth year, (from <i>Sons and Lovers</i>, which is
auto-biographical) after quoting the sentence, “He put his head on her breast
and took ease of her for love”:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“It is terribly poignant, and terribly wrong.
Almost better that a boy should die than have such an effort forced upon him by
such means. He is called upon to feel in full consciousness for his mother all
that a full-grown man might feel for the wife of his bosom.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>When I read the Bible, especially <i>Matthew </i>and
<i>Mark </i>of the New Testament, a second time, at the age of thirty, I had
doubts that Jesus, though aged over 30 years like Adi Sankara, the
World-Preacher of Vedanta, had never known woman–an opinion endorsed also by
Ludwig. But Jesus discerned well enough to interpret the lust of flesh in the
covetous glance of man at woman, at the synagogue; and his saying, profound
with meaning, “Whosoever looketh on woman to lust after her hath already committed
adultery with her in his heart,” is the dictum needed for the ethics of man’s
social, nay, spiritual life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sankara too passed away from this world of ours, at
about the age of thirty-two, quite young like Jesus; and his later story is
interesting. When he met the wife of Mandana Misra, she foils the young
ascetic, by discussing, not spiritual love, a part of Vedantic teaching, but
the love of a man and woman. He begs a month’s time to consider the question;
and it is said that he experienced the sex-act by his soul entering the body of
a dead king before its cremation, creating the phantasm of the king coming back
to life, which the queen detected, and returning to his own physical body some
days after. I refer to this story of Sankara mainly with one purpose. The
ancient Hindu thinkers, who were adepts in the study of the human mind, have
been quite conscious of the Oedipus and Electra complexes, and of the necessity
for their sublimation; and that idea is portrayed, for instance, in the mythical
episode of Ganesa or Vighnewara, the son of Siva and Parvati. When Ganesa came
of age and was pressed to marry he puts the question, “Find me a woman just
like my mother.” The story goes on to say that the gods got quite enraged and
cursed him with the life of <i>brahmacharya </i>(celibacy). Perhaps it is the
intention to convey the lesson to the human mind that normally such persons, as
are obsessed with the physical love for the mother, should not try the
experiment of marriage. This, to my mind, is the lesson that Murry teaches,
even though unconsciously, when he portrays what was the tragedy of Lawrence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I have referred in my book, <i>Life’s Shadows </i>to
the sacredness of the person of man and woman. This is a very important psychic
factor in the fondling of the son by the mother, or of the daughter by the
father. Such cuddling, hugging and kissing of the child is usually left off in
the Hindu household within a couple of years of the birth of the child, both by
the father and the mother. It may be, that the semi-nakedness of the children
in the East, and the lesser clothes which the Hindu children wear do not create
the obsession of sex in the maturing Hindu mind. It is typically said of the
Hindu that he adores his mother and worships her. It is this adoration of the
mother, which does not cause the tragedy I alluded to above. It is a matter of
common observation that the daughter is addressed by the Tamil Hindu–not even
by her name but as “Ammale,” meaning diminutive mother. The word “Amman” also
means Iswari. The northern Indian father addresses his daughter as “Devi.”
which is even more expressive of the feeling of adoration of the girl-child.
The Electra complex too is thus sublimated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>While on this subject, it is curious to note that
Persian poets sing of the beauty of boys, and not of women, probably on account
of the purdah system prevailing in that country, while all Sanskrit poets
praise the beauty of woman. It is apparent how natural and sane life can be
without these artificial restrictions laid by man on woman who is not trusted
in regard to her chastity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I must now branch off to certain aspects of the
Christian and Hindu religion. I have mentioned the Holy Ghost earlier. It is
the third aspect of the Christian Trinity, the first two, being Father and Son.
God is the Father; and Christ, the Son (sacrificed as a lamb), stands as the
intermediary, to bear the burden of the sins of the whole of humanity, if we
believe in him, while the Holy Ghost may be the Spirit of Man. The Bible says
to blaspheme or sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable, which saying is
rather hard to understand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Be it as it may, I shall first refer to the more
common concepts of Trinity in Hindu Religion, which have, by folklore, become
part and parcel of the Hindu mind, on an evolutionary basis of the idea, as I
imagine it. In the early stages of Hindu civilisation, when nature’s forces
seemed paramount, Godhead was represented by three names, the Sun (Surya), the
Waters (Apah) and the Earth (Prithvi), without which life could not exist.
When, later, it was realised that in human life, nay, in all life, there were
the three facts of birth, growth and death, the Hindu personified God Himself
taking on three aspects, as Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Siva
the Destroyer. It is noteworthy that the three gods are all male. Later still
when it was understood that sex was a universal phenomenon in the whole of
creation, these three gods were given wives in the Pantheon, Saraswati, Lakshmi
and Parvati respectively. They had sons too, Narada, Manmatha (Cupid) and
Ganesa or Kumara (because Ganesa was later ousted by Kumara in worship).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The concept of Siva as Ardhanariswara (half-man and
half-woman) was a great flight of imagination, and it is pertinent to observe
that the wives of Brahma and Vishnu were never merged in the <i>unity </i>of
the cosmic, principle. Nay, Vishnu had two wives, as represented in a picture
by Ravi Varma. Though Saraswati is the Goddess of Learning, Lakshmi of
Prosperity, yet it is Parvati, who is more appealed to as the Mother of the
Universe by the mass-mind of South India. For, the Father is indeed an august
personage, and the Son seeks the grace of the Father through the intervention
of the Mother. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The Vishnu worshipper may say that the aspect of
mother is present also in the worship of Lakshmi, typified by the prayer to
Sita, when the invocation to Sri Rama did not bear fruit in the alleviation of
suffering of the devotee Ramadas of Pandharpur (Sita was not patently conceived
as “the Mother” in the Ramayana, of Valmiki). The Trinity of human relationship
here was not complete, as it did not embrace the son-aspect, since Manmatha
became <i>ananga </i>(disembodied), and Narada, a mere saint in mythic lore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Having posited Siva as Mahadeva in the act of
contemplation, Parvati was invested with the powers of energy of the living
Universe and became possessed also of the fearful aspects of Nature, which took
shape in the worship of ‘Durga’, as in Bengal. The Kamakshi temple at
Conjeeveram is an instance of a similar worship in South India. Northern India,
in the recent past of a thousand years, under the aegis of Mahomedan rule, had
come to accept the purdah of the conqueror, which may be a reason why today we
are unable to see any temples for worship of Iswari, the consort of Siva, at
Benares for instance. When a South Indian visits, for the first time, the
Visveswara Temple at Benares next to the huge mosque, he is struck by two
important variations in the ritual of worship at he is accustomed to. The
devotee himself pours the offering of water over the stone image and offers the
<i>bilva </i>leaves, without the priest intervening as in South India, and
drops the coin for the priest to pick up the owner of the temple. And there is
no Iswari temple where he can say homage of worship. So the devotee goes to the
Visalakshi Temple a little far off, built by a South Indian in recent years, to
satisfy his religious need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Ganges, beside the temple of Durga with a lolling red tongue, stand next
door the images of Radha and Krishna, featuring not as man and wife, but as man
and beloved. They convey no meaning at all to the South Indian who visits the
home of the late saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>I have now to refer to the work of Adi Sankara in
South India, where the worship of ‘Durga’ was transformed into the worship of
the graceful and divine, loving Mother. He should also have felt that the
Ardhanariswra ideal alone would lead man to sexual orgies. A Siva temple was
erected by the side of every Iswari temple, and at the portals of the Iswari
temple was placed at a mans height in a niche the figure of Ganesa, face to
face <i>i.e.,</i> both looking at each other, the mother at the son and <i>vice
versa</i>. If one visits the temple of Jambukeswara at Thiruvanaikaval in the
island of Srirangam, one will find the routine of worship there to be thus.
First, the visit to the Siva temple where everything is quiet, austere and
serene. Next to the shrine of Parvati, Akhilandeswari, meaning ‘the Mother of the
entire Universe.’ Instead of blood pouring out of animal sacrifice, we see that
<i>kumkum </i>(red vermilion) is the offering and a portion of the offering is
returned by the priest to the married woman for her to wear on her forehead as
a symbol of chaste motherhood. And on his way back, the worshipper sees Ganesa,
offers his prayer and departs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>For the non-Hindu reader, it may be stated that
Parvati, Durga, Visalakshi, Kamakshi are different names for Iswari. Similarly,
Rudra Mahadeva, Parameswara, Sankara are the names of Siva. The word ‘Siva’
means ‘the Good’. However, owing to the previous association of that word with
the aspect of Destroyer, the mind conceives Him not only as Good, releasing the
soul to seek a finer body and brain at re-birth, or from the cycle of births
and deaths, but also as the God who infuses the terror of Moral Law in one who
does evil. The Hindu mind, in its health, cannot condone the suffering of man
brought on himself as a result of his evil deeds against man and society, since
the stern law of Karma gives no room for the ‘flabby ideas’ of Christian
forgiveness of evil deeds, and the mockings of the moral law by the
materialist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

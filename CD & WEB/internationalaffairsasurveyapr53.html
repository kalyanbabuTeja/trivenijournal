<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The two explosions of the Hydrogen bomb undertaken
by the Government of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> have created panic among most of the
rulers of the world. But panic never <span class=GramE>solves</span> a problem,
and much less a problem of the magnitude of peace or war. What is needed is a
calm consideration of the root causes that have led to the manufacture of the
Hydrogen bomb with all its terrific possibilities. Every one <span
class=SpellE>realises</span> that, if it is ever used, it will mean the
destruction of civilisation as it is understood today and the heaping up of
unbearable suffering on the remnants of humanity which may chance to survive
after its use. It has therefore been proposed that there should be a stand
still agreement between the two ‘World’ powers–the United States and Soviet
Russia–that they will not manufacture any more Hydrogen bombs, and that
discussions must be resumed for the international control of Atomic energy and
some solution arrived at regarding the various controversies that have gathered
round this subject in the course of the last six years. High level talks among
the rulers of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>,
Soviet Russia and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are considered to have great value in solving the question of Hydrogen and Atom
bombs.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Are such discussions and talks going to deter the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Soviet Russia from manufacturing and stock-piling these bombs? Let it be
noted clearly and at the outset that it is not only the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
but also Soviet Russia that is now engaged in the manufacture of these
nefarious weapons of destruction. It may be that the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> has a lead over her
rival at present but there is no guarantee that she will not be overtaken by
her rival in the near future. If the manufacture of these bombs is a matter
which demands condemnation, this condemnation has to be extended to Soviet
Russia as much as to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This point is usually lost sight of.
The statesmen and the publicists who have spoken recently on the subject stem
to think that the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> is more to blame than Soviet Russia.
This is not however a correct view. The world does not know what is happening
behind the iron curtain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is busy manufacturing the Hydrogen bomb because of the suspicion that Soviet
Russia is determined on pursuing a policy of aggression and expanding her power
and influence throughout the world. In a world which has become so
interdependent as the modern world has become, no State–and much less a State
of such world-wide interests like the United States–can look with equanimity at
a process which enables Soviet Russia to exercise a dominating influence over
countries from which the United States has to get her supplies of raw materials
or with which she has large trade and economic connections. The same is the
case with <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Similarly Soviet Russia suspects the <span class=SpellE>bonafides</span> of the
<st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> and thinks
that the expansion of American influence and power in the South-West Pacific,
in South-East Asia, in the Middle East, and in <st1:place w:st="on">Western
 Europe</st1:place> is a serious obstacle in the way of her economic prosperity
and political stability. It is this mutual suspicion that has created the
tension between the two great powers and created also the atmosphere of cold
war between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
one problem therefore for the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the post-war period has been how
to stop the aggression of Soviet Russia. The method of conferences was tried in
the years immediately following the Second World War but it did not yield any
substantial results. The method of re-armament was thereupon resorted to and
the Hydrogen bomb is the result of the use of this method. The United States is
now convinced–and this conviction is shared by her allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation and the Pacific Pact–that, if Soviet Russia has not engaged
in any aggressive campaign in Europe after the Berlin blockade, and if she has
agreed to the Korean armistice, it is due to her realisation that victory might
not be hers in a war with the United States, with her (the United States)
increasing pile of Atomic and Hydrogen bombs. The panic-stricken statesmen of
the present day should therefore aim at removing (or reducing) the tension
between the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Soviet Russia before calling upon them not to manufacture any more bombs.
If they cannot do this they will not succeed in their attempts to bring
pressure upon the two powers to suspend their manufacture. If after the death
of Stalin the Soviet leaders seem to be less aggressive than before, the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and her allies have the conviction that this is due to the Soviet realisation
of the growing military strength of her rivals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
United States will be convinced of the peaceful intentions of Soviet Russia if
the latter withdraws from the States of Central and Eastern Europe which are
today its satellites, if it dissolves the <span class=SpellE>Cominform</span>
and completely abandons its policy of being the patron of the Communist parties
in all the non-Communist States, and if it withdraws from its alliance with the
People’s republic of China. But is there any prospect of Soviet Russia being
persuaded by the pressure of world public opinion to do all this? And is there
a sufficiently strong public opinion which advocates a policy like this? Soviet
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region> will in the same
manner be convinced of the peaceful attitude of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
 States</st1:country-region>, if the latter dissolves the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, the Pacific Pact, <span class=GramE>the</span> military and
economic pacts it has entered into with the countries of Western Europe, with <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>, with the <st1:country-region w:st="on">Philippines</st1:country-region>
and with <st1:country-region w:st="on">Formosa</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">South Korea</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is only when Soviet
Russia limits itself to its frontiers as they existed in 1924, and when the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
gets back to its old policy of complete isolationism, that the two powers will
be convinced of each other’s peaceful designs. But it will be a miracle if all
this can be brought about by a policy of voluntary self-abnegation or by the
weight of world opinion. The age of miracles is past and it cannot be revived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

United Nations Organisation was created with a view to reduce tensions like
these and reduce in consequence the huge expenditure on armaments. But the
mutual suspicion referred to above has prevented the organisation from
fulfilling its primary objectives. If aggression is being stopped today it is
therefore due not so much to the efforts of the U.N.O. as to the programme of
re-armament and military alliances concluded by the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

deterrent of war–if </span>war can be effectively deterred at all by any weapon
forged by man. The bomb is only a symptom of the tension among the great
powers. There is no use of attacking the symptom as long as the tension
continues. This should not be regarded as a commendation of the Hydrogen bomb.
No sane man will commend it. But it is a deplorable necessity in a world in
which there is lust of power, mutual hatred of a fierce character, and resort
to war for settling international disputes. It is like the <i>Brahma <span

have expressed the view that the Hydrogen bomb is unlike all other weapons of
warfare and that its use will destroy civilisation itself. There are however
two fallacies in this view. The possession of the bomb does not necessarily
mean its use. It is perhaps the only effective instrument for preventing the
outbreak of a war, and if there is no war there will be no occasion for its
use. The other point is whether a civilisation of which </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that
such a civilisation undergoes destruction and that a new and better
civilisation takes its place? So many <span class=SpellE>civilisations</span>
have disappeared in the past after having flourished for ages. But this did not
mean the end of all progress. The cosmic process is shrouded in mystery and it
may be a characteristic of this process that one civilisation should give place
to another. The world is in need of a civilisation in which the Hydrogen bomb
and other weapons of universal destruction have no place. Perhaps the present
civilisation has to be destroyed before the new one can be reared. There has to
be a deluge <i>(<span class=SpellE>pralaya</span>) </i>before creation <i>(<span

several years there has been a war in Indo-China. It was and is primarily a war
against French Colonialism–very similar to the war which the Americans under

British under the leadership of Gandhiji. It is a phase of the Asian
nationalistic movement for liberation from the European yoke. All sections of
people in Indo-China are at one in their determination to get complete
independence from the French yoke. They do not want to be a part of the
so-called French Union. It was the stupidity of the French and their desire to
perpetuate their rule that drove Ho Chi Minh into the Communist camp. There was
nothing unnatural or unethical in this. The liberation of his country is his
aim. He was prepared to negotiate with the French for this purpose. But the
French were not honest in their dealings with him. They refused to carry out
the agreements into which they entered with him. They set up, when they had no other
alternative, an indigenous Government under <span class=SpellE>Bao</span> Dai,
but it was a Government without much of independence. His position is not very
different from that of any of the Rulers of Indian States in the days of the
British. They wanted to deceive the world by giving to the Indo-China war the <span

is on this mission that Mr. Dulles went recently to Britain and France and it

organisation like that of the NATO in Europe. The purpose of this organisation

of Communism in <st1:place w:st="on">South-East Asia</st1:place>. While the NATO
is an organisation of free and independent countries defending themselves

of powers primarily imperialistic and defending their imperialism against
Soviet and Chinese imperialism. Why is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

It is because the French do not want to give up their hold over <span

And both Malaya and Indo-China are needed by the United States for strategic
purposes and for getting a regular flow of tin, rubber and other raw materials
which are produced there in plenty, If the United States is really anxious to
prevent the spread of Communism in this area, she has to arrange for the
peaceful withdrawal of France from Indo-China and establish really independent
democratic governments in that area. To the people of Indo-China the foe is not
Ho Chi Minh or the Chinese. It is on the other hand the French. What these
people want is a national government of their own and not the perpetuation of
French rule. The present policy of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

policy. It strengthens the imperial hold of the French and in proportion to

active force in maintaining world peace or preventing the spread of a

her external problems cannot be solved. The leaders in the revolutionary
Council which has been in power for the last two years have been quarrelling
among themselves as to what should be the constitutional set-up of the State
and what economic and social reforms are to be carried out. The Council itself
came into power as a result of the entry of the army into civil affairs–thus
breaking the normally accepted doctrine and practice that the army should keep
aloof from politics and implicitly obey the civilian authority. But the
corruption and inefficiency that prevailed in the country under King Farouk
reached such heights that it was no longer possible for the younger commanders
in the army to keep quiet. They therefore led the revolution and under the
leadership of General <span class=SpellE>Neguib</span> they came into power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there arose a real difference between General <span class=SpellE>Neguib</span>
and General Nasser who was really at the bottom of the revolution of 1952. <span
class=SpellE>Neguib</span> has been anxious to restore parliamentary government
at as early a date as possible and carry out at a slow and gradual pace the
needed reforms. But <st1:place w:st="on">Nasser</st1:place> was and is of a
quite different view. He feels that parliamentary rule will bring back into
power the various political parties and their selfish and corrupt leaders who
did little in the days of their power to improve the economic and the social
condition of the people or to settle the Anglo-Egyptian dispute. He thinks that
the vigorous Government of the revolutionary Council should continue for some
years more until the outstanding questions are solved. The dispute therefore
between the two Generals is the dispute between a moderate and a radical.
Fortunately it has been settled for the time being and the point of view of
General Nasser has been accepted. But how far this will solve the dispute with <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> remains
to be seen. The British are of the view that there is today no Government in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sufficiently stable and strong with which they can enter into an agreement.
They are therefore marking time and contributing in their own way to the
unstable conditions not only in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>
but also in other countries of the <st1:place w:st="on">Middle East</st1:place>.
They are not interested in the solution of the political, economic or social
problems of the area so much as in creating a <span class=SpellE>defence</span>
organisation there against any possible Soviet aggression. Here again there is
no prospect of stability until the British and the Americans begin to look at
things from the point of view of the people of the area instead of from the
distorted angle of Communism versus anti-Communism. The problems and
difficulties of the backward and the undeveloped countries of Asia are
different from those of Europe and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is however the
misfortune of the people of these countries that the more powerful nations of
the Communist and the non-Communist world look at them as mere instruments for
furthering their rival ambitions and policies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

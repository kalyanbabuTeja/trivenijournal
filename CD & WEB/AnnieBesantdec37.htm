<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall that, when Dr. Besant’s <I>Autobiography </I>appeared, some who had watched her career from Christianity to Freethought, from Freethought to Socialism, and from Socialism to Theosophy, prophesied that she would pass from Theosophy to something else. But she showed that in Theosophy she did find the peace she sought, and as she passed away forty years later, she proved to the world that Theosophy was indeed the gospel of her highest consecration.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Annie Besant has a record of a manifold work. As Orator she gave the Wisdom, and revealed the ‘vision splendid.’ As Teacher she was a guide to thousands, counselling and encouraging. As Organizer in many departments of work, and especially in the political, she was ever the statesman, who stressed principles and minimized differences in methods of work. She was also ever the Mother, full of understanding and giving comfort and strength to those who came to her, To a few she was a wonderful Friend with whom she communed, sharing with them her hopes and dreams. In a supreme manner she was always the Inspirer, because she drew out the best in those who came to her for counsel and comfort.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her life was one of complete sacrifice and renunciation. Never was there a month when she was not face to face with difficulties and struggles; but as she tried to surmount them, there was a very special quality in her mind and heart. There are hundreds today in India who are valiant and noble and  show a heroic quality in their self-sacrifice. But Annie Besant was different because, while she was a leader, she herself as leader followed an invisible Leader. Because of this characteristic in her of the mystic and the occultist, all her actions were un-hesitating and directed by the certainty of serving her Master. Therefore, in failure she was never discouraged or hopeless, and in success, whilst she rejoiced in the work done, the joy of it was offered by her with utmost consecration to her Master.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever she worked at was not her plan, but the plan of that Leader who was invisible to others but visible to her. We may all believe in the invisible, but there are only a few of us who have succeeded in making that invisible pour through the visible, as a waterfall pours through the transformers of a power-house till the flow of water is transformed into electric power. In her, whose consciousness was always in touch with invisible realms, the invisible poured through her visible world, transforming every thought, feeling and action into joyous service of the Great Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To those of us who are in a special manner her disciples, she gave a very definite message. In her last signature, after the words ‘Annie Besant,’ she added ‘Warrior.’ In that word she showed one source of power in the life of the mystic and the occultist. That source is described in <I>Light on the Path </I>as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Look for the Warrior, and let him fight in. thee. Obey him, not as though he were a general, but as though he were thyself, and his spoken words the utterance of thy secret desires; for he is thyself, yet infinitely wiser and stronger than thyself.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of us must find by our experiments in spirituality who is this Warrior, with whose strength and wisdom we fight in the battle with utmost courage. When the Warrior directs our combat, then it is true:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My strength is as the strength of ten,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because my heart is pure.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For, when the Great Plan pours through each little plan of our consecration, then the utmost purity irradiates each word and deed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The life of Annie Besant, to those of her disciples who understood her, is an example of what the Master of Masters said in Palestine. &quot;My Father worketh hitherto and I work.&quot; With her struggles and successes and hopes and dreams, she gave the testimony that the world of the Spirit is the greatest of realities, that each of us can find the Warrior who shall direct our battle, and that the first true happiness begins when we discover the Supreme Worker who sends us into life to do His work.</P>

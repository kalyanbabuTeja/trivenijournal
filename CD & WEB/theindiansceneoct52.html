provision of Executive control. Vigorously defending it, Prime Minister </span><span

strong opposition to the special treatment offered to Kashmir as against other
Part B. States. The Prime Minister had a day </span><span style='font-size:

discussion and made a comprehensive statement on the genesis and course of the
relations with Kashmir and India’s commitments in the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the administrative side, the custody of the Executive Government by the veteran
statesman Sri C. Rajagopalachari, the Chief Minister of Madras, has been marked
by a series of measures of fundamental importance. Madras was the first State
to embark boldly on derationing. This has led to several steps by other states:
Rationing was abolished in parts of Hyderabad; wheat derationed in the whole
State; Saurashtra gave up statutory rationing from 1st August; Rajasthan
adopted derationing with caution; Bihar withdrew restrictions on the flow of
wheat and milo, and Mysore City was derationed. The second momentous steps
taken by Rajaji was the Tanjore Cultivators’ Ordinance. In Government’s anxiety
for justice and fair-play between landlord and </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tenant, certain
safeguards have been enforced to benefit the actual cultivator of the soil.
This example has been followed by Hyde</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rabad in its decision
to forbid the eviction of tenants by landlords. Already there is a demand to
extend the Ordinance to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>other districts besides Tanjore. The
third measure of far-reaching importance is Rajaji’s proposal to the Central
Government to reserve the manufacture of bordered dhoties and co1oured sarees
to the handloom industry. Fifty lakhs of people are affected by the slump in
the handloom products market. If the Centre agrees to the far-seeing suggestion
of the Madras Government, the handloom weavers and their families will be
afforded a much needed relief. Hyderabad is giving three lakhs in the form of
loans to the handloom industry of that State. The fourth and most important
measure of Rajaji’s Ministry is the effort that it is making to improve the
finances of the States. Facing a big gap in its resources by having to afford
relief to drought-affected districts–having already spent six crores so far and
requiring to spend a further four crores of rupees–many important
nation-building projects are being held up. It is an admitted fact of the
current situation in India, that the Centre holds in its control the most
profitable sources of income, such as Income-tax, Railways, Posts and
Telegraphs, and the major ports. The States are admonished not to lean too much
on the Centre, while they have no elastic resources. At the Finance Ministers’
Conference which is just meeting in New Delhi (October 14th) Rajaji is waging a
gallant fight against the bureaucratic tradition, inherited by the Central
Government, to release the stranglehold and let the States also have a share of
the milch-cow’s yield, instead of having to be content with lean and famished
cattle, using a simile employed by Rajaji himself. If he succeeds in his
efforts, all the States in India will breathe a sigh of relief and proceed with
fresh confidence to fulfil the various pending projects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Among the Central Ministers prominent in the news by
their tours, Mr. Kidwai has extensively acquainted himself with the Food
situation over the whole country. He has laid down that the policy will be for
decontrol whenever foodgrain stocks are sufficient. His important steps are the
relieving by the Central Government of the responsibility for Greater Calcutta,
leaving the State Government to discharge their duty to the State of West
Bengal; the advice tendered to Travancore-Cochin to save the subsidy for rice
and use the crores saved for cottage industries’ development, and switch over
to wheat in place of rice; his scheme for Zonal grouping of States for pooling
food resources by-contiguous areas. Mr. V. V. Giri, the Central Labour
Minister, having the advantage of his life-long experience of labour
leadership, has contacted several leading Trade Union organisations and has
suggested proper democratic methods, avoidance of outsiders in places of
control in the various Unions, merger into more homageneous groups, and
avoidance of unnecessary arbitration Courts by evolving a technique of direct
negotiations between employers and workers. There has just concluded at Naini
Tal a conference of labour representatives, and after a questionaire and a
tri-partite discussion between Government, employers and workers, a new <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt'>Labour Relations Bill is proposed to be
brought before the Central Legislature. Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari, the Commerce
and Indus</span>tries Minister, who has astonished Parliament with his rapid
mastery of a particularly tricky department whose policies have the record in
India for frequent changes, has made breath-taking tours in all industrial
areas and studied the relations between Industry and Government. He attended a
Cottage Industries’ Conference, all States being asked to draw up programmes
while the Centre undertakes to provide technical help. A subsidised Housing
scheme is proposed with a capital of nine crores, forty thousand units are in
prospect; regional Housing boards will be constituted which will be given fifty
per cent grant and fifty per cent loans; slum clearance will have priority. The
Commerce Minister has had the satisfaction of seeing the sugar output reaching
the 5 years’ target, three-fourths self-sufficiency in cotton production,
Indian mills no longer dependent on foreign jute, and yarn production having
reached its peak. It is proposed to start new industries for South India which
is poorly developed, with Cottage industries as a special wing. A high power
handloom board is on the cards. Recently a committee has been constituted to
consider State trading schemes, to see what extent of export is advisable and
to stabilise quality control. It is also proposed to set up development
councils for seven industries, with nominated chairmen in the first instance,
to study problems of better production, cheaper, better goods, and
rehabilitation and modcrnisation of existing machinery, and also new desirable
industries. One of the measures proposed is a cess on mill yarn to give relief
to handloom weavers.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the adjournment of Parliament Pandit Nehru also undertook tours–the first to
Kashmir, partly to reassure the people there of the sympathy of the country and
partly to recoup his mind and body in one of the rare relaxations of which he
is<i> </i>so fond. Gazing at his beloved<i> </i>vale of Kashmir in sight of the
over-hanging snows, Nehru’s buoyant spirit must have regained elasticity and
new rhythm for his strenuous life of unceasing labour. His second tour was to
Indore in the 2nd week of September. The convention of Congress legislators and
the A.I.C.C. meetings gave an opportunity for bringing together the organisational
and parliamentary Wings<i> </i>of the Congress Party. As President of the
Congress, Pandit Nehru stressed the need for united effort<i> </i>to bring
about economic development. India’s national wealth, he said, was labour and
man-power, not silver or gold. He reiterated the suggestion made three years
ago by Mr. B. G. Kher that all University students must put in social work
before degrees are awarded. The Prime Minister visited Hyderabad State in the
last week of September to see for himself how the first popular Government
installed six months ago was tackling its problems. He took opportunity to
criticise parochialism and stressed the need to think in terms of the nation.
He was against the disintegration of Hyderabad State, as it would retard
economic progress. The highlight of his tours was his visit to Rayalaseema and
adjoining drought affected areas for a first-hand appraisal of the situation
and his three-day halt at Madras. He rose to his greatest stature at the mass
meeting at Madras on 9th October, when, addressing a three-lakh audience for
over two hours, Pandit Nehru opened out his heart to the sympathetic citizens
of, what he termed, the intellectual capital of India. In a speech of deep
penetration, intense sympathy, and calm rational analysis, this great social
thinker, this valiant soldier of emancipation, this radiant spirit with the
fire of patriotism, opened the eyes of Madras to the great call of rebuilding a
New India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most outstanding event of the quarter is the epoch-making inauguration of the
Community Development Projects on 2nd October by President Rajendra Prasad.
This significant scheme, a direct result of the Indo-American Technical
Co-operation Agreements signed earlier in the year, had been prepared for, weeks
before; on 21st July was organised a training camp for 90 project workers
including four women at Nilo-Kheri, the model township near Delhi. Addressing
the camp at its inauguration by a radio broadcast, Pandit Nehru explained the
aims of the Community Projects: Improvement of the human being, technical skill
to be brought into use in every-day life, growth from the bottom upwards,
partnership in a tremendous enterprise,–the officers working in the project
abjuring conceit but making a humble approach. The President in his
Inauguration Speech, also broadcast, explained the nature of this momentous
undertaking which comprises 55 schemes, 18,000 villages, and an area of 27,000
Sq. miles. It involves an expenditure of 38 crores and concerns the welfare of
50 million people. Each project will cover roughly 300 villages, 15,000 acres
of land, and a minimum of two lakhs of population. While each department of
Government approached the Government through its own hierarchy, the project
worker is </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>meant to short-circuit departmental routine. In
the working of the project are included house-building, road-making,
canal-digging, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>school-houses, medical and health units,
co-operative farming, multi-purpose co-operative societies, cottage industries
and a host of other occupations. Eighty per cent of the cost is labour which
the people will contribute as their share of the enterprise; the other twenty
per cent of the cost, by way of supervision, technical aid and implements, will
be the cost of the scheme to Government. The secret is that the villager has a
lot of idle time on his hands, because the cultivation season is only four or
five months over four-fifths of the country. This time will be utilised by the
scheme for voluntary labour. This is the only effective way of raising the
quality of the common man in India, his standards of life, and his output of
nation-building. It is the hope of Pandit Nehru and the protagonists of the
Project Plan that the number of projects will multiply from year to year, and
before the first five years are completed, at least a lakh and a half of the
villages of India, a fourth of the total, will be benefitted by the scheme. If
the quality of the work is not allowed to deteriorate, the face of the country
will change in 20 years and a New India will have been built.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Indian engineers). The launching of the Jala-Pushpa on 9th July by the Planning
Minister, marked the tenth ship built at Visakhapatnam shipyard and the first

proposed to be built. A new pig-iron plant is under projection. The Indian
Council of Agricultural Research is planning to experiment with a special,
drought-resisting variety of grass to be imported form South America; the
Annamalai University is having a special training course opened in Agriculture,
with emphasis on field work. Bombay is to have a State Agricultural Station. A
special Forest Training Institute is being sponsored by the F.A.O. and the
Government of India jointly. On July 16th a Road Research Conference was opened

Dhanbad; a Salt Research Laboratory will function in Saurashtra. Assam has led
the rest of India in making social service compulsory in secondary education.
The repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act in Madhya Pradesh has freed sixty lakhs
of tribal people; a five year plan for tribal welfare envisages the expenditure
of one crore of rupees. The Punjab has a five year plan; two thousand tube
wells are to be sunk in five years, thirteen lakhs are allotted for takkavi
loans. Schemes for power development are at work in the Punjab, U.P., Bengal

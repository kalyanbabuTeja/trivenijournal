style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
listened to all types of music in all parts of India including the present
Pakistan at Lahore. I have attended several performances in Bengal,
Maharashtra, Bombay, Poona, Chittagong, Jullander, Lucknow, Amritsar,
Allahabad, Benares, Trivandrum and Vizagapatam besides Madras. Hindustani music
itself has several branches like the schools of Bhatkhande represented today by
Pandit Ratanjankar, of Pandit Vishnu Digambar represented by Pandit Omkarnath,
of Gopeshwar Banerjee of Bengal and the new occidental re-orientation of
Bengali music by Rabindranath Tagore. I have even tried to learn and play
Hindustani music for three years on the violin under a pupil of the late Vishnu
Digambar while at Calcutta. My experience tells me that the several musical
cultures of India should develop as emanating from a federation of peoples
speaking different languages–for each language has its own intonation, though
up till now the artistic communicable content of sound is fairly the same in
the <i>raga </i>forms of Carnatic music, whether the music is couched in
Telugu, Tamil, Kanarese, Malayalam or Sanskrit due to peculiar historic and
other influences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Early
in 1935, Jagadguru Sri Sankaracharya of Kumbakonam Mutt asked me at Banaras
after two violin recitals of mine at his behest, about the important
differences between Carnatic and Hindustani music. I expressed the opinion that
Tyagaraja’s music in his Kritis is the highest of melodic art (Kala) I have
known–by then I had travelled in continent of Europe and heard various melodies
of different countries–and as I was hesitating for the correct word, commenting
on the sweetness of Hindustani music in Vilambita time (fairly slow tempo) and
the lack of <i>Vivara </i>(a Tamil word) or explicitness is swara singing, he
suggested the word ‘Pamara’ meaning ‘for the masses’. Long after, I put the
same question to the late Sangita Kalanidhi Muthiah Bhaga</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>vatar
after he had served the Mysore Darbar for a few years and his travel in North
India; his reply was: Hindustani music is ‘Manushya’ m</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>usic,
meaning ‘human with its mass appeal’ while Tyagaraja’s music is ‘deivika’
meaning ‘divine and transporting’. It is perhaps time one should give some
thought to these pronouncements. Of course one can easily recognise at least a
dozen Hindustani ragas akin to those of Carnatic music–but the raga forms are
not the same, owing to micro-tonal changes in the swaras (notes) and the
arrangement of musical phrases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of an analytic mind, I should place before discerning artists the features of
‘reason in Carnatic music’ in other words ‘Hellenism’ which Matthew Arnold used
for culture. Though it is commonly said that Hindu music has its bases on the
Sama Vedic chant, which has left its impress in the Carnatic Ritigaula raga in
descent I may state that the foundations of Carnatic music have been freshly
laid by about 1550 A.D. when Ramamatya wrote his ‘Swaramela Kalanidhi’ as a
Grammar to the then existing music. The superstructure thereon built by the
trinity of Carnatic music Tyagaraja, Dikshitar and Syama Sastri has reached
majestic heights, if I may suggest an architectural comparison, like gopurams
of the great Shiva temple at Tanjore or the Subrahmanya temple near its
precincts, unlike the small-domes on the Belur Temple on the banks of the
Hoogli near the Ramakrishna Mutt or those lining the banks of the Ganges at
Banaras, or the Muslim Imambaras at Lucknow–for Tyagaraja has composed melodies
in over 200 mela and janya ragas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Firstly,
as already referred to it is probably from the days of Ramamatya i.e., from the
middle of the 16th century that the <i>vina </i>has been fretted with the 12
fixed frets to the octave or 24 frets for the two octaves as he refers to ‘<i>Chala-mela</i>’
<i>vina </i>and the ‘<i>Sthira-mela</i>’ <i>vina</i>, the latter representing
the one fixed with frets. Even today, North Indian fretted instrumets have only
moveable frets like the Sitar, played by a a plectrum, and the Esraj and the
Dilruba similar to Sitar, but bowed. [The non-fretted important instruments
are: (1) the Sarangi played generally against the finger nails with a bow; (2)
Sarod with a metal plate for its finger board but played with a plectrum; (3)
the Vichitra vina (corresponding to our Gottuvadyam) and played with a plectrum
by a moving glass thick rod of a peculiar oval shape, instead of the cylindrical
ebony rod used for Gottuvadyam]. All the 12 frets to the octave have not been
placed on the Sitar and Esraj. For some swarasthanas or fret positions, the
edges of thin copper or brass tubes of an inverted segmental shape are bound to
the body of the Sitar by a cotton string; the tube is shifted laterally by
displacement to obtain other swaras when different ragas are played. They seem
to have no fixed bases or “stepping stones” on which they could rest in several
places. The <i>vina </i>itself of Northern India, which I had seen at
Chittagong consists only of a large-sized bamboo tube, which is the real
resonator though fretted with fixed metal frets (about this see later), the two
gourds serving only for ornamental purposes and to rest on the human body;
while in our South Indian vina–adorning the picture of Saraswati by Ravi
Varma–produced at Tanjore, the fluted gourd on which the bridge rests as well
as the slanting tube of varying cross section under the fixed frets, act as a
single resonator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Secondly,
the four playing strings on all the North Indian instruments mentioned above
are tuned to the pitches Ma Sa Pa Sa–the Sarangi has only 3 playing strings,
Sa, Ma or Pa, and Sa–while on the Carnatic <i>vina </i>they are tuned as Sa Pa
Sa Pa/the dots below show swaras of lower octaves. The important changes in the
playing strings should be noticed. The Ma string has been discarded in the
Carnatic vina; the ostensible reason is that though Suddha Ma coalesces with Sa
it is not an upper partial of shadja or a svayambhu-swara. This makes a lot of
difference in the very process of fretting of the <i>vina</i>, as will be
referred shortly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thirdly,
another important change is in the pronouncing of the swara dhaivata, a word
hailing from the days of Panini, in abbreviation as Da or da in swara singing,
the consonant being soft and unaspirate. This feature is a result of an
accidental and supreme discovery of the 5th upper partial Ga at the fret Da on
the South Indian <i>vina</i>. Ahobala who lived about a hundred years later,
and had read Ramamatya did not realise this musical fact–<i>vide</i>
Bhatkhande’s “A Comparative Study of some of the Leading Music Systems of the
15th to 18th Centuries” wherein he refers to the fact of the ambiguity of the
fixation of the fret of dhaivata, Da–vide page 28 sub-para ‘Observation.’ That
is to say, the Carnatic Da in the fret is A and not A+ as described in Western
nomenclature. Hindustani musicians even today aver that A + is the note for
them as Pandit Ratanjankar told me at the recent Conference of the Music
Academy–while this A + or Da+ is only left as a vestige or produced in a gamaka
form in Carnatic music. Again the Komal da (according to Hindustani) or Shuddha
da according to Carnatic is pronounced da unaspirate–vide Carnatic Thodi or
Saveri; for the aspirate dha will lose its musical quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fourthly,
all melodic music should be consonant with the shadja or the fundamental pitch
of the singer and its fifth as it is usually called panchama. Therefore, the
tambura or the drone is an important adjunct in melodic music. It has a gourd
and a straight tube attached to it acting as a single resonator. It has four
strings to play on i.e., to say to be plucked consecutively and they are tuned
with the pitches Pa Sa Sa Sa. The pitches of the swaras of the strings are
mentioned in the order of plucking them by the finger. It will be noticed that
the two middle shadjas are of the same pitch; the last string gives the shadja
of a lower octave and coalesces with it. The first string to be plucked is
lower than the two middle shadja strings and practically forms the lowest pitch
upto which the voice of the singer reaches in most cases; the trained voice can
go down to the shadja still lower. The Hindustani musician does also tune the
tambura accordingly, but he has certain vagaries, not correct according to
scientific principles. In a raga where suddha madhyama is predominant and
panchama is either absent or almost absent, he will reduce the Pa string to
madhyama pitch. This is entirely against the spirit of the Carnatic
understanding of melody. Carnatic music has so many ragas in which panchama is <i>varjya
</i>or absent; yet we study the music in relation to this shadja and panchama.
The latter does not act as a hindrance, but enables one to grasp the said
raga-forms better. Further, when the Hindustani vocalist has two tamburas on
either side for the drone, occasionally where Ni is an important swara he
introduces Ni in one of the tamburas for Pa. The swara Ni is a Vivadi note
being too near Sa and can only produce a certain sense of discord in the ear
and this procedure is not in vogue now in Carnatic music and I am pretty sure
every South Indian will agree that the Hindustani procedure is not
scientifically and aesthetically correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are occasions where the Carnatic musician also changes the Pa string of the
tambura to Ma. But then, it is called madhyama sruti. That is to say, the Ma
becomes the fundamental Sa of the singer for the subsequent music and Sa
becomes Pa of the same music, so that all melodic music of South India is
understood in relation to the shadja and its panchama in unison. I must also
refer to the beginner’s lessons in Mayamalavagaula (or Bhair’on That) in South
India, and not in Sankarabharana as in the North to familiarize the student of
music with <i>quarter tones</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

in many of the stringed instruments e.g., Sarod, Esraj and Sarangi the
Hindustani musician has twelve resonant strings to correspond to the twelve
swarasthanas of the octave. Thus he belies the ancient Hindu theory of 22
srutis or pitches in the octave. Sometimes he has twenty-four for a lower and a
higher octave. These resonant strings give to my ears only a buzz and it seems
almost a noise for me. The Sarangi has as many as 34 resonant strings, the 12
swaras to the octave being repeated. Until these twelve resonant strings are
given up, music cannot rise up to a higher melodic sensation. In this
connection, I must also refer to the pronunciation of the abbreviated swara Ri
or ri; he calls it Re or re. The vowel sound which the South Indian uses
corresponds to that in the word pit, whereas the Hindustani vowel sound
corresponds to a shortening of the vowel as in fate. One more important feature
I must mention, regarding vowel sounds. In the sapta or seven swaras Sa Ri Ga
Ma Pa Da Ni, four of them end in the vowel sound ‘a,’ sounded as long or short
as in Rama, while the second vowel “i’ is sounded long or short as in Sita.
These sounds ‘aa’ and ‘e’ are Sanskritic vowel sounds; in spite of the fact
that music is supposed to have arisen from the mystic symbol OM consisting of
the vowels AUM, the U sound as in ‘put’ is not apparently sufficiently musical
for its being included in the <i>sapta </i>swara endings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a reference must now be made to the fretting of the South Indian <i>vina </i>by
means of 12 fixed frets in the octave. It is very rarely that the <i>vina</i>
player himself does the <i>melam</i>, as this process is called, and it is
given over to the <i>vina</i>-maker himself or some other substitute worker. To
my knowledge, the <i>vina </i>is not an instrument of equal temparament like
the Piano. It has twelve unequal semi tones to the octave, whereas in the Piano
the 12 semitones are theoretically equal. If one would investigate into the <i>melam
</i>one will find that the Ri on Sa string is slightly lower in pitch than the
Ri on the Pa string. Also that the ga on the Sa string is slightly lower in
pitch than the ga on the Pa string. There are other features which I cannot
dilate upon in the course of this small article.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
consonances between swaras are of four kinds. Firstly, the shadja-madhyama
relationship, the shadja-panchama reletionship, the shadja-antaragandhara
relationship and the shadja-sadharana gandhara relationship; the relative
frequencies may be said to be respectively as 1:4/3–1:3/2–1:5/4–and 1:6/5. The
last two are called in European phraseology the major third relationship and
the harmonic minor third relationship. It will be noticed that the swaras of
two arasthanas of the same name in the Sa and Pa strings will coalesce on one
but not on both the Sa and Pa strings. There is another feature still in the
South Indian music, that is recognised by me by constant hearing to both violin
and <i>vina</i> music of a high standard, namely, the process of inversion by
the voice of swaras both by a major third or a minor third. I can only give a
single example in this article. Let the voice stop at the Suddha-madhyama; and
an attempt be made to produce the pitch Ri. The Ri will be of a relative
frequency of 10/9, a minor tone above Sa, and not the frequency of 9/8, a major
tone above Sa. [Further, the South Indian mind has also found within the last
century and a half a process of inversion by a <i>septimal minor </i>third, a
frequency ratio of 7/6.] By these inversions, South Indian music has been able
to obtain a facility of singing the highest melodic art that is known to the
world. It is to facilitate such a complex musical structure that the madhyama
string is rejected from the playing strings of the <i>vina</i>, while this
feature has not yet been achieved in the North Indian stringed musical
instruments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

cannot but refer to a question put to me by Pandit Ratanjankar during his last
visit to Madras, why we always play ga in gamaka i.e., why the sadharana
gandhara (Carnatic nomenclature) or the Komala gandhara (Hindustani nomenclature)
is played in gamaka. I explained to him that once the previous sound Ri or ri
is reached, it is not possible to get straight to the ‘ga,’ though it is
possible that we could and do reach the ‘ga’ straight or prolonged from either
Sa or Ma. These delicate processes of methods of approach are understood fully
only by instrumentalists, either a <i>vina</i>-player or a violin-player of
South India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

should like only to add that Hindustani Music with emotional exuberances should
not be forced down the throats of our South Indian musicians and just as the
Hindustani language purely colloquial with no standard literature of any worth
is forced to be learnt for political purposes. I am aware that many of our high
class South Indian musicians can produce similar effects like the highest
Hindustani music, but I am pretty sure that the North Indian musicians cannot
make even a feeble attempt to copy us, because of all the handicaps I have
shown above. The Hindustani musician will soon find his level when he tries to
reproduce his vocal music on the South Indian <i>vina</i>. Then he will
probably get the realisation of its larger possibilities of the ten to fifteen
gamakas existing in South Indian music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I should add I am not stating anything new, but have only abridged what I have
already been talking about from the year 1931 onwards. These ideas have been
published in the form of a book in 1939, “The Grammar of South Indian Music.”
That book was written from an ab-initio study of the <i>vina</i>, and it is
only very recently within the last year I have tried to understand the
experimental observations, which Ramamatya suggests in his book
‘Swaramela-Kalanidhi,’ on which I have put this plausible interpretation and it
seems that he came to similar conclusions in regard to the science of music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

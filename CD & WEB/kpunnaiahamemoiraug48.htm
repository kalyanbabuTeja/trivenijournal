mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>“GET ready for another of your adventures. I know
you are always game for one.” These were the last words my brother uttered to
me on July 25 as I was leaving Bombay for Delhi just after the first days
session of the Editors’ Conference. He had in mind the pressing request of his
Sindhi Hindu friends to start or take over an English daily paper in Bombay and
run it on their behalf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His mind was, of course, full of the Hindus of
Sind. He knew they had not got a fair deal from the Union. He wanted to take up
their cause and asked for my co-operation. Previously we had met at Ootacamund
for the ECAFE, enjoyed the treat, farce and fun and discussed plans for an
English daily for the Andhras. That was dropped for the new project. The old
war horse could not rest in retirement. He wanted work as soon as he was
restored to health and strength after the recent domestic shocks and
calamities. The Editors’ Conference, the annual diversion of the profession,
drew him to Bombay from which he was never to return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His death has been described as a ‘mystery’.
Nothing of that kind. He knew the end was coming. I for one daily feared it
was. He was sixty-four and had suffered enormously in recent years from the
loss of two brilliant sons, a grandson and a son-in-law, who was a D.F.C., not
to speak of the deaths of members of our family younger than himself. Pakistan
and partition had ruined his life’s work. His own life was in peril in Karachi.
It was only his infinite faith in God and prayer that sustained him. He was
welcoming work to forget the host of sorrows and travails that had fallen to
his lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The old heart trouble which had subsided and
practically disappeared for twenty years in the salubrious climate of Karachi
revived later and was acutely troubling a much-distressed man. He found it
difficult even to walk and often panted for breath after covering a little
distance. He was not able to sustain a long conversation without stopping in
the middle. It was only his happy, though attenuated, family and the visits of
friends for talk and enlightenment on public questions that kept him going. If
sudden death is a mercy and a blessing, he was happy in death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His tragic end in Bombay recalls the beginnings of
his life and career in that city of romance. First son of a very poor family he
was the hope of my father. Yet he could not manage to pass the matriculation
examination. In later years I saw in a pile of family documents the mathematics
examination paper of 1901 or 1902 he had to answer. It was quite clean but for
a marginal note: “I can answer none of these questions. Good God, help me!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His failure came as a calamity to the family. The
paternal disappointment was great and the scolding that followed was too much
for him. He decided to run away, then as now, to Bombay the chief attraction of
adventurous youth. The little money he had in hand did not carry him beyond
Warangal, now bulking so largely in the day’s new about Hyderabad. He has left
it on record that he had an acute attack of dysentery there and unable to buy
medicine he began to pray–and recovered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Working up his way to Bombay somehow, he wandered
over the pavements till he picked up an odd job or two, not hesitating to do
work which an educated Brahmin boy will never do. In a square in Kalbadevi he
showed me, one day, a house where he carried water up to the third floor for a
South Indian gentleman who engaged his services for free food and shelter.
Twenty-four years after, he spotted him by accident in a park in Mysore where
we had gone together after the Madras session of the Congress in 1927. Though
he had received no generous treatment from the gentleman, he remembered that he
had given him food and shelter at a time when he needed it and he prostrated
himself before him, revealing his identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Introduced to Mr. K. Nageswara Rao, who had just
then begun his romantic career as a business man with Amrutanjan–“I will make
it as famous as Beecham’s Pills or Little’s Oriental Pain Balm,” was his
inspiring motto to himself–he was taken as a clerk and soon made his mark by
his honesty and industry. It was the era of individual approach and one of his
main tasks was to post advertisement leaflets about Mr. Nageswara Rao’s
numerous medical products to village officers. He wrote out the addresses for
years. He told me he knew almost the whole of the Postal and Telegraph Guide by
heart. Helped by his able assistant, Mr. Nageswara Rao performed another
miracle of his famous career–the starting of a Telugu weekly from far-off Bombay.
It succeeded remarkably well, my brother sharing the editorial and managerial
work. He acquired a good settled style of Telugu, which never left him in later
life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The spirit stirred Mr. Nageswara Rao and he wanted
to transform the weekly <i>Andhra Patrika </i>into a daily and change the venue
to Madras. Being a trusted servant and colleague, he begged Punnaiah to stay
behind in Bombay and look after Amrutanjan which after all was to provide the
wherewithal to keep the newspaper venture going. Here was a very nice
opportunity to make money, but Punnaiah declined, saying that his interest in
life was not money but public work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Acting as manager of the Telugu daily, he helped in
tiding it over in the crisis of the 1914-18 War, but journalism was his main
attraction, and so he switched on to the editorial side, doing the English
section (War Supplement) with considerable distinction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Soon he started a side-show of his own. <i>Humanity
</i>made its modest appearance as a fortnightly, chiefly to serve the cause of
social reform and the Brahmo Samaj. I was a student in Madras then and was his
principal co-operator, its ‘editor’ in his absence. I was to report lectures
delivered in the City on the neglected subjects of religious and social
importance and here began my own journalism. I was to pass proofs to the press,
to write reviews, to write in legible script (my handwriting was quite good
then) the manuscripts that were not easy to read, to write the address on the
wrappers. The paper had a small circulation, but the clientele were among the
best in the land–the cream of the intelligentsia of the Brahmo Samaj. Punnaiah
began his pioneer work as ‘Digambar,’ a personal column on current events which
became highly popular. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sadhu Vaswani, who was a prolific contributor to <i>Humanity</i>,
offered Punnaiah the assistant editorship of the <i>New Times </i>in December,
1918 and he accepted it, little knowing that the change of scene was to be the
start of a great career for him in journalism. I take credit for this which–he
was hesitating but I told him to jump at it. He would succeed because he had
both ability and character to carry him through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The rest of the story is well known from the
obituary notices that have appeared in the papers already. From the <i>New
Times</i>, which I joined four months later, he went over to the <i>Sind
Observer</i>, just then turned into a daily, and soon became its editor. He
made it an authentic organ of Hindu nationalism in Sind and a powerful organ of
public opinion in India. If a near comparison is permitted, I would say that he
did to the <i>Sind Observer </i>what J. A. Spender did to the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i>–he elevated an obscene, little-known provincial paper to one of
great importance in respect of opinion. He was helped by the fact that it was
attached to no party. The early proprietors had no direct interest in politics
and he was free to shape the policy as he pleased. I can say with pardonable
pride but with supreme confidence that he was the most successful provincial
journalist of his generation. There was much admiration between him and Mr.
Kalinath Ray of the <i>Tribune</i>. The giant once paid the younger man a
compliment by saying: “Punnaiah, yours is among the first few papers I read
every day. Like me you are attached to no party and you are free to speak out.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Every English-knowing Sindhi will admit, I am sure,
that he owes his political education to Punnaiah of the <i>Sind Observer</i>–the
pastor and mentor of the province for thirty long years. He dominated, without
taking directly part in it, the public life of Sind. He was the best known
citizen of Karachi after that saint and sage, Mr. Jamshed N. R. Mehta. He
founded a school, a housing society, a bank, a co-operative stores. He was the
life and soul of the local Brahmo Samaj.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>By his personal reporting of municipal meetings in
an individual column by ‘Cream-Cracker,’ he made municipal reporting a fine
department of journalism and kept up public interest in municipal affairs. The
grateful citizens have called a nook of Karachi Punniapur. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Punnaiah wrote his signature on every political
movement of Sind since 1919–Rowlatt Bill, Satyagraha, Khilafat movement,
Non-co-operation, Sind Separation, Sukkur Barrage constitutional reforms. It
required a prudent and resourceful journalist to keep his feet steady in the
shifting and treacherous sands of Sind politics and he was always steady. He
was often in the confidence of ministers, Alia Bux particularly. His office and
house alike were invaded by politicians eager for advice and eager to give the
news to a friendly editor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Punnaiah had a workmanlike style. His judgment was
sound; his opinions were his own. He commanded and respected confidences an
emotional nature and a pugnacious temper, which are a family inheritance, he
added a resourcefulness and prudence, not exactly in the family. This carried
him through. During the first twenty-five years of his editorship the paper
rarely came, into trouble. The last ten years were stormy but he rode the storm
with remarkable skill and courage. He wrote with conviction, suffered with passion,
and carried contagious belief to the writer by the downrightness of his
writing. His power of analysis was keen, mastery of his subject sure. He was
versatile and could write on any subject with great care. His war articles were
among the best in the land. I saw him listen-in to the radio ten times a day to
gather his views and news first-hand from both sides of the war game. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>His special contribution to Indian journalism was
highly valuable in some respects. ‘Shot and Shell’ by Vinode and ‘Peeps into
the City Council’ by ‘Cream-Cracker’ eagerly engaged the reader. He was his own
special correspondent on big occasions. He wrote interesting personal sketches.
He was prolific. His output was prodigious. He had the supremest quality of a
successful journalist: he was always lively and always kept the ball in action.
To be dull is a great crime in journalism. And Punnaiah was never dull and
never could be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Now to matters purely personal. It is permitted to
a brother to reveal the splendid sacrifices he made for the family. From the
first day he began to earn till the last he made his monthly contribution. To
me the help he gave was immense. He spent half his meager earnings on my
college education. To innumerable poor relatives or fellow workers or the Brahmo
Samaj a monthly money order from him was a certainty. He was a good father and
a good husband. He was helpful to South Indians visiting Karachi and his lovely
house in Punniapur was u centre of attraction to visitors to that great
airport. Dr. Tarabai, his gracious wife, was an ideal hostess. His genius for

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Coming early under the influence of the Brahmo
Samaj and Viresalingam Pantulu, he was a practical social reformer and made a
marriage that cut across religion, caste, community, and language. He believed
in prayer. As I don’t we had perpetual quarrels, theological and otherwise, and
never agreed. “My dear fellow, don’t be a fool. I also pray for you every day,”
he would tell me admonishingly. He loved to worship quietly and did not like,
for instance, the Gandhian mass prayer meetings. He had few hobbies. He loved
an occasional game of cards and hardly ever won. He loved gardening. Long walks
braced him up. He could cook grandly and taught the hillmen from Almora to cook
like the Brahmins of the Kistna district. He had a few peccadillos also. He
never failed to buy a Derby and a St. Leger’s ticket. He would jokingly tell me
that if he won he would give me a good portion and pension me off from my
restless life and create a trust for the poor relations and friends. He had
more than a tentative belief in spiritualism. Spirit-rapping became almost
regular in a house which lost one too many in recent years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The tragedies of the late years shook him
tremendously. Flesh and blood could not have borne that infinity of suffering
that fell to his lot. More than the loss of his children at an age when he
would rest on them, the loss of Sind to India, the Sind he had loved and worked
for thirty years, saddened and darkened his life. He was eager to get back to
work and take up the refugees’ cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

trust that even the Pakistanis will, out of respect for history which cannot be
wiped out so easily, remember him and keep the name of ‘Punniapur.’ It is a
fortunate mispronunciation, but that is where this good and true man belongs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evolving a language policy for India, it is necessary to evaluate and reconcile
the somewhat conflicting claims of the several languages. While nobody should
be prevented from learning as many languages as he pleases, nobody should be
obliged to learn more languages than he needs for his work and enjoyment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rational
consideration of the language policy has been complicated by some current
concepts. Each language has been claimed to be the cherished inheritance of a
group of persons. For instance, the Andhras cherish the Telugu language as
their own; similarly, the British cherish the English language, and the Muslims
cherish the Arabic and Urdu languages, and so on. But, as a matter of fact,
there is no correlation between a language, and a religion, a race, a sex or a
nationality. Urdu is not the exclusive language of the Muslims, for millions of
Hindus speak it, and millions of Muslims in the world do not speak it. All the
Hindus do not speak the same language, though they have the Hindu religion in
common. All Christians in the world, who share the Christian religion, do not
speak the same language. The Swiss people have a single nationality, but not
the same language. The British and the Americans have the same language but not
the same nationality. Anybody of any race, religion or nationality, can learn
any language for work or enjoyment, if he has the need and the opportunity,
even as he can learn any branch of knowledge. Even as no knowledge can be “foreign”
to anybody, so also no language is “foreign” to anybody. “Foreign” is a
political concept, denoting a foreign nationality. If the English language were
of British “nationality”, Indian and American nationals would not be able to
use it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
concept of “my” language and “your” language is also invalid. For no language
can be “mine” since “you” can learn it; it is “ours” then. Similar is the case
with all non-material culture elements like religions, sciences, arts, customs,
etc. They cannot be “owned”, much less exclusively, by anybody. Material
culture elements, on the other hand, can be “owned”. Property can be owned, but
not language. The teacher willingly shares his knowledge with his pupils, but
not his salary! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
languages are media for the communication of thoughts, the most rational
approach to the choice of languages is their <i>current communicational
utility, </i>and the extent of their utility, and not their ancestry. Few that
love ‘Shakuntala’ speak today the language she spoke. The nature and the number
of the languages that one need learn should depend largely on the range and
variety of his communicational needs. About ninety per cent of the people who
speak a well developed language like English may not need any additional
language for most of their communicational needs. Less developed languages need
supplementary ones. The great majority of the people in any part of the world
are not likely to need more than the local major regional language for most of
their communicational needs. A few may need more, because their needs transcend
linguistic boundaries, and are national and international . For instance,
members of the Diplomatic Service need to learn several languages. While a
working knowledge of a language is enough for most needs of most people, a more
intensive knowledge is necessary for the enjoyment of literature and, even
more, for its production. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
India’s language policy is to be based on present communicational needs, what
are the current needs and how would they be best met with maximum efficiency
and minimum strain? There is a tendency to exalt the mother-tongue. The census
of India, 1951, listed over seven hundred and fifty mother-tongues. Some of
them were spoken by one citizen each! It is obviously impossible to provide education
or administration at even the lowest level in each of these mother-tongues.
Some sixty languages are the mother-tongues, each of a lakh of citizens or
more. It is nearly impossible to provide education and administration, except
at the lowest level, in each and every one of them. All of them cannot be used
or developed for all modern needs. A book corresponding to, say, the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica, </i>much less whole libraries on all subjects, can hardly ever be
produced in most of them, if only because of their very small reader-potential;
Whatever be the sentimental attachment to them as mother-tongues, most of them
must perforce be allowed to survive only as museum specimens. Kalidasa’s
Sanskrit has practically died out as a current language, and only a rare
scholar sheds tears over it. In any event, it is not seriously proposed that
each and everyone of the sixty languages should be developed for use in higher
education and administration. The Indian Constitution recognized only fourteen
languages. Among them is Sanskrit, which is the mother-tongue of only five
hundred and fifty-five Indian citizens! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every
child needs the local major regional language, if its mother-tongue be
different, for its daily communicational needs. Generally speaking, it is now
the medium of instruction for certain or all subjects of study in the
pre-college stage. It is also the language at the lower levels of
administration, where it comes into contact with the great bulk of the
population, namely, the village and the taluq. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

are those who advocate that each major regional language should be the sole
language at all levels of administration and education within its linguistic
area. They think that it is an unmerited slur on the regional languages to
suggest that they are not fit for purposes of the highest administration,
executive, legislative and judicial, and of the highest education in arts and
sciences. Some of them concede that some of the regional languages are today
not quite competent for certain purposes, they will soon be competent, if they
are made the sole media of administration and education and given the necessary
incentive. They are inspired by the sentiment of linguistic patriotism and by
the theory that the efficiency of education and administration would be best
served thereby. They are, however, prepared to ignore similar arguments on
behalf of the aborigines and of those who speak some of the minor languages and
do not hesitate to impose the regional languages on them. It amounts to
linguistic autonomy for themselves and linguistic imperialism over others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are those who hold that the regional languages of India are not yet adequately
developed for the purpose of higher administration and education, and that the
progressive modernization of India, which is very urgent, should not be made to
wait on the adequate development of the regional languages. They would accept
and continue the present bilingual policy, under which, broadly-speaking, the
regional languages are used at the lower levels of education and
administration, and the English language at the higher levels, not only because
the English language is better developed but also because of the need for an
All-India medium for such higher purposes. They would continue to have English
as the medium for the State and Central Governments, the High Courts and the
Supreme Court, and the Central, if not the State, Legislatures and for the
Universities and centres of higher education. The. communicational needs in
these cases transcend the boundaries of regional languages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
attitude is criticised by those who, while conceding the necessity for
bi-lingualism, wish the second language to be Hindi, rather than English.
Broadly speaking, they consider Hindi an “</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indian” language and
English a “foreign” language, and prefer the former to the latter on the ground
of patriotism. They insist that India, as a nation, should have a common
“national” language, if only as a second language in non-Hindi areas. They have
also the Indian Constitution on their side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
is English “non-Indian” and Hindi “Indian”? The Linguistic Census of India of
1951 classified languages spoken in India under “Indian” and “non-Indian” and
listed over seven hundred and fifty languages and dialects as “Indian”. Among
them were over ten, each of which was spoken by just one Indian, though it was
not clear to whom that person could speak in that tongue if there was no second
who understood it! They were classified as “Indian” because they were each
spoken by an “ Indian National” as his mother-tongue. Sanskrit, which was
spoken by just five hundred and fifty-five Indian nationals, was also listed
among the “Indian” languages. But English which was spoken by over one lakh and
seventy thousand people was listed as “non-Indian”. Most of these were
Anglo-Indians who speak it as their mother-tongue, and they are hundred per
cent Indian nationals. To acknowledge them as Indian nationals and describe
their mother-tongue as “non-Indian” and its use in India as a humiliation to
India is, to say the least, unreasonable, besides being humiliating to the
Anglo-Indians. English is as “Indian” as any other “Indian” language and more
useful for modern needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is generally conceded in India that the English language is very useful, nay
essential, for higher education and administration, at any rate for some time.
But its universal utility is not yet fully realized. The UNESCO has listed over
1,500 vocations practised in the world. A good many of them are practised in
India also. The efficiency of most of them is being constantly improved by an
endless stream of inventions and discoveries. Most of them find almost
immediate publication in some periodicals which are published in the English
language and which are sold at comparatively low prices because of their vast
circulation. Almost every vocation, however humble, has a magazine or two,
which publishes the latest developments in it. Many of them are well
illustrated. It will take a long time before such illustrated magazines at such
low prices are produced in any “Indian” languages because of the small market
for them. Most people have to work for their living and have to learn to do the
work. It pays them to keep abreast of the times. The best source of information
at present and for a long time to come are the vocational journals published in
the English language. Every Indian worker, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled,
stands to gain by acquiring a working knowledge of the English language. The
more it is universalized, the better for the efficiency of Indians. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
all practical purposes, bilingualism, consisting of the local regional language
and the English language, is both necessary and enough for most Indians. Other
languages may be learnt by those few who need them for their special purposes.
For instance, those who wish to study the literature of other languages in the
original, like Greek, German, Tamil, or Japanese, may learn them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
modern knowledge reaches India through the English language. In so far as Hindi
replaces English, it has to be translated into Hindi, while the non-Hindi
people of India must learn Hindi to acquire that knowledge. This procedure is
likely to slow down the flow of modern knowledge into India while India needs
to be flooded with it, as it were. It is best, therefore, to continue the
present bilingualism of the local regional language and the English language,
and extend a working knowledge of the latter among a wider circle of Indians,
as will be the case when the Three-Language-Formula is universalised. It is
best to continue the present system of horizontal bilingualism in the
administrative sphere, namely, the local regional language at the lower levels
where it touches most people, and English at the higher levels where it has to
transcend the local linguistic areas for national and international purposes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bilingualism will also avoid the current feeling that if Hindi be made the
all-India language in education or administration </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>or
both, the people of North India will have an undue advantage over the people of
South India and the consequent sense of unfairness and jealousy. It is highly
fantastic to insist that, as a measure of reciprocity, the North Indian should
learn a South Indian language! </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Hindi-speaking North </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

obliterated by the imposition of a South Indian language on him, which is of no
use to him and which he need not and will not learn as the South Indian will
have to learn Hindi. It is an unfair reciprocity which is likely to accentuate
the sense of the just grievance of the South Indian against the Hindi
imperialism of the North Indian. Far from strengthening the sense of Indian
nationalism, it will not only weaken it but will stimulate to an unhealthy, and
even dangerous, degree local linguistic pride and patriotism and the demand for
linguistic autonomy and sovereignty. If, on the other hand, the English
language is continued as the chosen medium for all-India, as for international
communications, its value, whether an advantage or a disadvantage, will be
common to both the North and the South, and neither will have an undue
advantage over the other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

increasingly realised and acknowledged. But </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the insistence on
Hindi has not been given up. Instead, a compromise of Three-Languages has been
advocated. It is to include the regional language, Hindi and English. The
latter two also are to be made compulsory from an early stage of primary
education. When compulsory primary education of eight years is universalised,
as it should be as early as possible, English and Hindi will also be
universalised in India. In course of time every citizen would know both. But it
may well be doubted if both are necessary when either of them will serve
equally well for all purposes within India. Two men do not need two languages
to communicate with each other, unless it be intended that one language should
be used for some purposes and the second for some others, which is odd! If it
is intended to eliminate English ultimately, it seems equally odd to
universalise it in the first instance at enormous effort and expense! While
Hindi can, at best, serve all-India purposes, English can serve them as well as
international purposes also and do both much better. The development of English
is not likely to wait for Hindi to catch up with it in utility, but will always
be ahead of Hindi. It should be noted that the Three-Languages and their
alphabets are to be made compulsory for school-children who </span><span

attain equally high proficiency in all of them. “Pidgeon” English, “Bazaar”
Hindi and colloquial regional languages are not enough. Since it is not
possible to anticipate the future profession of each child when it is still in
school, it should be given equal opportunities with others and must be put to
the strain of learning the three languages and three alphabets well enough to
qualify for higher positions in later life. Two languages and alphabets will
reduce the strain without reducing the opportunities for knowledge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

will lead to isolation of each State. The attempt to make Hindi the sole
official language of the Central Government has provoked the linguistic States
to adopt their regional languages for their official purposes. <i>English is
not being replaced by Hindi but by the regional languages. </i>The cost of
administration is bound to go up if every communication of the Central
Government has to be communicated to the State Governments through their
several regional languages. If each linguistic State addresses the Central
Government in its regional language, they will have to be translated into Hindi
for the use of the Central Government, at enormous cost and delay. If a
business firm has to address the several State Governments each in its regional
language, and the Government of India in Hindi, the burden of administration
will be unduly heavy. If fourteen languages are to be used for executive, judicial
and legislative purposes as well as private business, the number of books,
documents and codes etc., which will have to be translated from English into
these languages <i>Plus </i>Hindi cannot be estimated with any accuracy but the
cost is bound to be prohibitive. It appears that the Manual of drill,
ceremonial and staff duties of the Defence Forces runs into lakhs of pages; the
Railway Code into nine thousand pages; the Post and Telegraph Guides, etc.,
into over eleven thousand. The number of books in any modern and up-to-date
library runs into thousands. Modern progress in science and technology depends
more on periodicals than on formal text-books which go out of date by the time
they are published! Most of such material is now available in the English language
and at a comparatively low price. Simultaneous translation of these into
fourteen languages with the desirable accuracy and promptitude is bound to
strain the finances of India too much. If English is to be made compulsory for
all, as under the Three-Languages Formula, it is best to retain these codes
etc., in that language, and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

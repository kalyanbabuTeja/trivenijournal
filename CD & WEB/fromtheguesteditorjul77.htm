thinkers, concerned with the promulgation of wisdom without regard to racial or
geographical boundaries, were quick to call attention to the contributions of
Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. As might be expected, however, the first recognition
found print in India.* Towards the end of the first decade of this century, in
1908, Ganesh and Company, publishers in Madras, issued a three-volume work
entitled, “Indian Nation-Builders.” In the third volume, among other great men
of India, including Gandhiji and Rabindranath Tagore, honoured place was
accorded to Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. An examination of his work was presented
under the title of “A Study of Ananda Coomaraswamy” (pp. 337-366). This gave no
biographical details but offered an estimate of his writings up to that date.
It was followed by two essays of the learned Doctor, quoted in full: “Preface
to Essays in National Idealism” (pp. 366-376) and “The Oriental View of Women”
(pp. 376-382). This first called attention to the significance of
Coomaraswamy’s work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the forty years that followed, the numerous articles and books of Coomaraswamy
were at times accompanied by biographi­cal details, supplied by the editors of
the journals or the publishers of the books. The details were no more than
informative support for the treasure chest of his own writings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

flow of his wisdom continued unabated till 1947, the year of his seventieth
birthday–and of his death. The recognition he had won may be seen in the fact
that two publications­–Festschrifts–were issued to commemorate his having
attained three­score and ten. “Art and Thought” was dedicated to him, edited by
K. b. Iyer. And “A Garland of Tributes” was culled in his name, edited ** in
1947.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Unfortunately
his death came two weeks after his seventieth birthday; he passed away on
September, 9, 1947. A memorial volume, “Homage to Ananda Coomaraswamy” was
collected and edited** in 1952. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
that time came on a flood of articles about him, which continues to this day.
In 1967, twenty years after his death, Ray Livingston brought out his masterly
work, “The Traditional Theory of Literature.” After this came the publication
of “Remembering and Remembering Again and Again”. These works, and other
writings by and about Coomaraswamy, were now giving impetus to an increasing
number of seminar papers and university dissertations about the scholar and
thinker, or studies of various aspects of his work. In addition biographies
like the latest work, “Coomaraswamy, the Bridge Builder,”** studies in depth
and volumes of Selected Writings are being promised for his centennial year.
Seminars on his work and commemorative lectures and broadcasts are to be held.
The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he was for thirty years, is holding an
exhibition to honour his 100th birthday. A collection of Coomaraswamy letters
have been compiled.** An itemised bibliography of a thousand or more items is
being issued.** New editions of his uncollected essays, and printings of his
unpublished papers are being prepared. In India and elsewhere the non-English
press are arranging memorial tributes and estimates of his work, in various
languages. In the English speaking world, as well as among those closer to his
native thought, Coomaraswamy is established as one whose wisdom seminal, whose
thoughts are ever fruitful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Souvenirs
and memorials of various kinds have been projected. Sri Lanka (the Ceylon of
his birth) has issued a Coomaraswamy stamp which bears his likeness to all
parts of the globe –a national distinction that few scholars have attained.
(India also issued a commemorative stamp in his honour on Aug. 22, 1977-<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Editor</i>). Besides the magnificent
Princeton Collection of Coomaraswamy’s works, there is being built up two
Coomaraswamy Collections** at Jaffna (his ancestral home) at the Jaffna Public
Library and the Jaffna Campus, University of Sri Lanka. A fund for the awarding
of two Gold Medals (annually) for the reciting of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tevaram </i>according to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pan </i>has
been instituted at the Saiva Paripalana Sabha, an award Coomaraswamy founded
when he visited Jaffna in 1906. A film “The Dance of Shiva” portraying his
life, has been produced by the U. S. I. S. The achievements of Coomaraswamy
will not be soon forgotten; beyond the reach of his name, his ideas and his
spirit will become part of the lives, the way of being of countless persons in
many lands. Such is always the destiny of those whose wisdom comes to guide
mankind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

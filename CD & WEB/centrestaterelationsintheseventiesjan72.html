several years past the subject of Centre-State relationship has been engaging
the earnest attention of jurists, legislators, political scientists and a
number of <span class=SpellE>organisations</span>, notably the Institute of
Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies, the Indian Law Institute, the
Institute of Public Administration, the Indian Parliamentary Association and
the Indian Institute of Advanced Study. There have been conventions, seminars
and symposia in which learned papers were read and important speeches made.
Some of these bodies have published the result of their deliberations and the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Institute</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Constitutional</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and Parliamentary Studies
has also devoted one special number of its journal to this topic. Recently we
have, in the shape of the reports of the Administrative Reforms Commission the <span
class=SpellE>Rajamannar</span> Committee, important documents on the subject.
In addition to all this, articles have been appearing in the Press from time to
time. We have, thus, a voluminous material, almost exhausting the points that
emerged and also the views <span class=GramE>expressed,</span> pro and contra,
on those points. That it was <span class=GramE>considered</span> necessary for
these three institutions of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Hyderabad</st1:City></st1:place>
to <span class=SpellE>organise</span> this seminar underscores the importance
of the subject. It also shows the heartening aspect of our democratic life,
namely, that there is always public discussion on all important matters in
which academies and persons in public life also participate in addition to
those who are directly concerned. I am sure all this material will prove useful
to the participants in this seminar. There may, of course, be new points not
already covered and I have no doubt that this seminar will throw fresh light on
the subject as a whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At
the outset, it would perhaps be appropriate to recall the background in which
our Constitution was framed. When the partition of 1947 was finally announced,
the reaction of Indian leaders was immediate and they unanimously <span
class=SpellE>favoured</span> a strong Central Government. <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
attacked us thrice. The present situation created by the continuing influx into
our <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">territory</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Pakistani</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> nationals has created for us
social and economic problems of vast magnitude and also constitutes a threat to
peace. Among the framers of the Constitution were great leaders, eminent
jurists, reputed statesmen and learned political scientists and others who had
devoted their whole life in the service of the nation. They were all patriotic
people, zealous and determined to see that <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> after independence must be a
strong and united nation capable of weathering all storms. Uppermost in their
minds was the fact that the history of the country disclosed fissiparous
tendencies and divisive factors. They were also apprehensive of external attack.
It was also felt that a strong Central Government would command respect from
the nations of the world. Throughout the proceedings of the Constituent
Assembly the idea persisted that ‘the unity of the nation’, which is mentioned
as one of the national ideals in the Preamble of the Constitution, must be
secured and this could be done only by adopting a federal structure with a
strong centre. The integrity of the country, vast in area and with a large
population, could not otherwise be assured. It is significant that at the
conclusion of the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Rajendra Prasad
referred to the fissiparous tendencies in the various elements of the country’s
life–communal differences, caste differences provincial differences and so forth.
He found it appropriate to close the proceedings with the prayer that the
country may be given men of strong character, men of vision, men who would not
sacrifice the interests of the country, by and large, for the sake of smaller
groups and areas and who would rise above the prejudices born of these
differences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
Dr. Ambedkar said that the use of the word “<st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>”
in the Constitution was deliberate, he had in mind the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>American history. In the course of his speech in the Constituent
Assembly Dr. Ambedkar observed that “The Drafting Committee wanted to make it
clear that though India was to be a federation, the federation was not the
result of an agreement by the States to join </span>in federation, and that the
federation not being the result of an agreement, no State has the right to
secede from it. The Federation is a <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place>
because it is indestructible.” He continued: “Though the country and the people
may be divided into different States for convenience of administration, the
country is one integral whole, its people a single people, living under a
single <span class=SpellE>imperium</span> derived from a single source.....” It
is also worth remembering that the provinces which became States under the
Federation were mere administrative units and no sovereign entities. No doubt,
under the Constitution, the States enjoy supremacy within their spheres,
subject to the limits and conditions imposed by the Constitution. The
territories of the States, however, are the territories of the Union of India
over which the Union laws operate. There is single citizenship for the whole
country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Our
Constitution-makers adopted what is known as, the co-opera­tive system of
federalism. The chief characteristics of this system are inter-dependence
between the Union and the component parts and also the practice of
administrative co-operation between the Union and the State Governments and the
partial financial dependence of the latter on the former. The relationship
between the Centre and the States under this system is a deliberately balanced
one. Co-operation is its very foundation. Co-operation, indeed, is an
indisputable instrument in the working of the federal system. Speaking about
the Australian Federation, Justice Starke of the Australian Supreme Court
stated the basic truth applicable to our federation also: “Co-operation on the
part of the Commonwealth (of Australia) and the States may well achieve objects
that neither alone could achieve; that is often the end and the advantage of
co-operation.” India had to develop as one single economic and social
structure. To regulate the social and economic development of the country”
planning of the activities are inevitably co-<span class=SpellE>ordinated</span>
and inter-related. It is important to remember that the ‘economic and social
planning’ is to be found in the Concurrent List. It is obvious that upon
co-operation between the Centre and the States and the constructive exercise of
powers and the carrying out of the obligations under the Constitution, depends
the success of our planning, the maintenance of internal order and the
preservation of external security.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since
1950 many events have occurred which have a direct or indirect hearing on
Centre-State relationship. The States were re-<span class=SpellE>organised</span>
under the States Re-<span class=SpellE>oganisation</span> Act, 1956. Thereafter
claims were made on behalf of a number of regions that they might be
constituted into new States. A notable example was the re-organisation of
Punjab. <span class=SpellE>Himachal</span> Pradesh, an erstwhile Union
territory, became a full-fledged State. In course of time, Governments having
different political complexions, programmes and policies from the Government at
the Centre came into being, but this eventuality was within the contemplation
of the Constitution-makers. The Governor’s office assumed a new importance.
Quite often the President had to take over the Government of certain States and
delegate his powers to the Governor. As the Head of the State, the Governor had
to exercise his powers in relation to the appointment of the Council of
Ministers and the summoning and dissolution of the Houses in circumstances
generating acute controversies and strong emotions. In some regions, language
issues were also raised. Boundary disputes between certain States arose, some
of them still remain unresolved. Disputes regarding river waters became acute
and litigation is pending in the Supreme Court. In certain areas law and order
problems became serious. Apart from the cases of floods and droughts and
similar unforeseen calamities there have been growing financial demands by the
States on the Centre. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

this background it was natural that questions should arise regarding the
rights, duties and powers of the States <span class=SpellE>vis-a-vis</span> the
Centre and the rights, duties, and powers of the centre vis-à-vis the States.
Constitutional machinery now is in full play, and its various parts have been
subjected to real tests. This led in some cases to a re-examination of the
constitutional set-up. Questions began to be asked: Has the Constitution met
the challenges presented by ~he problems which arose in the course of its working?
Can the difficulties experienced be resolved by mutual adjustments of an
administrative character, and so on and so forth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

relationship between the Centre and the States covers a wide range and embraces
a very large part of the functions and activities in the administrative, social
and economic fields. This relationship became the subject of investigation by
the Administrative Reforms Commission. That Commission, before examining the
issues regarding this relationship, first appointed a strong team headed by <span
class=SpellE>Shri</span> M. C. <span class=SpellE>Setalvad</span> to study all
matters relating to Centre- State relations. On the basis of the report of this
team, the Administrative Reforms Commission submitted its own report on 19th
June, 1969, to the Government on the subject. Referring to the controversies
which had arisen between the Centre and the States, the Commission observed:
“but these controversies pertain mostly to matters administrative and financial
and not to constitutional issues. Eminent leaders of various political parties
who appeared before the Commission <span class=SpellE>emphasised</span> their
faith in the Indian unity, though they argued for more autonomy and initiative
for the States. We, therefore, do not think it necessary to suggest any
amendments to the Constitution. We have, however, made recommendations to the
delegation of more financial and administration of functions and powers to the
States with the twin objectives of making the relations between the Centre and
the States smoother and introducing efficiency and economy in the administration
of the Union and State Governments. It is not in the amendment of the
Constitution that the solution of the problems of the Centre-State relationship
is to be sought, but in the working of the provisions of the Constitution by
all concerned in the balanced spirit in which the founding-fathers intended
them to be worked.” I need not detail the recommendations of the Administrative
Reforms Commission which must be well-known to you all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

individuals and bodies interested in the question. The reports of the
Administrative Reforms Commission and of the <span class=SpellE>Rajamannar</span>
Committee have received wide attention. There has also been critical
examination in the Press. The point worthy of note is that while the
Administrative Reforms Commission reported that no amendment of the Constitution

States (Article 131). Then there is the power of the President to obtain the
opinion of the Supreme Court on any question or law or fact. In cases of
disputes it is natural that it is in the interest of the parties concerned–and
they would also prefer–to have the disputes settled by mutual discussion. That
is the very essence of democratic life. With mutual goodwill and a spirit of
accommodation probably many such problems and disputes could be resolved. If
mutual discussions fail, resort could be had to the remedies provided in the
Constitution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>assumes </span>importance in cases
where the State Government might not, or might be unable to give adequate
protection to the personnel and the properties of the Central Government in the
State territory. Articles 256, 257, 258 and 258-A and 365 are based upon the
principle of co-operation which should subsist between the Centre and the
States. Article 256 requires that the executive power of every State shall be
so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament, and the
executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a
State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose.
This is a positive injunction on the State. Negatively, Article 257 requires
that the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede
or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union and in this case
also the executive power of the Union extends to the giving of all necessary
directions. A question may be raised as to why the power to issue directions is
given to the Government of India. The purpose underlying these two Articles is
the purpose of the Government of India, related to the laws made by Parliament
and the executive power of the Union, and the Government of India would be in
the best position to judge what is necessary to carry out that purpose. For
this reason it appears that the Constitution has given power to the Centre to
issue directions to carry out the purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another measure of co-operation is furnished by
Article 258 (1) which empowers the President, with the consent of the
Government of a State, to entrust to that Government functions in relation to any
matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. Conversely, the
Governor of a State is empowered by Article 258-A, with the consent of the
Government of India, to entrust to that Government functions in relation to any
matter to which the executive power of that State extends. It may be observed
that consent of the State Government does not appear to be necessary, where a
law made by Parliament confers powers and imposes duties upon the State and its
offices. What would happen in case the State Government refuses co-operation to
the Centre and disregards the directions given in any matter <span
class=SpellE>authorised</span> by the Constitution? Article 365 provides the
answer. It lays down that in case the State fails to comply with, or to give
effect to, any directions given in the exercise of the executive power of the
Union under the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be lawful for the
President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the
State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this
Constitution. Article 355 imposes a duty on the Union to ensure that the
Government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of
this Constitution. This is in addition to its duty imposed by the said Article
to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance.
Dr. Ambedkar stated in the Constituent Assembly that Article 365 was
consequential and not to give this power to the President was practically <span
class=SpellE>negativing</span> the directions which the Central Government was
empowered to give. The ultimate sanction is incorporated in Article 356 which
gives power to the President to issue emergency proclamation where the
Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the
Constitution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The duty imposed by
Article 355 in all the three respects, viz., protection against external
aggression, protection against internal disturbance and ensuring that the
Government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of
the Constitution, is an obligation imposed on the Centre in the interest and
for the benefit of the people residing in the State also. That appears to be
the intention of the framers of the Constitution in enacting the above
provisions. Where the Government of the State is carried on in accordance with
the provisions of the Constitution, no difficulty would arise and Article 365
would not come into play. For the retention of the emergency provisions
contained in Article 356, Dr. Alladi very strongly supported Dr. Ambedkar. Dr.
Alladi said that if responsible government functioned properly the Centre would
not and could not interfere. This provision, according to him, is a bulwark in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of the provincial or State autonomy because the
primary obligation is cast upon the Union to see that the Constitution is
maintained. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While considering the
various issues in connection with Centre-State relationship and the powers of
the Central Government created by the Constitution, it has to be remembered
that the Central Government is responsible to Parliament. The House of the
People represents the people of all the States and the Council of States
represents all the States. Actions of the Government in all states are
subjected to criticism in both the Houses of Parliament and whatever power is
exercised by the Central Government whether in connection with Article 256, 257
or 356, they have to be justified before Parliament. I have been associated
with Parliament since 1960 with the exception of short period and I think it is
a tribute to our Parliament that it exercises effective check and supervision
over the actions of the Central Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Governor’s powers have
been the subject of discussion for several years past and I have spoken on the
subject on a number of occasions. Briefly, the position appears to be this: The
Governor who is a link between the Centre and the State, fills a dual role.
Firstly, he is the constitutional authority charged with the duty of seeing
that the government of the State is carried on in accordance with the
provisions of the Constitution. This obligation is imposed on him by his oath
whereby he is required to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and
also by the fact that he owes a duty to report to the President under Article
356 if the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the
Constitution. His second role is that of the Head of the State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A view is very often
expressed that guide lines should be given to the Governor for the efficient
discharge of his duties and for bringing uniformity of action in like
situations. It may be remembered that in the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar
had first moved that provision should be made in the Constitution for giving
instructions both to the President and to the Governors. Later on further
consideration, he strongly took the view that a provision for the issue of
instructions to both the President and the Governors should be omitted from the
Constitution. While withdrawing the proposal to incorporate the instrument of
instructions for the Governor Dr. Ambedkar said in the Constituent Assembly
that the instrument was useless because there was no functionary who could see
that the instrument of instructions were carried out by the Governor. Dr.
Ambedkar appears to have admitted that the provisions of instrument of
instructions were, strictly speaking, not enforceable or <span class=SpellE>justiciable</span>.
The proposal by a Member that they may be <span class=SpellE>justiciable</span>
was rejected on the ground that this would permit courts to interfere in the
affairs of Parliament and thus the system of checks and balances would be
upset. It is fair to deduce Dr. Ambedkar and the Members of the Drafting
Committee to the conclusion that the written provisions of a non-jus instrument
of instructions and tacit conventions of a Cabinet Government had equal value.
The proposal to issue the instrument of instructions and to incorporate it in
the Constitution was exhaustively considered by the Constituent Assembly and
was rejected by it. For giving authoritative guide lines to the Governors, a
power in the Constitution will have to be discovered and there is no such
power. Moreover, no instrument of instructions can be exhaustive, as
circumstances not anticipated and not provided for in the instrument may arise.
In this situation, would it not be better that the Governors themselves may lay
the guide lines to be followed by them and conventions in this respect may be
allowed to grow? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I wish to say a few
words on the Governor’s role on one more aspect. Sometimes, it has been said
that even while acting as Chancellor of a university, the Governor is bound by
the advice of the Council of Ministers. In this connection it is worthy of note
that the Chancellor derives his powers from, and exercises his functions under,
the statute creating the office of the Chancellor and it is the duty of the
Chancellor to act in accordance with the provisions of that statute. Some of
the functions are of a quasi-judicial character and the Chancellor, for that
reason, has to exercise his own judgment. Such functions therefore cannot be
expected to be discharged according to the advice of an outside body. Sometimes
the Chancellor has to decide particular matters on the spot, for example, when
he is presiding over the Senate in cases where he is <span class=SpellE>authorised</span>
by the Act to so preside. In such cases the taking of advice from a body
outside the university would be impracticable. The Chancellor’s functions and
powers depend on, and are derived from, the statute creating the university and
the office of the Chancellor, and they have to be in accord with the terms of
each particular statute establishing the university. The fact that the Governor
is ex-officio Chancellor is a mere method of appointment to the office of
Chancellor. He is a Chancellor because he is a Governor, but he is not acting
as Governor when he is acting as Chancellor. The Governor derives his powers
and functions from the Constitution which does not <span class=SpellE>authorise</span>
any State legislature to confer on him any power in his capacity as Governor.
And the university Acts are ordinarily State enactments. Any other view would
take away the autonomy of the universities which will function–if that view be
correct–as a department of the Government. These are the various considerations
which the Seminar may take into account, while dealing with the Governor’s role
when appointed a Chancellor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

avoided, as far as possible, giving my own views on these problems, although at
places I had to give my interpretation of the Constitution. I am sure that the
Seminar will exhaustively examine the various issues relating to the subject in
depth. The Seminar will, I have no doubt, bear in mind the problems of law and
order and other problems connected with internal security and external
aggression. They are inescapable facts of life. I am mentioning this because no
issue, much less the issue of Centre-State relations, can be examined in

mutual consultations between the Central Government and the State Governments.
Even at the risk of repetition, I may state that such problems have to be considered
ultimately in the perspective of general considerations regarding the unity of
the nation and the security of the country. While considering the question of
whether there are any defects in the Constitution, it is important first to
examine the reasons behind the constitutional provisions made in the
Constitution and then to see whether those reasons still hold good, and further
to examine whether the fault lies in the constitutional provisions or in the
defective <span class=SpellE>implememation</span> of them. We must not forget
that our Constitution has been in operation for about 21 years and some
conventions have been formed and others are in the course of formation. I am of

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Among
the short-story writers in Telugu Sri <span class=SpellE>Sripada</span> <span
class=SpellE>Subrahamanya</span> Sastri stands in a class by himself. The
short-story as it is generally understood and in vogue as a form of literary
art, has been borrowed by us from the West and wonderfully adapted by our
writers to suit their literary themes in their variegated facets. Naturally,
therefore, all the writers who have come to distinguish themselves as
story-tellers in Telugu have had to read a good lot of stories in foreign
languages like English, French, German and Russian, in order to imbibe the
spirit and technique of story-writing and to present their literary material in
alluring, artistic accoutrements. Sri <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanya</span>
Sastri is an outstanding exception to this general proposition. He knew no
English and was, on a point of policy, (for which he advanced arguments, some
of them very convincing) opposed to the introduction and propagation of Hindi
among the people of the Telugu country. His main contention was that Telugu
itself was a beautiful language with a hoary tradition and rich literature
which could adequately express all the nuances, however subtle and intricate,
of human emotions and ideas and, was therefore, perfectly fit as a medium of expression;
and so there was absolutely no need to <span class=GramE>impose</span> Hindi, a
comparatively less developed and less rounded language, on the Telugu people
whose language has been hailed as the Italian of the East for its sweetness,
mellifluousness and euphonious vowel-endings of words (<span class=SpellE>Ajanta</span>
<span class=SpellE>Bhasha</span>). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
<span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> stories breathe the spirit of thorough
originality, authenticity and convincing realism. He studied situations in
life, and characters of men and women, at first hand and his depiction of the
same in his stories invariably carried conviction to, and compels appreciation
from, even the most squeamish of critics. No doubt he worked on a small and
limited canvas (many of his stories deal with middle class Brahmin families of
the East Godavari district, and that, too, of the past generation) but his
portrayals are masterly and superb of their kind. His ‘<span class=SpellE>Vadla</span>
<span class=SpellE>Ginjalu</span>’ (grain of paddy), a long </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>short-story
built around the absorbing game of chess is a <i>tour de force </i>in the art
of narration, suspense and the description of minutiae of characters and
situations. This story can be ranked without doubt among the best in Telugu, if
not among the world’s best. (<span class=SpellE>Vadla</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ginjalu</span>’ is in a sense superior to Stefan <span
class=SpellE>Zweig’s</span> ‘The Royal Game’ which is also a very fine story
with chess as its thematic pivot.) In the art of conversational narrative there
is no one equal to Sri Sastri, let alone surpassing him. His story ‘<span
class=SpellE>Arikallakinda</span> <span class=SpellE>Mantalu</span>’ (Flames
under the Feet) is all conversation without a single word of description in all
its length of 36 pages and therein we find the writer’s wonderful mastery of
his medium, his craftsmanship and dexterity in narration conducted in a
language that is at once crisp, forceful and highly expressive, and with an
effect that is deep and telling. The story deals with the unrelieved daily
drudgery, from early morn till late midnight, of a hopeless young widow in a
middle class household, who is constantly harassed by everyone in the family
including her own parents, with their never-ending and insistent orders to her
to do this thing and that for them, while all of them luxuriate in laziness and
revel in pleasure without ever thinking of her. Poor she, she is driven to the
extreme point of exhaustion, physical and psychological, by the inhuman treatment
meted out to her by her own kith and kin, and, in an uncontrollable fit of
exasperation and despair, leaves the home in stealth at midnight for Sri <span
class=SpellE>Viresalingam’s</span> garden where there is a home, a veritable
haven of peace and happiness for the widow, to receive her with mercy and love.
This story presents to us the sorrows of the young widow and her harrowing tale
of woe and misery in all its lurid details and serves as a more effective<i> </i>and
more powerful plea for widow marriage than any amount of public speaking and
pamphleteering in that behalf. Sri Sastri has written more than a hundred
stories of which are saturated with a spirit of social realism and convey a
message, couched in beautiful language and form, for the removal of the
undesirable elements in society in whatever shape they<i> </i>exist and for the
promotion of all that is <span class=SpellE>beneficient</span>, auspicious and
beautiful. Through his profound and sympathetic understanding of the
contemporary social situation and with the deft handling of the same in the
delineation of characters in his works with<i> </i>penetrating insight and
acumen, Sri Sastri has fulfilled himself as a writer of high <span
class=SpellE>purposiveness</span> and great merit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>Subrahmanya</span> Sastri wrote some novels also (<span
class=SpellE>Rakshabandbanam</span>, <span class=SpellE>Smasanavatika</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Atmabali</span> etc.) but they are not so significant in literary
or artistic value. The short-story is his forte and he rightly deserves the
title given to him viz., ‘<span class=SpellE>Kathanika</span> <span
class=SpellE>chakravarti</span>’. <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> play, “<span
class=SpellE>Rajaraju</span>” is a full-length drama with tense situations and
powerful language but absolutely <span class=SpellE>unstageable</span>. He did
not permit it to be altered in any way to suit the requirements of the stage,
even though repeatedly requested by admiring actors and interested playwrights.
At long last he relented but, before the stage-version could take shape and be
put on boards, he passed away. Sri <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> stories
are collected and published in twelve volumes. Besides stories and novels he
wrote a good number of <span class=SpellE>playlets</span>, Radio-plays, essays
and other literary miscellany on a variety of topics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘<span class=SpellE>Anubhavalu</span> -<span class=SpellE>Jnapakalu</span>’
(Experiences and Memories) written in a reminiscent vein, is a unique
autobiography in the Telugu language and this contribution of Sri Sastri to
Telugu letters is a splendid achievement deserving praise of the highest order.
We have had autobiographies of great leaders and writers like Viresalingam, <span
class=SpellE>Chilakamarthi</span> and others detailing out their life’s
activities and achievements in the main and revealing the social history of
their times incidentally. In <span class=SpellE>Sripada’s</span> book the
autobiographical details are subdued in tone and content but the events and
personalities that shaped him and his times and had largely influenced him and
people of his generation take the predominant position, <span class=SpellE>focussing</span>
the attention of the reader on the hoary and valuable traditions, instinct with
life, that have stood the test of time and become a part of our living. There
is also an undercurrent of regret mixed with <span class=SpellE>agonising</span>
anxiety for the gradual decline and decay of those precious values of life
which have sustained our race through centuries of vicissitudes, storms and
stresses, in social and political spheres, and alien attempts at their
annihilation to the root. The language employed by Sri <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanya</span>
Sastri in his writings is <span class=SpellE>Sista</span> <span class=SpellE>Vyavaharika</span>
(the colloquial language of the cultured); and he has an amazing mastery over
the authentic Telugu idiom. Distilled through his scholarship of Telugu and
Sanskrit and perfected during half a century of dedicated practice, Sri <span
class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> prose style is vigorous, lively, racy and
arrestingly attractive. Its suppleness and grace, power and puissance, balance
and rhythm are hard to beat and </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

greatness as a writer rests mainly on his enviable </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sri
Sastri ran a monthly journal entitled “<span class=SpellE>Prabuddha</span>
Andhra” for a period of nine years, almost single-handed and in it were
published for the first time many of his stories and novels as also those of
other leading writers of the time. <span class=SpellE>Khadi</span>, Gandhi and
Hindi were his <span class=SpellE><i>bete</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>noires</span>
</i>and he could never bring himself to approach with respect, or appreciate,
any of them in his lifetime. He was the founder of “<span class=SpellE>Kalabhivardhini</span>
<span class=SpellE>Parishat</span>”, an organisation devoted to the cause of
the arts and the letters. He used to conduct annual meetings at <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rajahmundry</st1:place></st1:City> during <span
class=SpellE>Sarannavaratri</span> days, when a scholar-poet would be <span
class=SpellE>honoured</span> with all due pomp and <span class=SpellE>splendour</span>.
Sri Sastri was uncompromising in his views, literary or otherwise. His sense of
opposition, if it was once aroused was inexorable and implacable, and he never
yielded a point to any one in any dispute whatsoever. He could not contain
within himself the opinions on men and <span class=GramE>matters, that</span>
surged up in him, but had to speak them out fully and frankly, even at the cost
of losing longstanding friendships, and incurring the displeasure of the
intimate and the loving. His affection for the young and rising writer was
sincere and thorough-going and he used to help such by his valuable advice and
guidance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Born
in a strictly orthodox middle-class family of Brahmins living on Vedic studies
and in the <span class=SpellE>Sanatanic</span> tradition and bred up in a
social milieu in which the wearing of a shirt by a Brahmin was frowned upon,
Sri <span class=SpellE>Subrahmanya</span> Sastri sedulously imbibed all that
was best and worthy in the classical traditions and<i> </i>equally defiantly
spurned off the superstitious, the undesirable, the antiquated and the
oppressive in social customs and manners. He gave up the arid <span
class=SpellE>Granthic</span> style in Telugu writing for the more pliable,
pleasant and living <span class=SpellE>Vyavaharika</span> under the influence
of Sri Gidugu <span class=SpellE>Venkata</span> Ramamurti, the pioneer leader
of that movement. His first story was published in 1915 and, for nearly half of
a century thereafter, he continued to write to entertain and educate the Telugu
public. His <span class=SpellE>Shashtipurti</span> was celebrated with great <span
class=SpellE>eclat</span> at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Rajahmundry</st1:place></st1:City>
in 1951 and many leading literary luminaries participated in the same. A <span
class=SpellE>Kanakabhishekam</span> was performed to him at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Visakhapatnam</st1:place></st1:City> under the <span class=SpellE>presidentship</span>
of Sri T. <span class=SpellE>Viswanatham</span>, himself a litterateur and a
fine connoisseur of the arts. Sri <span class=SpellE>Sastri’s</span> complete
works (his Telugu prose <span class=SpellE>Bharatam</span> </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is
incomplete) come to more than a hundred volumes and one can assert without fear
of contradiction that a good many of them will live down in the annals of
Telugu literature. Younger writers of this generation will do well to emulate
Sri Sastri in the matter of presenting a theme in a vibrant and virile style.
Sri Sastri was born on April 23, 1891 (Shakespeare was also born on the same
day in April) in a small village in the East Godavari District and worked his
way up in the literary field through b sheer self-effort, perseverance and
above all, his striking originality and inflexible individuality. He died (at <span
class=SpellE>Rajahmudry</span>) on 25th February, 1961, at the age of seventy,
after a brief illness. He was unconscious for three days continuously before
his death, and we cannot say with certainty what his last words were. How
tragic that the consciousness and powers of speech of a person, who lived his
seventy years, dedicated to the oral and written word, should have been cut in
his last days! The ways of the Almighty </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In October, 1945 the P. E. N. Centre in India
organised at Jaipur the First All-India Writers’ Conference. “By common
agreement, one of the most valuable features of the conference was the
symposium on the Modern Indian Literatures, in which the sixteen addresses
which we bring together here were given by as many representatives of leading
languages of modern India.” The languages thus represented are–Assamese by Sri
Nilmoni Phooken, Bengali by Kazi Abdul Wadud, English by Prof. N. K. Siddhanta,
Gujarati by Prof. Jayantakrishna H. Dave, Hindi by Dr. Ram Kumar Varma, Kannada
by Principal V. K. Gokak, Maithili by Dr. Umesha Mishra, Malayalam by Dr. C.
Kunhan Raja, Marathi by Prof. M. D. Altekar, Oriya by Sri Kalindicharan
Panigrahi, Punjabi by Sri Madan Gopal, Sanskrit by Dr. R. N. Dandekar, Sindhi
by Sri Lalchand A. Jagtiani, Tamil by Sri M. R. Jambunathan, Telugu by Dr. C.
Narayana Rao, and Urdu by Prof. Rashid Ahmed Siddiqi. It will be seen that the
list includes all the major spoken languages of modern India together with
Sanskrit and English which latter, in addition to being used as media of
expression by learned Indians, have inspired and profoundly influenced all the
living literatures of the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One notes with admiration the surprising amount of
information that the distinguished contributors to this symposium have been
able to pack into the few pages that were at their disposal. Not content with
giving us a bare chronicle of authors and books, many of them have traced the
trend of literary development in their respective languages in modern times,
noting carefully the political and social influences that have been at work.
The story of all Modern Indian Literatures is very much the same in outline:
the impact of English literature, the revolt against the old conventions, the birth
of work-a-day prose, the vogue of the novel and the social drama, experiments
in new literary forms and technique, including the revolution in metrical
patterns, the predominance of the secular outlook, the upsurge of national
spirit and patriotic fervour, and lastly the ‘progressive’ movement. And
everywhere translations and adaptations from English literature have played a
very important part. It is also of interest to note that Bengali, which came
earliest under English influence and moreover has produced the greatest Indian
poet of our times, has in its turn influenced a good number of Modern Indian
languages. In fact, we can distinguish the Ages of Bankim, Tagore (and of late
Saratchandra) not only in Bengali but also in sister literatures!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The lists of prominent names, dozens and scores in
each branch of writing, put together by many of the contributors to this
symposium are impressive enough. They give one the feeling that the creative
impulse is active in every nook and corner of India. But these strings of
names, given by the contributor in his anxiety not to miss–shall we even say,
not to offend–any ‘important’ writer, often become un-illuminating. Significant
authors cannot easily be distinguished from passable ones in this rather
indiscriminate company. This very ‘inclusiveness’ prevents the critic from
giving the due meed of praise to a deserving author. For instance, K. S.
Karanth’s <i>Marali Mannige</i>, one of the outstanding Kannada novels of our
times, certainly merits greater praise and longer notice than Principal Gokak
has accorded it here. Nor can one feel happy over the fact that K. S. Narasimha
Swami (whose name, by the way, is wrongly given as Narasimha Murthy) is
dismissed in about half a line as ‘an accomplished poet of love’. Among the
list of modern writers in Sanskrit, one particularly misses the name of the
talented poet and playwright, Jaggu Vakulabhushana Kavi of Melkote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The editor of this volume aptly observes: “It would
have been well in a symposium such as this if the same general outline had been
followed by all the authors. This would have ensured uniformity of treatment
which would have enabled the reader to compare adequately developments in one
language with those in another.” It appears, however, that the contributors prepared
their ‘reports’ independently. In planning volumes of this kind, it would be
best if the contributors could be given a comprehensive questionnaire to be
kept in view and answered to the best of their knowledge and critical acumen.
They must be particularly requested to concentrate upon the outstanding and
characteristic achievements in their respective languages against the larger
all-India background This will not only enable them to give full praise where
it is due, but will also deter them from yielding to the common impulse to cry
up every ware displayed in their respective shop-windows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>This is a book of autobiographical memoirs by Sri
Harindranath Chattopadhyaya. The reason for the unusual title is that the
author looks upon Nature as a great experimenter, and “we human beings are as
the test tubes into which she constantly pours her many-coloured liquids of
dreams and desires, mixing and re-mixing them until they change from colour to
colour, composition to composition, bearing her further and further towards
success in her experimentation.” (P. 83) It is in this mood of experiment ‘for
which he is not responsible’ that the author has objectified the events of his
life which he has set down in this book, bringing the story down to about 1930
when he returned from Europe and when the Salt Satyagraha movement was
convulsing the country. One can only guess the actual date for, unlike the
usual books of biography, this one dispenses with dates and documentation of
any kind, mentioning only occasionally and incidentally the age of the author.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sri Harindranath has won fame as a good writer of
English verse, and has proved popular wherever he has gone as an actor,
reciter, and singer. He belongs to the small, and dwindling, band of
Indo-Anglian poets whose influence on the life and thought of the country is,
as might be expected, not very considerable. If Harin had chosen to cultivate
with some assiduity his powers of expression as a poet and dramatist, say, in
Hindi or Bengali, and utilised his talents and bent his will to make his
contributions in these Indian languages, the story might have been far
different. But it was not to be. With all his brilliance, one hears an
undertone of loneliness and frustration sounded in the course of this book. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The early years of Sri Harindranath were spent in
Hyderabad (Deccan) where his father, Dr. Aghoranath had migrated from Bengal
and occupied a high and honoured place in the Nizam’s Government. Dr. Aghornath
was among the early stalwarts of Bengali English- educated gentlemen, and
Acharya P. C. Ray’s tribute to him recorded in the book (p. 26), in the course
of the interesting meeting between Harin and Acharya Ray, is noteworthy and
revealing in respect of these two great men of Bengal. Dr. Aghoranath’s early
life consorting with freebooters on the boats plying on the rivers of East
Bengal, and his meeting and eloping with his future wife, a girl of nine, read
more like a romance than an excerpt from life. The author has sketched with
loving reverence the portraits of his father, a vigorous personality, of
unbending rectitude and of encyclopedic learning; and of his mother, a lady of
high artistic sensibilities, of catholic sympathies and a magnificent matron
and hostess. But ill-luck overcame the family, and debtors attached the house,
and the family broke up when Harin was about fifteen. The events leading up to
this disaster are, however, not clear from the book. Harin then migrated to
Madras, and his ventures as a playwright and performer, his love-episodes, his
meeting with Kamaladevi and marrying her, are all set down with engaging
frankness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The latter part of the book deals with Sri
Harindranath’s voyage to England, and his studies and contacts there, his visit
to his brother Sri Virendranath in Berlin. The treatment is more objective, the
sketching of men and events is more convincing, and the first personal pronoun
obtrudes less frequently. The hospitality and affection that the author enjoyed
in English homes, and the encouragement that he received from fellow-writers
and artists seem to suggest that this was about the most happy period in the
author’s life; Owing to the absence of dales, it is difficult to say how many
years Sri Harindranath spent altogether in England. Of the sketches given, that
of Sri Virendranath, the Indian revolutionary in Berlin, is very arresting and
describes, incidentally, the sufferings of Indian political exiles in foreign
countries. There is a glimpse of Subhas Chandra Bose at Cambridge (p. 179)
which is noteworthy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The uncensored recollections of men and women who
live an unconventional life are in vogue in Western countries, and often prove
to be very good ‘sellers’. But this <i>genre </i>is new to our country and
perhaps foreign to our genius and temperament. Sri Harindranath, who is nothing
if not unconventional, has blazed a new trail with this book of memoirs which
is candid to a fault, and serves to show up the author and his intimate life as
they were–sometimes worse than they really were. There is a queer mixture of
self-condemnation and self-praise noticeable in the book, which is only another
way of saying that the author is highly temperamental. “The artist has no
half-way house: he is all extremes”, says the author (p. 169)...“Either he is
in the seventh heavens with the ecstasy of life and the gladness to be alive,
or he is down in the unfathomable depths of depression full of the ache to die,
and be done with the whole damned thing called human life. This is true of the
artists of our class who are ego-centric, who take up the attitude towards
existence that they are the centre round which all things move, breathe, and
have their being, or, if they do not, they ought to. They fall into the trap of
loneliness because of their dislike for collective living, a subtle form of
snobbery which wears the garb of humility.” Whether the above should be taken
as a confession or an apology and defence, it is difficult to say. But the
ego-centric attitude above referred to colours the book, and makes parts of it,
particularly those that deal with adventures in philandering, somewhat trying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

novelists in modern Kannada. A new novel from his pen is, therefore, an event
which is looked forward to by the Kannada reading public. This latest novel of
his, the title of which may be translated as ‘In the Noose of Generosity,’
deals with the life and career of a high-souled national worker and patriot
called Radhakrishna and traces the vicissitudes of his fortunes, from the days
of the Non-cooperation movement of 1921, when he gave up his college studies
and plunged into constructive national service under the inspiration of
Gandhiji’s leadership. Radhakrishna takes his due share in all the three
campaigns in the non-violent war of Independence conducted by Mahatmaji, <i>viz.,
</i>the Non-cooperation movement of 1921, the Salt Satyagraha movement of 1930,
and the Quit India movement of 1942. The untold privations undergone by the
hero of the story, his unswerving loyalty to the ideals of Gandhiji, his grim
determination against odds, that damped the spirits of those around him and
left him the lone standard-bearer in the march of freedom these make the
portrait of Radhakrishna the type of which there are a few thousands scattered
in all parts of this wide country. These known warriors stuck to their posts
unwept, unhonoured, and unsung while others reaped the harvest of their toils.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reappears as Doctor Nanda in Mangalore, makes name money, and tries to play the
benevolent godfather to Congress workers and national institutions. Sakharam
migrates to Bombay and becomes a journalist. We do not hear of him till almost
the end of the story, when depressed and war-worn Radhakrishna seeks him out in
Bombay. That is about the time when the All-India Congress Commitee meets in
Bombay and passes the famous Quit India resolution. A new glow enters into the
heart of Radhakrishna and he takes the plunge for a third time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Radhakrishna’s wife, Satya, the daughter of a
landlord, proves to an admirable help-mate in the story, and her character is
almost as fully portrayed as that of the hero himself. She becomes the mistress
the Ashram, which Radhakrishna started in the neighbourhood of Mangalore for
Harijan boys. Dayananda Rao, the leader of national activities in Mangalore,
was the very embodiment of liberality, and put a childlike trust in all whoever
professed to work for national uplift. He gave his support and patronage to
Radhakrishna in his undertaking. The author in his Foreword tells us that
Dayananda Rao is drawn from actual life, and those who are acquainted with the
course of political life in South Canara and Karnatak will have no difficulty
in recognising the portrait of Karnad Sadasiva Rao, one of our most amiable and
noble-hearted public men who lost his all in the national struggle and who,
alas, is now no more!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Prabhudev, the political adventurer, the
hot-gospeller of Socialism, ever seeking the limelight and eager to fish in
troubled waters to make his own private haul, may be considered the villain of
the story. This character, alas too true to type, is drawn with consummate
artistry. He is the very contrast of Radhakrishna and is the evil genius whose
unscrupulous financial adventures under the guise of raising funds for
Radhakrishna’s Ashram and school, brought about the crash in the hero’s life
and left him desolate, his hopes wrecked and his life’s aspirations utterly
frustrated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

inherits unexpectedly a small property and helps Radhakrishna to buy up a plot
of land on the outskirts of Mangalore, on which to run a farm and build his
school, is another unforgettable character in the story. Ramanna, whom
Radhakrishna rescues from the floods that overran the district, proves his
gratitude by deeds of kindness which constitute some of the most touching
incidents in the narrative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>When the Salt Satyagraha campaign was launched in
1930, and the Forest Satyagraha as an off-shoot of it, North Canara became the
centre of a heroic non-violent struggle against the Government. Radhakrishna
hastened there, more as a ministering angel than as a combatant. While the
outstanding features of this memorable campaign are faithfully sketched in the
story, one feels that the author’s touch has not the firm grip or fervour
noticed in the earlier part of the story. And the third phase, namely the Quit
India movement, is treated still more succinctly and even perfunctorily. This
is, presumably, because the author was an actor himself in the Non-cooperation
movement, but was little more than a spectator of the 1930 and 1942 campaigns,
and got his information more from hearsay than from vivid personal experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Ichanniah and Mahabalibhatta, the stalwart peasant
proprietors of North Canara whose sufferings are almost epic in their
intensity, are characters that are sketched very successfully, but one wishes
that this phase of our national struggle had occupied a larger area on the
author’s canvas. Towards the end of the book, appears the character of
Banhatti, the wobbling Congress leader, playing at the same time both for
popularity and safety, the type of power politician with whom expediency weighs
more than principles, a type which seems to have become somewhat too common in
the present day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Sri Sivarama Karanth is a skilled craftsman in the
creation and portrayal of characters. As a vivid narrator of events he has few
rivals, though in this latest novel of his one may reasonably complain that the
story element often wears out so thin as to make the book rather desultory and
halting in many places. Of plot, presumably, there is none in this almost
biographical (or is it autobiographical?) narration. And the story fails to
grip the reader and carry him along as other stories of Sri Karanth have done.
This is not to suggest any flagging of the powers of the talented author, but
due to the sense of frustration that lies heavy on the novelist’s soul and
clogs his usually virile and fluent pen. It is no more than a reflection of the
depression that has overtaken the hearts of sensitive spirits all over the land
at the sad fate that the country is passing through. The first glow of idealism
seems to have faded out, and pettiness, the seeking of sordid ends and
barefaced self-aggrandisement are stalking the land in unashamed effrontery.
Sri Karanth, with all his irrepressible buoyancy, seems to have suffered the
chilling touch of this encircling gloom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

literature glorious? Or is the literature of the later era? Are devotional
songs necessary? Or songs of love? In discussions such as these, ‘lovers of
Tamil’ have been disparaging one another subtly and on the sly. Their number is
on the increase and conditions in Tamilnad have not been favourable to the
production of books on scientific subjects in a language (our mother-tongue)
that will be understood by the common man.” So reads the publishers’ preface. I
can assure them that they have made a splendid beginning to meet a long-felt
want by publishing <i>Thaimai</i>. It is a very good book; its author has
demonstrated that the popular interest Dr. Marie Stopes was able to achieve by
her manner of writing in works like <i>Radiant Motherhood </i>and <i>Married

His was not the ambition to annihilate the Jews and rule over a city. To

He preached the highest means of detaching oneself from the ways of the senses

near and dear to him could not save him. His death on the Cross ended a life of
perfect gratitude to the Maker. Christianity was established. But the nations
professing Christianity have not honoured in action the memory of that noblest
of mortals. Attempts to reform human society from the days of Socrates have
been futile and man is still primitive in his emotions and moods. The invention
of engines of destruction, the devastating political and economic ideals of
certain nations, the intolerance of man against man show how uncivilized we

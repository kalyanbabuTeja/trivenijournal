<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Certain
thinkers are of the view that human life is in no degree superior to the lives
of other creatures. Life and death are the voice and silence of Nature. It is
to become fully aware of that voice and silence of Nature that poets and
truth-seekers strive and struggle. Although the human Intellect has its own
faults, the human Will is peerless and unfathomable. When this Will dominates
the mind of man, when this Will is not subject to his limitless ambitions, man
perceives that he is no more a creature of circumstance. We get a little
knowledge of what we are. A new sense of awareness, an intense urge, a wonder
at and a desire for loveliness in things develop in our mind, independent of
our Will. Love binds our thoughts; and to the external activities we engage in
for the satisfaction of our selves, a meaning is achieved, the meaning of
experience. We begin to interpret our life in a thousand and odd ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Life
is the content of art, and art is the form of life.” <sup>1</sup> We have
nothing to say afresh. But everyone of us who experiences beauty in some form
or other desires to express his or her feelings and emotions. In interpreting
the experience methods differ. A poet enjoying the music of a skylark or a
nightingale attempts at forgetting his own existence. In a moment of peace he
recollects his emotion. Rhythmic lines of life and love flow out of a brimming
heart. We call it art. It is an art that elevates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
gratify one’s wishes, one must have the courage to suffer. A mercenary dying in
war is not a true soldier of noble wishes. His sufferings and courage have no
norm. The anguish in the heart of a poet who wrote that “life stains the white
radiance of eternity” (Shelley: <i>Adonais) </i>aspired to grapple beauty. In
our passionate wish to perpetuate <i>that </i>which is mortal, we submit to our
senses. Our senses revel in Nature. How long? So long as love lasts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Art
interprets life only when man loves that kind of life for which Destiny has
fitted him. If any true art represents an aspect of life, it immortalises that
aspect which strengthens and elevates the human soul. As love is the supremest
force behind life, it is the inspiration for man to expound, sing, carve, or
paint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everywhere
we see everyone talking of love with little knowledge of what exactly its
nature is. Some pretend to know much of its influence in moulding the human
mind. A few brilliant scholars betray a glimpse of it by stating that love is a
creation of human emotions flooding the heart. They doubt whether it is a
creation of refined emotions originating from the contact of the senses in a
balanced manner with the objects of Nature. In three words, the greatest of men
born on earth, Jesus of Nazareth, proclaimed to the discriminating, thinking
animal, that Love is God. To attain that state of pure joy, wherefrom no return
to a tragic submission to those base qualities staining the radiance of love
could occur, one must be conscious of the impeding, distracting thoughts which
arise to shake off that noble wish–love to know and become. We all know that
what we are, we are not in truth. We change every moment to progress toward
that we want to become. Impulse, instinct, intuition, struggle, defeats,
imprison us, and escape is remote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
effect an escape, at once graceful and memorable, the poet sings, the musician
expands in rapture, the dancer goes into ecstacy, the sculptor breaks the most
obdurate of stones, and the painter takes the red out of his beloved’s lips.
“We are transmitters of life,” observes D. H. Lawrence. It is not the
politician that transmits life, but the artist, the philosopher, the ever
suffering deathless seeker. In this century we have too many critics of art,
too many shallow scholars whose convictions are borrowed, whose prejudices are
too heavy. They but skim the surface of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Why
did that famous Swedish philosopher, Swedenborg, speak of Spiritual Nuptials?
Did he say Love is Sacrifice? He too like Bentham aimed at the greatest
happiness of the greatest number. Why did Oscar Wilde create Dorian Gray? Love
must suffer. Love must die to live and transmit. Hardy made his Tess (pure
woman) suffer to realise that love is only an aspect of life, which
imperishable aspect perishes to survive, to acquire new energy and flow. The
primitive Serpent split to create and survive; love governs the tempest life,
and life is the content of art.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Life
terminates, love decays to live, and art perpetuates both. The famous tales of
Edgar Allan Poe, the secret <i>sadhanas </i>of the Vedic seers, the
imperceptible idea in the <i>Neti-Neti </i>philosophy –all seem to interpret in
many modes the transcendental aim of love. But man has in woman a better image
of his own to comprehend, to look deep. Woman means one aspect of love to him.
It is not an aspect of sex, not an aspect of ethics or religion or morality or
intelligence, but an aspect of understanding, a way to translate, a means to
perpetuate, an object on which to concentrate, an experience to immortalise,–in
fact, a way of life that becomes the true content of art. Dante was dominated
by Beatrice. St. Francis was under the spell of service. Both knew love. It
made them meet at the wished point of tranquility. The power which resides in
the heart of a man of sorrows, that known secret in the mind and soul of every
growing virgin, that which aspires and consumes is love.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
world’s literature reflects but the life of man and his creative passion to
extend the frontiers of the mind. Earth has more unacknowledged men of genius
than well-known scholars who borrow thoughts from the great and blatantly
plagiarise. What is to be the function of man in the future? “Man must think
anew about all human problems and not about any particular system or belief.
This is lacking throughout the world at present.” Mr. J. Krishnamurti makes
this remark for the intelligent man to analyse and perceive the true nature of
the psyche. What is needed is that man must fully become unconscious of the
critical instinct which always takes his sense off him, to admire and adjust to
circumstances in which destiny places him. Critical instinct by itself is not
bad. When it affects the psyche from a wrong angle it hampers evolution.
Obstructed evolution shatters morality. The dance of life loses its cosmic
rhythm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Theatrical
conceptions, want of imagination and lack of Indian feeling in the treatment of
sacred and epic Indian subjects, are Ravi Varma’s fatal faults.” Thus says the
late Dr. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy who was an accepted critic of arts. To say that
Ravi Varma had no Indian feeling is cruel. A painter of Ravi Varma’s stature
painted not to satisfy any critical instinct, not to arouse any sympathy. His
imagination was centred in creating one phase of Truth in which his own
salvation could be gained. William Blake painted what he sang in ecstacy. The
painter’s love is a burning flame of life. A cold critic develops cataract. His
erudition and reason give him no ease; to the restless seeker after beauty in
works of art, the quest is a source of perpetual joy. The writer does not stand
in opposition to a galaxy of critics. Despite the vast strides civilisation has
made, man still remains primitive in his moods; it is because his conception of
love is physical, superficial, narrow and base.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Music
is an idea of the emotions. Dance expounds that idea to stir the slumbering
senses which are to waken the soul. The soul realises its affinity with the
universe. Its realisation is not perfect, as the affinity is not full. The
moment a noble mind repeats an act with little knowledge of values, its
aesthetic experience moves toward that sacred dot where Ardhanariswara abides.
It is where the voluptuous passions of the heart burn to nothing and where the
senses have nothing to carry and deposit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

these days the desire of the young is for all kinds of political ’isms. Life’s

to aspire for the highest are expended to fabricate the means to centralise and
decentralise the economic resources of a nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

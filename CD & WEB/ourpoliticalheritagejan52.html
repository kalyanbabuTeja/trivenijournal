style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Modern
research has disclosed the widespread existence of democratic and popular
institutions during the earlier periods of Indian history. There is abundant
evidence of such institutions in the literature of the Vedic, Buddhist, Epic
and Puranic periods from about 1000 B.C. till about 600 A.D. While monarchy
seems to have been too prevalent form of State there seems to have been also a
number of republics (Vairajya). The character of the governments seems to have
ranged from aristocracy and oligarchy to democracy of a kind. Kingship was, in
some instances, elective. General assemblies of the people were convened to
choose, or to approve of the succession of, a new ruler. Popular assemblies and
Councils of Elders (Sabhas and Samitis) whom the ruler was bound to consult,
were to be found in many States. Regional Councils (Janapadas) City Councils
(Pauras), Village Assemblies (Sabhas) which administered local affairs with
almost complete freedom, and Trade and Caste Guilds (Sreni) which regulated the
trades and professions and the affairs of the caste were a common feature of
ancient Indian polity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
institutions of self-government were, in India as elsewhere, the “first
expression of man’s political instincts”, the “natural creation of his
political intelligence”. They attained a high stage of development in her early
history. But their growth was inhibited by the rise of monarchical and imperial
States and by the ideal of a united Empire embracing the whole of India. The
theme of all political literature of the later Hindu period is Empire
(Samrajya). The greatest of Hindu political treatises, Kautilya’s
‘Arthasastra’, is concerned not with freedom and popular government but with
monarchy and the means of strengthening and assuring its stability. In its
scheme of government popular institutions have no place. Its ideal is a
benevolent and paternal autocracy. At the same time the ‘Arthasastra’
recognises the existence of corporate institutions and enjoins on the King
respect for them and the duty of enforcing their decisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The history of popular institutions after the age of
the Guptas is obscure. We have no positive evidence of their existence in the
centuries that followed. We may presume none the less that the village
community, at least, continued its existence in some form or other long
afterwards. The successive empires that rose to power and declined affected
only the surface of Indian society. An efficient and centralised government
that stifles all local initiative and freedom was unknown in India until the
establishment of British rule in the nineteenth century. Only the
self-governing village survived while all other popular institutions vanished
completely leaving no trace behind them. The latter have survived only in the
beautiful words which once served to describe them, like the Sabha, the
Mahasabha, the Samiti, the Gana, Samgha, janapada, Paura, Sreni and others. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
self-governing village community in its later days was much less vigorous than
it had been in Ancient India. It was not found everywhere. Administrative
functions had passed largely into the hands of the Patel, or Munsiff. But even
in the days of its decline the village community was still impressive enough to
evoke the admiration of the great British administrators like Munro,
Elphinstone and Sir Henry Maine. To Elphinstone we owe the classic description
of the autonomous village reproduced below:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Each township conducts its own internal affairs. It
levies on its members the revenue due to the State, and is collectively
responsible for the full amount. It manages its own police and is answerable
for any property plundered within its limits. It administers justice to its own
members as far as punishing small offences and deciding disputes in the first
instance. It taxes itself to provide funds for its internal expenses such as
the repairs of the wells and the temple, and the cost of public sacrifices and
charities, as well as some ceremonies and amusements or festivals. It is
provided with the requisite officers for conducting these duties and with
various others adapted to the wants of the inhabitants, and, though entirely
subject to the general government, is in many respects an organised commonwealth
complete within itself. This independence and its concomitant privileges,
though often violated by the Government, are never denied; they afford some
little protection against a tyrannical ruler, and maintain order within their
own limits, even when the general government has been dissolved.”</p>

Village Panchayat which seems to have survived in fully vigour till the British
conquest, and was practically universal in India at the beginning of the last
century, is however not to be confused with the Sabha of the old self-governing
village. It was a purely judicial institution and had no administrative
functions. Where a national system of justice was lacking, its services were of
the utmost importance to the peaceful and orderly existence of the village
commmity. Sir Thomas Munro wrote of it in 1807: “There can be no doubt that the
trial of Panchayat is as much the common law of India in civil matters as that
by the jury<i> </i>in England.” (It is interesting to note that the two
institutions were similar in their functions). Elphinstone notes that the
Panchayat was a part of the judicial organisation of the Mahratta </span><span

the origins of the Panchayat, in its later forms it was neither an organ of

village community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

history of self-governing institutions in the South is more continuous than in
the North. But there appear to have been no popular assemblies representative
of the country as a whole except perhaps in the earliest period. The origins of
democratic institutions go back to the first or second century A.D. There are
frequent references in the early literature of the Tamils to the gatherings of
the Eight or </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>titution that has the most continuous history
and reached a high stage of development was, however, the Village Sabha. The
great age of the village community was under the Cholas from the ninth to the
thirteenth century. Inscriptional evidence indicates the existence of a
remarkably complete system of local autonomy from the sixth to the thirteenth
century, and from places so far apart as Tanjore and Tinnevelly in the Tamil
country and Masulipatam in the heart of the Telugu area. These village
communities seem to have preserved their corpora</span><span style='font-size:

a garden committee (Thotta variyam) and so on. Their names indicate their
functions. The committees were chosen by a system of lot from the different
wards of the village. The procedure of election was prescribed in great detail,
as also the procedure of the committees and assembly, the rules of debate and
the manner of arriving at decisions in these bodies. An efficient financial
control was maintained and the committees were held to a strict accountability
to the Sabha for the proper discharge of their functions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the description of the village of Uttiramerur
given by Professor S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar in his “Evolution of Hindu
Administrative Institutions in South India” and by Professor K.A. Nilakanta
Sastri in his “History of the Cholas” and “Studies in Chola Administration” we
have indeed the picture of a little republic administering its affairs
democratically with little or no interference from the central government. As
suggested by these two historians, it may reasonably be assumed that the
organisation of the village outlined here was typical of the villages of the
Tamil-Nad at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This account of the popular and democratic
institutions of ancient and medieval India is necessarily sketchy. There are
many gaps in our knowledge of them. We do not know how they actually worked or
the spirit that animated them. It is difficult, therefore, to estimate their true
role in our history. From the facts as we know them a few inferences may be
made. A nostalgic and uncritical admiration for them as a perfect example of
democratic institutions, and the attempt to find in them the latest democratic
devices like the secret ballot, seem to be wholly unjustified. Nor can they be
dismissed as primitive and useless. If they were in no sense the progenitors or
precursors of our modern democracy, they may still serve to give our people a
confidence in themselves and in their ability to make popular government a
success.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
have noticed two types of democratic institutions in Ancient India and the two
have a different history. Of these the political assemblies never attained any
great importance. Nor did they develop beyond an inchoate stage. They were
short-lived and seem to have succumbed easily before the rising power of the
monarch. We have no trace of them in our history after the sixth century. We
know nothing about the causes of their fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

self-governing village communities, on the other hand, were more permanent and
attained a high stage of development. Their most striking feature was their
self-sufficiency. They lived a self-centred and almost secluded life, as they
were not articulated to the political life of the larger community and nation.
Their independence and self-sufficiency were the source of both their strength
and weakness. Their self-sufficiency enabled them to survive great political
upheavals and frequent changes of regime. But their narrow and parochial
outlook inevitably prevented the development of a larger patriotism and truer
citizenship which recognise the duty of defending the country against foreign
enemies as the supreme virtue of the citizen. Indian society was atomized; it
failed to develop a sense of cohesion and nationality necessary to its
preservation. The result was the easy conquest of India by successive waves of
foreign invaders. The truth is that, in the long run, too great a measure of
local autonomy is destructive both of the national community and of the local
autonomy itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Harsha to Akbar and Aurangazebe. The British were no less under its spell and
it was under them that a united India was finally achieved. It should be
emphasised that it was the fundamental cultural unity of India achieved by
Hindu India that constitutes the essential basis for the superstructure of our

may turn now to a brief consideration of the political heritage of the Muslim
period of our history. In the thousand years from the first Muslim invasion of
India in the eighth century to the eighteenth, there is no trace of any
democratic institutions except in the villages. Muslim and Hindu rulers of this
period were all autocrats whose power was based on the army. Neither in theory
nor in practice were there any limitations on their absolute power. Except
during the enlightened rule of Akbar (1556-1665) there was no attempt at a
political synthesis of the adherents of Islam and Hinduism. The Muslims who
were mostly foreign immigrants constituted the ruling caste and the vast
majority of their Hindu subjects were denied equality. The latter were
subjected to the worst exactions and humiliations. In the suppression of the
Hindus the Muslim ruler combined with the priest, and his military despotism
assumed the character of a theocracy as well. The common people, Hindu or
Muslim, had no political existence except as tax-payers and soldiers. They
rendered to the ruler implicit obedience within the limits of custom and
necessity. During all these centuries the benevolent ruler was the rarest
exception and the capricious tyrant the general rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
period of Muslim rule has left a legacy that affects vitally the prospects of
democracy. Under their rule the people came to regard government as completely
alien and as something with which they had no concern. The fear and suspicion
of government and the anxiety to avoid all contacts with it, the indifference
to common affairs, the selfish concern with their own particular interests
which most of our countrymen exhibit in their daily conduct are, in large
measure, a legacy of a millennium of autocratic misrule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are two other results of significance of this period. Muslim rulers of India,
with the single exception of Akbar, followed policies that tended to divide
their Hindu and Muslim subjects and drove a wedge between them. They kept alive
and indeed did their best to foster the exclusiveness of Islamic culture. The
followers of Islam, as a result, remain after a thousand years of residence in
India a distinct and different group clearly marked out from their Hindu
neighbours. Their religion, language, social customs, manners and dress, are
all different from those of the Hindus. Their loyalties remain extra-Indian and
their sympathies and fellow feeling with their Hindu countrymen are ill
developed. This separatism runs counter to the Hindu tradition of the oneness
of India. The creation of Pakistan has not wholly solved the problem of Muslim
exclusiveness. A difficult problem of minorities is still with us awaiting a
just solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second result is that our politics have become suffused with religion. Religion
is the first and last interest of the Muslim. The appeal to religious sentiment
is what moves the Muslim to instant and irrational action in politics. The
Hindu masses are only a little less moved by religious feelings. This is a
result of the long period during which they remained in political subjection,
when religion perforce became the rallying point of their patriotism and their
sole hope of survival as a community. As a result of their age-long conflict
the followers of the two religions find it hard to extend the hand of tolerance
to each other. Fanatics and zealots of both religions have always been busy
sowing the seeds of distrust and fostering hostility between them. The task of
creating a truly secular outlook and territorial patriotism is, with this
background, one of immense difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Such
is our legacy from the past. From the point of view of building up a secular
and democratic political order, it presents great difficulties and offers
little help. There is in the legacy much that we have to unlearn or destroy and
little that we need cherish, if our new venture in democracy is to succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

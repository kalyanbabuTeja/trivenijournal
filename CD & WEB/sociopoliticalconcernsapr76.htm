emergence of the pre-independence Indo-English novel out of its early
romantic-idealistic arcadia into the expansive landscape of realism runs
parallel to the gradual development of a national ideology from its early phase
of reformist exuberance to the growth of a revolutionary consciousness among
the common masses of India, that they had to struggle relentlessly for their
emancipation from the steel frame of their politico-economic exploitation by a
foreign imperialism as also from the colossal weight of old tradition,
hide-bound <span class=SpellE>casteism</span> and the die-hard dogma of
religious conformism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

struggle for independence in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was not merely a political struggle, but an all-pervasive emotional experience
for all sensitive and enlightened Indians in the twenties, thirties and forties
of this <span class=GramE>century</span>. It is a coincidence that the Indo-English
fiction achieved a flowering maturity in the ’30s–a period during which the
star of Gandhiji was on its apex on the Indian horizon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Gandhiji’s moral-cum-spiritual leadership, the freedom movement percolated, for
the first time, to the very grass-roots of Indian society. Parallel to the
struggle for political freedom started another struggle for freedom on the
social plane. That was a fight against superstition, the caste system and
untouchability, poverty, illiteracy, the erosion of religious belief–that were
sapping the very vitality of our society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writer, writing in those decades or writing about that period, could avoid
reflecting this upsurge in his work. Fiction, of all literary forms, is
intimately concerned with social conditions and values, and at this time,
Indian society, “galvanized into a new social and political awareness, was
bound to seek creative expression for its new consciousness and the novel has,
in all ages, been a handy instrument for this <span class=SpellE>purpose.<sup>l</sup></span>
The socio-political movement, which had caught the imagination of the entire
nation, inspired the Indo-English writers as well, who had an added advantage
of Western liberal education. Among the significant works of fiction inspired
by this struggle are the novels like, <span class=SpellE><i>Kandan</i></span><i>
the Patriot </i>by K. S. Venkataramani, <span class=SpellE><i>Inqilab</i></span><i>
</i>by K. A. <span class=SpellE>Abbas</span>, <i>Waiting for the Mahatma </i>by
R. K. <span class=SpellE>Narayan</span>, <span class=SpellE><i>Kanthapura</i></span><i>
</i>by Raja Rao, <i>Untouchable </i>by M. R. Anand, <i>Into the Sun </i>by
Frieda H. <span class=SpellE>Das</span>, <i>Motherland </i>by C. N. <span

as it may sound, the dynamics of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> thought
helped open the way for the influx of Marxism in the literary field <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>in<i> </i></span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. But at deeper level there is
no paradox as the basic attraction of both the <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span>
and Marxian appeals was their idealism despite the wide difference in their
ideological framework and the terminology employed. Gandhiji’s lifelong crusade
against colonial exploitation of the weaker nations by the stronger, his no
less vehement condemnation of any form of economic exploitation, his insistence
that what is not shared with the dispossessed <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

talk of God to a people whose bellies were crying for bread–these rather than
his exaltation of prayer and fast, of spinning and celibacy, of non-violence in
thought, word and deed, had impressed the Indian intelligentsia. Between this
aspect of <span class=SpellE>Gandhian</span> crusade and the almost parallel
faith of Marxism the only difference was that Marxian dogma appeared to be more
consistent in its ideology and more realistic in its interpretation of history.
This explains the phenomenon of the thirties when many Indian writers and
intellectuals who were first inspired by Gandhi later veered towards socialist
or Marxist ideologies. Prem <span class=SpellE>Chand</span> who began as an
ardent admirer of Gandhi, later on came to believe more and more in the
desperate remedies advocated by Marxism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

attacking social snobbery and prejudice; urging for a larger outlook more
tolerance, more intimate and benevolent understanding and more self-sacrifice.
The Indian life that he depicts in his novels is that of outcastes, peasants, <span

farmers and the bottom-dog of his country from the obscure lanes and alleys of
the hamlets, villages and small towns. Like Prem <span class=SpellE>Chand</span>

class=SpellE>Bakha</span>, an eighteen year old boy, like his father <span
class=SpellE>Lakha</span>, a sweeper, a cleaner of latrines, is regarded as an
outcaste by the society. Anand, as has been suggested by Prof. H. M. Williams, “exemplifies
the problem of ‘untouchability’, the treatment of the latrine-cleaning class
condemned to isolation and deprivation as handlers of excrement; he exposes
this as a social evil and suggests its remedy”.<sup>2</sup> The method is to
narrate the single day’s events in <span class=SpellE>Bakha’s</span> life.
Sturdy, genial, easy-going, athletic <span class=SpellE>Bakha</span> lives and
works in the army camp pathetically aspiring to be as much like the <i>sahibs </i>as
possible and playing hockey with their children. But early on the fateful day,
he touches a Brahmin by accident and is reviled as a disgusting creature <span
class=GramE>who</span> has made the Brahmin unclean. He then sustains the
terrible shocks of indictment quite a number of times: he is abused and slapped
for polluting a merchant, he is chased out of a temple by a priest who has been
trying to molest his sister; he receives a shower of abuses for polluting an
injured child in his attempt to help the wounded child. An anguished cry comes
of his mouth<span class=GramE>:.</span> “I only get abuse and derision wherever
I go. Pollution, pollution, I do nothing else but pollute people...” For a
moment he stands aghast possessed by his rebellious self. His whole countenance
lights with fire, the strength, the power of his <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>giant body glistens with the desire for revenge in his eyes, while
horror, rage, <span class=GramE>indignation</span> sweep over his frame. But
this momentary rage and <span class=GramE>revolt,</span> soon evaporate when he
finds that he is still too </span>much bound to his low-caste-status. His anger
and fury can only make him painfully realize that his rebellion would lead him
nowhere as there is a futility written large on his fate. So in the highest
moment of his strength, the slave in him asserts itself, and he lapses back, “wild
with torture, biting his lips, ruminating his grievances.” He walks out
frustrated and highly disappointed. Colonel Hutchinson, the Salvationist, with
his shield of casteless society and salvation for all; Gandhiji with his strong
dislike for untouchability as the greatest blot on Hinduism and his views that
untouchables are in fact the <span class=SpellE>Harijans</span>–“men of God”,
and then <span class=SpellE>Iqbal</span> <span class=SpellE>Nath</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sarshar</span> with his new machine (the flush) that “will clean
dung without anyone having to handle it”–all these three encounters raise hopes
in him for a while. But he returns home, to his wretched bed, smothered by the
misery, the anguish of the morning’s memories, thinking intently of the
Mahatma, the Christ and the Machine in turn, but preferring none of the three, which
perhaps reflects the fundamental crisis in the mind of the writer himself and
is responsible for the gloomy end of the novel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

innumerable low-caste people. “The problem of caste and poverty, squalor and
backwardness, ignorance and superstition, admits of no easy solution”.<sup>4</sup>
Almost forty years after <span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> novel was written
(1933), and twenty-seven years after the attainment of independence, the
problem still defies a firm and final solution. Despite the fact that the
Indian Constitution has made it a crime to <span class=SpellE>practise</span>
Untouchability, we still witness <span class=SpellE>Anand’s</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sohinis</span> and <span class=SpellE>Golabos</span>, waiting at
the village-well for a long time–some standing up, bending and joining their
palms in beggary, others twisting their lips in various attitudes of servile
appeal and abject humility as they remain seated. We still have the residential
areas of the high-caste Hindus through which untouchables are forbidden to take
their marriage processions, hotels where the “low-caste people” are not allowed
the touch and use of utensils meant for other common customers. We still
witness the shameful and ghastly scenes of the untouchables being shot dead by
villagers for daring to grow their moustaches upwards (local tradition demands
that they grow their moustaches downwards because of their low status in the
caste hierarchy).<sup> 5</sup> Solution is there, but it needs a planned and
concerted action on behalf of the Government, the social workers and the under-privileged.
First they are to be educated properly, their standard of living is to be
raised, their miserable economic conditions are to be improved and then they
are to come out in a defiant mood to break loose the chains of age-old
traditions by breaking the ban on the use of public wells, schools, roads and
public temples. Only then some semblance of hope can be visible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

emaciated man, the bones of whose skeleton were locked up in a paralytic knot,”
“a grey-haired black blind man leaning half on the arm of his daughter, half on

through his creative writing, as he expresses in his <i>Apology for Heroism </i>(p.
139), has been able to live through the experience <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>of </span>other people and <span class=SpellE>realise</span> what silent
passions burst, in their minds, what immediate and ultimate sorrows possess
them where they want <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>to </span>go and
how they grapple in their own ways, with their destinies. He has tried in this
sense to express his passionate love <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>for
</span>the suffering people without caring for the misunderstanding and the
ridicule <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>of </span>those who are
better situated in social life and <span class=GramE>call</span> his
pre-occupation with the outcastes, the disinherited peasants, and the eternally
wronged <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>women </span>as a morbid,
sentimentalist pre-occupation with these “ignorant people.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

his pleadings for an unquenchable and unshakable faith in the elemental
goodness of man and power of love, a faith which has had all falsity and
sentimentality purged of by the fires of intense suffering, what Anand wanted
to achieve has been achieved. And that in itself is a unique contribution to
the Indian novel in English. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

song that had just finished while her fingers still thrummed the wires, or was
she unconscious of the tear-drops that had rolled down, her cheeks and fallen
on the strings only to get scattered? The wetness caused to the wires of the

became solemn and silent at once in her attempt to show her regard to
Hamsapadika. “No, Lady, I was not quite myself in my eagerness to communicate
to you an interesting piece of news. I own I exceeded my bounds. Long
familiarity has been responsible for my extra haste in trying to bring you
early information of things happening in the palace. I blurt out what I ought
not to, being anxious to let you have from me in person every fresh item of
gossip, hardly noticing the time and occasion for it. Pray, forgive me; I shall
choose another time,” she said and turned away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to regain balance. But she became curious </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>also to know what
exactly could be the special type of tidings she had brought her. With sharp
words, she prevented Rupavati from proceeding to leave her presence: “Well, do
you imagine I have the same avidity for gossip as yourself? Let me assure you
that I remain uninterested in the world outside, keeping company as I do with
my veena and my music lessons. What do I care about things happening to others?
How do you expect me then to imagine the cause of your haste and extend you a
hearty welcome? I could anticipate this and worse for myself in the palace. You
are all in the service of Queen Vasumati and it is natural, therefore, for you
to be lacking in sympathy for me.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was not prepared for this. She had indulged her usual mischievous pranks only
to draw Hamsapadika forcibly to herself. Otherwise, hardly was she inclined to
cause the least pain to Hamsapadika, and hence she rose and caught both the
hands of Hamsapadika and interlocking them in hers, burst out: “Ah! How have
you spoken, dear Lady! Am I the creature that you have described? God be
witness to my unsullied conscience! Because I was sure the important event of
the day in the palace might not have reached your ears, I came running to you.
Are there any others here, apart from me, having a right to share your joys and
sorrows?” she gasped for words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

intolerably impatient have I become! Don’t you know how much I suffer here?
Alas, I am at a loss to understand the King’s latest attitudes. Why should fate
have plunged me in this darkness? What have I in particular against you? No,
nothing at all. Pray, give me quick the news which you wanted me to learn.
Pity, we quarrel frequently without reason.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rupavati
took a seat near Hamsapadika and began her tale: “This morning, before the King
came out to occupy his seat in the Council Chamber, two young Rishis from the
forest, accompanied by an old dame as well as a beautiful maiden, arrived at
the gates. Knowing of their presence, the King ordered the Pratihari to usher
them in without any delay. The persons who came belong to the <i>ashrama </i>of
Kasyapa. The lovely damsel is Kanva’s foster-daughter named Sakuntala. The news
that she was taken here to be left with the King threw him into a great
astonishment. He closed his ears when it was mentioned to him that he had
secretly wed the maiden in the forest. At this behaviour of the King, the two
foresters emitted fire from their eyes. They charged the King with having
behaved in a manner unworthy of a ruler of his eminence.” Rupavati stopped
here. She had noticed a strange new light in Hamsapadika’s eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Why
have you stopped? Please go on,” said Hamsapadika unable to bear her anguish.
Rupavati was fully aware of Hamsapadika’s sensitiveness. So she began again
slowly: “The dame </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>who had accompanied the party wanted the younger
one to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>remove the veil from her face so that the King
could have a gaze at her and feel tempted, evidently. But that proved a
failure. For the King evinced neither curiosity nor pleasure in looking at her
loveliness. His eyes instinctively avoided watching the face of another’s wife.
Nevertheless, she was not without resource; for Soon she made attempts as if to
reveal some token of memory and further pretended even to be distressed at not
finding a ring supposed to have been worn by her as a gift of the King to her
in the forest.” Another pause intervened in the narration. But Hamsapadika in
the meanwhile sighed and cried, “Oh, why do you stop? Go on, please.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“What
is there further to add? She made all attempts to relate some imaginary
episodes connected with the King. But is the King so very gullible as all that?
So he refuted them outright,” said she.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mind was travelling far far away from the present and listlessly she asked
again, “Rupa, what story did she weave out of her imagination? May I have it?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“So,
you require it. Let me then regale you with it. Once, it seems, the King had
met her when he, hunted in the forest. He became infatuated with her and came
often to where she was. On a particular day a deer-pet of hers walked into an
arbour of creepers while they were together and closely stuck to her side.
However much the King tried to wean it away from her side, it refused to budge
an inch. Then the King made a cup of forest leaves and extended to it water
contained therein. Still the deer made no move towards him. Thereupon Sakuntala
took the leafy cup in her band and showed it to the deer encircling it with one
of her arms, when eagerly it drank of its contents. The King is reported by her
to have exclaimed: ‘well, this is quite in keeping with you: for both of you
together have been born and bred up in the same forest. There is hardly
occasion to feel surprised at it. The deer and the deer-eyed one cannot but
associate with each other so intimately.’ New tell me how you like her fancies?
A</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:

romances?” and Rupavati laughed in derision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Hamsapadika did not join in the laughter. Her memory was caught in a whirl. For
she remembered a similar occasion in her own life. But why should it torment
her now? Yes, there was reason for it. She shook the shoulders of Rupavati with
her hand and said: “The tale narrated by the unfortunate girl may be true. I
can believe it. No wonder a love-stricken person always talks like this and
even more strangely. I can myself bear witness to such things having occurred,
and you will then believe them.” Her voice was spoken with feeling. She began
to reflect as to what she should convey to her friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have forgotten to cover the veena with its cloak. I shall do it and return
presently,” she said, and stuffed the veena in its cover. She placed it safe in
its corner and came back, bringing with her a many-coloured parrot from a
golden cage. The parrot got on her back and perched on one of her arms.
“Durree, durree”; the bird’s language evoked her smile. She patted it and said:
“Well, wait, my dear. Your tale of woe is also mine. Your sad history and mine
together will last till eternity.” The bird in answer fluttered its wings and
spread them fanlike awhile. “Sister, sister,” the bird began in its usual way
of addressing her. Rupavati went to it and tried to fondle and stroke its
feathery back, but it pecked fiercely at her fingers which she withdrew as
quickly as she extended them. Hamsapadika gently moved her soft fingers on its
wings and gazed at their blueness blending with the ruby on its breast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rupa, to what my memories conjure up for me. It was just as it is today. Dark
deep clouds massed in the east and spread fast over the entire sky, only to
pour down in torrential rain. A veritable deluge seemed coming on us. But our
strong fortress remained four-square to all the storm and rain. For the
fortress was hewn out of granite and natural boulders of a mountain side. Yes,
I failed to mention one significant matter; my father was then away on a
friendly visit to a neighbouring chieftain. He did not return in time. I was
then a maiden of eighteen years and was left in the care of an elderly matron
named Sujata. The fortress was ever guarded with utter strictness and a General,
Ranadhir by name, kept vigils over it day and night with his men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
happened one day–just when the rains were heavy–two persons, storm-beaten and
totally bereft of the means of further progress on their journey, were stranded
at the gates of the fortress. They craved shelter inside. But from their attire
and behaviour, the General suspected that they belonged to the enemy’s staff
set to spy, and he refused them admission into the interior of the fort,
despite the driving rain and bad weather outside. My nurse hurried to me with
the news that one of the men had fainted with fatigue. Why was I overcome by a
feeling of tenderness? Had I not then entertained sympathy and genuine kindness
in my heart, I might have escaped the tortures of today. I left the nurse in my
place and in her disguise reached the outer gates without the General knowing
of it. It was indeed a fact that one of the two strangers–a Brahmin from what
his face revealed–was lying<i> </i>on the ground unconscious. The other was
actually supporting his body on his broad chest, and finding me standing there,
looked with such overpowering dignity that I could not stand the gaze and
dropped my eye-lids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I became powerless. Without much ado, the youth
asked me: “Have you caged in your castle wild beasts? Or have you also here
human beings?” My face having indicated a big question-mark he started again,
saying “I am only wondering why you deny shelter to a man completely frigid of
limbs in the biting cold and rain. Certainly you need no assurance for your safety
from enemies, possessing, as you do a fortress of solid granite and a heart as
hard as the very rock itself. Maybe hereafter your danger will only be from God
and not from any human enemy.”</p>

heart sank within me. “Please do come in; but may I know who you both are?”
said I. “Certainly I’ll tell you; but before everything else, let my friend who
is in a bad condition receive instantaneous attention and a bed to lie on. A
fire also must be made for him to get warm,” said the handsome young man. His voice
bore the traces of natural power and authority. I made signs to my servants
around to make ready a bed in my own inner apartment and cautioned them not to
let out the information to anyone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The outstanding event in international affairs in
the four months under survey is undoubtedly the effort made by India at the
session of the General Assembly of the United Nations to bring about peace in
Korea. By the time the Assembly met the cease-fire negotiations between the
parties reached a deadlock on the question of the repatriation of prisoners of
war, although on all other issues agreement was arrived at. It was a source of
disappointment to almost all nations that disagreement on this one issue should
have become a formidable obstacle in the way of peace. India’s efforts
therefore at removing the deadlock were welcome. The resolution which was
originally introduced by the Indian delegation underwent certain modifications
in the course of the debate in the Political Committee, and in its final form
it provided for an immediate cease-fire. In regard to prisoners of war it laid
down that their release and repatriation should be carried out in accordance
with the Geneva Convention of 1949, and that force should not be used to
prevent or bring about their return to their homelands. It also provided for a
Commission consisting of Poland, Switzerland, Sweden and Czechoslovakia to take
charge of all the prisoners, and it left to the subsequent decision of the
United Nations the final destination of those who did not wish to return to
their homelands. It was a most sane and humane proposal that India made. After
a lengthy debate it was passed in the Political Committee by fifty-three votes
to five (the Soviet bloc), with only nationalist China abstaining; and it was
subsequently approved by the General Assembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it produced no practical effect whatever, as it was not accepted by Soviet Russia
and by the Communist Governments of China and of North Korea. A resolution
which was endorsed by fifty-three out of the sixty nations on the United
Nations, and whose purpose was to bring peace to a troubled world, failed in
securing its objectives because of the opposition primarily of Soviet Russia
and secondarily of China. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The opposition came primarily from Soviet Russia and
the opposition from China was only an afterthought. And it is this point that
has to be kept in mind. For, it was subsequently made clear by the Government
of India and by her delegate, Mr. Krishna Menon, that the Government of China
was consulted before the resolution was moved in the United Nations and that
there was nothing to indicate that China was opposed to it. It was this
indication that encouraged India to proceed with her peace-effort. It was not
as if China was ignorant of the resolution. But when in the course of the
debate at the United Nations the Russian delegate asked for Chinese views, the
Indian representative had to sit back unable to give them out openly, as they
“were private views expressed to the Indian Government by China.” It came
therefore as really a shock to the Indian representative when the Russian
delegate expressed that the resolution was not acceptable to China. There was a
feeling that India was let down by that country. But it could not be helped.
Every one then knew that it was the pressure from the Soviet that influenced
the Chinese attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The complicated situation in the Far East arises out
of the fact that China is not prepared to pursue like India an independent line
of foreign policy. She has become a member of the Soviet bloc and she thinks
that on ideological grounds she should continue to be a member of that bloc.
There is need for India and for the world outside to understand this aspect of
China’s policy. China cannot be influenced directly. It is only through the
Soviet Government that she can be influenced. This is the one inescapable
conclusion that one has to arrive at from the changing attitude which she
adopted towards the Indian resolution. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It will be a serious folly to ignore the bond that
keeps China and Soviet Russia in the same camp. In a famous address which
Mao-Tse-Tung delivered “On the People’s Democratic Dictatorship” in
commemoration of the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party
on July 1, 1949, he stated clearly and emphatically as follows: “The forty
years’ experience of Sun-Yat-Sen and the twenty-eight years’ experience of the
Chinese Communist Party have taught us to believe that, in order to win and
consolidate the victory, we must lean to one side. The experience of forty
years and twenty-eight years respectively, show that, without exception, the
Chinese people either lean to the side of imperialism or to the side of
socialism. <i>To sit on the fence is impossible; a third road does not exist. </i>We
oppose the Chiang-Kai-Shek reactionary clique who lean to the side of
imperialism; we also oppose the illusion of a third road. Not only in China but
also in the world, without exception, one either leans to the side of
imperialism or to the side of socialism. Neutrality is mere camouflage and a
third road does not exist.” He proceeded further and observed: “In the era when
imperialism exists, it is impossible for the true people’s revolution of any
country to win in its own country without assistance in various forms from the
international revolutionary forces, and it is also impossible to consolidate
the victory even when it is won. The great October Revolution was thus won and
consolidated, as<i> </i>Stalin has told us long ago. It was also in this way
that the three imperialist countries (Germany, Italy and Japan) were defeated
and the new democratic countries established. This is and will be the case with
the People’s China at present and in the future...Internationally we belong to
the anti-imperialist front headed by the U.S.S.R, and we can look for genuine
friendly aid only from that front, and not from the imperialist front.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
subsequent, pronouncements of Mao-Tse-Tung and the alliances concluded by his
government were exactly on these lines. It may be that from the long-term
standpoint China would gain more by coming nearer the United States than Soviet
Russia, She has to get her capital equipment for her industrial and
agricultural revolution from abroad, and Soviet Russia is not in a position to
supply her with this. It is also possible that Russia may not be willing to
hasten the pace at which China can set up new industries that will make her
independent of key supplies from her. But there is no prospect whatever of
China adopting today any such long-term view of her development; and it is
wishful thinking to suppose that Mao-Tse-Tung will become another Tito in the
near future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it is not necessary for the purpose of this survey to analyse the forces and
factors that influenced China to reject the Indian resolution on peace in
Korea. What is needed more is to recognise that she is not prepared to separate
her foreign policy from that of Soviet Russia, and that so long as Russia is
interested in prolonging the war in the Far East the present Government of
China will not be in a mood to listen to words of peace, even though they might
come from a country like India which is outside the ‘imperialist’ bloc. It is
now an established fact that Russia is<i> </i>determined to see that the United
States is pre-occupied with the complexities in the Far East and be prevented
from concentrating all her strength and resources in organising the West
European Defence. There is therefore nothing to show that peace in Korea is
nearer today than what it was four months ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
conclusion is strengthened by the results of the Presidential election in the
United States and the coming of General Eisenhower to office in place of
Truman. It is not that the new President is more war-mongering than his
predecessor. As a matter of fact the policy pursued by Truman was a bi-partisan
policy, approved broadly and on the whole by the Republican and the Democratic
parties. It is only in matters of detail and in the tactics to be adopted that
possibilities of differences existed. But these tactical issues have now, with
the accession of the new President, assumed great importance and they are
showing themselves in a number of directions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
President Eisenhower and Dulles, his Secretary of State, take the view that the
situation in Asia is of as much significance as that in Europe and that the
anti-Communistic forces in Asia should be strengthened to at least the same
extent as those in Europe. Perhaps it will not be far from truth if one were to
say that they attach a slightly more importance to Asia than to Europe in the
current phase of the cold war. In the first statement on foreign policy that
Mr. Dulles made, he pointed out that Japan was the central target of Russian
moves in the Far East and that “if the Russians or Chinese Communists got
control of Japan with its great industrial power, then they could use that to
process raw materials which come from Asia, from Manchuria and from China, and
to process them into arms and weapons for the manpower of China, and that if it
happened, it would be a very serious thing for us.” He further stated: “Now the
Soviet Russians are making a drive to get Japan not only through what they are doing
in the northern areas and in Korea but also through what they are doing in
Indo-China. If they could get this peninsula of Indo-China, Siam, Burma, and
Malaya they would have what is called the ‘rice bowl’ of Asia...And you see
that if the Soviet Union had control of the ‘rice bowl’ of Asia, that would be
another weapon which would tend to expand their control into Japan and into
India.” His references to the Middle East were more or less in the same strain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is clear from all this that there is a likelihood of the intensification of the
war in Korea which has already cost more than two million lives and
unprecedented destruction of cities, towns, villages and all sorts of property.
This is the inevitable outcome of Soviet rejection of India’s peace-plan and of
the Chinese Communist Government letting down India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
only is there a likelihood of the intensification of warfare in Korea but also
of the further extension of war into areas outside Korea and the employment of
more Asians in carrying on the war. Both these are implicit in the policy of
Eisenhower. There is a widespread feeling in the United States that American
lives are being disproportionately sacrificed in the Korean campaign. This has
been given expression to by the new President and he has indicated more than
once that it would be his policy to leave as much of warfare as possible in the
hands of the Asians themselves. There will therefore be more South Korean
forces fighting against North Korea and China; and above all Chiang-Kai-Shek will
be given a free hand in making raids into the Chinese mainland and undertaking
a campaign of reconquest of power. War in the far East will come to assume more
and more the character of a civil war than of a war between Asians on one side
and Americans on the other. This does not mean that American forces will be
entirely withdrawn but that they will be getting increasing support from their
Asian allies,–Americans concentrating more and more on naval and air arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Implicit
in this new policy of Eisenhower and Dulles is the increasing application of
the doctrine of disruption of Communism instead of the doctrine of containment.
Both these schools of thought have been for some time in existence in the
United States, but it was the school of ‘containment’, with its emphasis on
restricting Communism to the regions already subjugated by it and preventing
its further expansion that had the upper hand. It now looks as if this policy
of disrupting Communism and of reconquering areas in Asia and Europe which have
become subject to Communist rule will be pursued. The first indication of the
new policy is the move towards giving a free hand to Chiang-Kai-Shek’s forces
to invade the mainland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is to be remembered in this connection that, two
days after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, President Truman ordered the
seventh fleet to protect Formosa and also to prevent Chiang’s troops from
raiding the mainland. This was done with a view to localise the Korean War. The
seventh fleet, it is now reported, will not act as a check on Chiang and he
will consequently be free to invade the mainland if he has the necessary
resources for the purpose. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is not possible or desirable at this stage to
describe what all the consequences of such a move will be. It is being undertaken
to weaken Chinese resistance in Korea. But whether it will result in Russia
giving more<i> </i>direct help to China and make of the war in the East a
Soviet-American war, is a possibility which cannot be ignored. Some of the
leading statesmen in the world–including Mr. Churchill–have recently been
saying that the danger of a third global war has receded and that Soviet Russia
is not yet ready for it. This may be true. But if the policy of disrupting
Communism replaces the policy of containment in the Far East, the situation may
not be far from that of an impending global war.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indo-China
has found a prominent place in the policy statement of Secretary Dulles. This
is the logical sequel to a resolution passed at the last meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, to the effect that the war which the French have
been waging in Indo-China against Ho Chi Minh’s rule in Vietnam should be
regarded as a part of the war of NATO against Communism in general, and that
the members of the NATO should be prepared to share with France the
responsibility for fighting it. If subsequent to the passing of this resolution
America has been giving increasing military aid to France, and if this aid is
being still further strengthened at present, it is because the Americans feel
that there is a possibility of the Communist Government of China coming to a
larger extent to the help of Ho Chi Minh. It is true that in the alliance
concluded between Ho Chi Minh and China such help is to be granted only under
certain contingencies. But if with increasing American aid, and with the
increasing co-operation of Bao Dai’s Government, the French achieve real
victory the Chinese may find it necessary to extend their help to their ally,
and the whole of the Far East from Korea to Malaya may become one continuous
theatre of warfare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

situation in the Middle East has not shown any signs of improvement in the four
months under survey. Iran broke off her diplomatic relations with Britain. But
this has not helped in any way to improve the internal conditions of the
country. Premier Mossadeq has been given more dictatorial powers. He is free
now to resort to any drastic measures which he may consider necessary. But here
again the power has not been of much use in working the oil wells, refining the
crude oil and marketing the finished product. Alternative sources for the
supply of oil<i> </i>have been exploited in Saudi Arabia and in Kuwait. The
world is able to get tolerably well without oil from Iran. And it will be a
problem for Iran to get back her old market. In spite of this the Government of
Iran has not seen the wisdom of settling the issue with Britain. The deadlock
here is as bad as it is in the truce negotiations in Korea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Egypt, which is the other centre of disturbance in the Middle East, there
has been no settlement of the outstanding differences with Britain. Internally
a dictatorial form of government has been established. General Naguib, who has
dissolved all other political. parties, has placed himself at the head of the
‘Liberation Front’, the only surviving party. To rid the Nile Valley of all
occupation forces and to promote the unification of Egypt is the main objective
of the party. In announcing this assumption<i> </i>of power he accused all
other political parties of having exploited power for their own private ends
and those of their relatives, that nepotism and corruption characterised their
administration, that King Farouk entered into a league with them in robbing the
people of their wealth and their liberty, and that the new liberation Front
would work for the poor and the weak. He has already demanded the unconditional
evacuation of the Canal Zone by the British who, it is said, have invested so
far £700,000,000 in fortifying it. At the same time, he has come to certain understandings
with the political parties in the Sudan on the basis of complete
self-government for that country.<sup>1</sup> The British however have not yet
reconciled themselves to withdrawal from the Canal Zone and to surrender their
privileged position in Sudan. It is their argument that the defence of the
canal is not merely a domestic Egyptian question or even a question between
Egypt and Britain, but one in which all the nations who have interests in the
security and stability of the Middle East are concerned. It has been their
argument that they are prepared to evacuate the Canal Zone, provided a Middle
East Defence Organisation is created with Egypt and other Middle East States
along with Britain and the United States as members. They do not want to leave
a vacuum, as it were, behind them. General Naguib does not deny the need for a
Middle East Defence Organisation but he is not in a mood to make it a condition
precedent to British withdrawal. The Britsh ought to realise that a graceful
withdrawal is much better than a forced one. In the mood in which General
Naguib and his Front are today, it will not be a difficult task for them to
cripple completely the military value of the troops in the Canal Zone for the
maintenance of which Egyptian labour and Egyptian goodwill are absolutely
essential.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is in this environment that one has to take note of the report that Britain has
invited Pakistan to become a member of the Middle East Defence Organisation.
This invitation is fraught with serious consequences. If it is accepted it
will, as Pandit Nehru put it, bring the cold war to the very frontiers of India
and create numerous other complications. It is therefore a move which requires
careful watching. It is not the part of statesmanship to widen the area of

contest for power has always been one of the sources of the world’s troubles.
The feeling among the people of the United States, that Soviet Russia is
determined to adopt all sorts of aggressive policies and tactics to extend her
power into almost every part of the globe, has been responsible for the huge
American expenditure on armaments, on the defence of Western Europe and on aid
to Greece, Turkey and several other States. During recent months the attention
of the world has been drawn to a number of political trials in Czechoslovakia
and to a number of charges against doctors in Soviet Russia. The majority of
those that were involved in these accusations and who were sentenced to death
happened to be Jews. World public opinion is therefore asking itself whether
there is a new wave of anti-Semitism in Soviet areas. Anti-Semitism was a
characteristic of the rule of the Czars in Russia and of almost every
government in Central and Eastern Europe in the past. It reached its worst and
most brutal form under Hitler. It was with<i> </i>a view to escape from this
traditional brutality that the Zionist movement was started,–a movement which
culminated in the foundation of the State of Israel. The anti-Semitism which is
now breaking out in Soviet Russia and in the States controlled by her has been
explained in a variety of ways. There are those who say that it is being
resorted to with a view to attract the Muslims of the Middle East who are
bitter against the State of Israel. In the view of the Soviet, Israel is a sort
of bourgeoise State. In any case there is need for establishing Soviet
influence in that part of the Asian world. It is quite possible that by
persecuting the Jews–who are almost all of them Zionists-the favour of the
Muslims can be obtained. This may be a shrewd move. It is also interpreted as a
move for entering into some kind of alliance with the Nazi groups who are
active in Western Germany. These groups are anxious to regenerate Germany on
Hitlerian lines. Some of their leaders have been recently arrested by the
British occupation authorities. They hate the occupation regime. They also
dislike the democratic system as led by Dr. Adenauer, the Chancellor. There was
a time when Stalin and Hitler became allies and worked together against
Britain, France and other Western democracies. There would be nothing strange
if today Stalin wishes to get the help of the Neo-Nazis in the war against the
Anglo-American-French forces. Anti-Semitism, which has an appeal to the Nazis,
may attract Stalin to them. Other interpretations also of the new wave of
anti-Semitism have been given. The fact is that there is such a wave today </span><span

</i>Central and Soviet Europe. The Communist parties in Britain and other
democratic countries have been bewildered by the trial and condemnation of many
leading Communists in Czechoslavakia and other countries and the purges to
which they seem to be a prelude. The bewilderment among others is very much
greater.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
